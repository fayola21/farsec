Inconsisting Handling of id mismatch on wicket:container    Given this simple case:public class Home extends WebPage { public Home() { add(new EmptyPanel('test')); }}and the following HTML page:&lt;span wicket:id='test2'/&gt;Please notice that the ids do not match.Executing this app will give the following Exception:WicketMessage: Unable to find component with id 'test2' in [Page class =com.myapp.wicket.Home  id = 0  version = 0]. This means that you declaredwicket:id=test2 in your markup  but that you either did not add thecomponent to your page at all  or that the hierarchy does not match.Whereas when using a wicket:container instead of a HTML tag  like this:&lt;wicket:container wicket:id='test2'/&gt;And when the ids doesn't match  Wicket throws the following exception:WicketMessage: Failed to handle: &lt;wicket:container wicket:id='test2'/&gt;Which is quite cryptic at the first glance.Original: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/wicket-dev/200803.mbox/%3c15908468.post@talk.nabble.com%3eWe ran across same problem too.
