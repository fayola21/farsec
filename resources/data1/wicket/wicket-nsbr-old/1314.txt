DateTimeField does not correct the timezone properly    The DateTimeField has a DateTextField which uses a styledateconverter with timezone correction set to true which is not needed since the DateTimeField accounts for the TimeZone correction. Another problem is that the DateTimeField only sets the timezone of the date (from local-&gt;client)  causing the date to be corrected to the local time. This should instead cause the local time to reflect that of the clients time.
