i18n package resource resolving depends too much on available locale    Instead of just depending on the session's locale  our i18n resolving algorithm should look at the form of the file names as well. For instance  if we get a request for /web/resources/foo.Bar/test_en_US.css  it should recognize that test is the base form  and try en and en_US on top of that  regardless of the locale that is was set in the session.
