MultiFileUploadField.js can't find file input when serving pages as XHTML    When Wicket-based application serves web pages as XHTML (with the 'Content-type:application/xhtml+xml' header)  upload procedure using MultiFileUploadField.js won't work as it can't find file input even though it's properly added.This happens because @line 65 of MultiFileUploadField.js input tag name is expected to be 'input' (capitalized)  which in XHTML is actually 'input' (lowercase).
