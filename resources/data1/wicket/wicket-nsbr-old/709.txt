Unable to remove an IFormValidator from a Form    It seems that there is no way to remove an IFormValidator from a Form. Because the fields in my Form are inside Panels (only one of which is present at any given time)  the Form fields are not necessarily children of the Form. When one of the Form's IFormValidators receives a getDependentFormComponents call  it (correctly  I believe) returns the form components that it validates. An exception occurs when getParent is called on these components (in attempt to find the Form somewhere up the hierarchy) up the call stack. Since the change in the Panel that's present is made via an Ajax update  the same update would be able to remove the offending IFormValidator when its Panel is removed. (That is  if there was a method in Form to remove an IFormValidator.) For now  I've hacked it so that my IFormValidator checks whether all its Form Components all have parents before any of its methods return non-null values. (I'm not just changing the Panel visibility because then the hidden Panels would still get validated  and I don't want that to happen.)
