BookmarkablePageLink only sets the target attribute when it exists in the markup    BookmarkablePageLink adds an attribute modifier to itself when setPageMap is called. However  it creates the attribute modifier in such a fashion that it is only applied when the target attribute is already in the markup. The initial goal to implement it like that was to make the change unobtrusive. I'm backtracking on that now though  as I now think it is actually half baked. I'd like to change the behavior so that it /always/ sets the target when you call setPageMap on it. This would mean that you'll popup another window if you try to link to a different page map in the same screen  but you shouldn't do that anyway.See http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Extending-wicket.markup.html.tree.Tree-p9273422.html for a problem this would fix.
