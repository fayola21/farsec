Can not create cookies    Hi I'm migrating to wicket 1.5-M3 and I've encountered a problem. I can not create cookies (I presume that I can't delete them either).I've looked through the source code and this is what I found:I add the cookie to the response and I end up with a nice HeaderBufferingWebResponse which contains BufferedWebResponse$AddCookieAction.But then redirectTo(Url  RequestCycle) from WebPageRenderer class is called. Here is the method: private void redirectTo(Url url  RequestCycle requestCycle) { WebResponse response = (WebResponse)requestCycle.getResponse(); String relativeUrl = requestCycle.getUrlRenderer().renderUrl(url); response.reset(); response.sendRedirect(relativeUrl); }response.reset(); - removes all actions from the request.So after this method my request has got only BufferedWebResponse$SendRedirectAction.
