AjaxPagingNavigator Link factories should return AbstractLink    AjaxPagingNavigator doesn't submit forms. The mailinglists instruct the user to override the Link factory classes in order to return SubmitLinks. However  both SubmitLink and AjaxSubmitLink do not inherit from Link. It is my opinion that AjaxPagingNavigator.new*Link() functions should return AbstractLink.I am currently forced to fork the majority of AjaxPagingNavigator inorder to create a 'Sub'class.
