WicketRuntimeException when using wicket-auth-roles in a frameset    Hi All I seem to have a very strange exception when using wicket-auth-roles in a frameset.Let me try and sketch out the setup:1) Application home page is called FramesetPage.java &#8211; it extends org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage &#8211; corresponding HTML contains simple frameset with 2 rows2) Top row of frameset contains TopFramePage.java &#8211; it extends org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage &#8211; corresponding HTML contains only an image component as follows: &#8211; add(new Image('bannerImage'  'logo.png'));3) Bottom row of frameset contains BottomFramePage.java &#8211; it extends org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage &#8211; it requires authentication/authorization using wicket-auth-roles (as is  straight out of the jar) &#8211; if not already authenticated/authorized then redirected to MySignInPage.java &#8211; it extends org.apache.wicket.authentication.pages.SignInPage &#8211; corresponding HTML contains standard &lt;span wicket:id='signInPanel'/&gt; tagHere's the strange part: After completing the 'Username' and 'Password' fields of thesignInPanel then the exception displayed in the attached stack trace is thrown. Further  if I replace the imagecomponent in TopFramePage with some CSS that loads the same image then no exception is thrown.Any thoughts on what is causing this problem?Thanks Steve
