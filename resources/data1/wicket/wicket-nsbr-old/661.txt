fire onchange event of associated component after date selection    sometimes it's desirable to be notified after a date was selected.therefore the change event (onchange() method) of the associated component should be fired.to not break existing code  a second constructor should be added to specify whether the event should be fired  whereas the default behavior is to not fire the event.
