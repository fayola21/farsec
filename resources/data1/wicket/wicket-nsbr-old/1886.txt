WicketTester Cookie handling    While trying to test my SecureForm implementation (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-1885) with WicketTester I ran into this issue: A cookie set in the response never shows up in the 'next' request  because both have their own lists of cookies that aren't shared.Afaik both should share the same List instance to handle cookies. That way its possible to set a cookie in the response and read it from the request.A simple testcase is attached.
