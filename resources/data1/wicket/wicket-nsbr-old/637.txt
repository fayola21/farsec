wicket-examples grey-on-white colour scheme is very hard to read    The current wicket-examples colour scheme is light grey text on a white background. This is very low in contrast  and difficult to read.In the source code views  which unlike the rest  use a smaller serif font  this is especially noticeable.Even something as simple as switching to plain black on white would be an immediate benefit.
