Using an AjaxSubmitLink outside of a Form does not set the form property    When constructing an AjaxSubmitLink outside of a form using the constructor:public AjaxSubmitLink(String id  final Form form)The form argument is not set in the link. This prevents the form from seeing the link as its submitting component  which in turn means that using thing like enableDefaultFormProcessing() on the link don't work.Changing the constructor of AjaxSubmitLink to:public AjaxSubmitLink(String id  final Form form){ super(id  form) /* was: super(id) */ ...}will probably fix the problem.A temporary workaround is to implement a getForm() method in the subclass of the submit link which answers the form of the link
