Submitting a form with Ajax in WicketTester does not check if form is multiPart    While executing wicketTester.executeAjaxEvent(butooon  'onclick') i get ServletRequest does not contain multipart content. One possible solution is to explicitly call Form.setMultipart(true)  Wicket tries its best to auto-detect multipart forms but there are certain situation where it cannot.executeAjaxEvent method does not check if form is multiPart. To workaround this problem before executeAjaxEvent we can execute: MockHttpServletRequest servletRequest = wicketTester.getServletRequest(); servletRequest.setUseMultiPartContentType(true);But its annoying to set this flag again and again. Could you extend executeAjaxEvent to check if form is multiPart ? Similar checking is already done in FormTester.onSubmit().
