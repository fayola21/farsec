Dropped support for Servlet 2.5 inadvertently    Fixing 3146 in r1031086 resulted in introducing a dependency on javax.servlet.annotation.* thus rendering WicketFilter unusable in pre-3.0 servlet containers.If pruning the large base of 2.5-compatible containers was intentional then I'd also suggest switching to java 6 (Although servlet 3.0 specs does not explicitly indicate java 6 as a requirement  all 3.0 compliant containers that I'm aware of - namely Jetty 8  Websphere 8  tomcat 7  glassfish 3 - require java 6). Not to mention that this should be spoken out loud (https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/migration-to-wicket-15.html does not mention anything about container compliance)
