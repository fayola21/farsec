AutoComplete ShowListOnFocusGain not working    I noticed an issue with the Wicket-Extensions autocomplete behavior when the AutoCompleteSettings ShowListOnFocusGain flag is set to true. Basically  it works as expected in Firefox  but in (at least) Chrome  IE6 and IE7  it displays the list on focus gain  but you cannot use the mouse to select any of the items in the autocomplete list. The debug log showed that as soon as an item in the list was clicked on  the onblur event would fire for the field  which would then immediately fire a focus event  which would trigger reloading the list.This fix for this is trivial: adding one line to the top of obj.onfocus: if (mouseactive==1) return killEvent(event);.I'll post the patch.
