Make Component. 'protected List getBehaviors(Class' public    actually making getbehaviors(class) public will also break codebecause any override already in place will then attempt to reduce thevisibility of the method.add a jira issue  most likely for 1.5 considering 1.4 is already in RC2.-igorOn Thu  Feb 19  2009 at 1:24 PM  Martin Funk &lt;mafulafunk@googlemail.com&gt; wrote:Hi why is Components public final List&lt;IBehavior&gt; getBehaviors()publicand why is protected List&lt;IBehavior&gt; getBehaviors(Class&lt;? extends IBehavior&gt;type)protected?For example for a Behavior I'd like it to be able to tell if an Behavior ofits type is already bound to that component.In its bind() method I'd like to do something like: if (component.getBehaviors(SomeBehavior.class).size() &gt; 1) { throw new Error('Ther may only be one'); }But I have to do something like: for (IBehavior behavior : component.getBehaviors()) { if (behavior instanceof SomeBehavior) { throw new Error('There may only be one'); } }So my whish would be to have em both public. I wouldn't mind seeing em bothfinal  but that might break existing code.mf
