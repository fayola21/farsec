PackagedTextTemplate does not load resource from application resource stream locator    Here is my post to the dev list...file a jira issue-igorOn Wed  Jun 25  2008 at 11:23 AM  Ritz123 &lt;ritesh.trivedi@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; I did some investigation and seems like there is a bug.&gt;&gt; PackagedTextTemplate @line:92 is creating a new ResourceStreamLocator()&gt; instead of using the one from the application. This is causing resources to&gt; be not found if you have custom resource stream loader registered with the&gt; application.&gt;&gt; line 92: private static final IResourceStreamLocator streamLocator = new&gt; ResourceStreamLocator();&gt;&gt; Can Wicket dev confirm?&gt;&gt;&gt; Ritz123 wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am trying to use PackagedTextTemplate to load the template  but seems&gt;&gt; like its not looking for the resource in the application registered&gt;&gt; resource stream locator. I get resource not found exception.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HeaderContributor.forCss and forJavascript has worked fine and has found&gt;&gt; resource in the folders for application stream location without any&gt;&gt; issues.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#8211;&gt; View this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-PackagedTextTemplate-does-not-load-resource-from-application-resource-stream-locator----BUG---tp18116540p18116540.html&gt; Sent from the Wicket - Dev mailing list archive at Nabble.com.&gt;
