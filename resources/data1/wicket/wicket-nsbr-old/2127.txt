Javascript function Wicket.replaceAll is unbearably slow    I use AbstractAjaxTimerBehavior to update many different components on my pages periodically.After a while  the browser occupies 50% or more of the system resources.I used the javascript profiler in firebug and found that Wicket.replaceAll is responsible for 60+ percent of javascript processing time.The problem is that sequential string processing is used instead of much faster regular expressions
