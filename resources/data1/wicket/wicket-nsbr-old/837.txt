Use -DpackageName if it is specified    Hi Wicket's archetype (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/trunk/archetypes) uses 'groupId' as a placeholder for the package name. If someone specifies Maven's option -DpackageName then this option will be neglected and the produced project will not compile.The attached patch resolves this problem. It works either when -DpackageName is not specified (then -DgroupId is being used).P.S. I put this issue at wicket-quickstart component since there is no such for the archetype.Kind regardsMartin
