StringValidator error messages erroneously mention input instead of label    Using a StringValidator.MaximumLengthValidator (or any flavor of the StringValidator class)  the reported errors are currently under the form:StringValidator.minimum='${input}' is shorter than the minimum of ${minimum} characters.which creates odd messages where the content of the field is mentionned instead of the field label.Example: 'Joe' is shorter than the minimum of 5 characters.should be The field 'Name' should be at least 5 characters longThis is specially important in password fields  where the StringValidator is not usable because it displays the input in clear text on the web page: 'x4eR4*z' is shorter than the minimum of 5 characters.should be The field 'Password' should be at least 5 characters long
