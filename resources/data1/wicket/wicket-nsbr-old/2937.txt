AbstractPropertyModel getObjectClass don't consider nested IObjectClassAwareModel targets    Currently if AbstractPropertyModel has an target that implements the IObjectClassAwareModel interface  the known class of that target is not used to infer the modeled property type. Requested improvement: use 'target type'+'property expression' to return the property type of the AbstractPropertyModel
