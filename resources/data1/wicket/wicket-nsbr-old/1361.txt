Localizer doesn't honor style when caching property lookups    In Wicket 1.2.6  we created some properties files like:Foo.propertiesFoo_style1.propertiesFoo_style2.propertiesand used StringResourceModel to look up property values. This worked correctly as in 1.2.6  Localizer didn't cache the property lookups and respected the style. However  in 1.3  Localizer now caches the lookups but doesn't respect the style when creating the cache key (though it does append the locale to the end of the cache key).The side-effects of this are that whatever style is in use when a property is first looked up  that property value will be returned for all subsequent lookups regardless of style.
