Extend cases where the exception can be ignored due to an aborted request    We should either find more specific catches in Resource#respond or come up with some other way to ensure we can recognize a client abortion. For instance  Jetty 6 on unix-like platforms (tested here on OpenBSD/ OSX) throws EofExceptions which extend IOExceptions and thus are not marked as ignorable. The problem then is that a stack trace will be printed in ComponentResourceRequestTarget  and as many production systems will have some trigger installed that sends an error message/ SMS/ ... that can be quite annoying.Can't we instead of looking at the exception somehow look at the request/ response itself to figure out that a request was aborted? If that is possible  that seems like a much more robust way of solving this.
