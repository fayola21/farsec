Make substitutePropertyExpressions() in Localizer overridable    I want to extend Localizer.substitutePropertyExpressions(final Component component  final String string  final IModel model) to add a special behaviour when the model for substitution is instance of a Interface which has the Method getMessage(Locale locale).In this case I want to use a custom PropertyVariableInterpolator.So please make the method protected.
