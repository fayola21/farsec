Improve Locale fallback in BundleStringResourceLoader    While https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-1415 fixed the NPE in BundleStringResourceLoader Locale.getDefault() is a bad choice to get the locale from  as it is determined by the default locale of the jvmrunning the servlet container. I think it's a big coincidence if the jvm default locale is actually the one the user wantsto see in the webapp - Session#getLocale() would probably be a better default.Attached is a patch against current trunk (1.4)
