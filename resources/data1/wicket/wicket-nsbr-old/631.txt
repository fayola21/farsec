Resource.getParameters() empty when resource is mounted    After migrating my application from 1.2.6 to 1.3.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT mounted shared resources (rss feeds  uploaded images) stopped working.DynamicWebResource.getParameters().getXXX() returns with null if the resource is mounted via Application.mountSharedResource but it works fine when the resource is not mounted.
