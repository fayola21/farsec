false positive or wrong unit tests unit tests when ajax is involved    MockWebApplication#setupRequestAndResponse always sets up a non ajax requestcycle.this method is also used to setup the requestcycle for ajax related functionality (eg. BaseWicketTester#clickLink).the consequence are:a) the markup for expected ajax responses contains wicket tags and wicket attributes  although these are never rendered in ajax responses.b) some unit tests (eg. AjaxTimerBehaviorTest#testAddToAjaxUpdate  ComponentBorderTest#testHideableBorder) succeed  when the same code in non-unit-test environment doesn't work  because there is no ajax request during testing  while there is one during normal execution.
