WicketTester can't create new sessions    It looks like currently there is no way to create a new session (e.g. execute Application#newSession through WicketTester).My test case would be something like this: create a session set a configuration option with a form invalidate session create new session assert that the session#getStyle now returns something elseIn wicket-1.4 this was possible with WicketTester#createRequestCycle  but that is gone now.Workaround: create a new WicketTester  which will force to create a new session.
