[PATCH] Javascript error in IE7 when selecting a date    When selecting a date in IE7 I get a javascript error on line 227 in wicket-date.js. In this line there is the following check:if (typeof(field.onchange) != 'undefined' ) field.onchange();in IE7 this gives a warning due to field.onchange being null (which is user defined instead of undefined). Changing the check as follows solves this problem for me:if (typeof(field.onchange) != 'undefined' &amp;&amp; field.onchange != null) field.onchange();
