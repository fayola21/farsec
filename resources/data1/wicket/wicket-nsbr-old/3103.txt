RequestCycle logs something  when its intended for servlet container    I have something where I reference an image directly in html  wicket has no idea what it should do with it so it passes the request to the servlet container.. It works as I wanted  but should it give an error message?html: &lt;img src='/images/icons/arrow_down_end.png'/&gt;Log:ERROR &#91;org.apache.wicket.request.cycle.RequestCycle&#93; - Unable to execute request. No suitable RequestHandler found. URL=images/icons/arrow_down_end.png
