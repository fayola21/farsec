WicketServlet deprecation and WicketFilter    Hi I'm one of the maintainer of ops4j-pax-wicket. Atm  I'm trying tomigrate pax-wicket to wicket-2.0 that can be found at(https://scm.ops4j.org/repos/ops4j/branches/pax/wicket-2.0).One of the problem that I found during migration is the fact thatWicketFilter uses reflection to instantiate application factory byusing the FilterConfig.getInitParam( 'applicationFactoryClassName' ).Since this is not advisable in OSGi (Due to problem of ensuringwhoever export the wicket bundle must have it's classloader be able toload the application factory) and HttpService does not support Filter.It would be better if the old pattern of WicketServlet is supported.&lt;code&gt;public class WicketServlet{ protected WicketFilter newWicketFilter() { return new WicketFilter(); } public void init() { wicketFilter = newWicketFilter(); filter.init(new FilterConfig() { ... }); }}&lt;/code&gt;This way  I would be able to override the instantiation ofWicketFilter without having to reimplement my FilterConfig.For example  my wicket servlet will look like like:&lt;code&gt;final class MyWicketServlet extends WicketServlet{ private final IWebApplicationFactory m_appFactory; MyWicketServlet( IWebApplicationFactory factory ) { m_appFactory = factory; } protected final WicketFilter newWicketFilter() { return new WicketFilter() { protected IWebApplicationFactory getApplicationFactory() { return MyWicketServlet.this.m_appFactory; } }; }}&lt;/code&gt;This way  reflection will not be used anymore in both instantiatingWebApplication (bypassing ContextParamWebApplicationFactory class) andIWebApplicationFactory.Regards Edward YakopNote:Can we please remove the log.info part to mark WicketServlet is deprecated.&lt;code&gt;public WicketServlet(){ // log warning log.info('********************************************'); log.info('DEPRECATED! Please use WicketFilter instead.'); log.info('********************************************');}&lt;/code&gt;Reply from Johan Compagner (jcompagner@gmail.com)We will remove the warnings about the deprication when we will release 1.3/2.0for now we want to point people as much as possible to the wicket filter.The wicket servlet will still be there.So you just want a factory method in wicket servlet where you can make the wicket filter?can you add a RFE for this:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;mode=hide&amp;pid=12310561&amp;sorter/order=DESC&amp;sorter/field=priority&amp;resolution=-1&amp;component=12311420then i will add the factory method asap.johan
