Make debug settings session dependent    Currently  the debug settings are global. i.e. everyone gets to see the ajax debug link  or nobody. For production systems it is not acceptable to generate the debug link for all users  but it might be beneficial to quickly see what is going wrong on a site if you can enable the debug link programmatically for a single user.I can imagine that other settings also benefit from this.
