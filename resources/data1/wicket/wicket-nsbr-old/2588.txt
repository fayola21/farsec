ExternalLink to take IModel instead of IModel for label    I just noticed that this constructor  public ExternalLink(final String id  final IModel&lt;String&gt; href  final IModel&lt;String&gt;* label) takes IModel&lt;String&gt; for label. This is somewhat limiting since the model could hold a number or a date for example. Actually passing a raw IModel with any object inside works just fine. It would be more appropriate if this constructor takes IModel&lt;?&gt; for the label as done in Label constructor. Unfortunately ExternalLink offers a public method getLabel() that returns the label as IModel&lt;String&gt;. So it seems changing it would break compatibility.
