Use Apache Nexus Maven Repository instead of self hosted maven repository on wicketstuff.org    As of June 15  2010 the wicketstuff.org maven repository was down. Instead of fixing the wicketstuff.org server I proposed that the org.apache.wicket artifacts be switched to deploy through the Apache Nexus Maven repository.See this discussion: http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/proposal-Use-apache-nexus-repository-for-org-apache-wicket-release-and-snapshot-artifacts-tp2256728p2256728.htmlThis page has the registration details: http://www.apache.org/dev/repository-faq.htmlIt says to create a sub issue on this one: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1896I think the issue needs to be created by a org.apache.wicket committerThis migration will allow snapshots to be deployed from the apache hudson build cluster into the apache nexus maven repository.There is some kind of switchover that occurs for artifacts that are located through the people at apache method but since wicket artifacts that have been released are in central I see limited impact at this point.Future releases would deploy into this nexus repository which supports staging.I will attach diff's for the trunk 1.5-SNAPSHOT pom.xml and the 1.4.x branch 1.4-SNAPSHOT pom.xml that will create the two additional snapshot and release profiles that can be used for this purpose.
