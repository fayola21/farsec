Remove IComponentBorder in favor of IBehavior    Yeah i think we can depricate IComponentBorder in 1.4 and point to IBehaviorbefore/afterand then remove it in 1.5 and maybe remote also **public final Component setComponentBorder(final IComponentBorder border)in component or make it*public final Component setComponentBorder(final IBehavior border)to make it more clear to people that a border can be set by using a behavior(else who knows..)

Is there&gt; any reason why IComponentBorder needs this special treatment and why&gt; it is not implemented as a behavior?&gt;&gt; -Juergen&gt;-----------------&gt; Yeah i think we can depricate IComponentBorder in 1.4 and point to IBehavior&gt; before/afteri like the ComponentBorder stuff  because you can set it withoutinfluencing any beahavior or component stuff.. just render some contentbefore and after a component..i use it in debugging environmentmm------ Wait for some and give everybody a chance to comment
