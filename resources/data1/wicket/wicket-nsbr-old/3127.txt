Adding node to a collapsed tree node should not cause it to expand    The fix for WICKET-3112 made a unwanted minor modification to the Tree behavior that was established in WICKET-2886.Adding a child to a tree node that already has children and that is currently collapsed now causes the parent node to expand so that all the children are displayed. Only adding the first child to a node should cause it to expand  in all other cases the state of the parent node should not change.
