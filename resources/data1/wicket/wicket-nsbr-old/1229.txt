Inside a html tag wicket:message's attribute cannot contain colon : in it  it uses the first colon and tokenizes the rest to be the resource_identifier. Need some way to use colon in the attribute name.    I am trying to use wicket:message inside a tag in the following format wicket:message='attribute:resource_identifier'The attribute:resource_identifier passed as a value to the wicket:message uses the colon to tokenize the attribute and the resource_identifier. Now  The attribute which I am using is a custom attribute 'ric:title' (without quotes) which also has a colon in it. Currently  I have a tag with a custom attribute ric:title and the resource_identifier for it is page.title &lt;div wicket:message='ric:title:page.title' /&gt;  the problem is wicket takes the first colon which is part of my attribute and takes the rest as the resource_identifier and looks for it in the property file and then throws an error.How can I tell wicket to ignore the colon in the attribute name...? and I've tried using slash in front of the colon and it didn't work  I've tried using ascii html entity encoding for colon  which is &#58; and didn't work.So  please make a way to use colon in the attribute.Something like the following would be nice &lt;div wicket:message=' 'ric:title' : page.title'&gt;  which allows the user to set the attribute name in the markup within single quoutes. I am hoping to see this fixed.Thanks
