Wicket.Focus code utterly breaks AjaxEditableLabel    The Wicket.Focus javascript is nice and clever  but isn't clever enough - we've overlooked the use case where people want to set the focus in their AJAX callback to another component.This is particularly bad for the AjaxEditableLabel case  because onblur() on the text field that it pops up causes it to submit the value back to the server and finish the editing process and go away. So the text field pops up  and then wicket moves the focus somewhere else  so it goes away again immediately. Maybe a good stab at fixing 90% of the problem would be to see if the JS in the response has the word 'focus' in it  and not do the focusing if it does?Looking at the user list  I think Johan is the Wicket.Focus man  so I'm assigning this to him. Johan - if this isn't really your domain  obviously feel free to unassign and accept my apologies.
