Link: PopupSettings - overriding getPopupSettings has no effect    The popup settings are ONLY considered for the resulting JavaScript code when you use the setter setPopupSettings (which is final).The method getPopupSettings is NOT final but it has no effect - internally Link always uses the private field - not the getter.Something like the following code works fine - but is not really clear / intuitive:public class TestLink extends Link { public TestLink(String id) { super(id); setPopupSettings(getPopupSettings()); } public PopupSettings getPopupSettings() { return new PopupSettings(PopupSettings.RESIZABLE).setWindowName('test'); }}I don't know which is the prefered way of Wicket core developers but I can think of two ways to improve on this: Make getPopupSettings final (less work) Use getPopupSettings() within Link instead of the field
