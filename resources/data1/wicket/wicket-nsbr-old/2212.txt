Resource lookup/caching in OSGI environment spams errors for gone resources    I'd put together a simple dynamic menu example running on Modulefusion where the contributed menu items and pages come from another OSGI bundles. It works exactly as expected  eg. submenus appear/disappear automatically without restarts on submenu modules' deploys and undeploys  but after undeploying an already visited page's module  my server logs starts repeating messages like this:352322 &#91;ModificationWatcher Task&#93; ERROR org.apache.wicket.util.resource.UrlResourceStream - getLastModified for bundle://38.0:1/com/ftldev/wicket1/Boo.html failed: No bundle associated with resource: bundle://38.0:1/com/ftldev/wicket1/Boo.htmlI guess this has to do with resource caching. Is it possible to get this behaviour turn into a warning and/or get it stop after the first message? I guess once a resource has gone  it makes no good to keep looking for it forever anyway.. or is it another approach getting around this message? (again  appearently all my app keeps working fine meanwhile..)
