Input field with autocomplete behavior does not submit the form via enter key in some cases    This is related to WICKET-2 but wasn't fixed in that bug:When you enter nothing in an input field with autocomplete and press enter  type something that doesn't give results or press escape when the autocomplete box has appeared  you have to press enter twice to submit the form.The solution is quite simple: remove line 219 from wicket-autocomplete.js:hidingAutocomplete=1;This variable was introduced to keep enter from submitting  but by setting it here always to 1  enter is blocked in the above cases.
