for stateless pages wicket complains with 'The Buffered response should be handled by BufferedResponseRequestHandler'    when initially rendering a _stateless_ page I get 'The Buffered response should be handled by BufferedResponseRequestHandler'it's logged by WebPageRenderer#respond(cycle) in line 185 in trunk.I don't know if this really is worth a warning  maybe we can just remove it.There's also method WebPageRenderer#enableRedirectForStatelessPage()which seems to be somehow involved (and still contains a TODO which probably should be resolved before 1.5.0)I would like to fix it for myself but don't know much about the background of that warning.
