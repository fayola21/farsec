WicketServlet no longer sets application on current thread    The last changes made to WicketFilter (move Application.set(webApplication) from doGet() to doFilter()) have a side effect: if working with WicketServlet (due to OSGI)  the application is no longer set on the current thread  because it was moved to doFilter().Possible fixes: move Application.set() in WicketFilter back to doGet()  at the start if that's early enough expose the webApplication property  and add an extra Application.set() in the doGet() of WicketServlet
