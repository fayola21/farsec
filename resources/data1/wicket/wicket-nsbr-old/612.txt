HeaderContributor forces relative URL    I consider this a bug  and was wondering if you do as well... If so  I will open a JIRA and attach a patch for it. Just let me know.In my 1.2.6 app  I have the following line:add(HeaderContributor.forCss('/resources/styles/global.css'));which generates this in the markup (correctly):&lt;link rel ='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='/resources/css/global.css' &gt;&lt;/link&gt;In 1.3  it generates this in the markup (incorrectly):&lt;link rel ='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='../../..//resources/styles/global.css' &gt;&lt;/link&gt;This is because of the change to have everything with relative URLs  I am assuming. But  I don't want a relative URL  I want an absolute one. I'm thinking that the following change would be appropriate:HeaderContributor.java (26)if (location.startsWith('http://') || location.startsWith('https://'))changed to:if (location.startsWith('http://') || location.startsWith('https://') || location.startsWith('/'))
