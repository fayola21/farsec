SmartLinkLabel does not handle ~ in urls    The SmartLinkLabel doesn't care with tilde (~) character  so if i have a link like this: http://localhost/~something than only the http://localhost/ will be a link  and the rest of it won't.The source of the problem is very likely in DefaultLinkParser.java: /** URL pattern */ private static final String urlPattern = '(&#91;a-zA-Z&#93;:////w//.//-//:///)//w//.://-/?&amp;=%*';It just needs to add ~ char to the regexp.
