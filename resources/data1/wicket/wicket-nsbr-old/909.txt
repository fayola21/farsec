onBeforeRender not called on ModalWindow contents    ModalWindow.onBeforeRender contains the following code: super.onBeforeRender(); getContent().setOutputMarkupId(true); getContent().setVisible(shown);This has the consequence that the content of the modal windows is still invisible when its onBeforeRender() method is called. The default implementation of onBeforeRender delegates to the window's children beforeRender() method. However  the contents beforeRender() method first checks if the component is visible  which is not the case  so the onBeforeRender() call is not propagated down the component tree. This is a problem if the content of the modal window is something like a table  which populates itself in the onBeforeRender call.
