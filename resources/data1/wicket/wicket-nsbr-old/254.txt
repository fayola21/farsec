Allow to set field values before submitting a form with Ajax in WicketTester    I have code to validate {{TextField}}s one by one with ajax. While the code works  I wasn't able to assert it working with WicketTester.The attached quickstart can be used to reproduce the problem on a 2.0 snapshot. The code works in a browser (validity gets toggled true / false when changing the input length)  but WicketTester fails. With WicketTester  the ajax event gets triggered (and it calls validate on the field)  but isValid always returns true.
