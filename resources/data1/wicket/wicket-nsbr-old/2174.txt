Form#getMaxSize() -> no custom format    Hi I found problem with format of 'maxSize' property in component Form:final Map&lt;String  Object&gt; model = new HashMap&lt;String  Object&gt;();model.put('exception'  e);model.put('maxSize'  getMaxSize());... the main problem is if you want modify 'look and feel' of the Bytes format in error messages.Can you add e.g. new method String formatMaxSize() or something similar? The other solution is modification of toString of bean Bytes to get results look like 300kB (now there is 300K ... this is not good for common users). Or is there other simple way how to do this?Regards H.
