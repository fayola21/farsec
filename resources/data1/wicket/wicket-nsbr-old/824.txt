Session id encoding problem in cookie-less mode    If I disable session cookies  the URL-encoding does not work. The problem appears in displaying 'page expired' when I click through 'wicket-exmples' . I discovered that HttpServletResponse.encodeUrl() called by WebRequestCodingStrategy.encode() does not encode the session id  if it is called with a relative URL like '?wicket:interface=:0:inputForm:IFormSubmitListener::'. i.e.. starting with '?'.
