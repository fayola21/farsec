beforeRender not called for behaviour added to ComponentTag    When adding a IMarkupFilter and adding a behaviour to the ComponentTag  the beforeRender method is never called  only onComponentTag will be called  but by then it is too late to modify the component.Usecase: I would like to make components hidden if the markup contains wicket:hidden='hidden'. For this i need to modify the components visiblitiy depending on if the markup contains that attribute.The attached quickstart will never reach the System.out.println('beforeRender: should hide component'); in HiddenComponentMarkupFilter
