NPE in ListMultipleChoice.updateModel()    I noticed a NullPointerException when I cleared a Form with a ListMultipleChoice to its original state.In updateModel() following statement causes a NPE when something was selected in the multiple select but in the original state nothing was selected:selectedValues.addAll((Collection)getConvertedInput());getConvertedInput() is null  so ArrayList.addAll() operates on the null value and throws the NPE.
