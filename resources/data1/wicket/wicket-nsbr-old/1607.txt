addDomReadyEvent unreliable for Safari    Because Safari doesn't support an onDomReady event  wicket-event.js emulates that behavior using timeouts when that browser is detected. However  the timeout is only set once  for 10ms; window.setTimeout() does not produce a repeating timeout. If the document object is not ready at that point  the registered functions are never called. Often it is ready  so the bug is masked.I discovered this problem in a page that uses the DateTimeField component  which uses onDomReady for its initialization. Sometimes the component works fine  other times nothing happens when you click. It's a fairly complicated page that apparently Safari may spend more than 10ms building.
