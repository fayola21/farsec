AbstractTextComponent#setConvertEmptyInputStringToNull(true) does not work with IObjectClassAwareModels (affects TextField  etc.)    The unit tests ought to cover this  but apparently don't. A TextField should convert empty strings to nulls if you call setConvertEmptyInputStringToNull(true) on it (which the constructors do by default).However  this doesn't currently work: AbstractTextComponent#getConvertEmptyInputStringToNull() is only called from AbstractTextComponent#convertValue(String[]). AbstractTextComponent#convertValue(String[]) is called from FormComponent#convert()  but only if the component doesn't have a type assigned to it. As soon as you use a PropertyModel (which implements IObjectClassAwareModel)  this means empty strings are no longer converted to nulls.This is obviously a great big blocker and needs fixing ASAP.
