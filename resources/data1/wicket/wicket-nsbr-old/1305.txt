AbstractTextComponent requires itself to be rendered before conversion happens    The bug is reproduced as follows:1. Use StatelessForm.2. Use compound model  eg CompoundPropertyModel. In this case  form components are not initially aware of their model types.3. Use any text component inside  eg TextFieldWhat happens:1. In StatelessForm  form processing occurs BEFORE components were actually rendered.2. BUT AbstractTextComponent guesses its model type ONLY in onBeforeRender().3. onBeforeRender() never gets called  so text component doesn't know its actual type and cannot convert properly.4. Everything crashes because of incorrect type (validators and form submission is working wrong).Obviously  this processing sequence needs to be fixed (eg retrieve model type early or check for stateless forms explicitly).
