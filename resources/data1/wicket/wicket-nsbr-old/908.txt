There is no way to specify what exceptions to log in RequestCycle    RequestCycle  line 1135 logs all exceptions except for PageExpiredException. This is not a wanted behavior for us (for example  it also logs AuthorizationException which is not a error).So we need some way to specify which exceptions should be treated as errors and which ones are just need to be handled by RequestCycleProcessor#respond(RuntimeException  RequestCycle).Maybe there is some way to globally catch application exceptions other than writing a custom RequestCycleProcessor. If so then tell me please.The possible solution is to move exception logging to RequestCycleProcessor#respond(RuntimeException  RequestCycle) because it can be overriden.
