isComponent in BaseWicketTester contains possible nullpointer exception    When attempting to verify if a component exists  attempting to unit test a panel  the tester.assertComponent() call fails due to a nullpointer.This occurs when isComponent() in BaseWicketTester is called and fails to find a component from the last rendered page. Then the component.getClass() in the following line will trigger the nullpointer exception.A very simple fix would be to add a null check before attempting to check the type of the component to be able to provide a better error message.
