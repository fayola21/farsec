Patches to correct some Findbugs warnings in core  request and util    The patches contain fixes mainly for the followings: only java files in main source directories of core  request and util were touched (so test not) only those were fixed that looked straightforward and locally fixable fixing cases that always result in NPE (2 found) or ClassCastException (1 found) unused local variable  dead store removals redundant instanceof check  nullcheck removals added transient to non serializable fields of serializable classes made inner classes static where the reference to the enclosing classes was not used some extra null checks added with WeakReference usages to avoid NPE 'File#delete() return value not checked': using wickets Files#remove() instead small performance related tasks: using StringBuilder in loop  using map entrySet() instead of keySet() + get()I added some comments to the patches where I tought it is not easy to figure out without the findbugs report why the code was changed. But of course I can explain if other questions arise.
