Bookmarkable / Stateless form submit bug    A stateless bookmarkable form submission isn't working correctly for submissions after reboot or session expiration. This may be due to the use of MixedParamUrlCodingStrategy: believe I've tracked down the problem to this code in BookmarkablePageRequestTargetUrlCodingStrategy:  // do some extra work for checking whether this is a normal request to a  // bookmarkable page  or a request to a stateless page (in which case a  // wicket:interface parameter should be available  final String interfaceParameter = (String)parameters  .remove(WebRequestCodingStrategy.INTERFACE_PARAMETER_NAME);  if (interfaceParameter != null)  { WebRequestCodingStrategy.addInterfaceParameters(interfaceParameter  requestParameters); return new BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestTarget(pageMapName  (Class)bookmarkablePageClassRef.get()  parameters  requestParameters .getComponentPath()  requestParameters.getInterfaceName()  requestParameters.getVersionNumber()); } The issue is that the 'parameters' will never contain the INTERFACE_PARAMETER_NAME because it would have been removed in WebRequestCodingStrategy:decode:215 which as far as I can tell is always called first (from RequestCycle.step.RESOLVE_TARGET:1233). The 'requestParameters' should already have the interface parameters  so it isn't clear why the addInterfaceParameters() logic is being called again (it is already called in WebRequestCodingStrategy:decode:200). I've got a patch forthcoming.
