WebRequestCycleProcessor.resolveHomePageTarget for empty path with enforceMounts=true provokes 403 - 'Direct access not allowed for mounted targets'    Scenario: WebApplication.getHomePage() returns a page that is also mounted to a non-empty path by WebApplication.mountBookmarkablePage(). Besides  we have getSecuritySettings().setEnforceMounts(true). Upon a request for the servlet's root URL (i.e.  with requestParameters.getPath()=='')  the methodWebRequestCycleProcessor.resolve will throw a AbortWithWebErrorCodeException(403) with error message 'Direct access not allowed for mounted targets'.This is because WebRequestCycleProcessor.resolveHomePageTarget correctly returns a non-null target  so that the else-branch starting in line 190 of file WebRequestCycleProcessor.java is reached. The comment says 'a target was found  but not by looking up a mount'  which is misleading  because the szenario should desirably work even though property enforceMounts has been set to true.The only (terrible) workaound I have found is to override WebRequestCycleProcessor.resolveHomePageTarget() to return null and establish a home-page-like thing by overriding WebRequestCodingStrategy.urlCodingStrategyForPath() for the empty path.
