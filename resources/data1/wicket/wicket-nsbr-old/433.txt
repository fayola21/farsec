improved reporting on locked page maps    It would be cool if we could log some more information on which request is locking another request when it times out. Currently  we get an error like:exception: After 1 minute the Pagemap null is still locked by: Thread&#91;Jetty thread-105 5 main&#93;  giving up trying to get the page for path: 0:1but Thread&#91;Jetty thread-105 5 main&#93; is hardly useful in a log. More useful would be e.g. the request target.
