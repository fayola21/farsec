Extract lazy AbstractListDataProvider out of ListDataProvider.    ListDataProvider is handy for quickly providing a List as source for a DataView; but it forces you to pass a list object during construction and doesn't allow you to provide a new list.That means it becomes hard to update the elements in the DataView when the page is (re)rendered. It might be useful to provide an abstract superclass to ListDataProvider which provides an abstract method for obtaining the list allowing the developer to lazy-load the data he wants to show; making sure to always load up-to-date data when the view is being rendered rather than data he passed in during construction which may have become outdated.
