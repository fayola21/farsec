WebRequestCodingStrategy is not synchronized    The WebRequestCodingStrategy class uses a TreeMap to store mounted pages however there is no synchronization done. This will cause problems if pages are being mounted/unmounted by one thread while web requests are being served from a different one. It could also cause problems if two threads try to mount/unmount pages at the same time.I'll include a patch to fix this as well as a new version of the java file that you can use if you wantKeep up the good work
