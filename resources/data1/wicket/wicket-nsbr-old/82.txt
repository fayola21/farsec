Support case insensitive mount paths    http://www.nabble.com/Non-case-sensitive-nice-URL-tf2643746.htmlI use nice URL to mount some page in the usual way :mountBookmarkablePage('/Organization'  Organization.class);That is great  but it will make an error if a user enter the url by hand and decide to not use case sensitive. I mean  I can mount organization without the capital letter  but it would make the same error if the user use Capital after that.Is there a way of using Nice URL that is not case sensitive?ThanksMarc
