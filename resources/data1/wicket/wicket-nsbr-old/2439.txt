Improve MixedParamUrlCodingStrategy  introduce Hybrid    The MixedParamUrlCodingStrategy can be improved.The current form has the following shortcomings: it just fails when something is added to the URL  solution: add the option to ignore the added parts (in fact I made this the default) when something is added to the URL  the message is not very clear  solution: rewrite message and add more information it does not accept non-String parameter values  solution: use String.valueOf(paramValue)In addition the patch adds a Hybrid variant.
