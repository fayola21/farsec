Form.MULTIPART_HINT is not cleared correctly with nested forms    I have a page that looks like this Page  Form  Wizard (contains another Form)  StepOne - contains a FileUploadField StepTwo - has no FileUploadField      (The outer form is there because I have some controls outside the wizard that needed to submit the wizard too).Because I have been using Ajax ModalDialogs  it has been important to get Form.multipart set correctly (otherwise they don't submit back correctly). So I override Wizard.onActiveStepChanged and checked to see if the new wizard step contained a FileUploadField  and set Form.setMultiPart accordingly. However  this only clears Form.MULTIPART_HARD  Form.MULTIPART_HINT is left untouched.When I step from StepOne to StepTwo  the inner form still has MULTIPART_HINT set as it contained a FileUploadField last render. Then the outer form's onRender fires  which clears MULTIPART_HINT  then the outer form's onComponentTag fires. When it checks isMultiPart()  it evaluates to true as the nested Form still returns true from its MULTIPART_HINT  and therefore tag.put('enctype'  'multipart/form-data'); is executed. After that  the inner form's onRender fires which clears its MULTIPART_HINT.When I try to submit StepTwo  the html has enctype='multipart/form-data'  so it does a multipart submit. But wicket is not expecting a multipart submit so it doesn't find any of the submitted form data  and cannot determine which button is pressed  and loses all the form content.
