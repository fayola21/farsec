Form.findForm(Component c) bug. When form is part of Border and form component like TextField is inside another Border   component cannot resolve its form.    I have Border class which renders Form and some other elements for feedback messages. Class included in attachments. Into this border i am putting form component which is Panel and in that Panel is another Border. Borders form has body container added.When i submit form i get error 'Could not find Form parent for ...'It's because Form.findForm method search for Form.class just in nearest component Border and not in all Borders upper in hierarchy.
