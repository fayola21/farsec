IModel parameters of StringResourceModel not getting detached    StringResourceModel supports IModels in the 'parameters' Object[] thatare properly handled in StringResourceModel#getString  meaning theycould get attached because of StringResourceModel. StringResourceModel should probably check the 'parameters' array for IModels(or even IDetachables?) and detach them from StringResourceModel#onDetach
