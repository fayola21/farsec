Text not visible in Wicket Ajax Debug window    The Wicket Ajax Debug (WAD) window has a background color set to white but the font color is not set (in wicket-ajax-debug.js) - it uses the base page defaults. So when I have in css for my page setting like this: body color: Color value is invalid  the text in WAD is not visible.Suggested solution: maybe add somewhere in wicket-ajax-debug.js setting: 'color: black;'
