Should the QuickStart archetype generated HomePage.html inlude the Wicket namespace in the html tag?    For full history see http://www.nabble.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-handle-%22Undefined-attribute-name-%28wicket%3Aid%29%22--warnings-from-Eclipse-Ganymede--to21788889.html#a21818462Timo It's a very simple change to the archetype: just replace the html open tagwith html xmlns:wicket='http://wicket.apache.org/dtds.data/wicket-xhtml1.3-strict.dtd'in /archetype-resources/src/main/java/HomePage.htmlThe question is  is there any reason why we wouldn't want to do this? I've raised the Jira issue anyway.Regards - Cemal&lt;a href='http://www.jWeekend.co.uk'&gt;jWeekend&lt;/a&gt;
