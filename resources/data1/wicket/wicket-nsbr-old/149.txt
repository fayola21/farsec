mounted URLs fail if filterPath is blank    The path in RequestParameters needs to begin with a '/' or it will not be found when checking against mounted paths. The slash is prefixed in WicketFilter line 545 when checking isWicketRequest()  but it is not prefixed later when looking for the request target. Proposed fix in patch (to be attached) performs this operation in ServletWebRequest.getPath(); I'm not sure if that is the ideal spot  but I've confirmed that it fixes the problem.
