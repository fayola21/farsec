Add IRequestListener interface to allow easier framework extension points    See http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/Session-attach-tp3004389p3004681.htmlBasically  add an interface for onBeginRequest and onEndRequest that can be plugged into the WebRequestCycle. This allows framework extensions to plugin their listeners rather than extending WRC  and requiring that you then extend them.
