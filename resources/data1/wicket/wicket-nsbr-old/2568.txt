Unnecessary method calls in IDataProvider    Referring to the post on the mailinglist (http://old.nabble.com/Unnecessary-method-calls-in-IDataProvider--ts26266771.html)  here's a quick summary of the problem:If the size() method of an IDataProvider returns zero  the iterator(int int) method should not be called. Calling this method with value zero as second parameter (== count) always results in returning an empty iterator. Therefore a lot of unnecessary method calls (and thus a lot of unnecessary database hits) could be saved if an empty iterator would be used by the DataView whenever size() returns an int &lt;= 0.Please find a project attached with a junit test that illustrates the problem. I tested it with all major releases from 1.4.3. down to 1.3.0. with the same result.
