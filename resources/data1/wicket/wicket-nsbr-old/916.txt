inconsistent state after setting AjaxDebugModeEnabled to true in an AjaxRequest    when the application debugsetting AjaxDebugModeEnabled is changed from false to true in an AjaxRequest (e.g. via JMX)  the following two statements in AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior#renderHead are executed:response.renderJavascript('wicketAjaxDebugEnable=true;'  'wicket-ajax-debug-enable');response.renderJavascriptReference(JAVASCRIPT_DEBUG);as soon as the client recieves the response  the first javascript statement is executed and code in wicket-ajax.js 'thinks' that ajax debug is enabled.well it is  but wicket-ajax-debug.js has not arrived (or at least has not been processed) yet  and thus Wicket.Log.info() and Wicket.Log.error() will fail  because these methods access an object which is defined in wicket-ajax-debug.js.This problem seems to be solved by changing the order of the statements in AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior#renderHead  so that the ResourceReference JAVASCRIPT_DEBUG is rendered before wicketAjaxDebugEnable is set to true.
