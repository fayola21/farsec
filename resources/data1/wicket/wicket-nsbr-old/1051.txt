StyleSheetReference doesn't take style/locale into account    StyleSheetReference (in essence PackagedResourceReference) doesn't take the style and locale into account as is common for resource loaders.Changing PackagedResourceReference line 102 from ResourceReference ref = new ResourceReference(referer  f);to ResourceReference ref = new ResourceReference(referer  f  getLocale()  getStyle());fixes this issue
