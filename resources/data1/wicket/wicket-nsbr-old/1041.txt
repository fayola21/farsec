Fix a TODO for 1.3 at AjaxFormSubmitBehavior.onError()    There is the following TODO at org/apache/wicket/ajax/form/AjaxFormSubmitBehavior.onError(): /**  Listener method invoked when the form has been processed and errors occured  @param target  TODO 1.3: make abstract to be consistent with onsubmit()  */ protected void onError(AjaxRequestTarget target) {  } Should this be done for 1.3 or it will stay like it is now for the next major release ?
