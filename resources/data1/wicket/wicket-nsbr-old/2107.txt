Misplaced IllegalStateExceptions when accessing stateful URL with different session    partly copied from the mailing list (http://www.nabble.com/exception-handling-for-session-dependent-URLs-to22037821.html):I recently came across a link to one of my projects where a user linked to a session dependent URL such as /?wicket:interface=:0::IBehaviorListener:2:3when clicking on that URL  a PageExpiredException gets thrown and a redirect to the SessionExpiredPage takes place. So far so good - that's the way it should be.However this works only for the first request (as long as the user doesn't have a session). If the user has a session and clicks on that link different exceptions might get thrown. with the URL mentioned above I've seen either a IllegalStateException (when it couldn't find a IBehaviorListener with the corresponding ID) or a ClassCastException (when it tried to cast a HeaderContributor to an IBehaviorListener in BehaviorRequestTarget). Apart from the ClassCastException  which definitely shouldn't occur  I don't think that IllegalStateExceptions should be thrown in (all of) those cases  as clicking on a session dependent link with a wrong session isn't a far fetched scenario.
