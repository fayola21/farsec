AJAX file upload fails in IE8 due to Wicket.Ajax.handleMultipart() sniffing wicket:body tags as an HTML body element when running Wicket in development mode    To reproduce:1. Run provided quickstart project2. Open in IE8. 3. Upload a file. Expected behaviour: File is uploaded  and some basic information about uploaded file is displayed.Observed behaviour:IllegalStateException is thrown.The IllegalStateException is being thrown because the form is being submitted as a normal form. This is because the JS in handleMultipart that traverses up the DOM looking for the actual form is checking tagnames  and in IE8  the tagName of a &lt;wicket:body&gt; is body  so as soon as it hits a wicket:body  it returns false. I've provided a patch that checks for identity against document.body - an alternative is to check that the form.tagUrn is empty  as it would be for a normal HTML element.
