Form gets submitted using AjaxSubmitBehavior when sub-form has error's    from http://www.nabble.com/Should-a-form-submit-when-sub-form-has-error%27s--tt22803314.htmlI have a main-form where I add a panel that contains another form.This sub-form contains a formvalidator that gives the error.However the main-form is submitted  but the feedbackpanel does show the error message set in the sub-form's validator.I'll attach 2 patches with testcases displaying the behavior in wicket 1.3 vs 1.4(As a side note  I had to rename the org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.validation.TestHomePage to org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.validation.HomePageTest to get the test to run when building wicket)
