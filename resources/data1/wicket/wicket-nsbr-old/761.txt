Disable line-precise exceptions for component use check    vote here:http://www.nabble.com/-VOTE--disable-line-precise-error-reporting-by-default-tf4037146.html#a11469624while looking in the code i noticed that line-precise information is collected under the same setting as component-use-check. i think the exception part should be factored out into a separate setting. component use check is still very valuable without line-precise information and has no perceptible slow down like the line-precise exceptions.
