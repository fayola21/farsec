Set Application ThreadLocal in WicketSessionFilter    WicketSessionFilter currently only sets the Session ThreadLocal  but not the Application ThreadLocale.This leads to WicketRuntimeException when trying to get the Application using Application#get or Session#getApplication.It would be handy if the Application ThreadLocal would also be set in WicketSessionFilter.see also:http://old.nabble.com/Application-get-in-WicketSessionFilter-ts27862681.html#a27862681
