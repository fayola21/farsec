Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser3. Open http://localhost:8080/page2 in a new tab4. Go to the first tab and click submitResult:WicketRuntimeException: unable to find component with path form on stateless page &#91;Page class = test.Page2  id = 0  version = 0&#93;It looks like the 2 pages are created with the same id in 2 different pagemaps  but when I submit the form  it goes to the second pagemap and finds the second page (with no form on it).
