setresponsepage() does not properly redirect from ajax requests    if you are on a mounted page with parameters  lets say/context/page/param1/param2/and you call setresponsepage() from an NORMAL link on that page you will land on/context/?wicket:interface=...which is correct  however if you do it from an ajax link like so: onclick(ajaxrequesttarget target) { setresponsepage(new mypage()); } you will land on /context/page/param1/param2/?wicket:interface=...which is INCORRECTl. notice that the mount and params were not stripped. also now because wicket thinks url depth is 0 urls will break  for example a resource requested from that page will be:/context/page/param1/param2/resources/..... woopsiewhy this happens:when setresponsepage is called the ?wicket:interface:foo::: url is constructed and passed to webresponse.redirect(url) which in turn calls httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(url); for normal responses or httpServletResponse.addHeader('Ajax-Location'  url); for ajax responses. the big difference is how servletresponse handles this  and from the javadoc: This method can accept relative URLs; the servlet container will convert the relative URL to an absolute URL before sending the response to the client. so what needs to be done is that httpServletResponse.addHeader('Ajax-Location'  url); also needs to mangle the url and make it absolute.since you are the proxy guy and i dont know how this will play into that i am assigning it to you
