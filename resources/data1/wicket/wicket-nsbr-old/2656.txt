Ability to add CSS style to table body in DataTable    Being able to dynamically adjust css styles in the table body &lt;tbody&gt; of the DataTable is essential for a lot of advanced functionality e.g. adding a scrollbar to the contents of a table (which also eliminates the need for pagination and enhances usability for certain use cases). Sure one can override DataTable.html and hardcode a css style in the body element  but that is not enough. It must be dynamic and that requires the DataTable.java code to be changed. In the event that a client just provides a complete implementation of DataTable.java   the Toolbar classes can no longer be used since they reference the DataTable concrete class instead of an interface. I provide a patch to fix this issue and augment the DataTable with an extra method: void setTableBodyCss(String cssStyle);
