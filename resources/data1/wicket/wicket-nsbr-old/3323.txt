TreeTable should call attachUpdate javascript on domready event.    Since Wicket-1.4.15 it is possible to filter javascript resources (JavascriptFilteredIntoFooterHeaderResponse) and place them to the tail of HTML document. It means that some embedded javascript can be broken because of too early evaluation and missing dependencies.I have faced with this problem in TreeTable component. But probably there are other places in the framework  affected by this issue.
