form action URLs in non-Wicket forms not rewritten    Wicket's RelativePathPrefixHandler rewrites 'href'  'src'  and 'background'URLs in non-Wicket markup but does not rewrite 'action' URLs in forms.There are workarounds but it would be cleaner if Wicket handled this caseby default.Discussion at:http://www.nabble.com/RelativePathPrefixHandler-and-form-'action'-attributes-tt18537680.htmlhttp://www.nabble.com/RelativePathPrefixHandler-and-form-'action'-attributes-tt18536692.html
