Wickettester executeAllTimerBehaviors executes stopped behaviors too    When attempting to test a page with two ajax timer behaviours the first behaviour is triggered correctly. Then that behaviour is stopped (using the stop function) and a second behaviour is started. If executeAllTimerBehaviors is called again both behaviours are triggered even though one is stopped.It would be good if the code in BaseWicketTester.executeAllTimerBehaviors(MarkupContainer container) could validate if the behaviour is stopped or not before trying to execute it.
