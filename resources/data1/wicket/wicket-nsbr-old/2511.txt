Upgrade to SLF4J version 1.5.8    Please consider upgrading to SLF4J version 1.5.8 which should--+ be 100% compatible with SLF4J version 1.4.2 that you are currently using (in wicket 1.4.2). Compared to SLF4J version 1.4.2  the latest version  among many small improvements  supports serialization which should be helpful when a logger field is used within a wicket model.--+ I am being conservative when I say 'should'  'is' would have been more accurate.
