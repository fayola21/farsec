unable to add nodes to an empty rootless Tree (e.g. LinkTree)    2 scenarios which adding new nodes (via ajax) to a rootless Tree is not working as expected.the node is getting added to the treemodel but non is displayed.1) adding a node to the rootnode. the newly added node is not displayed.2) the rootless tree already has a node. if you add additional nodes to the root node  they will be displayed (compare to 1)  if you add an additional node to one of the added nodes  the complete tree will disappear.see attached quickstart
