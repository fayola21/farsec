assertComponentOnAjaxResponse does not work with WicketTester.clickLink    assertComponentOnAjaxResponse does not work with clickLink. Workaround are to call wickettester..executeAjaxEvent(ajaxLink 'onclick'); instead.Reason why this fails has something todo with that clickLink creates a servlet response which are empty hence this will always fail: // Get the AJAX response String ajaxResponse = getServletResponse().getDocument(); // Test that the previous response was actually a AJAX response failMessage = 'The Previous response was not an AJAX response. ' + 'You need to execute an AJAX event  using clickLink  before using this assert'; boolean isAjaxResponse = ajaxResponse.startsWith('&lt;?xml version=/'1.0/' encoding=/'UTF-8/'?&gt;&lt;ajax-response&gt;');proposed fix are to rewrite wicketTester.clicklink(string path boolean ajax) to call executeAjaxEvent instead if possible?
