Script in RenderHead method of AjaxFormChoiceComponentUpdatingBehavior needs fixing    The script in the renderHead method of AjaxFormChoiceComponentUpdatingBehavior assumes that the Radio Component will be the immediate child of the RadioGroup Component  But in some or in most of the cases that is not correct.That is not the case even in the Wicket Examples  in examples the hierarchy is RadioGroup/ListView/Radio.I have maodied the rendered script to work for RadioGroup/ListView/Radio hierarchy. And the Patch is attached.RegardsDipu
