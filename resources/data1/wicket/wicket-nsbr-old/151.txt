set session locale when constructing session object    Currently  we create the session objects like this:WebApplication#getSession:if (session == null){ // Create session using session factory session = getSessionFactory().newSession(request); // Set the client Locale for this session session.setLocale(request.getLocale());What I propose is to change the constructor from Session/ WebSession to take in a Locale parameter as well. That would make it possible for custom session classes to fix the locale by setting it in the constructor. Now that is only possible by overriding Session#getLocale
