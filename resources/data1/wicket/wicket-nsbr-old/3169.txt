Parametrize IFilterStateLocator    Interface org.apache.wicket.extensions.markup.html.repeater.data.table.filter.IFilterStateLocator contains methods which work with Object types. It may be a good improvement to parametrize this interface with type &lt;T&gt; much like the IModel &lt;T&gt;interface in order to introduce type-safety and avoid casting.
