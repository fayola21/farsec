Internal Spring beans should be ignored    When looking up Spring beans by type (to inject into @SpringBean fields)  the injector should ignore internal beans  like the ones generated by the &lt;aop:scoped-proxy/&gt; element at the configuration. In this case  the generated name always starts with 'scopedTarget.'.Other cases can be identified by the method 'BeanFactoryUtils.isFactoryDereference(name)'.These beans are created by the container to be used internally  so  shouldn't be considered for injection. The problem is  they usually have a mirror bean (which is the really injected by the container)  so  when Wicket's injector tries to find it  it doesn't find unique beans of the type  forcing us to declare the bean name explicitly.
