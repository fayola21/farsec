HybridUrlCodingStrategy and StatelessForm ( or StatelessLink ) results in invalid parameter encoding    I put a header component on one of my pages which contains a statelessform ( or stateless link ) . I mounted the page with a HybridUrlCodingStrategy . When you request the page like thishttp://localhost:9696/mountpath/param1/param1value  stateless form attaches another parameter which shows the forms IFormListener target. The new url is like this :http://localhost:9696/mountpath/param1/param1value/wicket:interface/%3A0%3Aheader%3AloggedOutView%3AloginForm%3A%3AIFormSubmitListener%3A%3A/.0I haven't covered all the source code for now but i think the form changes the page parameters object so i think HybridUrlCodingStrategy must clone initial page parameters before putting it to page metadata. But not sure that this will cause any other problems
