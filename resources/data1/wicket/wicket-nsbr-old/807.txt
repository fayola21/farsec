MockHttpServletRequest.addFile does not work with binary files    http://www.nabble.com/Uploading-binary-files-via-MockHttpServletRequest-tf4192893.html#a11934991As stated in the thread  I can upload text (xml) files just fine but binary data does not work. I suspect there are some encoding issues which cause the binary data to be corrupted. buildRequest() looks like it is corrupting the binary data when it pushes the data into String format. I don't think this is right - you should treat the request as a byte array  not a String. I think the MIME or HTTP RFCs might have more info on how binary data is supposed to be packaged within an HTTP request.
