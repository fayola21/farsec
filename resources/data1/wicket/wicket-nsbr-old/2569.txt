Inheritance layout excludes XML header from output    When using inheritance layout  if the superclass (Layout class) has an ?xml header at the top  it's excluded from the rendering of subclasses  if they have an associated html file. If the subclass has no .html file associated with it  the ?xml header is preserved in the rendering output.To reproduce: Create a SuperPage class extending WebPage. At the top of SuperPage.html  put '&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;' . Create two subclasses of SuperPage  one with an HTML file and one without. View the sub pages. Notice when the one with an HTML file is rendered  the xml header is excluded.Expected: The ?xml header should always be preserved in the rendered output as it's vital to the layout.
