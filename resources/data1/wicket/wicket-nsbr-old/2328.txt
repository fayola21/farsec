WicketTester does not accurately simulate scenario where entire page is added to AjaxRequestTarget    If the entire page is added to an AjaxRequestTarget  Wicket treats this as a special case: the normal ajax flow is aborted and the browser is asked to refetch the page in a normal  non-ajax request.For example  if this code is used:public void onClick(AjaxRequestTarget tgt){ tgt.addComponent(getPage());}This causes the browser to reload the page (you can see the location bar in the browser changing).The problem is that WicketTester does not simulate this scenario correctly. If you use WicketTester to test the onClick() listener in the example above  the page is not re-rendered. You can verify this by instrumenting the onBeforeRender method for the page: it is never called.So to summarize:When the framework is run normally  AjaxRequestTarget.addComponent(Page) causes Wicket to start a completely new non-ajax request-response. However when the framework is run using WicketTester  a new request-response is not executed.
