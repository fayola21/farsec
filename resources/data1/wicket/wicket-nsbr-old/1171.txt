Tolerate malformed If-Modified-Since header    Some kind of RSS aggregator is hitting an rc1 site of mine regularly with dates that don't follow the HTTP spec. Correct to the servlet spec  Jetty throws an exception in this instance which causes Wicket to abort processing the request and log an error. I think it would be better to log the exception as a warning and proceed as if the header had not been present.Example exception:ERROR btpool0-703 org.mortbay.log - /resources/com.typeturner.Typeturner/eat-rssjava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert date: 1194673976 at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpFields.getDateField(HttpFields.java:827) at org.mortbay.jetty.Request.getDateHeader(Request.java:460) at org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter.doFilter(WicketFilter.java:197)
