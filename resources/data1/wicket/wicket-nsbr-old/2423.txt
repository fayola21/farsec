Not all 'domready' events are called when two wicket-event.js files are added to the page    When more than one wicket portlets run in a portal a page could get more than one wicket-event.js entry and more than one Wicket.Event.add(window  'domready'  function() {...});. In this case not all of these 'domready' functions are executed. It happens because Wicket.Event object is created every time browser reaches wicket-event.js entry declaration which in turn causes Wicket.Event.fireDomReadyHandlers function to execute not all functions (this function is called only once when the global variable 'window.loaded' is set to false).Attached patch fixes the problem by ensuring that Wicket.Event object is created only once.
