FormComponents (and subclasses) should be able to provide their own resource bundles    In order to fully support the idea to break down a large application into small reusable components it seems necessary that FormComponents provide their own resource bundles. We have a project that uses a customized subclass of Checkbox that needs to provide customized error messages. The ideal place for those error messages would be a resource bundle living next to the Checkbox subclass but this is not yet supported. Unfortunately the JavaDoc for ComponentStringResourceLoader indicates (see example: input1.properties =&gt; Required) that support for this already exists.A small change to FormComponent$MessageSource.getMessage(String key) could add support for this. Instead of using the formComponent.getParent() as the base for searching the resource string  simply use the formComponent itself.
