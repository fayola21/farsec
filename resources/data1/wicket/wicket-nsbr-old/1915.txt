wicket:message sometimes broken    The behavior described here: http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/wickets-xhtml-tags.html (use wicket:message as attribute) sometimes doesn't work  depending on the hierarchy and the tag where it applies.I've reproduced it using a repeater and applying wicket:message it to a &lt;td&gt; tag.Instead of correctly modifying the attribute  it throws the usual MarkupException 'WicketMessage: Unable to find component with id 'label' in [MarkupContainer'
