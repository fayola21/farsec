Add getter and setter for data provider to  AjaxFallbackDefaultDataTable    Adding at least getter (and a setter too) for data provider would allow for a lot better handling of customized data providers. For example if data provider's results are dependant on external values like  say  boolean stating if table should contain only rows with some specific statistic ('show only items which are on sale' or anything like that) I'd rather do ((ShopDataProvider)table.getDataProvider()).setShowOnlyItemsOnSale(true); instead of recreating the object and replacing it on the page by doing something like get('table').replace(new AjaxFallbackDefaultDataTable('table'  columns  new ShopDataProvider(true)));
