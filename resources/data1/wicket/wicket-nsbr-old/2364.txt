CLONE -Make LoadableDetachableModel writable    To keep it compatible with current usage:public final void setObject(Object obj) { reload(obj); tempModelObject = obj;}protected void reload(Object obj) { throw new OperationNotSupportedException('Read only model');}Subclasses can now implement their own write logic. This is necessary for for instance stand alone dropdownchoice components that need to store their selection.e.g.MyPage { IModel&lt;SchoolYear&gt; selectedSchoolYear; public MyPage() { selectedSchoolYear = new HibernateModel&lt;SchoolYear&gt;(SchoolYear.current()); new SchoolYearDropDownChoice(this  'schoolyear'  selectedSchoolYear); }}If HibernateModel is not writeable then the selected SchoolYear instance would end up in the session.
