Consistently create body for short tags.    When the Wicket HTML contains a tag such as &lt;a wicket:id='foo' /&gt; and the component bound to that tag uses replaceComponentTagBody to write a string to the tag's body  currently nothing happens.Either a text node should be added to the component tag and the body written to it;Or a warning/exception should occur if for some reason it is preferred to not let this method succeed when the component tag has no body yet.I don't see the use of the latter  so I recommend the former be implemented.For now it's just confusing and dangerous. If I give my HTML to a web designed and he changes a few empty HTML tags to short tags  I'll never be warned  but my output WILL be broken.
