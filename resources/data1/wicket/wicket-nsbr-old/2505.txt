Button.onSubmit javadoc is misleading    The javadoc in org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.Button.onSubmit() is misleading. It says 'Override this method to provide special submit handling in a multi-button form. It is called whenever the user clicks this particular button.' In reality  the method doesn't get called if the form's validation fails. Not sure if there are other cases as well when the method doesn't get called.
