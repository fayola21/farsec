Problem closing a ModalWindow when used through an IFrame    I'm doing some POC testing to find out how a wicket application could be used through an IFrame and noticed that closing of a ModalWindow fails.My setup:Application A: -a dummy html page that has an IFrame-the contents of the IFrame is requested from Application B&lt;iframe src='http://localhost:8080/mywicketapp/app/' width='100%' height='500'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;Application B:-a Wicket application that uses a ModalWindow-deployed to tomcat: http://localhost:8080/mywicketapp/Problem:The ModalWindow is not closed when OK ( or Cancel ) button is clicked when Application B is used throug IFrame of Application A.OK button performs the actual action (in my case deletes an item from a list) but is not closed after the execution of the action.Closing of the ModalWindow works normally when Application B is not used through an IFrame.Reproducing the problem:You can test this by creating a html page with this source:&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src='http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples/ajax/modal-window.1' width='100%' height='100%'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;And then open 'Show modal dialog with panel' and try to close the dialog.
