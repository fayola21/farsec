Add restartResponseAtSignInPage() Method to AuthenticatedWebApplication    I have a situation where I need to be able to get the sign in page class outside the context of the AuthenticatedWebApplication class itself (or a subclass). Basically  I've got a Spring Security framework that's going to register a custom exception mapper (that wraps the default one). If it sees an AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException  it needs to throw a RestartResponseAtInterceptPage(getSignInPage()). Can we add a method that does that? Patch coming...
