AjaxEditableChoiceLabel does not detach choices model    The component org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.AjaxEditableChoiceLabel never detaches its choices list model  thus keeping this model attached indefinitely. It should detach when the component's own detach method is called  like eg. this:@Overridepublic void detachModels() { choices.detach(); super.detachModels();}
