HtmlProblemFinder documentation bug    In the javadoc of HtmlProblemFinder there is an example how to add additional IMarkupFIlters using Application.getAdditionalMarkupHandler()  this method is no longer available in Wicket 1.3  the documentation should be modified to show a valid example. The only way I can find by setting a new MarkupParserFactory which adds the filter.
