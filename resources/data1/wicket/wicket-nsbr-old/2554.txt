WebRequestCodingStrategy assumes that a shared resource URL should always be relative to the Wicket handler    We use an absolute URL for the shared resources and as long as the page is directly under the Servlet context we have no problems  but for pages that have additional paths  then it is converted into a bad relative URL. For Example:/cjs/app/test.page - This page's shared resource URLs are not modified  so http://localhost:8080/crtv/css/cjs-3.3.1B.css is correct/cjs/app/orders/contentbuilder.page - This page's shared resource URLs are all modified causing them to be ../http://localhost:8080/crtv/css/cjs-3.3.1B.css  which is bad; and of course with JavaScript it causes us a lot of problemsI propose a simple fix in method: public final CharSequence encode(final RequestCycle requestCycle  final IRequestTarget requestTarget)Change the following line from:if (!sharedResourceURL &amp;&amp; portletRequest)To:if (url.toString().startsWith('http://') || url.toString().startsWith('https://') || (!sharedResourceURL &amp;&amp; portletRequest))Thanks!
