o.a.wicket.ng.** Resource related classes don't take 'variation' into account    The Resource and ResourceReference related classes in o.a.wicket.ng package don't take into account the 'variation'. Several weeks ago Juergen splitted 'style' and 'variation' in 1.5-SNAPSHOT. It seems Matej have finished the new classes before that split.I'm attaching a patch which includes 'variation' into account.
