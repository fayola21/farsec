'charset=UTF-8' is appended to Content-Type of  DynamicWebResources    After upgrading from wicket 1.2.6 to 1.3.1 we now have a big problem when opening PDF files inside the IE browser window. Instead the PDF file is now loaded as a separate window  leaving the Browser window empty.I traced the problem down wicket always appending ';charset=UTF-8' to the Content-Type  and this can be viewed by using a http debugger:Wicket 1.2.6: Works Content-Type: application/pdf Wicket 1.3.1: PDF opened outside the browser.Content-Type: application/pdf; charset=UTF-8 The ';charset=UTF-8' is appended in ResourceStreamRequestTarget  and I can't see a way to override it. Please make it possible to have the Content-Type as set by the DynamicWebResource
