Add ability to manage disabled items from subclasses of AbstractChoice    AbstractChoice does almost everything but disabled items. This patch adds that ability.This is my first patch to Wicket. I had some question about whether to include a default implementation for isDisabled()  but that would have required a Map to be supplied. Then I started wondering about whether four more ctors should be provided to pass in the map. Then I decided it was better managed by the subclass. It can always be improved later.
