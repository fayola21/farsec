MarkupCache style/variation/locale support broken    We're running into a problem with the change made for this issue: WICKET-1370Basically  if you have a situation like this where the Login page extends DefaultPage and uses &lt;wicket:extend&gt;:Login.htmlDefaultPage.htmlDefaultPage_style1.htmlDefaultPage_style2.htmlThe markup for DefaultPage will always be based on the first style the site is hit with. This is because the location string ('Login.html') hasn't changed with the style change.
