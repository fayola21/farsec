SerializationChecker issue    When the static initialization of the SerializationChecker class fails (one of the methods is not available) it throws a runtime exception which marks the SerializationChecker class as unavailable in the JVM. Using the SerializationChecker class after that to check for SerializationChecker .isAvailable is pointless because it throws the ClassNotFound exception.
