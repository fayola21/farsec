ServletWebRequest.getRelativePathPrefixToContextRoot generates wrong relative path if current page has URL-encoding in the params.    Actually  this is against 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT revision: 554607I have been trying to find a very annoying  seeminly sporadic  glitch where my images that are relative to the context wouldn't 'find' the image file. Looking at the source  they would have 11 sets of '..' versus the 5 sets that the other resources would have. Here is how I was trying to display the image:&lt;img src='images/find.png'/&gt; I was finally able to produce a scenario in a quickstart to prove the problem exists. It seems that getPath() and getServletPath() don't work the same way  in that I mean  getPath() had the '{' encoded as '%7B' whereas getServletPath() was not encoded.Therefore  this test fails and the path is not properly handled! if (servletPath.endsWith(path))
