Wicket 1.3.4 violates servlet standard  Glassfish spews warnings    WicketFilter.java line 194 invokes getLastModified() which invokes 'request.getParameterMap()' on line 962. Later on in that same request  WicketFilter.java line 222 invokes doGet() which invokes response.setCharacterEncoding() on line 376.This is just one case where this problem occurs but I believe others might exist. Whenever Wicket violates the standard Glassfish spews out this warning:PWC4011: Unable to set request character encoding to UTF-8 from context &lt;context-path&gt;  because request parameters have already been read  or ServletRequest.getReader() has already been called... you literally end up with tens of these warnings per request  and supposedly  the wrong behavior  Glassfish's FAQ discusses this in more detail: http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=FaqWebAppUnableToSetRequestCharEncoding
