WicketTester does not bind created Session to SessionStore    The WicketTester constructor  via a call to MockWebApplication.createRequestCycle()  creates a new session but fails to bind it: this.wicketSession = (WebSession) Session.findOrCreate();This means that the session subsequently gets over-written by a new one created in a later call to WicketTester.startPage(). This causes problems for any unit tests which want to set up session data after instantiating a WicketTester  but before calling WicketTester.startPage().The MockWebApplication.createRequestCycle() should probably bind the session immediately after creating it: this.wicketSession = (WebSession) Session.findOrCreate(); getApplication().getSessionStore().bind(getWicketRequest()  wicketSession);Then subsequent calls to startPage() will use this session rather than create a new one.
