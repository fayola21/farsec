ApacheLicenceHeaderTests fail after projects' metadata created by Eclipse    Wicket and all it's accompanying projects when being worked on in Eclipse tend to fail several ApacheLicenceHeaderTest as it is an IDE that creates .settings directory containing several xml projects' metadata files. There are 6 solutions:1. don't use eclipse2. skip tests entirely (-Dmaven.test.skip=true passed on the CLI when invoking maven)3. skip running the tests (-DskipTests)4. compile &amp; run but ignore tests failures (-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true)5. Modify the ApacheLicenceHeaderTests so that the xml files in the .settings directories are ignoredIMHO  having considered all pros and cons  only 5. is a an option. As there already is an Eclipse originating .xml file that gets ignored I hope that you don't mind going this way. The patch to follow shortly.
