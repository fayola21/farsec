Border.resolve() should not attempt to render contents if bodyVisible is false    Border.resolve() should not attempt to render its nested components if setBorderBodyVisible(false) has been called. This way the behavior would be similar to Component.setVisible() - when the contents are not visible  wicket would not raise an exception if there are no corresponding components for the border's markup.
