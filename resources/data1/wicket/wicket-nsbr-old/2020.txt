Callback after detaching the page but before the PageMap lock is released    Currently  it is not possible to perform any checks on a page after the request has been detached. In onEndRequest  the PageMap lock has already been cleared  making it unsafe to access the pages involved in the request. Would it be possible to add an extra callback method (ie. onAfterTargetDetach()) to RequestCycle directly after detaching the request targets? We need such a callback to check (in development mode) if all models are detached correctly.
