Wizard buttons (previous / finish) aren't enabled when they should be    When using the Wizard component in 1.4-SNAPSHOT (sometime after 1.4-RC1)  the previous and finish buttons don't enable when they should. I have found that this is because isEnabledInHierarchy is called multiple times  with the first time being during the POST process  before the wizard step is advanced to the next step. Since the step has not advanced when isEnabled is calculated  you get the following behavior:1 - click 'next' from first step to second - the 'previous' button should be enabled  but it's not2 - the 'finish' button never is enabled  even on the last step
