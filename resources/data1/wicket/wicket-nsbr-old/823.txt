Empty content inserted into Border - throws ugly exceptions    This can be easily reproduced wirth wicket-examples/template/templating using border.Please open: org.apache.wicket.examples.template.border.Page1ant cut ALL the contents inside span  wicket:id='border'It should look like this: &lt;span wicket:id='border'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After this  the page renders nicely.But if you change it to look like this: &lt;span wicket:id='border' /&gt;there are tons of exceptions that do not say anything useful.I have spent 1 full day fighting with this before I found the reason in my little app.
