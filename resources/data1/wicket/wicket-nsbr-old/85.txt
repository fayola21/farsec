FormTester does not set request parameters for unchanged form fields    When using the FormTester  the Form is correctly having its field values  but FormTester does not call setFormComponentValue() for every field. Thus  the request parameters are not set for the next request  when submit() is called.The workaround is to call setValue() for every field.The attached patch fixes the problem for AbstractTextComponent. It also adds a new method getTextComponentValue() as a shortcut to access a field value.
