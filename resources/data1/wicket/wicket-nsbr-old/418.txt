Ajax requests don't detach component models    After ajax request the component models are not detached. Page onDetach should detach those models  but since the page itself is not attached  the onDetach method is not called.It's necessary to always call page.detachModels after request. And we should only call page.detach from the request target. The ajax request target should not page.detach  as the behaviorrequesttarget should do that.
