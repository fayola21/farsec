Typo in IllegalStateException when there are multiple beans of the same type    I have a test where there are multiple beans of the same type  I received the following exceptionCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: more then one bean of type &#91;MyClassName&#93; found  you have to specify the name of the bean (@SpringBean(name='foo')) in order to resolve this conflict. Matched beans: MyClassNamer$$EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB$$f5bd36c9 MyClassNamePlease note how it states 'then' rather than 'than' since the sentence is about multiple things  'than' is the only appropriate word to use.
