AutoCompleteTextField's *scrollable* suggestion list disappeared when a mouse pointing to the scroll bar in IE6/7    if we define the following CCS to fix the height of the suggestion list  the list will become to be scrollable when it is overflow  for example  there are 100 suggestions should be shown.div.wicket-aa { height: 200px; overflow: auto;}if a user moves his mouse to the scroll bar  the suggestion list will disappear immediately in IE6/7 but in FF. The reason is that the onblur event of the text field is triggered in IE but in FF. At the moment the mouse pointing to the scroll bar  Wicket.AutoComplete.mouseactive is 0  therefore  hideAutoComplete() was called. That's why the suggestion list disappeared in IE6/7.
