Overflow when setting Expires header in WebResource    problematic code:response.setDateHeader('Expires'  System.currentTimeMillis() + (getCacheDuration() * 1000));getCacheDuration() * 1000 is an integer operation causing an overflow if getCacheDuration() is set to be &gt; MAX_INT/1000 seconds (approx. 25 days) which is by far less than the w3c recommendation for 'never expires': 'To mark a response as 'never expires ' an origin server sends an Expires date approximately one year from the time the response is sent. HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD NOT send Expires dates more than one year in the future.'http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21changing getCacheDuration() to return long or forcing a long operation fixes the problem:response.setDateHeader('Expires'  System.currentTimeMillis() + getCacheDuration() * 1000L);
