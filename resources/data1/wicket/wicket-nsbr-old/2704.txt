FormComponent.MessageSource.getMessage(String) and getValidatorKeyPrefix()    I tried to use the getValidatorKeyPrefix() feature to have a more suitable translation key for a RequiredTextField and the �_��_� required �_��__ message.But Wicket wasn't able to find my key : the debug log said that it couldn't find my key whereas it is well-formed (getValidatorKeyPrefix() + '.Required').So i debugged the getMessage(String) and I understood the problem. Arround the line 175 (in Wicket 1.4.5) we find :// If not found try a more general form &#91;prefix&#93;.&#91;key&#93;if (Strings.isEmpty(message)){resource = prefix(prefix  key);message = getString(localizer  key  formComponent);}The comment is good  but the code is wrong : the resource variable isn't used in the getString(...) ! (I think it's a kind of bad copy/paste from surrounding code)We should find :message = getString(localizer  resource  formComponent);I did it and it works.
