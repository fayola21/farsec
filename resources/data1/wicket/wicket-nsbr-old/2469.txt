Allow using a different FileItemFactory by extracting a method in MultipartServletWebRequest class    Hi there:In MultipartServletWebRequest constructor we have:...(line 93) DiskFileItemFactory factory = new DiskFileItemFactory();...which inhibits anyone from reusing MultipartServletWebRequest with a different factory. The only solution is generate a new class that is a copy of this one  with that line changed.The suggestion is to extract this code into a protected method  so we could just extend this class when there's a need to use a different factory (as in GAE applications). A diff file is added.Thanks in advance Esteban
