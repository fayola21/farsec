'Invalid procedure call or argument' on AJAX call with IE7    I have a Button that shows a JS alert and then executes an AJAX call.It works fine under Firefox 2  but fails under IE7.. The alert appears  I click 'ok' and then I get the 'Initiating Ajax GET request...' inside 'WICKET AJAX DEBUG'  but it doesn't reach my serverside handler.After clicking 'ok'  in the bottom-left corner of the window appears a javascript error: 'Invalid procedure call or argument'  line 849  code 0.Original discussion: http://www.nabble.com/Button-with-confirmation-with-IE7-td18944137.htmlI'll add a quickstart and a patch in a moment.
