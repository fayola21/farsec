embedded jetty configuration stops working on beta3    When using beta3 with embedded configuration  which means there is no web.xml  but wicket servlet instance is injected in jetty server context. During the startup application generates NPE in (DiskPageStore.java:486) which means that wicket servlet cannot retrieve temp dir... Adding the following line before string the application resolves the question:serverContext.setAttribute('javax.servlet.context.tempdir'  new File('.'));I am not sure if this is just treating effect and not the cause which can be related to recent WicketFilter/WicketServlet 'thread' questions ?Attached simple hello world application reproduce this...
