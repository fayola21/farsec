DatePicker issues with locale medium date format    DateTextField as follows: DateTextField d = new DateTextField(id  model  new StyleDateConverter('M-' false));Case 1: en-US locale for example DatePicker insert 04 rather than Apr in DateTextField  even though pattern clearly says MMMCase 2: pl-PL locale 2010-10-25 is in the DateTextField DatePicker opens on April 2031 rather than October 2010I believe the problem lies in wicket-date.js  in functions substituteDate and parseDate.I know this might be duplicate of WICKET-2427 and WICKET-2375  but apparently this hasn't been properly fixed yet.
