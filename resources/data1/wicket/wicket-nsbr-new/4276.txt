Select component loses it's value    Select component loses selected option and shows the first option in some situations (one example is when you try to submit a form  but there are validation errors).It was working fine in 1.4.18  but it's broken in 1.4.19.This must be caused by the solution from this issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-3962I think the problem is likely in Select.isSelected method  where String[] paths = getInputAsArray() is actually an array of uuid-s  so uuid-s are compared to paths.I haven't tested wicket 1.5  but this problem may also affect 1.5 versions.
