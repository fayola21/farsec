AutoComplete should not request suggestions if input is no longer active element    If an ajax change event handler disables and re-renders an AutoCompleteTextField  a pending ajax request for suggestions will trigger a ListenerInvocationNotAllowedExecption. This leads to a log warning 'behavior not enabled; ignore call' but the redirect to the AccessDeniedPage is ignored by wicket-autocomplete.js.
