WebPageRenderer should honor RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT more consistently    In WebPageRenderer shouldPreserveClientUrl() currently has precedence over RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT.This can lead to confusion or unexpected behavior when RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT is explicitely set  but for some reason shouldPreserveClientUrl() returns true and thus no redirect is performed due to the logic in WebPageRenderer.A fix for this particular problem could be implemented in WebPageRenderer as of Wicket 6.12.0 by changing line 211 to: (shouldPreserveClientUrl &amp;&amp; getRedirectPolicy() != RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT)) //Note that this problem is slightly related to WICKET-5484. Both fixes combined the line could look like this: (shouldPreserveClientUrl &amp;&amp; !isAjax &amp;&amp; getRedirectPolicy() != RedirectPolicy.ALWAYS_REDIRECT)) //
