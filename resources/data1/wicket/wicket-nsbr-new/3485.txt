Link tries to construct the URL when the link is disabled    This piece of code (Link.onComponentTag) tries to construct the URL for a Link  even when it is disabled: CharSequence url = getURL(); url = appendAnchor(tag  url); if (!isLinkEnabled()) disableLink(tag); else { use url }getURL fails for us  because we did not expect it to be called for a disabled link. The constructed url is never used. Can the getURL and appendAnchor be moved inside the else?
