Let AbstractResourceStreamWriter implement empty getContentType()    AbstractResourceStreamWriter's javadoc says it already:'Base implementation of an IResourceStreamWriter so that you only have to override the write() method'Actually I have to override getContentType() too  which is most of the time superfluous when the request target knows the resource's name and the type can be identified automatically .Please add an empty implementation to AbstractResourceStreamWriter.Thanks
