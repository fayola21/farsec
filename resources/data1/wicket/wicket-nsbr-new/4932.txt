Mounted page is not throwing ExpireException with setting setRecreateMountedPagesAfterExpiry(false)    We have a page that is both bookmarkable (and accessible with certain page parameters) and has a second constructor taking an object. When ever the session time-out we want to show a session expired page. But we get a exception because Wicket is trying to rebuild the page with no page parameters. We have set the setting getPageSettings().setRecreateMountedPagesAfterExpiry(false); This works when clicking on (ajax)links  but it's not working when using the back/forward button in the browser (or javascript:history.go(-1)).I'll attache a quickstart.
