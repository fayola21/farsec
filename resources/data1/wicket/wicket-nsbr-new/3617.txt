Using render strategy ONE_PASS_RENDER fails for Ajax requests    I have an application which has two pages. Page A has an AjaxLink which makes some checks and either sets some error feedback and stays on the same page (e.g. login page with 'Invalid user' error) or if everything is OK then redirects to page B (via setResponsePage(B.class)).The problem comes when the current render strategy is ONE_PASS_RENDER. In this case no matter that fromUrl and toUrl are different and the request is Ajax the current code directly writes the page markup to the response.I think it should trigger a redirect instead.I am not sure whether it should be redirect to render or to buffer ...
