Allow for dynamic prefix and suffixes in CheckBoxMultipleChoice    Currently  CheckBoxMultipleChoice has support for a prefix and a suffix to be defined for each choice being rendered. However  there is no way to change them based on the item being rendered. A possible use case is in case some data needs to be used in either the suffix or prefix for Ajax or other javascript related use.Please consider adding getPrefix(int index  T choice)  and getSuffix(int index  T choice) methods to this component and using them instead of getPrefix() and getSuffix() within the onComponentTagBody method.
