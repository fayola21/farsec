Encoding problem with POSTing a form with Ajax    The form is always posted using Ajax in UTF-8  but if you're using a different encoding in the DB or the HTML aswell  the string is ugly obviously. Wicket should convert from UTF-8 to the given encoding (detecting from getMarkupSettings().setDefaultMarkupEncoding('...'); or getRequestCycleSettings().setResponseRequestEncoding('...'); or an other settings parameter which could be given to wicket)I'm attaching a quickstart project which demonstrate this issue by echoing back the string given to a textarea.
