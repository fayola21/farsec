Use a behavior that modifies AbstractLink's markup when disabled    Currently Wicket transforms &lt;a&gt; tag to &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; when a link is disabled.Recently Wicket-Bootstrap user filed issue https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap/issues/79 that this breaks the UI because Twitter Bootstrap needs just 'disabled='disabled'' attribute in &lt;a&gt;.With the new strategy it will be possible to set global strategy and override it per link.
