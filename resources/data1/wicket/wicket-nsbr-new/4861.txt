Making MultiFileUploadField use HTML5 multiple attr & remove confusing fakepath    WICKET-3370 prepared the terrain (all major browsers except IE already support it).I will make a Git pull request for getting this into the master branch.Here is what the changes do (commit comment):Added the possibility to select multiple files in the OS dialog forbrowsers that support HTML5 'multiple' attribute. For browsers that donot support it  or if you do not set the boolean to true  it will behavethe same as before.New: easier select multiple files from multiple folders shows the multiple files after choosing them - one per lineFixes: the delete buttons are aligned instead of positioning after thevariable length file names useless and confusing 'C:/fakepath' in filenames reported by somebrowsers (in multiple with single select mode) are now hidden.
