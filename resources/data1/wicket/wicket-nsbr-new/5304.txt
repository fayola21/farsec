AbstractResource should check for error code first before for modifications    Since org.apache.wicket.request.resource.AbstractResource#setResponseHeaders() gives a chance to the application to set custom headers it should first check for error and status codes set and then check for modifications (Not Modified).Because now one needs to reset the modification time of the resource if she wants to set error or status code.
