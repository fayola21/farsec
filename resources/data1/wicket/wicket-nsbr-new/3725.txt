wickettag contents aren't skipped when trying to find markup in 1.5    The attached quick start  fails to render the components inside the fragment  because it will pick the &lt;span wicket:id='text'&gt; instead of the fragment as markup.I believe the id are only required to be unique 'per level'  so this should work and it should properly find the &lt;wicket:fragment wicket:id='text'&gt;. This also worked fine in 1.4
