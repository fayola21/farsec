DataTable toolbars do not handle dynamically changing columns in the table    All the packaged toolbars for the DataTables fail to handle dynamically changing column in the table.HeadersToolbar - is new columns are added  they do not have headers. If columns are removed  the headers are not removed.NoRecordsToolbar - colspan is static to the number of columns when the table was created. If more columns are added  or if columns are removed  then the incorrect colspan is used.NavigationToolbar - incorrect static colspan  like NoRecordsToolbar.FilterToolbar - same problem as HeadersToolbar  just s/header/filter/
