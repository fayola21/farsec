Make it easier to produce a page with links with absolute urls    We needed to create a page which links have absolute urls (protocol  host  port included). So I created a simple extension of MountedMapper that makes the relative url returned by super.mapHandler() to an absolute one.So far so far but later Wicket uses org.apache.wicket.request.UrlRenderer#shouldRenderAsFull() to decide whether to actually render the url as full (i.e. as absolute) and since the protocol  the host and the port matches with the current request's url attributes it decides to render the url as relative.Since Url class is final it is not possible to create a custom AbsoluteUrl which #toString() delegates to #toString(StringMode.FULL).I see two solutions:1) provide AbsoluteUrl class which is again final and uses StringMode.FULL2) add a boolean flag to Url that is used by UrlRenderer#shouldRenderAsFull() so I can force full modeDo you have other solutions ?
