MockHttpServletResponse.addCookie(Cookie) adds duplicate cookies    org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.mock.MockHttpServletResponse.addCookie(Cookie) makes a bad check whether the cookie to be added is already in the list of cookies.Since javax.servlet.http.Cookie doesn't implement #equals() 'cookies.remove(cookie)' wont remove the previous cookie because the identity is different.According to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt  p.4.3.3 : If a user agent receives a Set-Cookie response header whose NAME is the same as a pre-existing cookie  and whose Domain and Path attribute values exactly (string) match those of a pre-existing cookie  the new cookie supersedes the old. However  if the Set- Cookie has a value for Max-Age of zero  the (old and new) cookie is discarded. Otherwise cookies accumulate until they expire (resources permitting)  at which time they are discarded.I.e. the equality is on the name  path and domain.
