Quality of ThumbnailImageResource    The control over the quality of generated thumbnails has been lost after modifications proposed in WICKET-2450 (the performance has been greatly improved though). That article http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/04/03/perils-of-image-getscaledinstance.html proposes multi-step approach when downscaling images. It produces much better visual results with no dramatic performance loss. Can we use that code? It also would be nice to have image rendering hints configurable as they were before.
