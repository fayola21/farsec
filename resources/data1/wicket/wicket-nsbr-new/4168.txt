Error page resource relative urls are wrong    The wicket page exposed as 404 error page has wrong links to resources. The sample project is attached.Run the project with 'mvn jetty:run' and go to url 'http://localhost:8080/bug/404' - it's mapped wicket page  works perfect. But if you type any wrong url such as 'http://localhost:8080/bug/aaaaaa' the page doesn't have styles and images.
