Make AbstractMapper.getPlaceholder and similar methods as public methods    Playing with mappers and Scala I found that because of Scala's limitation  there's no way to call protected static methods even from subclasses.Thinking about Wicket-Scala interoperability  I think that these methods could be changed to public or to non-static methods.There's no gain nor design reason to leave these methods as protected static  IMO.
