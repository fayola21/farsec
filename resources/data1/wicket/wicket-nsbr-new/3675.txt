Usage of JavaScriptCompressor by resources other than PackageTextTemplates is lost!    With the refactoring of ResourceReferences  Resources and ResourceStreams it seems that the JavaScriptCompressor is no longer used for resources other than a PackageTextTemplate. In Wicket 1.4 it used to be in JavascriptPackageResource but seeing as this class is gone the JavaScriptCompressor is no longer used.There should be either a subclass of PackageResource which uses the JavaScriptCompressor or a way to intercept the length and the bytes which are written to the stream in PackageResource line 327.
