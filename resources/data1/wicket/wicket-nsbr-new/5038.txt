Add equals() and hashcode() implementation to INamedParameters.NamedPair    It would be handy to have an equals() and hascode() implementation based on key and value  so that it is possible to do things likepageParameters.getAllNamed().contains(myNamedPair)In case you are interested:My current use case is that the page should check whether it is actually called with the pageparameters needed (i.e. using the unique  canonical URL)  however ignoring some special params.
