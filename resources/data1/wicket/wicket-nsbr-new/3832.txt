RequestLogger doesn't log incoming event and outgoing page    The requestlogger currently doesn't log the incoming request and the outgoing page  which it did in 1.4.x (and earlier). This is due togetRequestLogger().logEventTarget(handler);getRequestLogger().logResponseTarget(handler);not being called. This results in log entries like:&#91;2011-06-22 11:43:20 836&#93; &#91;TP-Processor6&#93; RequestLogger | time=12 event=null response=null sessioninfo=...which isn't saying much  and making every presentation I gave on the RequestLogger  and chapter 14 from WiA look foolish
