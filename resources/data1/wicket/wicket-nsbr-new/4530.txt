Final methods on ResourceNameIterator prevent full customization of IResourceStreamLocator    IResourceStreamLocator contains the method newResourceNameIterator(...) which builds a ResourceNameIterator. Unfortunately ResourceNameIterator declares several getter methods (getLocale()  getStyle()  getVariation()  getExtension()) as final and thus ties the public API to the internal implementation of ResourceNameIterator. Therefore it's not possible to fully customize the behavior of ResourceNameIterator by subclassing.
