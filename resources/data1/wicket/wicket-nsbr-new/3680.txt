Make Objects.convertValue() generic    o.a.w.util.lang.Objects.convertValue(Object  Class) should use generics similar how it was changed for IConverter.convertToObject().The bad news is that this change is changing the semantics of the function because currently it is sometimes returning the input object (if the conversion was not possible). The good news is that this modification only impacts a small part of wicket.
