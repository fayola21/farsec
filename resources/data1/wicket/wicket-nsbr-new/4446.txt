processScript in Wicket.Head.Contributor doesn't remove CDATA - eval fails in IE    There's incosistency between org.apache.wicket.util.string.JavaScriptUtils and wicket-ajax.jsEven though the source is marked with comment Script open tag. If this tag is changed  also update Wicket.Head.Contributor.processScript() function from wicket-ajax.jsIn JavaScriptUtils there are:public final static String SCRIPT_CONTENT_PREFIX = '/n/&lt;![CDATA[//n';public final static String SCRIPT_CONTENT_SUFFIX = '/n/]]&gt;//n';in wicket-ajax.js (line 1742 in 1.5.5 version) there are:// get rid of prefix and suffix  they are not eval-d correctlytext = text.replace(/^&lt;Unable to render embedded object: File (--//&#42;--&gt;&lt;) not found.[CDATA[//&#42;&gt;&lt;!--&#42;///  '');text = text.replace(///&#42;--&gt;]]&gt;&#42;//$/  '');As you can see the sequences in java and javascript DO NOT MATCH! There are missing new lines in JS and there are extra HTML comments &lt;!-- --&gt; that aren't added by the Java code.The result is  that these extra lines aren't removed and IE fails to eval such a javascript. I could fix this issue by editing the wicket-ajax.js like this:text = text.replace(/^/n//&#42;&lt;![CDATA[&#42;///n/  '');text = text.replace(//n//&#42;]]&gt;&#42;///n$/  '');But we need it fixed officially  because we use gradle for Wicket dependency.
