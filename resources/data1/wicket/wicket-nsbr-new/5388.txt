Allow DebugBar contributors to be removed    Please add a way to unregister DebugBar contributors.I wish to remove some of the default contributors and currently have to do this by using reflection to lookup the 'CONTRIBS_META_KEY' field.The reason why I'm removing contributors (perhaps there's a better solution?): PageSizeDebugPanel tries to serialize the whole page during page rendering  while models are still attached. This causes most of our database-backed models to complain that they're being serialized without being detached (as this usually means somebody probably forgot to call detach() somewhere). InspectorDebugPanel - InspectorPage currently shows me a blank component tree because it doesn't have @RequireHttps as all our other pages do and thus redirects to an http:// URL and can't see the session. So we copied InspectorPage (since it's final and can't be subclassed) to add @RequireHttps and likewise copied InspectorDebugPanel.
