Resource filtering breaks the calculation of rendered resources    The calculation of rendered resources at org.apache.wicket.markup.head.internal.HeaderResponse#rendered field is broken when org.apache.wicket.markup.head.filter.FilteringHeaderResponse is in use.The problem is that org.apache.wicket.markup.head.filter.FilteringHeaderResponse#getContent(String) creates its own instance of HeaderResponse and thus has its own 'rendered' set.If a filtered resource depends on a resource which is rendered in the head (i.e. in the default filtered bucked named 'headerBucket') then the latter is also rendered in the custom filter.
