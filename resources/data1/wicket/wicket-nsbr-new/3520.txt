SHOW_NO_EXCEPTION_PAGE responding with HTTP status 500 is overwritten by redirect    If the application is configured with SHOW_NO_EXCEPTION_PAGE as unexpectedExceptionDisplay  an exception thrown while submitting a form should result in an HTTP 500 status.Since the request is already marked as a redirect in AbstractListenerInterfaceRequestTarget#onProcessEvents()  the 500 status is overwritten with status 200 when the redirect is handled afterwards.
