Unable to override final method isLinkEnable of class AbstractLink    I have a form for which I need to disable all form components in certain situations.For this I am using form.setEnabled(false)  which works nicely for all input elements.However the form also contains a number of links (next to some fields)  which need to stay enabled.In the code of the onComponentTag method of the Link class I see the isLinkEnabled method is called to check if the link should be rendered enabled/disabled.In my Link subclass of I need to override isLinkEnabled to force the link being enabled even if the parent form is not.
