AjaxIndicatorAppender removes itself immediately when added via ajax    When addding/replacing IndicatingAjaxLink's using ajax in Wicket 1.5.0 it's indicator markup is directly removed when parsing the ajax response. The AjaxIndicatorAppender renders a bit of javascript to the response (when it is an ajax request) to remove previous indicators from the dom (see issue WICKET-722) but in 1.5.0 the execution order of the javascript is different  causing the indicator markup to be added first and the javascript to remove previous versions of the indicator to be run next and thus removing the newly added indicator.De ajax debug windows shows that the component is replaced first and then the javascript is run. In 1.4.18 ajax logging shows the javascript run first and then the component gets replaced  resulting in correct behavior.
