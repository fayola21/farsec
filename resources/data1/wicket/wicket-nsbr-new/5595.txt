Atmosphere: updates infinitly with long polling transport    I found a problem when I use long polling for the transport :When the EventBus loop to the list of AtmosphereResource (on post method) and if the update is too long of each AtmosphereResource  the list of AtmosphereResource is update and reorder (because atmosphere remove and registry the AtmosphereResource due to long polling) and then the loop on EventBus never stop and update is infinitie.To solve the probleme I do that on line 366 of EventBus.java :for (AtmosphereResource resource : ImmutableList.copyOf(broadcaster.getAtmosphereResources()))rather thanfor (AtmosphereResource resource : broadcaster.getAtmosphereResources())Best regards
