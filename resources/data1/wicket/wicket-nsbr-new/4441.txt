PageProvider should create a new Page instance if PageParameters are changed  even if a stored page exists.    The 'getStoredPage(int)' method returns a stored page instance even if user changes parameter values encoded into URL  and the PageParameters object of the stored page instance is never changed. So same page is displayed always though user changes url on browser manually.   HOW TO REPRODUCT **  1. unpack the attached sample project 'pagebug.tar.gz'.2. mvn jetty:run3. access to http://localhost:8080/user/user1You will see a form filled with information about user 1. The user's name is 'user 1'  age is 30 and country is 'Japan'.The mount path of this page is '/user/${userId}'. so 'user1' in the accessed url is a parameter value.after accessing to the url  the url will be changed to http://localhost:8080/user/user1?0 . it contains the page id of the currently displayed page.4. change some values and submit the form. page id will be changed on every submit.5. change only parameter value in url to 'user2'. Never change page-id.for example  if you now access to http://localhost:8080/user/user1?5  change the url to http://localhost:8080/user/user2?5 .6. This program must display information about user2  because the parameter value of url is changed. But you will see the information of user 1. Wicket always display the page of page-id = 5 (even though user changed url manually).In this sample program  I use LoadableDetachableModel for retrieving current parameter-value. But I don't get the new parameter-value because pageParameters object in a page instance is never changed after the construction. pageParameters is fixed in the constructor of Page class.I think that there are no easy way to retrieve parameter-values encoded into mount-path. Request.getRequestParameters() does not contain parameters encoded into mount-path. So there are no work-around for this issue.   HOW TO FIX THIS ISSUE **  We must return null from getStoredPage(int) method of PageProvider class  if current PageParameters is not same with the PageParameters of a stored page. In current code  getStoredPage(int) checks only if the class of both pages are same. We must check the PageParameters of both pages.   PATCH **  I attached a pache for PageProvider class. try it.
