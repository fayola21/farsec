Nested Redirects and REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER    When the render strategy is REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER  redirects cannot be nested. After the second redirect  Wicket renders the buffered first page in preference to the second page. The relevant code is in WebPageRenderer.respond: if (bufferedResponse != null) { logger.warn('The Buffered response should be handled by BufferedResponseRequestHandler'); // if there is saved response for this URL render it bufferedResponse.writeTo((WebResponse)requestCycle.getResponse()); }The attached quickstart demonstrates the issue. Simply navigate to the home page. The observed behavior is that Page1 is displayed  but I expect Page2 to be displayed.I can work around the issue by calling WebApplication.getAndRemoveBufferedResponse() to clear the render buffer  but I am uneasy with this solution since it seems like I am playing with Wicket internals; albeit the function is public.
