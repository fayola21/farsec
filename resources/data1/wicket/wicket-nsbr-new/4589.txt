Closing  tag is incorrectly setup as autocomponent    The closing instance of the &lt;wicket:container&gt; tag returns true when isAutoComponentTag() is called whereas the opening instance correctly returns false.The problem lies probably in the WicketTagIdentifier class which simply checks if there is a wicket:id attribute value and makes all tags (opening or closing) autocomponent tags if there is no wicket:id.Obviously any closing tag doesnt have a wicket:id assigned.
