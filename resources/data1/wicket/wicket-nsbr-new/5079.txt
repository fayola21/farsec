Allow WebApplication-specific Spring configuration    SpringWebApplicationFactory allows two places to defined a WebApplication: in the global root application context loaded by Spring's ContextLoaderListener in a filter-specific additional web applcation context.SpringComponentInjector is not aware of this additional context but just uses the global one. This imposes the following restrictions: the filter-specific context cannot define any beans to be used by SpringComponentInjector SpringComponentInjector cannot work without a global root application  i.e.ContextLoaderListener is required.Starting with Wicket 6.7.0 the filter-specific context is made accessible to SpringComponentInjector. If no application context is given explicitly to SpringComponentInjector's constructor  by default the injector uses the application context used to create the WebApplication.Benefits: no need to define ContextLoaderListener in web.xml (i.e. less xml) use application-specific beans defined in the filter-specific application context
