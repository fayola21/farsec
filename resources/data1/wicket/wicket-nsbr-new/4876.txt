CheckBoxMultipleChoice should implement getAdditionalAttributes as RadioChoice    Today there is no way to add additional attributes to each checkbox in CheckBoxMultipleChoice  the only way is to override the entire appendOptionHtml and copy the entire original source code and in that add your additional attribute. A much better way is to have Wicket provide a extension hook like org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.RadioChoice.getAdditionalAttributes(int  T).
