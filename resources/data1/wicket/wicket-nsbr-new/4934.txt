DownloadLink uses wrong encoding for spaces/non-ASCII characters    When downloading a file with spaces and non-ASCII characters in the filename using DownloadLink  all browsers I tested show a wrong filename in the file download dialog. For a file named Test '�_�__'.txt  I got the following output from different browsers:IE: Test+'�_�__'.txtFF: Test+%27%C3%A4%27.txtChrome: Test+%27�_�__%27.txtI have attached a patch that fixes the issue for me. The problem is thata) the used URL encoding is wrong. PATH encoding  not QUERY encoding is requiredb) only IE needs the filename to be encoded  other browsers seem to work with the original nameSee e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/93551/how-to-encode-the-filename-parameter-of-content-disposition-header-in-http for a discussion of the underlying issue.Note: I do not believe the attached patch is the optimal fix for this issue. I would prefer removing the encoding handling from DownloadLink and putting it into AbstractResource.setResponseHeaders()  so other components using attachments benefit  too.
