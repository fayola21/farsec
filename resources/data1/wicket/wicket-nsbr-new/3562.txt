onInitialize() is not called before StatelessForm.onSubmit()    I have a StatelessForm that has initialization code in onInitialize(). When my form is submitted  the onSubmit() method is invoked before onInitialize() is called. This results in a NullPointerException since the form has not yet had a chance to initialize its instance variables.I expect that onInitialize() will be called before any listener method is invoked.I believe this bug is due to the change in Page.onInitialize() introduced in r1085649.Quickstart attached.
