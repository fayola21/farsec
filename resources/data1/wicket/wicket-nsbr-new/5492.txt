WebApplication ignores a SecurityException when reading the configuration type    The WebApplication class has a piece of code in the method getConfigurationType()  that ignores a SecurityException.Code snippet: try { result = System.getProperty('wicket.' + Application.CONFIGURATION); } catch (SecurityException e) { // Ignore - we're not allowed to read system properties. }This apparently causes a performance problem at one of our customers  where they had shared classloading enabled. Permissions were set differently on shared classloader level  which caused the retrieval of the property to fail silently  while taking about 10ms longer. This code is called everytime Component.getMarkupId is called  which means with 300+ components on a page  you get a delay of 3 seconds or more.Ofcourse the problem can be (and has been) solved with a correct configuration. My request however is that the exception is atleast logged at some level (warning for example)  so spotting the problem will become a lot easier (it took us 2 weeks to narrow it down).
