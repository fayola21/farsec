Wicket-Atmosphere track message length    When activating a PerRequestBroadcastFilter  the methods annotated with @Subscribe are unable to contribute to the AjaxRequestTarget.At the Filter level  the messages are OK but the client receives an empty &lt;ajax-response&gt;.A quickstart is attached where target/WEB-INF/lib is provided because jquery.atmosphere.js has been modified in order to activate track message length.Feel free to ask for more info.Regards Pierre Goupil
