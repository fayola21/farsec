Page parameters not working with CryptoMapper    When CryptoMapper is used  page parameters do not work. This is because the incorrect request is set in the request cycle. The incorrect request contains the encrypted url  where the page parameters are encoded into the url segments. When the CryptoMapper maps a url to a request handler  it should set the request to the correct request when the request handler is selected.This was reported on the users@ list  but I have also fallen victim to it when getting urlFor(resourceReference  pageParameters) and the pageParameters not comming out on the other end.See:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/wicket-users/201211.mbox/%3C50991F74.3050605@unknown.za.net%3Ehttps://github.com/jesselong/wicket/commits/for-apache-master-pr-4 (3 commits)
