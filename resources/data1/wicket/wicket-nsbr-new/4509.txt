Spaces in path cause ModifcationWatcher to fail    The ModificationWatcher isn't able to reload resource files if there's a space in the path.The problem is that Files#getLocalFileFromUrl(String) receives an URL encoded String in which spaces are encoded to %20. They are never decoded and passed to File(). The fix is not to use the external representation of an URL but the file representation.
