Ajax indicator not working when display is set to none in css    I created a simple quickstart with one AjaxLink and one div used as ajax indicator (id ajax_indicator). When I set display: none to ajax_indicator in css  is does not show up when pressing link. When I remove display:none from css  it disappears after when ajax request is finished and works fine for next ajax requests.
