Encoding problem with JavaScriptRefrences    Let we have a javascript which contains some strings (which eventually should be appended to DOM)  and let we have a page in different encoding from UTF-8  like ISO-8859-2. The anomaly is the following: If the encoding of the JS is UTF-8  then the Ajax query which injects the JS is working OK. The injected string looks like it should be  no magic chars. But if we don't use the JS from Ajax  but plain request  then the string is ugly because JS is in UTF-8  but the page is in ISO-8859-2. If the encoding of the JS is the same as the Page then the response of the Ajax request will be ugly  but the plain non-ajax will be OK.
