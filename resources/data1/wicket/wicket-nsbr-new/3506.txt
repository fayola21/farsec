ResourceMapper doesn't work: mapHandler() always returns null    ResourceMapper#mapHandler uses the following code test whether a particular ResourceReferenceRequestHandler should be mapped:// see if request handler addresses the resource we serveif (resourceReference.getResource().equals(handler.getResource()) == false){ return null;}Unfortunately this if statement always evaluates to true and thus null is returned.The problem is that IResource implementations do not provide an equals() method. In practice this means that the default Object#equals() implementation is used  which nearly always results in false for the equality test.I see two possible solutions:1. Implement equals() for all IResource classes.2. Compare the ResourceReference objects instead  which already have a meaningful equals() implementation. In other words:// see if request handler addresses the resource we serveif (resourceReference.equals(handler.getResourceReference()) == false){ return null;}I'm attaching a quickstart that illustrates this bug.
