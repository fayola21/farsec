HttpsMapper and BookmarkablePageLink    There is a wicket Application which is configured to use HttpsMapper. There are two page: TestPage and TestPage2. TestPage uses @RequireHttps  TestPage2 doesn't. Each page contains a BookmarkablePageLink to the other one. However in this configuration (one with @RequireHttps and one without) the links on the pages are pointing to the page they are added to - the link in TestPage links to TestPage itself (and not to TestPage2) and vice versa. When both of the pages use @RequireHttps or not using it at all the links work normally.
