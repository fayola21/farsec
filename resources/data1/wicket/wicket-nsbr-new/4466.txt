Use an external host for the static javascript files (specially JQuery)    There should be some (easy) way to specify an external URL (for example  on a CDN) for the JQuery script.IJavaScriptLibrarySettings.setJQueryReference() takes only a ResourceReference as a parameter  that must point to an application resource. One could create an IResource that redirects to the CDN  but that would require an additional request anyway.That support should exist also for wicket-ajax.js and wicket-event.js  but it is less of an issue  since they are tied to the Wicket version anyway (JQuery is hosted for free in a number of CDNs  so using them is very compelling).If there is some workaround  it should be documented in the wiki.
