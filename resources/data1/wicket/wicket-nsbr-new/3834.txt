WicketTester does not follow absolute redirects    Wicket tester does not follow absolute redirects:This is a problem when using HttpsMapper. For example when requesting a page over http:// with an forced redirect to https:// for secure access will make wicket tester return 'null' for the last renderer page instead of the rendered page instance. In general all kinds of absolute redirects to another page will not be tracked by wicket tester. So this potentially a problem for all kinds of tests that rely on absolute redirects.
