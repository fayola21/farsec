IResourceCachingStrategy is too much bound to PackageResource  make it more general    Somebody recently complained on the wicket userlist that IResourceCachingStrategy is not very versatile but only useable for PackageResources. I 100% agree would like to generalize the caching part by introducing the interface 'ICacheableResourceReference' (instead of referring to PackageResource). This makes it easy to use caching for other resource types. Since we are so close to 1.5 I would like to ask first if the patch is acceptable by you.
