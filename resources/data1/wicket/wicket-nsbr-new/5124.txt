Improve ResourceReference#getDependencies() API    currently the signature ispublic Iterable&lt;? extends HeaderItem&gt; getDependencies()which is awkward to use.suppose i want a javascript reference that should include a css reference as a dependency  i cannot simply add it to iterable like this:new ResourceReference(Some.class  'some.js') { Iterable getDependencies() { Iterable supers=super.getDependencies(); // supers.add(CSS); &lt;=== cannot do this  instead List list=new ArrayList(); for (reference:supers) { list.add(reference); } // now i can finally add mine list.add(CSS); return list; }}instead change Iterable to a List that is backed by a mutable one. this should make extending much easier. if List is too 'open' create Appendable { append(); } backed by a list and use that.
