HttpsMapper triggers rendering of incorrect absolute callback url for Link    This problem only occurs when HttpsMapper is installed as the root request mapper. Additionally  it only seems to occur when the web context is not root.I mount a simple page so that it is available as http://localhost:8080/myproject/pagetest. That page has one Link (the onclick doesn't do anything). If I access that exact url and show source I see the link callback is rendered incorrectly. It should have the web context mentioned. The fact that Wicket generates an absolute url makes me think the HttpsMapper.mapHandler is touching it in such a way to trigger an absolute url  when the delegate was returning a url expecting it to be relative.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a wicket:id='test' href='http://localhost:8080/wicket/page?1-1.ILinkListener-test'&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
