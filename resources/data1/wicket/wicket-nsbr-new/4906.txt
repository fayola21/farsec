Form#visitFormComponents can cause ClassCastException    The current method signature of Form#visitComponents allows for passing in an implementation of IVisitor that will cause a ClassCastException. ExampleAdd a CheckBox and TextField to the Form. Pass in an IVisitor&lt;CheckBox&gt; to visitComponents. There will be a ClassCastException when the IVisitor&lt;CheckBox&gt; attempts to visit the TextField.The method signature should be changed topublic final &lt;R&gt; R visitFormComponents(final IVisitor&lt;FormComponent&lt;?&gt;  R&gt; visitor)or the method should be removed to prevent confusion.
