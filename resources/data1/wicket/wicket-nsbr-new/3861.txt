AbstractTransformerBehavior sets wrong namespace    AbstractTransformerBehaviour adds a wicket namespace (http://wicket.apache.org) to its tag which is different from that of the whole page (http://wicket.apache.org/dtds.data/wicket-xhtml1.4-strict.dtd).This causes (at least) XPath queries for Wicket nodes to fail when matching the contents of components with an AbstractTransformerBehavior.
