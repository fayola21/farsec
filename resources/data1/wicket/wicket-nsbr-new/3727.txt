MultiFileUploadField internationalisation does not work    We are having an issue setting some properties to override the default text for the MultiFileUploadField component. As per the docs  we have set the following in our local properties file:org.apache.wicket.mfu.caption.unlimited=Ficheros:org.apache.wicket.mfu.caption.limited=Ficheros (m/u00E1ximo ${max}): org.apache.wicket.mfu.delete=Borrarhowever they are not being overridden. We know our properties file is working because we can override other properties  like:workphone.PhoneNumberValidator = N/u00FAmero de tel/u00E9fono no v/u00E1lidoand those come up correctly.I have reproduced this in a quickstart.
