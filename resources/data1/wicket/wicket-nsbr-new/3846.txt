in environments without reliable timestamps (e.g. some clusters) resource caching is useless    As mentioned already in the wicket userlist iirc wicket's default resource caching strategy using resource file timestamps will not work in some cluster environments. Cluster deployers seem to be quite dumb and not preserve the 'lastModified' file attribute. So depending on the server instance the resource is delivered from it will contain multiple timestamps for the same resource. Apparently timestamps seem to be unsuitable for the purpose of caching in that environment.
