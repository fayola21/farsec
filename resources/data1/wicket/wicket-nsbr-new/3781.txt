Differentiate Google Chrome from Safari in wicket-xyz.js    Currently Google Chrome is treated as Safari in wicket-ajax.js and wicket-event.js.This causes Wicket.replaceOuterHtmlSafari() to be used while Chrome supports Range and ContextualFragment like Gecko browsers.The special code in replaceOuterHtmlSafari() is for older versions of Safari but it is hard to test  so improvements in this area for Safari 5 will be done when Wicket Ajax starts use some JS library.This change is a bit risky because until now Chrome was treated as Safari and we all tested this behavior but I tested all Ajax examples in wicket-examples and my application and everything seems to be OK.
