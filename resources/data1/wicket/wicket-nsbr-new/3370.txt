Extend multiple file handling to IMultipartWebRequest    HTML 5 allows a new attribute with file input tags called 'multiple ' which lets the user choose multiple files to upload. It works for me in Safari 4 and Firefox 3.6. It probably works in Chrome and probably doesn't work in IE (like everything else).So I set about creating a MultiFileUploadField that uses a List&lt;FileUpload&gt; as its model. Unfortunately it looks like while MultipartServletWebRequestImpl does a fine job of parsing out each file in the multi-file upload  the IMultipartWebRequest interface isn't up to the task: it assumes that each field only has one file.I think that it would be straightforward to make IMultipartWebRequest map field names to List&lt;FileItem&gt; instead of just FileItem. The existing FileUpload field (and indeed any other user of this interface) could just use the first FileItem in the list  or the last  if it really wanted to reproduce the existing behavior exactly (in which each new file for some field 'f' overwrites the previous one in the map  leaving the last).Alternately there could be a couple of new methods:public Map&lt;String  List&lt;FileItem&gt;&gt; getFileLists();public List&lt;FileItem&gt; getFileList(final String fieldName);with the other two methods retaining the old behavior.
