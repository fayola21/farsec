AjaxButton #onSubmit() #onError() intricacies    Overriding AjaxButton's hook #onSubmit() is prone to possible programming errors: with JavaScript enabled  #onSubmit() will not be called  leaving the developer without clue that the wrong method was overwritten with JavaScript disabled  #onSubmit(ART  Form) will not be called - furthermore if the markup includes type='submit' or no type attribute  #onSubmit() will be called instead.#onError() and #onError(ART  Form) have identical intricacies.To make things consistent I propose the following change for Wicket 7.x: declare #onSubmit() and #onError() final on AjaxButton in #onComponentTag() make sure the &lt;button&gt;-Tag has type='button'  so the browser does not submit the form when JavaScript is disabled. For fallack support we have AjaxFallbackButton already.Any objections or better ideas?
