It is impossible to determine the form submitting component's inputName when AjaxFormSubmitBehavior is used    It is impossible to determine inputName in Form.delegateSubmit method (was working in version 1.4)as per Martin's comment from this thread: http://markmail.org/message/eiji4elt4mitf2m5I see a way to simplify this code so it will be possible to do what youneed:1) AjaxFormSubmitBehavior should implement IFormSubmitter2) onEvent() should do: getForm().getRootForm().onFormSubmitted(this)then you can cast to AbstractAjaxBehavior and call getComponent() and thencast to IFormSubmittingComponent to get the input nameI'm not sure whether clirr-maven-plugin will allow this change in 6.x thoughPlease file a ticket and I'll take a look in the next days.
