Using setResponsePage() before page rendering should skip the rendering of the page    This ticket follows from the email thread http://markmail.org/thread/uk5y4ddoopntmkgdWhen setResponsePage() is used  the current page is still rendered. The response thus generated is then thrown away completely and a replacement request handler is used. I can think of 3 reasons why this should be avoided:1-Performance; it's wasteful to render components to discard them right away2-Needs complete components hierarchy; even if setResponsePage() is used in a page constructor (e.g. when redirecting depending on page parameters)  since the page will be rendered  all of its components or some substitutes must be added to the page. Otherwise Wicket will throw a missing component exception in dev mode.3-Feedback messages; if the needlessly rendered page contains a feedback panel  feedback messages registered in the session will be swallowed by the thrown away page rendering.
