AbstractResourceReferenceMapper doesn't escape separators in style/variation names    org.apache.wicket.request.mapper.AbstractResourceReferenceMapper#encodeResourceReferenceAttributes() doesn't escape '-' character when generating the query string parameter with the locale-style-variation.So using a style with name 'a-b' leads to parameter with name '-a-b' and later is decoded to style == 'a' and variation == 'b'
