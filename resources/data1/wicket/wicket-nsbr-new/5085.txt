InlineEnclosure are piling up on each render    InlineEnclosureHandler#resolve() uses an auto-incremented id for its resolved InlineEnclosure  On the next render  a new instance will be resolved  since the id of the already resolved InlineEnclosure does not match the id in the markup.But InlineEnclosures are not removed after render as other auto-components  thus all instances pile up in the owning container of the markup.
