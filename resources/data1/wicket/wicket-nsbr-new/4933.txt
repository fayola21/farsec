Palette does not handle disabled choices correctly    It is possible to add choices to a Palette with the disabled HTML attribute. This attribute is respected by all modern browsers and prevents the selection of disabled choices.However Palette also has a double-click handler  which will ignore the disabled attribute and add the choice to the selection.The Javascript palette.js can be modified to prevent disabled choices from being added to the selection:Wicket.Palette.moveHelper=function(source  dest) { var dirty=false; for (var i=0;i&lt;source.options.length;i++) { if (source.options&#91;i&#93;.selected &amp;&amp; !source.options&#91;i&#93;.disabled) { dest.appendChild(source.options[i]); i--; dirty=true; } } return dirty; };Maybe it makes sense to integrate this into Palette?
