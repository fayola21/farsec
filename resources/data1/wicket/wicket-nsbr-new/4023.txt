Please Allow AjaxLink to use getChannelName    Please allow AjaxLink to provide an empty getChannelName() that is called by its internal AjaxEventBehavior  so that Ajax-Channels can be used withoutoverriding the whole behavior.I know  not all methods should be provided and I also know its possible to override the AjaxEventBehavior  but an AjaxLink should at least provide the Possibilityto assign it to a specific Channel.THanks..
