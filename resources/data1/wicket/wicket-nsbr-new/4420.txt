Unversioned pages don't get touched when created and cannot be found by ID later    When I tell Wicket not to version pages by default via IPageSettings#setVersionPagesByDefault(false)  created pages cannot be found later by theirs ID. Versioned pages are touched upon creation in dirty(boolean) method and thus stored in the page store. But unversioned ones are not! So when I create a Page  wrap it inside a PageProvider and RenderPageRequestHandler  then get its URL with urlFor  the URL is useless  because the page is referenced by its ID in the URL but it cannot be found by that URL later.I'll give you an simple example.PAGE 1: public class WicketMainPage extends WebPage {  public WicketMainPage() { PopupPage page = new PopupPage('Created: ' + new Date()); // getSession().getPageManager().touchPage(page); PageProvider pp = new PageProvider(page); RenderPageRequestHandler rh = new RenderPageRequestHandler(pp); add(new Label('url'  urlFor(rh).toString())); } } as you can see  I only create an instance of second page (which is not bookmarkable as it has some parameters)  wrap it in page provider and request handler and simply output URL for it (of course it is an stateful URL). The second page is just simple outputting text from constructor PAGE 2: public class PopupPage extends WebPage {  public PopupPage(String text) { add(new Label('text'  text)); } } When I run this  the app outputs an relative part of URL to the second page... if I copy this into browser  everything works  when pages are versioned. But when I set setVersionPagesByDefault(false) I start to get PageExpiredException whe trying to access the second page. When I uncomment the touchPage line  everythings works even with unversiones paged. I think  that instead of explicitly touching the page  it should be done by Wicket when retrieving the url for it. Somewhere in mapUrlFor or mapHandler  etc... Or maybe it should be touched in the dirty method just like versioned pages.
