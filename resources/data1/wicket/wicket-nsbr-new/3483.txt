NullPointerException in PersistentPageManager's page cache    From a private email to me by a user:Hi I'm trying to use your gae-initializer to get your test application working on GAE. I'm using version 1.5-rc2 of wicket and your initializer. Using GAE sdk 1.4.2.I'm getting the same problem the person on the 1.5-rc1 release page was getting  and I can't get around it.The homepage loads  but the other page throws the same null pointer exception he was getting:java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.wicket.page.PersistentPageManager$SessionEntry.findPage(PersistentPageManager.java:117)....--------------------------------The problem is that org.apache.wicket.page.PersistentPageManager.SessionEntry.addPage(IManageablePage) adds even 'null' pages.
