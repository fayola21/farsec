Move the logic for creating the proper PackageResource from PackageResourceReference to ResourceReferenceRegistry    org.apache.wicket.request.resource.PackageResourceReference#getResource() has a logic that decides what type of PackageResource to return depending on the file extension. It supports only .css and .js at the moment.ResourceReferenceRegistry (RRR) uses this logic for unknown ResRefs. It will be better if this mapping is moved to RRR and be possible to add custom mappings.
