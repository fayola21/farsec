Rename log4j.properties in the quickstart when creating a project for WildFly    As discovered at http://markmail.org/message/wlm4tjvmn62j3cit Wicket Quickstart should remove log4j.properties from the generated project when it will be deployed at WildFly (JBoss 8).maven-archetype-plugin supports special names (e.g. _something_) for files in the fileSet which can be renamed by using system properties.Using this we can rename _log4j.properties_ to log4j.properties by default and to wildfly-doesnt-need-log4j.properties when WildFly is selected from an additional drop-down at http://wicket.apache.org/start/quickstart.html
