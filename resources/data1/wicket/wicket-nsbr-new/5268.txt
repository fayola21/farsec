ComponentRenderer.renderComponent fails to render two components with different component IDs    After WICKET-5232 was fixed  #renderComponent now accepts component with any component ID. However since the markup of the RenderPage is cached  after calling #renderComponent for one component it will fail for components having different component ID.This could be fixed as I suggested in WICKET-5232: RenderPage could implement IMarkupCacheKeyProvider interface and return null in #getCacheKey.
