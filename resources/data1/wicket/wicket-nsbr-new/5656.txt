PropertyResolver does not scan for NotNull in annotation tree    When annotating a field of a bean with e.g. org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty  this impliesjavax.validation.constraints.NotNull  but PropertyValidator only checks for the annotations immediately on the filed not the tree of annotations. As a result Wicket does not mark the field as required in the UI  which it should.Also PropertyResolver.findNotNullConstraints() is not even protected  so cannot be patched in a simple way.So as a solution I suggest changing findNotNullConstraints() to be protected and rather be something like findConstraints(filter)  or findConstraints(clazz)  and then in that method method recursively invoking getComposingConstraints to get all constraints  but collecting only those of interest. Possibly some care needs to be taken to prevent infinite recursion where constraints are composed of each other (if that compiles).
