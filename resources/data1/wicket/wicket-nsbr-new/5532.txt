NPE calling PackageResource.getResourceStream() if there is no RequestCycle defined    From my email on the list:Since the introduction of the ProcessingResourceStream  it's notpossible to call PackageResource.getResourceStream() anymore if thereis no RequestCycle defined.Typically  we call it in our Application init() to prepare (mostlypreprocess and cache) a couple of resources before opening theapplication to the public.We now have a NPE here:https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/master/wicket-core/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/request/resource/PackageResource.java#L496This problem was introduced by this commit:https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/29b26ffffdd619f4e2fe86aa2d2b02ff3e1d6017#diff-428db8d5278d2ac567e471efd377c7c7Thanks.
