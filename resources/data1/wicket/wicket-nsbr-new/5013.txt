Wicket Enclosure fails with more than one component    An enclosure like:&lt;wicket:enclosure child='message'&gt; &lt;span wicket:id='message' /&gt; &lt;a href='#' wicket:id='link'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/wicket:enclosure&gt;fails with:org.apache.wicket.WicketRuntimeException: The component(s) below failed to render. Possible reasons could be that: 1) you have added a component in code but forgot to reference it in the markup (thus the component will never be rendered)  2) if your components were added in a parent container then make sure the markup for the child container includes them in &lt;wicket:extend&gt;.1. [ExternalLink &#91;Component id = link&#93;]It will report failed rendering for all components within the enclosure except the child.This works if I turn the enclosure into an inline enclosure:&lt;div wicket:enclosure='message'&gt; &lt;span wicket:id='message' /&gt; &lt;a href='#' wicket:id='link'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I got this error when upgrading from Wicket 6.2.0 to 6.3.0.I also noticed that the AjaxEnclosureListener only visits the InlineEnclosures.
