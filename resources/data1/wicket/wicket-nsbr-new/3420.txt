javascript with a less than character ('<') fails to execute when added through a header contribution in ajax response    This is adapted from a wicket users post I made (links are to the same thread in two archive systems):http://markmail.org/search/?q=wicket%20users%20wicket-ajax.js#query:wicket%20users%20wicket-ajax.js+page:1+mid:rfts3ar3upffhbbt+state:resultshttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/wicket-users/201102.mbox/%3CAANLkTi=EkmTA0RnA+GyJE-CQWmkCxRLsjp+z8jwv-Aw9@mail.gmail.com%3EThe problem: I have a panel with this: &lt;wicket:head&gt; &lt;script&gt; if (someVariable &lt; 0) { someVariable = 0; } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/wicket:head&gt;This script fails to execute when the panel is loaded by ajax. If I replace the less than character '&lt;' with equals '=='  then it executes (but of course  this is not what I need).I tested this in Firefox 4.0b10 and Chrome 8.After some debugging  it seems to me that this needs to be corrected in wicket-ajax.js. The header contribution is sent to the browser inside of a CDATA section so the '&lt;' character arrives to javascript intact. However  in parsing the script tag  the '&lt;' seems to signal the beginning of an HTML tag that then is considered malformed.Possible workarounds for apps: Invert the logic so a greater-than is used. In my example  this would be: 'if (0 &gt; someVariable) {' Put the code into a separate JS file (the downside is it requires another network hop from the browser) Embed the script in &lt;wicket:panel&gt; rather than &lt;wicket:head&gt; (the disadvantage is the script will be re-sent with the panel content when the panel is re-used on the same page)
