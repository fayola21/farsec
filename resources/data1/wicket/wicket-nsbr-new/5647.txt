missing generic cast causes compile error on OS X / jdk 8    when trying to compile wicket-7 from HEAD it fails under OS X / JDK 1.8.0_11. Casting a NULL to generic type (T) solves the issues. This seems like some odd case of failing type inference.The problematic source line is: return getEnumImpl(key  eClass  null);The compiler error is: Error:(792  35) java: incompatible types: inference variable T has incompatible upper bounds java.lang.Enum&lt;T&gt; TThis will fix the issue: return getEnumImpl(key  eClass  (T)null);I found that there is a fix WICKET-5427 which does not work in most current JDK 1.8.0_11 anymore. -Could not change the wicket-6 branch since the change will break the clirr plugin (see WICKET-5427).-
