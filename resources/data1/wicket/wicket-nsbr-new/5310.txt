if wicket is an external lib  BundleStringResourceLoader doesn't work    We have got serveral Wicket-based Wepapps on our server and in order to save space  we have move all shared libs (including wicket) into a shared folder which is included via the 'common.loader' of the catalina.properties file. (Using Apache Tomcat/7.0.39)The Problem is now  that StringResourceModel works normal  but the BundleStringResourceLoader doesn't work anymore. It always returns null.How to reproduce:Build attached quickstartRemove wicket-libs from warDeploy in Tomcat
