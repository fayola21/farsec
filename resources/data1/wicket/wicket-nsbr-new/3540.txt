Make AjaxLink's URL more configurable    Currently AjaxLink uses AjaxEventBehavior which exposes just its getAjaxCallDecorator() to the user.It would be nice if there is a way to have access to the behavior callback url  e.g. to add some additional parameters  to set channel (wicket-ajax.js)  etc.As solution I suggest to add method 'AjaxLink#newAjaxBehavior()' which by default will return current AjaxEventBehavior but if the user wants she may override it with custom one. This way wicket stateless ajax behavior (see jolira's google code project) can be used as well without the need to re-write (copy/paste) the whole class.
