Implement onValidateModelObjects() and beforeUpdateFormComponentModels() for nested forms    The onValidateModelObjects() Method in a Form is used for late-stage validation that allows outside frameworks to validate any beans that the form is updating (like JSR303 Bean Validation). This method is called after the model is updated.If you override this method for validation in your form and your form is nested in another form  this method will not be invoked if the outer form is submitted. Only the onValidateModelObjects() Method of the outer form is invoked.It would be great  if you change the implementation in the form in that way you did for the nested form validation and submission.The same problem exists for the beforeUpdateFormComponentModels() Method.
