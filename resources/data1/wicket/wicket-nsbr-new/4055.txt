LocaleFirstMapper does not strip Locale from url in getCompatibilityScore()    LocaleFirstMapper delegates the call to getCompatibilityScore() to the chained IRequestMapper without stripping the locale from the url.Since most request mappers generate a compatibility score by counting the number of matching segments from the start of the url  they will mostly return a score of 0.Practically this means that all request mappers behind the LocaleFirstMapper stop responding to urls.
