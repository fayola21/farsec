ModalWindow overwrites window.onbeforeunload    If window.onbeforeunload is changed after a ModalWindow is opened the change is lost when the ModalWindow is closed. I expected calling ModalWindow#showUnloadConfirmation(false) would fix this  but the javascript for the modal window unconditionally overwrites window.onbeforeunload. I suggest checking settings.unloadConfirmation before overwriting window.onbeforeunload.
