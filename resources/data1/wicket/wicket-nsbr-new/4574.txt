ThreadContext does not properly remove the ThreadLocal from the current thread    Actually  I only checked 6.0.0-beta2 and master  6.0.0-beta2 is not in the drop down.ThreadLocal.get() returns the current value  if one is set. If not  it creates a new value using the initialValue() method  AND (importantly) registers the ThreadLocal in the Thread's Map of ThreadLocals.In order for the get(false) method to work as expected  we must actually call ThreadLocal.remove() after a ThreadLocal.get() that returned null.Also  after the request was processed  we never properly remove the ThreadLocal from the Thread  we were simply setting it to the previous value  which was null most of the time. This is not enough. The ThreadLocal was still attached to the Thread  just the value it was storing was null.Here's hoping that Jira is working again and I can attach a patch.
