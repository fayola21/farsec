ComponentStringResourceLoader must not include the index of repeater items in resource lookup but still resolve properties to them    Issue when using a StringResourceModel to lookup a resource for a component underneath a repeating view.When a StringResourceModel is used by a component under a repeating view  the ComponentStringResourceLoader doesn't find the resource.This seems to be a problem introduced by the fix for 3671.In ComponentStringResourceLoader  getResourcePath excludes all AbstractRepeaters  however getComponentStack doesn't leading to the two being out of sync for the elements of the component hierarchy under the repeating view.
