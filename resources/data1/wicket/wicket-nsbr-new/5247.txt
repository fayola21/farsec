Broken Link in Tomcat because of Page Mount    I post this message on the user mailing List (http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/Broken-Link-in-Tomcat-because-of-Page-Mount-tt4659663.html) and Martin Grigorov asked me  to create a ticket on Jira.Broken Link in Tomcat because of Page MountFollowing situation:-I have a Wicket Application(6.8.0) which runs under the context 'webapp' on a Tomcat 7.0.41-I mount a Page with two parameters (this is important) in the WicketApplication. mountPage('/mount/${parameter1}/${parameter2}'  MountedPage.class);-The mounted Page(MountedPage.class) has only a simple Link-There are two links on the HomePage to the mounted Page. They are declared as follows: add(new Link&lt;Void&gt;('link') { @Override public void onClick() { setResponsePage(MountedPage.class  linkParameters); } }); add(new Link&lt;Void&gt;('brokenLink') { @Override public void onClick() { setResponsePage(new MountedPage(linkParameters)); } });I deploy this Application as a war file on a Tomcat under the context 'webapp'.When I call the first Link on the HomePage and then the Link on the mounted Page  everything works fine.But if I call the second Link and then the Link on the mounted Page  the link is broken.The context is missing in the generated link http://localhost:8080/wicket/bookmarkable/com.mycompany.LinkedPageDoes anyone have an idea  why the second link does not work on Tomcat?I add a Quickstart and the war file as attachment.Ps: Both links works fine in Jetty. Pss:If I remove the mount command  both links will work in Tomcat too.
