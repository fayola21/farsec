MarkupResourceStream should use debug instead of info to log non-standard namespace    It is possible to use a non 'wicket' namespace name in markup (for example 'w'). However wicket logs this on info level for every markup file. Imho this is a bit verbose and should be done on the debug level instead. Also wicket should log 'namespace name' instead of 'component name' in this message.
