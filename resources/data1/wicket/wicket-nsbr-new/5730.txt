Dequeue auto component can't resolve components if they are nested in child markup    If a container has an auto component (ex: enclouse) in its markup but this later is nested inside a child  the autocomponent won't be resolved if child is a IQueueRegion. For example (taken from quickstart): &lt;span wicket:id='myBorder'&gt; bar &lt;wicket:enclosure&gt; &lt;span wicket:id='c'&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/wicket:enclosure&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
