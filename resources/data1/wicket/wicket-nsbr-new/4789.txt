URL rendering regression    The way URLs are encoded was changed (WICKET-4645) and now the first request (with ;jsessionid in path) generates invalid internal links:My page is mounted to '/Home/' and I get redirected to '/Home/;jsessionid=1234?0' (fine). There's a Link on the page and the generated URL for it is '../Home;jsessionid=1234?0-1.ILinkListener-link'. Note the missing '/'. This results in a 404 and breaks basically all of my system tests.I'll attach a simple quickstart which demonstrates the problem. It's important to delete the jsessionid cookie before accessing the page.
