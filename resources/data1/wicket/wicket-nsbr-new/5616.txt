CLONE - ModalWindow is not visible in Safari when opened from a link at the bottom of a large page    I am not able to see a ModalWindow in Safari and I expect to see it centered on my view port.Steps:1. Start with a large web page with a link to open the ModalWindow at the bottom of the page. You need a large page where you have to scroll down to find the link.2. Click the link3. Observe that the mask for the ModalWindow displays  but the ModalWindow does not. Scrolling back up  re-sizing  and maximizing will still not display the ModalWindow.
