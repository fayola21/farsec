Allow continued processing with WicketTester after exception is thrown    When exposing an exception while processing  WicketTester is left in an inconsistent state. Since #setupNextRequestCycle() is not called  no additional processing is possible afterwards: org.apache.wicket.WicketRuntimeException: No RequestCycle is currently set!For tests expecting WicketTester#process() to fail  it would be nice to be able to continue processing with the same tester instance afterwards.
