Wicket 1.5 rewrites template content where it should not    I have recently upgraded from Wicket 1.4.14 to 1.5.4. One issue that Iencountered is that &lt;script&gt; tags in panel templates are rewritten byWicket  even when the &lt;script&gt; tags in question have no wicket handlersattached to them. I.e. the following panel template (notice that thereare no wicket:id attributes whatsoever):&lt;wicket:panel&gt; &lt;script id='template-upload' type='text/x-jquery-tmpl'&gt; &lt;span&gt;${name}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/wicket:panel&gt;Would render in the panel as:&lt;script id='template-upload' type='text/x-jquery-tmpl'&gt;/&lt;![CDATA[/ &lt;span&gt;${name}&lt;/span&gt;/]]&gt;/&lt;/script&gt;Imho this is unwanted behavior that is a regression from the behavior inWicket 1.4.x (or at least 1.4.14). Wicket should not add content to thebody of the script tags (or any other tags in a template  unless theircontent is provided programmatically)  as it does not have the knowledgehow that affects the functionality of the page. Moreover  the contentthat Wicket adds to these script tags is only correct for Javascript(hence incorrect for the scripts in the example as they are notjavascript). In the above example adding /*  */will change the functionality of the script tag. If the '/&lt;![CDATA[/'part was necessary in the script tags above  they should be added by theperson that provides the template  not magically added by Wicket.I have attached a quickstart that demonstrates the issue. The quickstart has a &lt;script id='script1'&gt;Some Text&lt;/script&gt; element in HomePage.html that (by javascript) is shown in an alert box. Because of this bug  the alert will now start with '/&lt;![CDATA[/'  while it should simply show the text. See HomePage.html in the provided quickstart.
