AjaxEditableChoiceLabel won't close select onblur    AjaxEditableChoiceLabel won�_��_�t close the select combo (showed after clicking in the asociated label) when it losses the focus. It's supossed to call the onCancel method like it does in AjaxEditableLabel but the select turns into a label only selecting a different value in the select combo (it doesn't work pressing Escape or clicking in other part of the page).I fix it localy adding this code:editor.add(new AjaxEventBehavior('blur') { protected void onEvent(AjaxRequestTarget target) { AjaxEditableChoiceLabel.this.onCancel(target); }});For the editor declared as DropDownChoice in line 183 of AjaxEditableChoiceLabel .java.
