PagingNavigation: possible to call setStartIndex() earlier than onBeforeRender?    PagingNavigation has two actions in its onBeforeRender implementation:setDefaultModel(new Model&lt;Integer&gt;((int)Math.max(Integer.MAX_VALUE  pageable.getPageCount())));setStartIndex();Building my own PagingNavigation extending PagingNavigation  not being able to retrieve the start index before onBeforeRender  forces me to put a lot of logical code into my own onBeforeRender implementation.So there's a valid workaround  but I'd expect this to work from onConfigure also  maybe even from onInitialize.As far as I can see it should be possible to call the two methods earlier than onBeforeRender  however I might be missing the 'big picture' and oversee some side effects this could cause.
