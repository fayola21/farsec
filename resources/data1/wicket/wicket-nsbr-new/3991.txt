SignInPanel prevents the page being Stateless when signing in with the 'rember me' facility.    This worked fine with 1.5-RC5  so I think it is a regression. Start the webapp ( mvn clean jetty:run ) Log-in with remember me checked. Stop the webapp restart it ( mvn clean jetty:run ) The browser should re-log-on and wicket will throw a RuntimeException. If you refresh the browser  you are properly logged-on.See the attached quickstart.
