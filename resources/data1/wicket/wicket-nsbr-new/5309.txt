No page id appended to some stateful pages using repeaters    My test case is a page containing a ListView with a single stateful child. In that case  there is no redirect done to append a pageId to the url because the page's statefulness check is erroneous.Analysis:This calls page.isPageStateless() to dertermine whether a pageId should be addedBookmarkableMapper(AbstractBookmarkableMapper).getPageInfo(IPageRequestHandler) line: 440BookmarkableMapper(AbstractBookmarkableMapper).mapHandler(IRequestHandler) line: 387SystemMapper(CompoundRequestMapper).mapHandler(IRequestHandler) line: 215RequestCycle.mapUrlFor(IRequestHandler) line: 429WebPageRenderer.respond(RequestCycle) line: 268RenderPageRequestHandler.respond(IRequestCycle) line: 165RequestCycle$HandlerExecutor.respond(IRequestHandler) line: 861RequestCycle$HandlerExecutor(RequestHandlerStack).execute(IRequestHandler) line: 64RequestCycle.execute(IRequestHandler) line: 261The problem I see is that AbstractRepeater's onPopulate() is called during onBeforeRender() and this is not done when the stateless status of the page is first checked. Therefore  no pageId is added unless other components not located inside repeaters are also stateful. See thread http://wicket-users.markmail.org/thread/6q2dmns7lqjgkok7I will add a quickstart.
