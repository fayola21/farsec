Reference to a non-existing images causes IllegalStateException 'ResourceResponse#setWriteCallback() must be set.'    A Page containing a PackageResourceReference to a nonexisting image fails with an Illegalstateexception. Debugging through the code reveals that hust before this exception a 404 HTTP Code ist set. This 404 gets hidden by the exception.I could not script a unittest for this problem  but it is easily reproduced in my browsers (Firefox 4  IE 8). A page class and html will be attached
