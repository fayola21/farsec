NumberTextField does not have default minimum and maximum    Javadoc of NumberTextField says:A TextField for HTML5 &lt;input&gt; with type number.Automatically validates the input against the configured min and max attributes. If any of them is null then Double.MIN_VALUE and Double.MAX_VALUE are used respectfully. Note: FormComponent.setType(Class) must be called explicitly!It is not true. We have constructor which sets them to null: public NumberTextField(String id  IModel&lt;N&gt; model  Class&lt;N&gt; type) { super(id  model  type); validator = null; minimum = null; maximum = null; }and if I don't set them manually  in case of error nulls go to RangeValidator (line 84-85: error.setVariable('minimum'  min); error.setVariable('maximum'  max);causing:java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Argument 'value' may not be null.Nevertheless  I think reflection API should be used to determine if given Number has MAX_VALUE/MIN_VALUE and this one should be used. In other case I think it is ok to use Double.MAX_VALUE/MIN_VALUE.or maybe you have another ideas?
