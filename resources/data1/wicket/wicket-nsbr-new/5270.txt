Do not set the location.hash when clicking on a link    Clicking an AjaxLink or SubmitLink sets the location.hash to an empty value (..../someUrl?some=param#).This interferes with JavaScript libraries which need to use 'hashchange' event.Additionally in two of our apps we experience a strange page reloads after clicking on AjaxLink.The issue is not easy to reproduce but it seems to be caused by the used href='#' somehow.Applying a custom behavior that overrides href='#' with href='javascript:;' fixes the problem.The problem occurred on Google Chrome and IE9 so far.
