SecuritySettings.setEnforceMounts() does not work when the mounted mapper is not in the root compound mapper    BookmarkableMapper.isPageMounted() assumes that all mounted mappers are in Application.getRootRequestMapperAsCompound(). Sometimes the mappers make a tree structure  with multiple compounds existing  sometimes separated by wrappers  like HttpsMapper and CryptoMapper.Because of this  BookmarkableMapper fails to realise that a page is mounted and so does not enforce mounting.
