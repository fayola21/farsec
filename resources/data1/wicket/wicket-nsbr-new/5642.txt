CheckingOutputObjectStream should filter duplicates by identity  not by equality    As discussed at http://markmail.org/message/kdbyimrznubgtz5n the checks for duplicates by equality is not correct (and optimal).CheckingOOS already filters checked objects by identity (see org.apache.wicket.core.util.objects.checker.CheckingObjectOutputStream#checked) so there is no need to check second time (via Stack#equals()).
