Log a warning when WebSocketResponse#sendError() is used    As discussed at http://markmail.org/message/x6xj4l2vo6iijan5 it will be better to log the passed error code and message instead of throwing unsupported exception.Additionally it will be good to provide a factory method for the WebSocketResponse so the application can write a proper error response in its own format to the client if needed.
