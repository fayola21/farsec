UrlRenderer renders invalid relative URLs if first segment contains colon    Seen on Wicket 1.5.3.If a relative url of a link starts with a path segment containing a colon then the whole uri will be regarded as absolute uri  so typically browsers will complain that there is no handle for the protocol foo in foo:bar/dee/per.See also the attached quickstart. The start page contains three links  one relative with colon  one absolute and one to a mounted page without colon for comparison.The application also has a static switch to add an extended urlrenderer  prepending './' if needed. This fix is merely a quick shot and there might be better alternatives.
