MultiFileUploadField after selecting a file does not hide properly input field    Component org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.upload.MultiFileUploadField in related javascript uses code: ''this.style.position = 'absolute'; this.style.left = '-1000px' ' to hide a file input after selecting a file.Unfortunately on my screen (1920x1200) if I put this component on the right side of a page then after selecting a file  'the hidden input' is moved to the left of its container  but still visible for a user.Changing style.position to 'fixed' should resolve the problem  so the input field will be positioned relative to the browser window  not to its ancestor.
