Set the component as a context to the ajax listeners    Currently to get the component in an Ajax listener (before  success  complete  ...) one has to use: attrs.event.target.In Wicket 1.5 one could use 'this' in ajax call decorators because the script was a value of the inline attribute.Currently 'this' in event listeners is unusable. It would be good to set the component as a context.
