Wicket 1.5.6 duplicates segments in absolute URLs    Since we migrate our application to Wicket 1.5.6 some URLs from BookmarkablePageLinks have duplicate segements for indicating a Shop and a Language item from our persistence model. For indicating a Shop and Language item we use our own ShopMapper and LanguageMapper (subclass of AbstractComponentMapper). This was working until we migrate to 1.5.6.For instance ...correct URL: host/servlet/shop/en/pagewrong URL: host/servlet/shop/en/shop/en/pageThis happens  for example  when the protocol of the linked URL is different from the current protocol (http/https). So  basically  all links that point to pages that are annotated with @RequireHttps are wrong.In our Application class we set the HttpsMapper as RootRequestMapper  e.g.:setRootRequestMapper(new HttpsMapper(new ShopMapper(new LanguageMapper(getRootRequestMapper()))  new HttpsConfig() ) );Using a debugger  I've tracked down the spot where wrong URL is rendered:org.apache.wicket.request.Url.resolveRelative()
