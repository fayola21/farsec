Add maxlength to  wicket-datetime hours  minutes input fields    I watched an end user type an entire time into the hour component without tabbing over to the minute.So  I'd like to suggest a minor change to DateTimeField.html to add the maxlength='2' to the current size='2' on the hour/min input controls.I think it might be a simple way to give earlier feedback (I've found it unwise to rely on instructions like 'Please enter dates and times like this...' ).I can't think of any downside to this addition.
