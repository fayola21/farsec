Add RestartResponseException constructors to specify a RedirectPolicy    Since Wicket 1.5 uses RedirectPolicy.AUTO_REDIRECT  it would be good to be able to specify an explicit other policy.We often use this in cases we need to redireect  even though the AUTO_REDIRECT might choose not to do so (the reason being to transport cookies/new session to the user between those requests). Also in some rare cases we need to force a NEVER_REDIRECT for a certain page in order to keep the URL as is.It would be great if there were overloaded constructors to specify the RedirectPolicy for the RenderPageRequestHandler.
