WicketTester doesn't preserve the request cookies when #executeListener() is used    org.apache.wicket.util.tester.BaseWicketTester#executeListener(org.apache.wicket.Component  org.apache.wicket.RequestListenerInterface) creates a new new MockHttpServletRequest but doesn't do the cookie management as in org.apache.wicket.util.tester.BaseWicketTester#setupNextRequestCycle() (the only other place where a new MockHttpServletRequest is created).
