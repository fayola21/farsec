Reset the busy flag in Wicket.Channel if the execution of the callback fails for some reason    If a scheduled (in Wicket.Channel) callback fails for some reason (in my case because WicketAjaxDebug was not yet loaded) then the 'busy' flag for the channel remains 'true' until the page is reloaded.It would be better to try/catch the execution of the callback and reset the flag in case of an error.
