Make it possible to use JsonFunction as a AjaxCallListener's handler    Currently the IAjaxCallListener's handlers could be an instance of CharSequence. Wicket wraps them in JsonFunction and sets the respective parameters for the handler.By making JsonFunction itself a CharSequence allows the developer to use it as a handler and to provide the whole JS function code  not just the body which makes the code looks a little bit strange because some variables are assumed to be passed (the parameters) from somewhere else.
