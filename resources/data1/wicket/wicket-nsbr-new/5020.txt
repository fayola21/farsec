InlineEnclosureHandler always uses 'wicket' namespace    The name of the wicket namespace is hardcoded in InlineEnclosureHandler:public final static String INLINE_ENCLOSURE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = 'wicket:enclosure';This constant is also used by InlineEnclosure and was probably never meant to be part of the public API.These classes should respect the user defined namespace provided by the MarkupResourceStream.
