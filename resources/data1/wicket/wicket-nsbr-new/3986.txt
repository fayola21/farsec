Potential StackOverflowError in SerializableChecker    At line 517 it checks if 'streamObj' has already been checked  but at 522 it puts 'original' in the map. I don't know what's needed to reproduce it  but wicket-weld triggered it for me. You probably need a class with custom serialization which tries to serialize itself recursively. Changing line 522 to 'streamObj' fixed it for me.
