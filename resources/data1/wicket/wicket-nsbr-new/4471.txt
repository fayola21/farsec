Generic registry of javascript/css resource references    It would be nice if JavaScriptLibrarySettings had a generic mechanism to register javascript/css resource references (maybe using something like MetaDataKeys).This way  extension/third-party components (ModalWindow  DateTimeField  etc.) could register their resources  or just lookup for substitute resource references for their own scripts/stylesheets.This would allow some optimizations  such as minification/compression and joining many files into one  and hosting static files in CDNs.
