Form components' name/value are encoded in stateless form's action url    Stateless forms aren't working well as you can see on wicket examples: http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples/stateless/fooThe first time you submit  (for example  the value 10)  everything works as supposed to. If you now change the value (to 11 for example) and submit the form  the value wicket shows is 10.I think the problem is stateless forms are generating an action URL with submitted values on query string  and when you resubmit the form  this values on query string replace the POST(or GET) values.
