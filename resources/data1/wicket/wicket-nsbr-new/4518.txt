Wicket example 'forminput' is broken due to bad url for IOnChangeListener    http://localhost:8080/forminput (wicket-examples) doesn't change the locale of the labels when the locale select is changed.The reason seems to be the produced url: './.?5-1.IOnChangeListener-inputForm-localeSelect' This is parsed to a Url with one empty segment and thus HomePageMapper doesn't match it and doesn't handle it.
