Modify o.a.w.Component.send method signature to exactly match the one defined in superinterface    Current signature in Component:public final void send(IEventSink sink  Broadcast type  Object payload)This is an implementation of o.a.w.event.IEventSource.send:&lt;T&gt; void send(IEventSink sink  Broadcast broadcast  T payload)These are the same at runtime but the difference cause minor annoyance for Eclipse users. For example when creating a new page and defining the WebPage superclass in the wizard  Eclipse will generate a new class with a send method stub which has to be deleted by hand. Exact signatures fix this.
