CryptoMapper does not correctly decrypt URLs for the home page    I proposed a solution for WICKET-3514  which I had been using myself. I didn't notice that it was incorporated into Wicket. This patch represents a bug fix I made to the new CryptoMapper which is not in Wicket.Encrypted URLs for the home page (where the unencrypted URL is something like '?4' - no segments  just parameters) are not correctly decrypted.
