Update jetty to 7.3 and spring to 2.5.6.SEC02    Jetty 7.3.0.v20110203 is the latest stable version. Maybe it would be worth to upgrade now from 7.2.2 before wicket 1.5 goes final.Spring 2.5.6.SEC02 is the latest spring version in the 2.x line and it only differs in a few security fixes from the current used version: 2.5.6.
