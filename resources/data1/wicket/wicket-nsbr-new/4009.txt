Page Lock on Browser Back Button after Page Expiry    In the attached quickstart  after page expiry and browser back navigation  a server error occurs such as:'failed to acquire lock to page 0  attempted for 1 minutes out of allowed 1 minute'This appears to be related to request logging  but I have seen other strange errors without request logging such asorg.apache.wicket.request.handler.ComponentNotFoundException: Could not find component 'form' on page 'class web.page.ExpiredPagealso with browser history back navigation.I have seen none of these errors in Wicket 1.4. I guess the reason for not having seen this before it that http cache headers are different in 1.5.
