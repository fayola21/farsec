Extract the code that creates the XML for Ajax responses out of AjaxRequestHandler    Currently the code that generates the &lt;ajax-response&gt; object is inside AjaxRequestHandler and it is impossible to reuse it.It will be better if the response data and the logic to serialize it is outside. This way other IRequestHandlers can reuse it or a different serialization strategy can be applied (e.g. JSON).
