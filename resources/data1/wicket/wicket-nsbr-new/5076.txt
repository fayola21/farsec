form#onSubmit() is called on just replaced nested forms    I use wizard api from wicket extensions.Next button is implemented like org.apache.wicket.extensions.wizard.NextButton.It means: if step is complete wizardModel.next() is called and step content is replaced.I send you example - see attachment.In the example Step2Panel contains inner form 'innerForm'.The problem is when we leave step 1 (click to next button) - innerForm.onSubmit from step 2 is called. Obversely when we leave step 2 innerForm.onSubmit is not called!One solution is to call form.process(null) manually in Nextbutton.onClick before step content is replaced. It is wrong again becaouse innerForm.onSubmit is called twice.
