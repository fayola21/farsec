SCRIPT tags in Ajax-Response are not evaluated in Chrome    if a JavaScript script tag is added to AjaxRequestTarget (by Behavior via JavaScriptUtils.writeJavaScript)  it is not evaluated on Chrome browser. While debugging through wicket-ajax.js  it turns out  that replaceOuterHtmlSafari function is not called for Chrome  but the Gecko version gets executed instead (fall to '} else /* GECKO */ {' in Wicket.replaceOuterHtml). And the Gecko version does not do any special handling of SCRIPT tag  since Firefox does execute SCRIPT nodes added dynamically to the DOM. This behavior occurs since 1.5-RC5.1.There is a quickstart webapp attached to this ticket. HomePage contains a Label with Behavior attached and an AjaxLink. Behavior add a JavaScript showing alert message. It is shown once the page is loaded and once the ajax link is clicked. In Chrome there is not alert message after clicking the ajax link.
