Greek (el) Application.properties    I am attaching greek Application_el.properties file. Unfortunatelly I myselft do not speak Greek  we have a project partner/client in Greece  which was conmpaining about default 'Choose one' drop down option. I suggested translating the Application.properties file. I know  there are more files  which should be translated to get full translation  but I do not really feel I can ask our Greek partner to do them all  Additionally I can not really validate  how good the translation really is - they are very non-technical persons.
