Logic or Exception Message is incorrect in ModalWindow.setCookieName    The logic of the compound conditional statement is incorrect or the message passed to the Exception is incorrect. /** Sets the name of the cookie that is used to remember window position (and size if the window is resizable).  @param cookieName Name of the cookie @return this */ public StatelessModalWindow setCookieName(String cookieName) Unknown macro: { if (cookieName != null &amp;&amp; cookieName.indexOf(&quot; &quot;) != -1 &amp;&amp; cookieName.indexOf(&quot;|&quot;) != -1) { throw new IllegalArgumentException('Cookie name may not contain ' ' or '|' characters.'); } this.cookieName = cookieName; return this; } The logic reads: If the String is not null and it contains a comma and it contains a pipe  then throw the exception.
