Add Generics to TabbedPanel:    In 1.5  TabbedPanel#tabs has a wildcard signature: List&lt;? extends ITab&gt;. This makes it impossible to add tabs to that list  even though adding panels is one of the stated purposes of the #getTabs() method.On #wicket  dashorst suggested giving TabbedPanel a type parameter &lt;T extends ITab&gt;  which I think is a good idea. It should definitely be added in 6.0.What about 1.5.x? This would be a source-level break  but I think binaries should still work.
