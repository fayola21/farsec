this.replaceWith is broken when called from onInitialize    When calling this.replaceWith within the onInitialize method  wicket throws an exception:'Last cause: org.apache.wicket.Component has not been properly initialized. Something in the hierarchy of com.mycompany.PanelA has not called super.onInitialize() in the override of onInitialize() method'This happens because detach is called on the panel being replaced which clears Component.request flags (sets to 0) which causes the exception on line 864 of Component.java:if (!getRequestFlag(RFLAG_INITIALIZE_SUPER_CALL_VERIFIED)) { // throws here}
