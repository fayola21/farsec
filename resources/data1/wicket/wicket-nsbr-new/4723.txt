tracking id retrieved in AtmosphereBehavior#onRequest() is always 0    jquery.atmosphere.js will always use 0 as initial tracking-id to send request and then reassign it from server response.AtmosphereBehavior#getUUID() shouldn't return the tracking-id from request header  since the initial request's tracking-id is 0.The correct way to retrieve tracking-id is calling AtmosphereResource#uuid()
