in development mode Wicket stops picking up markup changes    I have wicket application running via mvn jetty:run under JRebel to facilitate code hotswap.With 1.5RC5.1 Wicket does not pick markup changes unless I change requested version  and it still put version on URL even I have getPageSettings.setVersionPagesByDefault(false);   but that is a minor inconvenience.More annoying that after awhile Wicket stops picking up changes in the markup of components used on my page. I mean that I can change markup for my components and it gets reflected upon page refresh (with requesting non existent version)  but at some point it stops  changes to the markup of subcomponents are not picked up.That forces me to restart application  which is major productivity killer....
