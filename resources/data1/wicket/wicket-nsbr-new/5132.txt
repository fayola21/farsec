Evaluation of returned data (which includes alot of javascript) very slow after ajax call in IE10.    We're using ajax to update a treetable. In IE10  when the ajax call returns the data  which contains alot of javascript code  processEvaluation in wicket-ajax-jquery.js stalls on var text = jQuery(node).text();In jQuery procedure Sizzle.getText is called  which eventually returns property elem.textContent. In IE10 this last statement takes about 26 seconds for our case while the same statement in chrome takes about 6 ms.It seems strange that IE10 takes this long to return the textContent of a node  but why is this necessary in the first place?The purpose of var text = jQuery(node).text() would be to get the text of the node. I think it would suffice to state var text = node.childNodes&#91;0&#93;.nodeValue instead of var text = Query(node).text()  because the text is in the node itself  and it's not necessary to get the text from its descendants  because it has no descendants.In our case this modification improves the duration from 25915 ms to 8 ms in IE10.
