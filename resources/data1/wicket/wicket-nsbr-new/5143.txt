Create an interface for the roles replacing the current Roles class    Currently the roles in wicket are managed by a final class  Roles  that extends HashSet.In my current projects I have to manage permissions considering several factors that include the role  the creator and the type of data  and this must be done also when displaying tables with several rows. Having the possibility to create my own Roles class I can integrate my restrictions with wicket authorization and add some performance improvements (required in this case because the validation must be done at the field level).
