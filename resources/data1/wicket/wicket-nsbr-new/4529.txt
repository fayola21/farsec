AjaxEditableLabel not selecting text or moving cursor on Firefox 11.0 or Safari 5.0.5    The class Javadoc for AjaxEditableLabel says:'''onEdit(AjaxRequestTarget) is called when the label is clicked and the editor is to be displayed. The default implementation switches the label for the editor and places the caret at the end of the text.&lt;/li&gt;'''However this does not happen on Firefox or Safari.Looking at the code  it is actually trying to place the caret at the end of the line and selecting the text in the form field. (This selecting the text is what I also want  and also the most common behavior of such ajax-editable fields on other big websites on the Internet)// put focus on the textfield and stupid explorer hack to move the// caret to the endtarget.appendJavaScript('{ var el=wicketGet('' + editor.getMarkupId() + '');' + ' if (el.createTextRange) { ' + ' var v = el.value; var r = el.createTextRange(); ' + ' r.moveStart('character'  v.length); r.select(); } }');target.focusComponent(editor);However the 'stupid explorer hack' as the code calls it  probably only works on explorer  because the el.createTextRange method is quite old and deprecated (it's only needed on MSIE &lt;9)I'm getting good results by just calling select() on the DOM element. I don't have MSIE available to test there but I think it will work there too.// put focus on the textfield and stupid explorer hack to move the// caret to the endtarget.appendJavaScript('{ var el=wicketGet('' + editor.getMarkupId() + '');' + ' el.select(); ' + ' }');target.focusComponent(editor);
