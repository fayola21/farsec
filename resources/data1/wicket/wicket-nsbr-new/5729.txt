Avoid using input names that conflict with JavaScript DOM API method and attribute names    If you use input names that conflict with JavaScript DOM API method and attribute names the ability to use the DOM method/attribute on the form element is hampered.For example  JQuery stops working if you have a form control with input name 'nodeName' (&lt;select name='nodeName'&gt;).This is because form.nodeName is no longer a string  but is a element. JQuery expects element.nodeName to return a string and exceptions ensue.
