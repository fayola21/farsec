BufferedWebResponse fails to add/clear cookie in redirect    bufferedWebResponse.addCookie( cookie );That fails under certain conditions: (1) when called on the last of three 302 redirects during OpenID login; and (2) on single redirect immediately after container startup  though it later recovers. Failure confirmed in Firebug; no cookies sent in any of the response headers. My workaround is to bypass the buffered response. This works:((HttpServletResponse)bufferedWebResponse.getContainerResponse()).addCookie( cookie );
