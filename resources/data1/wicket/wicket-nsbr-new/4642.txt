Atmosphere Modul not working on first page after Jetty restart    After Jetty is started if the very first page being visited is a page with AtmosphereBehavior (using @Subscribe)  for some reason by the time the page is being registered by EventBus (#registerPage(String trackingId  Page page)) the session is null and after the page has been rendered its not null any more thus having a different PageKey and so the events for the page are filtered out at line #140 or EventBusIf you just add Session.get().bind() in the constructor method of your page  everything would work as expected.
