NumberTextField renders its value in unsupported number format    The issue is similar to WICKET-3591 but its fix doesn't help when the model object of the NumberTextField is a BigDecimal because BigDecimalConverter#convertToString() produces something like '123  456  789' and this is not supported by &lt;input type='number'&gt;'s spec: http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/datatypes.html#common.data.float.
