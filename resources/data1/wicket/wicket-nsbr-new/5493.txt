Disable jar indexing    Wicket's pom.xml uses maven-jar-plugin with &lt;index&gt;true&lt;/index&gt;  which creates META-INF/INDEX.LIST file in the JAR files. This is useless when done only for a single jar file and might in some cases even be harmful.I propose to disable the generation INDEX.LIST files both in Wicket 6 and 7.For a full discussion of the drawbacks  see the corresponding bug track at Tomcat's Bugzilla: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49236
