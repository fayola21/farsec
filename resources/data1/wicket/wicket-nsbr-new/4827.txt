Modal panel mouse pointer in resize style for MSIE8 and MSIE9    In IE8 and IE9 the mouse pointer has the w-resize or e-resize style when hovering above a panel modal window.

Quirks mode is not an option for us.http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples-6.0.x/ajax/modal-windowI will attach a quickstart.
