PackageResource#internalGetResourceStream() should return ProcessingResourceStream only when the resource is existing    The fix for WICKET-4762 introduced ProcessingResourceStream - a resource stream that wraps another IResourceStream and processes its InputStream (e.g. compresses it).There is a bug that even when the resource is not found  i.e. the resource stream is null  Wicket still wraps it in ProcessingResourceStream.Another inefficiency is that ResourceStreamWrapper (the parent of ProcessingResourceStream) declares its method #getDelegate() as protected. It should be public.
