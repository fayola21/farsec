Incorrect casts to AuthenticatedWebSession in AuthenticatedWebApplication class    After resolving bug WICKET-2971  several methods in AuthenticatedWebApplication still contain casts to AuthenticatedWebSession instead of casts to AbstractAuthenticatedWebSession. It makes AuthenticatedWebApplication not reusable with custom implementations of AbstractAuthenticatedWebSession class. Several cosmetic changes in code and javadoc should be done.
