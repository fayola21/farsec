Improve WebClientInfo logic to extract the exact browser version    A colleague of mine gave some love to WebClientInfo and improved the logic to extract information which browser and its major/minor version.This way it is quite easy to generate something like:&lt;html class='ie7'&gt;  or even &lt;html class='ff3.7'&gt;  ...instead of using IE conditional comments for IE and no way to do that for FF/Chrome/Safari.
