AutoLinkResolver looks in the wrong scope    When turning on MarkupSettings#automaticLinking  AutoLinkResolver is supposed to touch tags like &lt;img&gt; and &lt;a&gt; and set their src/href attributes so that packaged resources are correctly referenced.I found a situation where that does not work: If you have a panel  and e.g. an &lt;img&gt; tag inside that panel  and the &lt;img&gt; tag is NOT enclosed in a container component  it looks for the resource in the scope of the surrounding component  not in the panel's scope. It obviously can't find it there  so it just dumps the raw attribute.If you put that &lt;img&gt; tag into a MarkupContainer (like WMC) then it works correctly. So it looks like the scope is off-by-one or something like that. I'll investigate.
