addDomReadyEvent broken for IE    Wicket.Event.addDomReadyEvent is broken in IE since 1.5.1. I identified WICKET-4080 as the cause of the problem: onreadystatechange with readyState='loaded' is sometimes fired before the document is fully loaded  causing scripts that reference DOM nodes to fail.See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534359%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for the order of the readystate events.The attached quickstart reproduces the issue (you may need to F5 a few times as it does not happen reliably). The actual JS error is:SCRIPT5007: The property 'onkeydown' has no value: The object is null or undefinedwicket-autocomplete-ver-1317728550188.js  Line 91 Character 9
