FilterForm#enableFocusTracking(FormComponent) method uses ComponentTag#put(String CharSequence) with key='id' which gives a warning in Wicket 1.5    A warning 'Please use component.setMarkupId(String) to change the tag's 'id' attribute.' is issued every time the component is rendered as the put(String  CharSequence) method on ComponentTag is called with 'id' as a key.To get rid of the warning message the FilterForm#enableFocusTracking(FormComponent) should be updated according to the warning message.
