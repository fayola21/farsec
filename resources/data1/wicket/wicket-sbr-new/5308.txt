AuthenticatedWebSession#authenticate should be protected  not public    A common source of confusion in trainings is that when implementing security using wicket-auth-roles  you have to implement #authenticate in your own session class  but in the login form's #onSubmit you have to call #signIn.Both #authenticate and #signIn are public and both have identical signatures. Their names mean basically the same thing too. This is rather error-prone.I propose changing the visibility of #authenticate to protected. That way  it will still work the same as it does now  except it won't show up in code-completion anymore and won't compete with #signIn anymore.This should not be an API break  since #authenticate is abstract anyway and is always implemented in user code. Raising visibility from protected to public is always legal  so user code should not break from this change.Opinions?
