parentFolderPlaceholder default value in Settings implementation is inconsistent with the javadoc    In relation to wicket-1992 the javadoc for: org.apache.wicket.settings.IResourceSettings#setParentFolderPlaceholdersays:'Note that by default the placeholder string is empty '' and thus will not allow to access parent folders.'But the default is null  not ''and this generates src url like this: resources/com.test.sub.pack.TestPage/null/null/base/information.pngwhich do work  but probably shouldn't.
