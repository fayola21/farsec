Remove StorageFile.getURL() and its implementations    StorageFile.getURL() is only called from CPFile  which is an implementation of StorageFile. The getURL() method could therefore be removed from the StorageFile interface and all its implementation classes except for CPFile  and it could be made private in CPFile.
