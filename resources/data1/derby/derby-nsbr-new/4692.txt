Unions between BOOLEAN and non-BOOLEAN datatypes should be rejected    DERBY-4684 fixed problems in implicit casts to BOOLEAN. However  the query which created the implicit casts should raise an error for other reasons:select isindex from sys.sysconglomerates where conglomeratename = 'foo'unionvalues ( 'true' )This should fail because if either of the datatypes being UNIONed is BOOLEAN  then both should be BOOLEAN. Here is my reasoning  copied from the related discussion on DERBY:1) The rules for determining whether two datatypes are union compatible are stated in the SQL Standard in part 2  section 7.3 (&lt;query expression&gt;)  syntax rule 20.b.ii.2) That  in turn  refers the reader to section 9.3 (Result of data type combinations).3) Section 9.3  syntax rule 3.g says that if either of two values to be merged is BOOLEAN  then both must be BOOLEAN.
