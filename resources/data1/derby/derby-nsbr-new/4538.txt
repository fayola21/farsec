If the CREATE TRIGGER does not have the REFERENCING clause  then there is no need to keep before and after values for the triggering table    In order for the trigger action to have access to before and after values of the triggering table  the CREATE TRIGGER should use the REFERENCING clause. Without the REFERENCING clause  old and new values of triggering table can't be accessed by the trigger action. Based on this  we can improve Derby memory utilization by not keeping old and new values if REFERENCING clause is missing. It will be good to see if the code already does this optimization and if not  then introducing this optimization will definitely be very useful when the triggering table could have LOB columns.
