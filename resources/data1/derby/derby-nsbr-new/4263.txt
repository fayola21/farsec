PropertySetter isn't able to recognize JDK without version number in path    With empty ant.properties and JDK 6 installed in /tmp/jdk as the only JDK on the system  PropertySetter complains that it's not able to set java16compile.classpath: ---- &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; PropertySetter environment = &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; java.vendor = Sun Microsystems Inc. &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; java.home = /tmp/jdk/jre &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; java.version = 1.6.0_13 &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; os.name = SunOS &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; j14lib = null &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; j15lib = null &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; j16lib = null &#91;setJdkProperties&#93; BUILD FAILED /code/derby/trunk0/build.xml:203: Don't know how to set java15compile.classpath  java16compile.classpath using this environment: java.vendor = Sun Microsystems Inc. java.home = /tmp/jdk/jre java.version = 1.6.0_13 os.name = SunOS j14lib = null j15lib = null j16lib = null'----Since it is able to detect both that the version of the default JDK is 1.6.0_13 and where it is installed  setting java16compile.classpath should be trivial.If the name of the JDK directory is changed from /tmp/jdk to /tmp/jdk1.6.0  Derby is built successfully.
