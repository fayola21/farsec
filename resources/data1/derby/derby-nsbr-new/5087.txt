NPE in istat daemon when encountering critical exception during shutdown    If the istat daemon encounters a critical error during shutdown and the data dictionary module has been stopped  it will run into a NPE.This bug is highly timing-dependent in two ways: the data dictionary module must have been stopped first  and then the istat daemon must encounter a critical error 'at the right time'.I have seen this bug once on my laptop.
