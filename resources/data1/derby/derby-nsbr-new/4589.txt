Corrupted database prevents startup and should be automatically repaired perhaps    I have found a database in my application that prevents startup due to it being corrupted. The driver reports that the database does not exist  even though it does. Then when my app tries to create the database using ;create=true; on the URL it fails.I think this happened due to the app being killed in Task Manager while it was creating the database.I have the database saved so that you can reproduce the problem. (I'm not sure if I can attach it yet)
