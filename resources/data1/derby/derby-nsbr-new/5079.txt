DERBY-4984 caused a regression which will not allow users to drop a table if the table was involved in a trigger action rebind during ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN    The fix for DERBY-4984 has introduced a regression which adds rows into SYSDEPENDS which are incorrect. The error I think was caused when before doing a rebind of trigger action  I made the trigger table as the current dependent in the dependency system and hence all the dependencies required by the trigger action got associated with that trigger table and hence causing the errorneous behavior. I will work on this asap. The fix went into trunk and 10.7. I will add a test case for this in the jira and will also add a test case in our junit test
