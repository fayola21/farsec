Log a page dump to derby.log if ERROR nospc: nospc.U  is returned to the user    ERROR nospc: nospc.U should only be an internal error that is caught and handled. If returned to the user  it is likely a bug. It would be useful if this occurs to have a page dump printed to derby.log. Care should be taken to only do this if the error is returned to the user and not for the internal variety.
