Replication tests fail on CDC platforms without optional JSSE package    The replication code uses the javax.net.ServerSocketFactory class  which is not part of the core API defined by Foundation Profile 1.1. It is however part of an optional security package (JSSE) defined by the same specification  so it may or may not be available on the CDC platforms that Derby runs on.Running the replication tests on phoneME without said optional package  results in NoClassDefFoundError:Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax.net.SocketFactory at org.apache.derby.impl.store.replication.net.ReplicationMessageTransmit$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.store.replication.net.ReplicationMessageTransmit.initConnection(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.store.replication.master.MasterController.setupConnection(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.store.replication.master.MasterController.startMaster(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.store.raw.RawStore.startReplicationMaster(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.store.access.RAMAccessManager.startReplicationMaster(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.db.BasicDatabase.startReplicationMaster(Unknown Source) at org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection.handleStartReplicationMaster(Unknown Source)We might fix this by rewriting the replication code so that it's not dependent on optional packages on CDC. However  there have not been any user requests for this functionality on platforms without that package  as far as I'm aware  so I suggest we just skip the replication tests for now if that package is missing.The tests I've run on Oracle Java Micro Edition Embedded Client 1.1 (OJEC) have not revealed this problem  as OJEC comes with the optional JSSE package (it's version output lists 'JSSE JSR219' under the components section). And since the reports from the weme 6.2 test runs don't show this failure  I think it's included there as well.
