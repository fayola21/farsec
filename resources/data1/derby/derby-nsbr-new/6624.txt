Use javax.xml.xpath interfaces for XPath support    Currently  Derby uses the interfaces in the org.w3c.dom.xpath package to implement XPath support. That package is not part of the Java SE specification. Even though the package is included as an internal API in some of the major Java runtimes  using the standard javax.xml.xpath package instead would be better. It would be more portable  and less likely to break in the future if JVM vendors remove the internal API.
