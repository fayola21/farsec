Syntax error when reference to transition variable has whitespace around it    If a trigger action references a transition variable and has whitespace around the period sign that separates the transition variable name from the column name  it fails with a syntax error.For example:ij&gt; create table t1(x int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; create table t2(x int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; --failscreate trigger tr1 after insert on t1 referencing new as newfor each row insert into t1 select x from t2 where x = new . x;ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered 'x' at line 1  column 150.Issue the 'help' command for general information on IJ command syntax.Any unrecognized commands are treated as potential SQL commands and executed directly.Consult your DBMS server reference documentation for details of the SQL syntax supported by your server.ij&gt; --succeedscreate trigger tr2 after insert on t1 referencing new as newfor each row insert into t1 select x from t2 where x = new.x;0 rows inserted/updated/deletedThe only difference between the failing trigger definition and the successful one  is that the former says 'new . x' and the latter 'new.x'.Both should succeed.
