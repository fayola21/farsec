Add derbyoptionaltools.jar to the class paths of the scripts in the bin directory    The derbyoptionaltools.jar should be added to the class paths constructed by all of the scripts in the bin distros which include derby.jar. Otherwise  the Lucene plugin (and future features which we put in derbyoptionaltools.jar) won't be available when you use the scripts to run ij  the network server  and sysinfo.For instance  you will see information on this jar file if you run sysinfo this way...java -jar derbyrun.jar sysinfo��_�__but not if you run the sysinfo script in the bin directory of a Derby installation.
