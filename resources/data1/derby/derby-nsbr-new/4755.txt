That section will need to change2)In Derby Developer's Guide  under section Derby System -&gt; Shutting down the systemAn eg of engine shutdown message in derby.log is2010-07-23 18:59:24.078 GMT Thread&#91;main 5 main&#93; :Shutting down Derby EngineAn eg of database shutdown message is as follows2010-07-20 17:23:55.171 GMT:Shutting down instance 80220011-0129-f0e1-f479-0000000c5ef0 on database directory C:/p4clients/svnmain/client2/trunk/systest/out142/dbs/tours3 with class loader sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@3f6e3f6e (Notice that this message includes the name of the db getting shutdown.
