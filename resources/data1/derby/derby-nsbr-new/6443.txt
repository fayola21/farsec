ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when calling function from trigger    I'm having problems will calling functions from within a trigger.The problem seems to be with the outer function call (FLOOR() in this case  but it also happens with other functions). It works fine in the SELECT statement  but when used in the trigger it throws a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.Remove the FLOOR() part from the trigger and it works fine.-- create source table and some dataCREATE TABLE foo (name VARCHAR(20)  val DOUBLE);INSERT INTO foo (name  val) VALUES ('A'  10)  ('A'  20)  ('B'  30)  ('C'  40);-- calling the function works fine hereSELECT name  FLOOR(AVG(LOG10(val)))  COUNT(*)FROM fooGROUP BY name;-- create target table for triggerCREATE TABLE summary (name VARCHAR(20)  aver DOUBLE  size INT);-- create the triggerCREATE TRIGGER trg_foo AFTER INSERT ON fooREFERENCING NEW TABLE AS changed FOR EACH STATEMENT MODE DB2SQLINSERT INTO summary (name  aver  size)SELECT name  FLOOR(AVG(LOG10(val)))  COUNT(*)FROM changedGROUP BY name;-- insert rows to cause trigger to fireINSERT INTO foo (name  val) VALUES ('A'  10)  ('A'  20)  ('B'  30)  ('C'  40);SELECT * FROM foo;SELECT * FROM summary;
