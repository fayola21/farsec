PropertySetter fails due to an empty jre/lib directory    If a JDK directory with an empty jre/lib directory is chosen by the old algorithm for detecting JDKs on the build system  the build fails because the classpath is set to the empty string instead of the default (stubs and the higher level JDK classpath).The situation causing this problem can arise if a JDK with extension libs is uninstalled. Depending on the packaging system  this may leave the jre/lib/ext directory behind.
