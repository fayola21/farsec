setTimestamp() methods don't agree on trailing zeros    With the statement VALUES CAST(? AS VARCHAR(29))PreparedStatement.setTimestamp(int Timestamp) and PreparedStatement.setTimestamp(int Timestamp Calendar) don't agree on what to do with trailing zeros in the nanosecond component. The method that doesn't take a Calendar argument  removes trailing zeros. The method that takes a Calendar object appends zeros so that the nanosecond component always has nine digits. (Both methods have a special case when nanoseconds is zero  and they agree on adding just a single zero after the decimal point in that case.)The format used by PreparedStatement.setTimestamp(int Timestamp) matches what java.sql.Timestamp.toString() returns (in fact  it uses Timestamp.toString() internally to produce the string representation)  and I think it would be reasonable to use that format for both the methods.
