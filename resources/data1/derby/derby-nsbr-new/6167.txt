Interrupt restarts clock for login timeout    If a login takes time  and the thread that's blocked in Driver20.timeLogin() is interrupted  it will call Future.get() again with the same timeout value. This means that interrupting a getConnection() call will not make it terminate faster  as one might expect. Instead  it restarts the timeout clock and makes it terminate later than if it had not been interrupted.
