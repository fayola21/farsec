Add method to obtain a bogus port in TestConfiguration    In some cases one needs to obtain a port number on which there is no Derby network server.Today this is solved in an ad-hoc way  for instance by using the current port minus one. When running tests in parallel  there is a chance that a port where there actually is a Derby network server listening is picked.As a start  I suggest that the bogus port is allocated to the last port in the port range configured for the run: baseport + MAX_PORTS_USED -1.
