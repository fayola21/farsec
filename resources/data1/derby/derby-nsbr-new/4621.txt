Invalid conversion from Timestamp to String when calling setTimestamp() with Calendar    If you set a VARCHAR parameter with setTimestamp()  the string will be formatted differently depending on whether a Calendar is specified or not  even if the default calendar is used.Take for example this statement: VALUES CAST(? AS VARCHAR(30))I executed this statement twice with the same Timestamp instance. First like this: ps.setTimestamp(1  ts);and then like this ps.setTimestamp(1  ts  Calendar.getInstance());In this example  both of the methods should use the default Calendar to convert the timestamp to a string. However  I see that they generate different strings:2010-04-20 15:17:36.0 vs 2010-04-20 03:17:36Note there are two differences:1) The method that takes a Calendar object does not show the fraction part (.0)2) The method that takes a Calendar object is 12 hours off (03 instead of 15)
