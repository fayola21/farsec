Don't run MessageVetter unless messages have changed    Continuing my series of patches micro-optimizing the build scripts...MessageVetter is always run as part of the build  also in incremental builds when nothing has changed. Since it needs to go through more than 800 files  it may take a while (just half a second on the fastest machine I tested  so not a big deal  but that's still a significant portion of the total time in an incremental build). We should skip the message check in incremental builds if none of the messages have changed.
