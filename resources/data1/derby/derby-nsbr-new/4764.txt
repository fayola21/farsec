Files with missing ASF license headers    There are some files (consisting of creative works) without license headers in the repository. Some files are also using a different text for the Apache License header then the other files.I plan to add the license header after having verified that the files were uploaded to Jira with the grant license to ASF bullet ticked.The list of files I have identified so far  grouped based on the assumed action required.&#8212; Add license headerjava/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/memory/TriggerTests.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINStatementDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINScanPropsDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINResultSetDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINStatementTimingsDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINSortPropsDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINResultSetTimingsDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/XPLAINTableDescriptor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINSystemTableVisitor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINDefaultVisitor.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINFactory.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINUtil.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINFactoryIF.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINable.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/execute/xplain/XPLAINVisitor.javajava/tools/org/apache/derby/tools/PlanExporter.javajava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/TreeNode.javajava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/AccessDatabase.javajava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/CreateHTMLFile.javajava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/CreateXMLFile.java&#8212; Update license headerjava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/jmxnone/NoManagementService.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/jmx/JMXManagementService.javajava/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/jmx/ManagementService.java&#8212; Consider adding headerjava/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/sanity/SanityState.javajava/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/sanity/SanityState.tmpljava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/advancedViewXSL.xsljava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/vanilla_html.xsljava/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/advancedViewXSL2.xslThe SanityState classes seem to come from somewhere. Does anyone have the history? Can we add the ASF license header?The xsl files also look like creative works to me. Any objections on that?
