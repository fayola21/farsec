Speed up message splitting in build    On a slow machine I sometimes use to build Derby  running the org.apache.derbyBuild.splitmessages tool takes 30 seconds and accounts for 15% of the total time needed to run 'ant -q buildsource' (which builds the engine  the network server and the client  but not the tests or demos). The tool is invoked 15 times  and each time a new Java process is started because the Ant target has specified fork='yes'. By changing it to run the splitmessages tool in the same Java process as the one running Ant  the time is reduced to 3-4 seconds on the same machine.
