Cannot use row_number() in ORDER BY clause    The following query works correctly:select abs(a)  row_number() over ()from twhere a &gt; 100 and a &lt; 111order by abs(a)I expected the following query to also work  but it raised an exception:select abs(a)  row_number() over ()from twhere a &gt; 100 and a &lt; 111order by row_number() over ()This is the error I saw: 'ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered 'over' at line 5  column 23'.Here are the reasons why I think that this syntax is supposed to be supported:According to my reading of the 2003 SQL spec  the ORDER BY clause should be able to sort on any expression in the SELECT list. That includes OLAP expressions. I believe this is so because  according to part 2  section 10.10 (&lt;sort specification&gt;)  a &lt;sort key&gt; can be any &lt;value expression&gt; and if you follow the grammar for &lt;value expression&gt;  it can resolve to be a &lt;value expression primary&gt; (see section 6.3)  which can in turn resolve to be a &lt;window function&gt;. This reasoning is supported by tracing the hotlinks on the following page which lays out the SQL 2003 BNF: http://savage.net.au/SQL/sql-2003-2.bnf.html This interpretation is further supported by the example of an ORDER BY clause referencing an OLAP expression which is provided on page 23 of the introduction to OLAP written by Fred Zemke  Krishna Kulkarni  Andy Witkowski  and Bob Lyle: www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/Data/Papers-Other/SQL1999/OLAP-99-154r2.pdf
