Documentation in release doesn't include stylesheets    The documentation that is bundled with the Derby releases does not include the three .css stylesheets that are copied into the out/&lt;manual-name&gt; directory by the Ant task that builds the HTML files. These need to be included in the docs/html/&lt;manual-name&gt; directories for the releases.I believe this problem has existed from the beginning &#8211; it certainly goes back several releases.
