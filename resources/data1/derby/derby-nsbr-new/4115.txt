Provide a way to drop statistics information    Now that DERBY-269 has been resolved  users can update statistics  but once they do  they are committed to using and maintaining the statistics  even if it doesn't improve performance or they have difficulty maintaining the statistics on a regular basis. It would be good to have a way to drop statistics information so that users could revert to the prior behavior if needed.
