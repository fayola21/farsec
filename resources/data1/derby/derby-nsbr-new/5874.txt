Remove JDBC 3 constants from client.am.Statement    org.apache.derby.client.am.Statement defines three constants  CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT  KEEP_CURRENT_RESULT and CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS  that are also defined in java.sql.Statement. Since client.am.Statement implements java.sql.Statement  we could remove those constants and let it inherit them instead. The only reason why these constants are defined in client.am.Statement  is to make the client compile on JDKs predating JDBC 3 (that is  Java 1.3 and earlier). Since we don't support those JDKs anymore  the constants can be removed now.
