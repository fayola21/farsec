Reduce number of jar invocations in the buildjars target    When building derby.jar  derbytools.jar and derbynet.jar  the build script runs the jar target twice for each of the jars. The first jar invocation creates the jar and adds some files  and the second one updates the jars with some more files. It would be simpler to create each of the jar files in a single invocation  and it would also cut off a few seconds on the time to build the jars.
