ClientConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection and ClientXADataSource.getXAConnection ignore connection attributes    The methods CCPDS.getPooledConnection and CXADS.getXAConnection fail to pick up attributes set with setConnectionAttributes(String).The current regression tests fail to detect this  because they obtain a connection using getConnection(). I'm not sure if this method should be present in a XADataSource at all  but this problem should be addressed by a separate issue.
