BTreeController.comparePreviousRecord() may fail to release latch on left-most leaf    If comparePreviousRecord() is called on some other leaf page than the left-most leaf  and all the rows to the left of the current position are deleted so that the position is moved all the way to slot 0 on the left-most leaf  comparePreviousRecord() will return without releasing the latch on the left-most leaf. Only the leaf on which comparePreviousRecord() is called should be latched when the method returns.Since comparePreviousRecord() currently fails to continue after finding a deleted row  this bug is not possible to expose until DERBY-4028 is fixed.
