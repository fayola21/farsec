LOBStateTracker should not use SYSIBM.CLOBRELEASELOCATOR when the database is soft-upgraded from 10.2    Reported by Daniel Noll on derby-user: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.user/9107To reproduce: 1. Create a database with Derby 10.2.2.0 2. Create a table with a clob column and insert some data 3. Access that database with client+server at version 10.4.1.3 and iterate through the rows in the tableYou'll see an error message like this:ERROR 42Y03: 'SYSIBM.CLOBRELEASELOCATOR' is not recognized as a function or procedure.
