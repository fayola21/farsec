Change derby.tests.trace to print the class as well as fixture name    I was thinking it would be good for the test output with -Dderby.tests.trace=true to have the class name as well as the fixture as I think if I had a nickel for every time I grepped for a fixture name to find out what class it is in  I would have a pretty big piggy bank.It could print the full class name  like this:org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.lang.SimpleTest.testBasicOperations used 844 ms .or strip off the org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests for less output like:tests.lang.SimpleTest.testBugFixes used 6265 ms .Any preferences?
