Behaviour of setTypeMap() differs between embedded and client    On the embedded driver  Connection.setTypeMap() behaves like this (when the connection is not closed): if the map argument is null  throw an SQLException with SQLState XJ081 if the map is not null and not empty  throw an SQLException with SQLState 0A000 if the map is not null and empty  do nothingThe behaviour on the client driver is this: always throw an SQLException with SQLState 0A000We should try to make the two drivers behave the same way when setTypeMap() is called. (This would also allow us to simplify some of the tests in J2EEDataSourceTest).
