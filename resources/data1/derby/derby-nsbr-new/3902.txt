some messages are referenced but never used - MessageBundleTest output    MessageBundleTest was taken out of derbyall because it only ran with classes  not with jars  and it was decided that it would be better to make this into a build check rather than a test...However  the build check - DERBY-1458 - was never implemented  and so  the test has not been run.When I ran  I got the following output:testSQLStateOrphanedIds ERROR: Message id 22003.S.4 in SQLState.java was not found in messages_en.propertiesERROR: Message id XCL32.S in SQLState.java was not found in messages_en.propertiesERROR: Message id X0RQ3.C in SQLState.java was not found in messages_en.propertiesERROR: Message id XSAX1 in SQLState.java was not found in messages_en.propertiesused 188 ms .testMessageIdOrphanedIds used 0 ms .testMessageBundleOrphanedMessages WARNING: Message id 22004.S.4 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id J106 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id J107 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id J108 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id J109 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id 08000.S.1 in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id XCL17.S in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaWARNING: Message id XJ102.S in messages_en.properties is not referenced in either SQLState.java or MessageId.javaused 0 ms Some of these are known issues  e.g. XCL32 - it's been in MessageBundleTest.out for a long time...XSAX1 looks like a assumption mismatch in MessageBundleTest  see DERBY-1413....But others need some minor code changes/cleanup  for instance  looks like the need for J106 was removed during DERBY-2692  see http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&amp;revision=543428  and should probably get removed from messages_en.properties/messages.xml.Needs further checking.
