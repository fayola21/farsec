Simplify JSR-169 implementation class tree    The JSR-169 interface is a subset of JDBC 3.0  but still the JDBC 3.0 implementation classes do not extend the JSR-169 implementation classes. Instead  the JSR-169 and JDBC 3.0 implementation classes extend a common base class. The reason for this structure  is that the JSR-169 compile targets used to be optional  so the JDBC 3.0 classes could not depend on them.For example  the class javadoc comment for EmbedResultSet169 says: ResultSet implementation for JSR169. Adds no functionality to its (abstract) parent class. If Derby could be compiled against JSR169 that the parent class could be the concrete class for the environment. Just like for the JDBC 2.0 specific classes. Until that is possible (ie. easily downloadable J2ME/CDC/Foundation/JSR169 jar files  this class is required and is only compiled by an optional target.Since the JSR-169 code is no longer optional  we should do as the comment suggests  and use the base class directly instead. This would allow us to simplify the class tree.
