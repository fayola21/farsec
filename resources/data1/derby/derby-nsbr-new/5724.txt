EncryptionKeyTest sometimes keeps reference to connection    EncryptionKeyTest has this code to clean up the connection: if (con != null &amp;&amp; !con.isClosed()) { con.rollback(); con.close(); con = null; }If the connection is already closed  it won't null out the reference. It should set con to null unconditionally.
