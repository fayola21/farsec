intermittent test failure in storetests/st_derby715.java    I am seeing an irregularly occurring failure with ibm 1.4.2 on one machine - which happens to be the only 4 CPU machine and the only one running Windows 2008...And I've got 10.8 nightly tests running on it.I have not seen this with other jvms on the same machine.It's possible this would also happen on trunk  but we stopped supporting 1.4.2 with trunk and so I do not run tests against trunk with (ibm) 1.4.2.When the test passes  the output contains 5 identical lines 'Got a Deadlock'.The test failures are of 2 kinds: 1 (or more?) of the 'Got a Deadlock' lines is missing we get a '40XL1' error (timeout) instead of a deadlock.As the second situation seems to match what DERBY-715 was about  I thought it worthwhile reporting as a separate JIRA. We should check it's not somehow a regression.
