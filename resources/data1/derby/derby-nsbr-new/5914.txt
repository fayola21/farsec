Incorrect list of compatible JRE versions in client trace #2    The list of compatible JRE versions is out of sync again. It currently says 1.4  1.5  and 1.6.For trunk I believe we must remove 1.4  and we should add 1.7.For 10.9  if we want to change it  I think we can keep 1.4? And 1.7 was out and supported before we released 10.9  right?This issue was logged as DERBY-5078 the previous time it was out of sync.
