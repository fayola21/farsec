Interrupt of create table or index (i.e. a container) will throw XSDF1 under NIO - connection survives    Cf the enclosed repro. It would be good to make Derby ignore the interrupt here. Cf DERBY-4741. Note that this is less serious than in the cases referred to in DERBY-4741: here the database does not get shut down  even the connection survives  cf the repro. So  this can be considered a follow-up to DERBY-4741 to further improve Derby's robustness under interrupts.
