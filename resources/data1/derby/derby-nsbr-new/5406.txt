Intermittent failures in CompressTableTest and TruncateTableTest    The test cases CompressTableTest.testConcurrentInvalidation() and TruncateTableTest.testConcurrentInvalidation() fail intermittently with errors such as:ERROR XSAI2: The conglomerate (2 720) requested does not exist.The problem has been analyzed in the comments on DERBY-4275  and a patch attached to that issue (invalidation-during-compilation.diff) fixes the underlying race condition. However  that patch only works correctly together with the fix for DERBY-5161  which was backed out because it caused the regression DERBY-5280.We will therefore need to find a way to fix DERBY-5161 without reintroducing DERBY-5280 in order to resolve this issue.
