PositionedStoreStream doesn't initialize itself properly    When a PositionedStoreStream is created on top of a stream from store  it must properly initialize itself.Proper initialization consists of initializing and resetting the stream to make sure the states of the streams are in sync.A case of out of sync stream states was detected in a test where the Clob reference wasn't kept  but a new Clob object was created for each operation  i.e: rs.getClob(1).length(); rs.getClob(1).getSubString(...);A symptom of out of sync stream states is EOFException on a valid request.I don't think the access style above is supposed to work  but the proper initialization should be performed anyway.
