It should be possible to run unit tests right after 'ant all'    Right now  the property 'derby.junit.classpath' is empty by default. There should be an ant target which sets the correct classpath to run all tests after an initial checkout and 'ant all'.The current situation is very confusing to beginners and people who try to build Derby for the first time. For example  when running the tests  I got this exception:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.derbyTesting.junit.EnvTestbut that class was there  the file was there  everything was correct. Googling for the error didn't turn anything up  either. It took me a while to believe that build.xml just wouldn't try to setup a classpath for the tests.
