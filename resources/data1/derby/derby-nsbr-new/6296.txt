Simplify PropertyUtil using Properties.stringPropertyNames()    PropertyUtil should use Properties.stringPropertyNames() (new method in Java 6) instead of Properties.propertyNames() since a Set&lt;String&gt; view of the property names is easier to work with than an Enumeration&lt;?&gt;. The Set&lt;String&gt; view can be used with for-each loops and many of the helper methods in the standard library.
