Cannot find Ant libraries when building from NetBeans    Building Derby doesn't work out of the box in NetBeans. The wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/BuildingDerby instructs NetBeans users to specify the ant.library.dir property in order to get the build working.The Ant documentation says the following about the ant.library.dir property: 'The following property is only set if Ant is started via the Launcher class (which means it may not be set inside IDEs either)' - http://ant.apache.org/manual/properties.htmlSince the property is not guaranteed to be set  I suggest that we replace references to '${ant.library.dir}/ant.jar' with references to '${ant.core.lib}' in the build scripts. According to the above mentioned Ant manual page the ant.core.lib property should always be available and point to ant.jar. Changing this makes it possible to build Derby from NetBeans with no special customization.
