Connections opened by ForeignTableVTI never get released    I noticed during a run of suites.All that one database instance never got garbage collected  even after it had been shut down. It turned out it could not get garbage collected because it was still referenced from the static HashMap _connections in ForeignTableVTI. Looking closer at ForeignTableVTI  it looks as if it only calls put() and get() on the HashMap  never remove()  so its memory footprint will keep increasing as it is used.It would be good to have some way (preferably automatic) of releasing the resources held by ForeignTableVTI when they are no longer needed.
