Add proper delete mechanism for in-memory databases    The current mechanism for deleting in-memory databases isn't good enough  and a proper one must be added.It is also important to be able to delete in-memory databases  since they occupy valuable main memory that should be discarded when the database is no longer needed.I intend to implement the mechanism by using the JDBC connection URL:'jdbc:derby:memory:myDatabase;delete=true&#91;;user=X;password=Y&#93;The connection attempt will throw an exception in any case  either because the request failed or because it succeeded.Reasons for a failure can be invalid user and/or password  lacking encryption attributes  or conflicting attributes.For the time being  only the database owner will be allowed to delete databases (note: do we have a way to control/limit in-memory database creation?)
