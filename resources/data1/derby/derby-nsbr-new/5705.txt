Authorization decorators don't null out connections when done    Some decorators used to test authorization don't close and null out references to Connection objects when they have completed. Since these tests often create/boot single-use databases  and the Connection objects have references to the database instance and  directly or indirectly  many of its modules  this prevents much garbage from being removed from the heap after the tests have completed and shut down their single-use databases. We should close the default connection and clear the reference to it when tearing down these decorators  so the space is released for subsequent tests to use.This problem affects decorators returned by the following methods:DatabasePropertyTestSetup.builtinAuthenticationNoTeardown()TestConfiguration.sqlAuthorizationDecorator()TestConfiguration.sqlAuthorizationDecoratorSingleUse()These methods return modified versions of DatabasePropertyTestSetup where the tearDown() method is a no-op.
