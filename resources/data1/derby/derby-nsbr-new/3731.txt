Improve calculation of refSize in ClassSize.java    java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/cache/ClassSize.java has a static code block which calculates the size of a reference for the architecture. This code could be improved by adding garbage collection before measuring memory  to give a consistent reading. Also there have been suggestions that we use os.arch or sun.arch.data.model to make the measurement more reliable  especially on 64bit machines.
