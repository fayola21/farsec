Incorrect use of CharsetEncoder in DDMWriter    DDMWriter has two calls to CharsetEncoder.encode()  in writeLDString() and writeString(). According to the javadoc for CharsetEncoder  one should call reset() before one calls encode()  and flush() after on. DDMWriter doesn't call reset() or flush(). I'm not aware of any problems that happen because of it  but we should follow the spec to avoid surprises.
