Too few arguments when generating AM_RECORD_NOT_FOUND error    The message for AM_RECORD_NOT_FOUND has three parameters  but all the methods that generate an exception with that message  only use two of them. So the generated message ends up looking like this:ERROR XSAM6: Record {2} on page 7 in container 625 not found.whereas it should have looked like this:ERROR XSAM6: Record 7 on page 1 in container 625 not found.I don't know if these messages ever make it all the way up to the application  since they are typically caught by this code block in TableScanResultSet: if (se.getMessageId().equals(SQLState.AM_RECORD_NOT_FOUND)) { // Somehow the row got deleted between the above // doesCurrentPositionQualify() call and here (one way is if // this scan is read uncommitted isolation level). return null; }But they may be logged in derby.log if the log severity level is set appropriately.
