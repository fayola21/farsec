Replace Utils.min and Utils.max in the client driver with standard methods in java.lang.Math    The client has a utility class implementing functions for choosing the smallest and the largest int. These functions are already defined in java.lang.Math  and should be used instead because they are more familiar and because there is no need to duplicate the functionality.
