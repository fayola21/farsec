After specifying deregister=false on the engine shutdown URL  Derby forgets that the default behavior is deregister=true    If you shutdown the engine specifying deregister=false  then get a new connection  then shutdown the engine again without specifying any value for the deregister attribute  Derby acts as though you specified deregister=false again. I will attach a test program which shows this problem.
