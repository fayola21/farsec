InputStream returned from Blob.getBinaryStream(long  long) terminates the stream by returning 0  should return -1    Take the following code to copy a sub-stream from a BLOB:Blob blob = rs.getBlob(1);InputStream stream = blob.getBinaryStream(1000  2000);try { IOUtils.copy(stream  out);} finally { stream.close();}This will loop forever in IOUtils.copy  as the InputStream is returning 0 at end of stream instead of -1. It probably should return -1 to comply with the Javadoc for InputStream.Notes:I have not yet checked Blob.getBinaryStream()  or any of the Clob methods  or the client driver. So some of these may have a similar issue.
