SYSCS_BULK_INSERT doesn't quote identifiers or strings properly    Discovered by Mamta A. Satoor in DERBY-1062.SYSCS_BULK_INSERT builds an insert statement in which it doesn't quote the schema name or the table name. It also takes string parameters that are inserted into the statement text with single quotes around them  but that won't work if those strings contain single quote characters.
