With derby client setTransactionIsolation executes and commits even if isolation has not changed    With in EmbedConnection.setIsolation() we have a check to see if the isolation level is the same and if so just return without doing a commit: public void setTransactionIsolation(int level) throws SQLException { if (level == getTransactionIsolation()) return;with org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection we have no such check. It would be good if the client driver acted like embedded.
