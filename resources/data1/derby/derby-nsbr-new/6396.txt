NullPointerException in DirFile    We got a NullPointerException trying to start a Derby database in embedded mode; the stacktrace indicated it happened in org.apache.derby.impl.io.DirFile.deleteAll(); that method got called from org.apache.derby.impl.io.BaseStorageFactory.createTempDir().After investigating  it appears that the deleteAll() method calls 'super.list()'  which according to the java.io.File specifications  can return null. But the deleteAll() method doesn't handle that case gracefully.
