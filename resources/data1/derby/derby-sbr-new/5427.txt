Unauthorized shutdown should not generate thread dump and javacore. AuthenticationTest dumps over 20 javacores with IBM JVM for normal user errors    If jdbcapi.AuthenticationTest is run without changing the derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel as is done in the test  it generates thread dumps and javacores for IBM jvms. I beleive the errors in this test are expected user errors and not crashes so they should not generate a thread dump or javacore. To reproduce remove this line from test: //Derby-4856 set the property to avoid thread dump and diagnostic info sysprops.put('derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel' '50000');Until fixed  users can work around the issue by setting derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel to 50000 as is done in the test.
