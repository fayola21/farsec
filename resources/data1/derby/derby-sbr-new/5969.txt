Encryption  re-encryption  and un-encryption silently fail if the database is already booted.    If the database is already booted  then the DBO's attempt to re-encrypt or un-encrypt the database will silently fail. It will appear to the DBO that the re(un)encryption succeeded but in fact the database will not be changed. Derby should raise an error if the database is already booted when the DBO attempts re(un)encryption.
