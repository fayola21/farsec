Update demo's to remove references to com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver    SimpleApp.java is still refering to DB2 JDBC driver. I think it should be take out to reflect DB2 driver is no longer supported.There are also some typos in SimpleApp.java. i.e. noone  retreiving  etc.example.html that should be updated as well.Kathey mention nserverdemo also has references to the DB2 driver. This issue will address that as well.
