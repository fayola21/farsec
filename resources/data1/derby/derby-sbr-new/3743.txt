Revoking EXECUTE privilege on a function if used in a CHECK constraint: implementation problem    The docs say that REVOKE EXECUTE ... RESTRICT should fail if there is a dependent constraint:'The RESTRICT clause specifies that the EXECUTE privilege cannot be revoked if the specified routine is used in a view  trigger  or constraint  and the privilege is being revoked from the owner of the view  trigger  or constraint.' Revoking the privilege will be correctly restricted  but possibly for the wrong reason.
