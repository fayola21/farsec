test nstest generates errors XBM06 re reencryption and 22003 re value outside range for decimal/numeric    The test nstest (both in embedded and networkserver) ran into a JVM-bug-related error the last few times I tried it; but with a newer jvm I notice it's generating an XBM06 error:XBM06: Startup failed. An encrypted database cannot be accessed without the correct boot password. From the test's README.txt it shows it is indeed attempting to re-encrypt  but this is failing.The test needs to be tightened up so it doesn't show unusual errors.The test also generates:22003: The resulting value is outside the range for the data type DECIMAL/NUMERIC(5 0)The test's readme and comments don't indicate this is a negative test  so this too should get tightened/cleaned up.
