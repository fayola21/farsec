Setting derby.database.classpath to contain installed jars causes the database to be unbootable when a Securitymanager is installed.    If the jars are sucessfully installed (without a security manager see DERBY-537) and the class path set then subsequent boots with a security manager fail with a SecurityException due to trying to install a class loader.Related to DERBY-537 but not the same.
