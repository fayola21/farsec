AES encryption test fails on Solaris 10    The store/aes.sql test on Solaris 10 produces the following diff report:     Start: aes jdk1.4.2_02 2005-05-30 12:13:17 ***206 del&lt; ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'Wrong keysize: must be equal to 128  192 or 256: java.security.InvalidParameterException'.206a206&gt; ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'AES key length must be 128  192  or 256 bits: java.security.InvalidParameterException'.Test Failed. End: aes jdk1.4.2_02 2005-05-30 12:14:06 ***    The cause of this problem is that on most OSs  the java.security.InvalidParameterException thrown by the JVM when an invalid encryption key length is requested contains a message with the following text: Wrong keysize: must be equal to 128  192 or 256while on Solaris 10 the message contained in the exception has been changed to: AES key length must be 128  192  or 256 bitsThe reason for this is most likely that a different encryption library is included in Solaris 10 comparedto the other OSs  either as part of the JVM or as a native library.The problem occurs on Solaris 10 running on both x86 and Sparc processors. It occurs both with jdk 1.4 and jdk 1.5.
