introduce a new test type to run junit tests from the current harness    It seems to me that for including a new JUnit test into i.e derby-all we need to make a new java class with a main() method  which parses a command line and set up the testsuite and run it  just like any java program. Basically we are running the junit tests as test type 'java'.Instead of having to do this for every junit test going into a derby test suite  I would propose a different strategy.I propose to introduce a new test type called 'junit' (current test types are: sql sql2 unit java multi demo - unit is not junit)Then you can use:java org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest &lt;TestCaseClassName&gt;.junitto run a Junit test - instead of:java org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest &lt;AnotherClassWithMainMethod&gt;.javaWhen starting a test of type junit  the RunTest class may simply use thejunit.textui.TestRunner class  which has a main method which takes a TestCase class name as parameter. The junit.textui.TestRunner runs the tests defined by the suite() method of the TestCase class.I think this strategy will make it easier to integrate new JUnit tests into the current test suites  since it save you the trouble of creating a java class with a main method for every test.
