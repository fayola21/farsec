Code paths for db restore do not use doPrivileged-calls  causing SecurityException    When using 'createFrom' or 'restoreFrom' in the JDBC url to restore a database from a backup image  a SecurityException is thrown even though the policyfile for codebase derby.jar is correctly configured (giving Derby access to the backup image).A few comments on this issue can be found here (and in subsequent comments): https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1001#action_12439811A workaround is wrapping the connection call in doPrivileged at the 'application-level code'  or granting the required permissions to the application codebase as well.
