Add Support for network Server USRIDONL security    Currently Network Server supports only two security mechanisms.User ID and password (usridpwd)User ID and encrypted password (eusridpwd)It would be good to add support for User ID Only security so that it could more closely match the embedded driver and not always require a password.See details of security mechanism implementations in section 4.4.2.1 of DRDA V3 Vol. 1: Distributed Relational Database Architecture http://www.opengroup.org/dbiop/
