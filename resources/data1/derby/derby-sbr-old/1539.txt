A  trigger should be dropped when a privilege required by the trigger is revoked.    A trigger tracks its privileges requirements using Derby's Dependency Manager. If any one of those required privileges are revoked  the trigger should be dropped automatically. I am just creating a new jira entry here so it is easier to track sub items of DERBY-1330. Will link this Jira entry to DERBY-1330.See the functional spec attached to DERBY-1330
