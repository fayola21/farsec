Make test jdbc4/TestPreparedStatement run under the security manager    See trunk/java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbc4/TestPreparedStatement_app.properties which says: test fails trying to read blob content filesOther tests succesfully read files so it must be possible to enable this test under the security manager.Maybe the files need to be marked as support files and copied into the extin/extout/extinout foldersto use the existing permissions in the test policy files.
