Wrong connection object used in EmbedConnection.clearLOBMapping()    I think there are two bugs in EmbedConnection.clearLOBMapping(): 1) It checks if lobHashMap is non-null  but it should have checked rootConnection.lobHashMap. 2) It calls getlobHMObj().clear() regardless of whether there is a HashMap. This creates a HashMap object even though it's not needed  and all the subsequent transactions on that connection have to perform cleanup on that object.
