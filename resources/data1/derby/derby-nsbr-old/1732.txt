The language and store systems treat a JVM error such as OutOfMemoryError differently leading to the raw store protocol violation errors    Don't have the exact details  but remember noticing it a while ago. I think the store transaction context closes the transaction on such an error  while the language conneciton context just rollsback the transaction or the statement. I think the best and consistent approach would be to close the connection.
