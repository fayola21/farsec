getBinaryStream returns incorrect result (truncated value) if underlying blob is deleted    If getBinaryStream is reading a value (READ_UNCOMMITTED) and the row is deleted by another connection  a truncated value will be returned without error. I believe instead either the whole value or an IOException should occur.With 10.2 and higher with the repro attahed we get:&gt; java TruncatedBlobEmbedded:Read 32669 bytes0 rows in BLOBCLOBWith 10.1Embedded:Read 40000 bytes (OK)0 rows in BLOBCLOB Note network server returns the full value for both 10.1 and 10.2 but gives a lock timeout for 10.2+. I will file a separate issue for that.
