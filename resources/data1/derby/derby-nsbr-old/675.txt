Build-time processing of 'metadata.properties' file handles slashes incorrectly.    As found and described by Mamta here:http://www.nabble.com/-Derby-573-Optimizer-overrides-and-metadata.properties-files-t460642.htmlDuring the ant build process  Derby's metadata.properties file is modified by the ODBCMetadataGenerator class and that class treats backslashes that occur in the metadata.properties file incorrectly. More specifically  it treats every backslash as the end of a line and thus will translate things likeFROM --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED n /intoFROM --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED //n /(in other words  escaped characters like '/n' are handled incorrectly)..
