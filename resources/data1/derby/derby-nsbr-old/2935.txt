DDMReader.readLengthAndCodePoint() decodes long integer incorrectly    DDMReader.readLengthAndCodePoint() contains code to decode a long integer from a byte array. This code is broken since it uses int operations and not long operations in the decoding. The long might be encoded using four  six or eight bytes  and since Derby currently always uses the four bytes encoding  the bug is not exposed in the current code.
