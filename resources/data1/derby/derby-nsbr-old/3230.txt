Selecting data from a Table raises Error XN008: Query processing has been terminated due to an error on the server    I got a table (PCLASS) in my database where I cannot select the data via a simple select statement: If I execute 'select * from PCLASS': XN008: Query processing has been terminated due to an error on the server If I execute 'select * from PCLASS order by CLASSNAME': it works If I add or remove only one row to/from the table: it worksIf I use the embedded driver everything works fine. But as soon as I use the derby network client to access the database  this problem occurs.This is very odd. I spent a lot of time to do some research on this behavior because I could not believe that the network client produces errors depending on the data contained in a table. But after all it looks like I managed to fill the table with an exact amount of data that causes this error to arise.To reproduce the problem download the attached file and follow these instructions: extract test.rar to $derby.system.home$ start derby network server start ji utility and execute the following commands:  connect to database test using client driver: connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost/test;user=ZOL;password=zol'; select content of table PCLASS select * from PCLASS;--&gt; Error XN008: Query processing has been terminated due to an error on the server      disconnect from database disconnect; shutdown database 'test' connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost/test;user=ZOL;password=zol;shutdown=true'; connect to database 'test' using embedded driver: connect 'jdbc:derby:test;user=ZOL;password=zol'; select content of table PCLASS select * from PCLASS;--&gt; everything o.k.
