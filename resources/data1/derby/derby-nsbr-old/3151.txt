Reduce dependency on NetworkServerControl in TestConfiguration    Code has been added in TestConfiguration to allow for starting and stopping a Derby network server.Even if you know will not need this functionality  or you simply don't want to have this functionality available  you must include derbynet.jar (or point to classes/).I think this dependency should be reduced  by not having any instance variables and by not importing the class with an explicit import statement. The existing instance variables are not used.With this planned change  you can run tests without including derbynet.jar on the classpath  as long as they don't call 'startNetworkServer' or 'stopNetworkServer'. Most often these methods will be called by a decorator.The downside of this change  is that you won't get any error messages before the mentioned methods are actually executed.A typical error message:Failed to invoke suite():java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/derby/drda/NetworkServerControlI'm sure there are other solutions as well  but this one is really easy.Any opinions on this change?
