SUR: Use DRDA's extended diagnostic to send ROW_UPDATED and ROW_DELETED warnings.    Detectability of own changes is implemented in the client using warnings cf the write-up for DERBY-775. When a row has been deleted and/or updated  a warning will be sent to the client to indicate that fact. Presently  only one warning can be sent each time a data row is sent from to the client  that means that some warnings may be lost. Using extended diagnostic allows us to send several warnings for each data row.I propose to use extended diagnostics to send ROW_UPDATED and ROW_DELETED warnings when necessary. This may later be extended for other warnings  but I do not plan to do it as a part of the work in this issue.
