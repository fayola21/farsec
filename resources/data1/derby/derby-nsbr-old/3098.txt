LOB locks are not released after free().    When getBlob/getClob is called on the ResultSet  the current row islocked if the JDBC driver does not cache the entire LOB value inmemory. This is done to prevent the Blob/Clob object from beingchanged. Until now  this lock has been held to the end of thetransaction.JDBC4 introduced free() methods for the Blob/Clob class. The lockingshould be changed so that the locks is releases when the Blob/Clobobject is freed.
