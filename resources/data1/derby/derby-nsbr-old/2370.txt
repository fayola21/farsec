EXISTS may return the wrong value for sub-queries involving set operations    It seems like EXISTS on a SELECT returning zero rows returns false (asexpected)  but EXISTS on INTERSECT of two disjunct sets returns true e.g EXISTS (values 1 intersect values 2).Yip Ng wrote on derby-dev:I believe its probably got to do with the EXISTS subquery transformingthe original RCL toa TRUE boolean value for the INTERSECT. So during row comparison atexecution timefor INTERSECT processing since true == true(thus intersects)  so itwill always return 'BAD'. Likewise select * from ( values 'OK' ) as T where exists (values 1 except values 2);This supposedly should return 'OK' but because of the booleantransformation mentionedabove for EXISTS subquery  it will return no rows for EXCEPTprocessing.
