getAsciiStreamshould replace non-ASCII characters with 0x3f  '?'  to match embedded    When calling Clob.getAsciiStream or ResultSet.getAsciiStream if the column type is a character type or a CLOB  then any out of range character (to the ASCII set) needs to be replaced by 0x3f ('?'  question mark). ASCII is defined as 8 bit characters  thus Unicode Characters in the range 0x0000 to 0x00ff are mapped to ASCII characters 0x00 to 0xff  and Unicode characters in the range 0x0100 to 0xffff are mapped to 0x3fBy code inspection:client code in org.apache.derby.client.am.ResultSetembedded in org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.ReaderToAscii
