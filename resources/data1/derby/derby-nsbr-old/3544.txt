If NetworkServer fails to shutdown when run as a separate process by NetworkServerTestSetup  test run will hang    If the NetworkServer fails to shutdown for some reason  we do not clean up the process but will just hang the tests. We should kill off the process if the server fails to shutdown and continue. To reproduce try runnning the test derbynet.SecureServerTest with 10.3 derbyTesting.jar and 10.4 jars. See DERBY-3534 for details.
