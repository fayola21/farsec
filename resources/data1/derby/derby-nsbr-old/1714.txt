huge single insert statements fail with JVM error due to size of generated method    ERROR XBCM1: Java linkage error thrown during load of generated class org.apache.derby.exe.ace5214067x010dx1c21xe385x00000011be005.ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'Invalid method Code length 68686 in class file org/apache/derby/exe/ace5214067x010dx1c21xe385x00000011be005: java.lang.ClassFormatError'.The above occurred when doing an insert statement using the mutiple row syntax 'INSERT INTO foo (...) VALUES (...)  (...) ...' for huge amounts of input data. I was able to insert 500 rows at once  but it balked at 1000.Workaround: chunk one huge insert into several merely big inserts before sending them to Derby.
