Updating Building.txt    We (Svein Erik L�_۴_�vland and Henrik Holum) have updated the building.txt document for Derby Trunk. We built the code following every step of the document  and here are our suggested changes. A review of the changes would be appresiated.Removed the empty subsections  and updated the section and subsection numbers. We also updated the references according to the new subsection numbers.Removed 2.2.3 and 2.2.4Renamed 2.2.5 -&gt; 2.2.3  2.2.6 -&gt; 2.2.4 and 2.2.7 -&gt; 2.2.52.1Added 3 directories2.2.1 (1)Updated the text to indicate that any newer version than 1.6.3 can be used. Old text indicated that you could only use 1.6.x versions  not 1.7.2.2.2 (2) and (4) (Windows)Updated the URLs to point directly to download pages for the desired java versions2.2.3 (Previous 2.2.5)Can we use Junit 3.8.2 or does it have to be 3.8.1? if Junit 3.8.2 can be used the link can be replaced with http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/junit/junit3.8.2.zip. Also update the text to indicate these changes (3.8.*)2.2.5 (Previous 2.2.7)Moved the Optional tag to be consistent with 2.2.4 (Previous 2.2.6) We updated references in the note to reflect the new subsection number.3.3 (3)Updated the number of jar files with local support to 13 instead of 9.We have used Windows XP  so we have not checked the *nix or Mac settings.Hope this is helpfull-Henrik and Svein Erik
