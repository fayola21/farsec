Interface changes introduced in Mustang build 86    Build 86 of Mustang introduced changes to the Connection interface that were not compatible with the existing Derby implementions. createArray() was renamed createArrayOf() and setClientInfoProperties() now throws SQLClientInfoException (rather than ClientInfoException). The result of this is that it is not possible to build Derby with build 86.
