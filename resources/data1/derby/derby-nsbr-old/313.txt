testing/README.htm property descriptions: testSpecialProps wrongly named; useprocess omitted    In section 4.12 in ../testing/README.htm  the property  TestSpecialFlags is described for specifying additional properties to RunTest. I could notfind any evidence of this in RunTest or elsewhere. However  the property testSpecialPropsis supported by RunTest.java. I found this to work. This propertyalso has a syntax for specifying more than one property using a '^'delimiter between properties  i.e. testSpecialProps=&lt;prop-1&gt;=&lt;value-1&gt;^ ... ^&lt;prop-n&gt;=&lt;value-n&gt;Also I noticed the property 'useprocess' (default=true) for controllingwhether RunTest runs the test in a separate vm or a thread in currentvm isn't documented in README.htm. I suggest it be included  sinceit's potentially useful for debugging tests. I could include it in thepatch for derby-313 (I don't think anybody committed it yet) or file anew JIRA issue.Looking at RunTest reveals that unit tests are not (yet) runnable with'useprocess=false'  though.
