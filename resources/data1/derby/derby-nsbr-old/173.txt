For the concurrency of ResultSet  Network Server should not send the concurrency of Statement.    I am working on getting updatable resulset functionality to work under Network Server. One issue that I found is Network Server sends the concurrency of the Statement object when it really needs to send the concurrency of the Resultset. This was ok in the past because CONCUR_READ_ONLY was the only concurreny supported by Derby. But  now with the support of CONCUR_UPDATABLE  it is possible that the concurrency of ResultSet might not be same as the Statement object. Hence  Network Server should send the concurrency of the ResultSet object if that is what the protocol calls for.The fix for this is localized in java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java.
