during crash recovery of a drop table  on case insensitive files systems derby may delete wrong file    Sometimes during redo the system will incorrectly remove the file associatedwith a table. The bug requires the following conditions to reproduce:1) The OS/filesystem must be case insensitive such that a request to delete a file named C2080.dat would also remove c2080.dat. This is true in windows default file systems  not true in unix/linux filesystems that I am aware of.2) The system must be shutdown not in a clean manner  such that a subsequent access of the database causes a REDO recovery action of a drop table statement. This means that a drop table statement must have happened since the last checkpoint in the log file. Examples of things that cause checkpoints are: o clean shutdown from ij using the 'exit' command o clean shutdown of database using the 'shutdown=true' url o calling the checkpoint system procedure o generating enough log activity to cause a regularly scheduled checkpoint.3) If the conglomerate number of the above described drop table is TABLE_1  then for a problem to occur there must also exist in the database a table such that it's HEX(TABLE_2) = TABLE_14) Either TABLE_2 must not be accessed during REDO prior to the REDO operation of the drop of TABLE_1 or there must be enough other table references during the REDO phase to push the caching of of the open of TABLE_2 out of cache.If all of the above conditions are met then during REDO the system willincorrectly delete TABLE_2 while trying to redo the drop of TABLE_1.&lt;p&gt;I will be adding the following test to reproduce the problem:1) create 500 tables  need enough tables to insure that conglomerate number 2080 (c820.dat) and 8320 (c2080.dat) exist.2) checkpoint the database so that create does not happen during REDO3) drop table with conglomerate number 2080  mapping to c820.dat. It looks it up in the catalog in case conglomerate number assignment changes for some reason.4) exit the database without a clean shudown  this is the default for test suites which run multiple tests in a single db - no clean shutdown is done. Since we only do a single drop since the last checkpoint  test will cause the drop during the subsequent REDO.5) run next test program dropcrash2  which will cause redo of the drop. At this point the bug will cause file c2080.dat to be incorrectly deleted and thus accesses to conglomerate 8320 will throw container does not exist errors.6) check the consistency of the database which will find the container does not exist error.
