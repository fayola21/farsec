Manifest file doesn't contain OSGi attributes    With osgi.jar in tools/java  'ant buildjars' does not add the OSGi attributes to derby.jar's manifest. Instead  a file named ${manifest.file} is created in the root of the source tree. This file contains what should have been in the manifest  for instance:Manifest-Version: 1.0Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.6.5Created-By: diablo-1.5.0_07-b00 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)Bundle-Activator: org.apache.derby.osgi.EmbeddedActivatorDynamicImport-Package: *Export-Package: org.apache.derby.authentication org.apache.derby.datab ase org.apache.derby.io org.apache.derby.jdbc org.apache.derby.vtiThis seems to be caused by build.xml containing a reference to '${manifest.file}' at a location where manifest.file is not bound to a value. The attached patch (manifest.diff) fixes the issue by replacing '${manifest.file}' with '${derby.jar.dir}/lists/smf.mf'.
