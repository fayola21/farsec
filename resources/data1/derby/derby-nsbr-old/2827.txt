Rename ClobStreamControl to TemporaryClob    Since the original submission  the situation has changed quite a lot and the original name no longer fits as well as it did before.The class is changed to TemporaryClob  signalling that the Clob object is living temporarily outside the database. This is true for all scenarios  except for small Clobs that are stored as non-stream objects in the database. The general contract is that as soon as a change is made to the Clob  it becomes a temporary Clob. Unless the user reinserts the Clob (i.e. updateRow  updateClob + execute)  the changes will be lost. This is also true for Clobs created with Connection.createClob. If it is not explicitly inserted into the database  it is lost.
