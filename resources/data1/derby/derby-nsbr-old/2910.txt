SimpleStringOperatorNode in it's bindExpression method generates a character string CAST if required but does not set the correct collation.    Following query should run into error if run in a territory based database SELECT TABLENAME FROM SYS.SYSTABLES WHERE UPPER(CURRENT_DATE) = TABLENAME;When a CAST node is generated on top of CURRENT_DATE to create a character string type  we do not set the collation of that character string type and hence it always ends up getting the default which is collation derivation IMPLICIT and collation type UCS_BASIC. That does not sound right. There might be other places where we generate CAST node to create a character string type. We should check if the collation is set correctly for them.
