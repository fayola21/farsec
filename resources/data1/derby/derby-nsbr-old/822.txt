Client driver: Pre-fetch data on executeQuery()    Currently  the client driver does not pre-fetch data whenexecuteQuery() is called  but it does on the first call toResultSet.next(). Pre-fetching data on executeQuery() would reducenetwork traffic and improve performance.The DRDA protocol supports this. From the description of OPNQRY (openquery): The qryrowset parameter specifies whether a rowset of rows is to be returned with the command. This is only honored for non-dynamic scrollable cursors (QRYATTSNS not equal to QRYSNSDYN) and for non-scrollable cursors conforming to the limited block query protocol. The target server fetches no more than the requested number of rows. It may fetch fewer rows if it is restricted by extra query block limits  or if a fetch operation results in a negative SQLSTATE or an SQLSTATE of 02000.
