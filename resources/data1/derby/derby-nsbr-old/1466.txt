Network Server should flush the PrintWriter after console output    If Network Server is started with a PrintWriter specified for console output it will not automatically flush output such as starting the server. This can be confusing as the console output shows no activity.Users currently need to specify the PrintWriter to autoflush e.g. starterWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(SERVER_START_LOG)) true); derbyServer = new NetworkServerControl(); derbyServer.start(starterWriter); For repro see:http://www.nabble.com/Questions-about-Network-Server-API-Behavior-p5055814.htmlAnd change the following line in the program to not autoflush as follows:starterWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(SERVER_START_LOG)) false);
