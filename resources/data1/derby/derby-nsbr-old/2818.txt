Rewrite ClobUpdatableReader constructors    When the fix for DERBY-2806 is in place  the current implementation of ClobUpdateableReader will fail.This patch is a preparation for the mentioned issue  and I have also removed some 'internal' (package private) methods from EmbedClob and replaced it with a single one. Instead of writing methods that forwards calls to the underlying InternalClob  the method getInternalClob will return the internal clob itself. This seems more in place  since the method getByteLength does not belong in EmbedClob. It also comes with a warning that using the reference to the internal clob object requires the caller to take more care. Second  isWritable() does not belong to EmbedClob either  as a Clob is always writable (unless the database/connection itself is read/only). However  the internal clob representation may be read-only  in case EmbedClob must clone the content and create a writable representation.The fix leaves more of the handling of implementation details to the InternalClob itself.
