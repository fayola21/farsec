ParameterMetaDataJdbc30 fails for weme6.1  which prevents rest of suites.All from completing.    With the addtion of the ParameterMetaDataJdbc30 JUnit test (DERBY-2658)  suites.All has been failing with weme6.1. It turns out the that new ParameterMetaDataJdbc30Test fails with the following error: Failed to invoke suite():java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.sql.ParameterMetaData which prevents suites.All from continuing and thus no results can be gathered.It might be good to disable the test for weme6.1 at least in the short term so that rest of suites.All can run cleanly again. Not sure if that's a complete solution or just a temporary one until the test can be fixed...
