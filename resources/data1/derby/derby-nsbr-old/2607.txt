DatabaseMetaData is not consistent about throwing SqlException when tablename=null    According to java.sql.DatabaseMetaData  the following DatabaseMetaData methods should not allow tablename=null:getBestRowIdentifier  getColumnPrivileges  getIndexInfo  getVersionColumns  getPrimaryKeys  getImportedKeys  getExportedKeys. In the five former methods  SqlExceptions are thrown if tablename == null  but this check is not performed in the latter two.The method calls eventually end up in EmbedDatabaseMetaData  which performs this check. Hence  an exception is thrown either way. If we want the exception to be thrown as early as possible  the two latter methods should do so as well. If not  the check should be removed from the former methods.
