Starvation in RAFContainer.readPage()    When Derby is completely disk bound  threads might be starved inRAFContainer.readPage(). This is a real problem when multiple clientsare repeatedly accessing one or a small number of large tables. Incases like this  I have observed very high maximum response times(several minutes in the worst cases) on simple transactions. Theaverage response time is not affected by this.The starvation is caused by a synchronized block inRAFContainer.readPage(): synchronized (this) { fileData.seek(pageOffset); fileData.readFully(pageData  0  pageSize); }If many threads want to read pages from the same file  there will be along queue of threads waiting for this monitor. Since the Javaspecification does not guarantee that threads waiting for monitors aretreated fairly  some threads might have to wait for a long time beforethey get the monitor. (Usually  a couple of threads get full throughputwhile the others have to wait.)
