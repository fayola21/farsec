test run exits for _foundation run because unloadEmbeddedDriver uses driverManager  which isn't available.    The wctme5.7_foundation runs have been exiting out for a while. We only run this environment weekly and were under the impression there was a time out. But I ran the suite  capturing the output in a file  and the last part of the run shows the problem is with unloadEmbeddedDriver:Now do RunListException in thread 'main' java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.sql.DriverManager at org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunList.unloadEmbeddedDriver(RunList.java:1636) at org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunList.runSuites(RunList.java:276) at org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunList.&lt;init&gt;(RunList.java:167) at org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite.getSuitesList(RunSuite.java:208) at org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite.main(RunSuite.java:147)UnloadEmbeddedDriver was put in to allow running with useprocess=false and autoload of the driver  so it's needed. But maybe we can add an appropriate if condition so it doesn't try to do this with foundation.
