Add more tests for Statement.setQueryTimeout method    Currently  the following checks work as expected but it would be good to add them to regression tests: Add tests to check query timeout value is used by executeUpdate method. Existing test tests calls to execute and executeQuery. The following mail mentions query timeout limit should be applied for all executeXXX methods. http://www.nabble.com/Statement.setQueryTimeout-tf94429.html#a258410 Add tests for Statement and CallableStatement class. Existing test tests this method with PreparedStatement only. I found a difference in behaviour with client driver when using Statement class (DERBY-1692). So it may be good to add some tests for each statement class.
