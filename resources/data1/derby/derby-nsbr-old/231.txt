'FOR UPDATE' required for updatable result set to work    To get an updatable result set  the JDBC 3.0 spec  section 14.2.4 'Modifying ResultSet Objects' states:  'ResultSet objects with concurrency CONCUR_UPDATABLE can be updated using ResultSet objects'.In addition  Derby requires the SQL SELECT statement to have a 'FORUPDATE' clause for updates to be allowed. This may be a usability issue  asmany examples  e.g. in 'JDBC API tutorial and reference and reference'book and the JDBC 3.0 Specification (14.2.4.1) do not include a 'FORUPDATE' clause in the SQL SELECT.Mamta Satoor says:'Derby implements the JDBC updatable resultset by using the existing updatable cursor implementation. And in order to do that  it requires that the SELECT statement should include the FOR UPDATE clause. One can change the Derby implementation so that it does not require FOR UPDATE clause to piggyback on updatable cursor implementation.'Dan DeBrunner says:'Technically I wonder if this is covered by the JDBC standard  I see nothing in the JDBC 3.0 that states any requirements for the SQL statement for an updateable result set. I know the JDBC tutorial book has some guidelines as to what will typically work  but isn't it up to the database engine to define what works here? Having said that I think that not requiring the FOR UPDATE would be a useful improvement.'
