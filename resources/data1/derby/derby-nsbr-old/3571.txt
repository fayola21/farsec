LOB locators are not released if the LOB columns are not accessed by the client    If the client creates a result set containing LOB locator columns and iterates through it without actually accessing the LOB columns  the locators are not released.The amount of locators and their associated LOB objects causes the server to consume large amounts of memory and it eventually gets an OOME.There are a few workarounds for this bug: a) Access and/or properly close the LOBs (i.e. Blob.free). This is partly dependent on DERBY-2892. b) Invoke Connection.commit (or rollback) periodically  which causes all locators on the connection to be released.
