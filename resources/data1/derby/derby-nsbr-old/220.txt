Javadoc build should include a timestamp and/or the svn revision number in a visible location.    In order to easily identify when a specific set of javadoc was built  and from what source  it would be useful to include a timestamp and/or the svn revision number at the time the javadoc is built. The footer is an excellent location to place this information  as it is visible on every generated page.
