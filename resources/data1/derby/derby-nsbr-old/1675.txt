Network Server should not send to client that it supports EUSRIDPWD when running against Sun JVM    As part of ACCSECRD  if the server does not accept the security mechanism sent by the client  the server will send a list of security mechanism that it supports. Currently even when the server is running with sun jvm  it will still send EUSRIDPWD as a sec mec that it supports  which is incorrect. The server should test if it can support EUSRIDPWD dynamically and if it does  only then send EURRIDPWD as an option that it supports.see DRDAConnThread.writeACCSECRD(int)
