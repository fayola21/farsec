Old clients with new server return wrong database metadata values for some methods    With an old client (10.1.1  10.1.2) accessing a new (10.2) server some metadata calls will return the wrong value for both the JCC andthe Derby clients: deletesAreDetected(TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE) -&gt; true updatedAreDetected(TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE) -&gt; true ownDeletesAreVisible(TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE) -&gt; true ownUpdatesAreVisible(TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE) -&gt; trueThis happens because these values were changed for the 10.2 withthe addition of updatable scrollable insensitive result sets (DERBY-775) combined with a weakness in the way the client and the server cooperates to answer these metadata calls.Presently  when the client application invokes these methods  theresults will be returned by the server without regard to the identityof the client  i.e. the 2-tuple {JCC or Derby client  client version}.The values to be returned for the methods in question are based solelyon the values found in the file metadata_net.properties  which is partof the server.In general  some database metadata is dependent on the combination ofthe capabilities in the client and the server and the returned valuesshould reflect this  which in general implies negotiating (down) tovalues which are correct for the actual combination of client andserver.
