Wrong results with query using LIKE and ESCAPE clause that includes '%'  '/'  and '_'    After the fix for DERBY-1262 was checked in  I'm noticing that the following query now returns different results. Prior to the fix for DERBY-1262 the query returned 2 rows; now it doesn't return any rows.create table escTable (c1 char(10));insert into escTable values ('%_/a');insert into escTable values ('%_b');insert into escTable values ('%c');insert into escTable values ('d');insert into escTable values ('%_/e');select c1 from escTable where c1 like '&#37;&#95;%' ESCAPE '/';Before DERBY-1262  the SELECT returned:C1----------%_/a%_/e2 rows selectedNow it returns:C1----------0 rows selectedBrief inspection of the query and data suggest to me that these new results (i.e. no rows) are wrong  and that Derby should in fact return 2 rows/.Based on comments in DERBY-1262  I'm creating a new Jira issue for the regression since it has been checked into the 10.1 maintenance branch. I've set the priority to 'Critical' since this could potentially delay a 10.1.3 release--I.e. I don't think we'd want to release 10.1.3 knowing that we have a wrong results regression. But if anyone thinks that's not the correct priority  feel free to speak up.Other option  of course  is to back out the change for DERBY-1262 in 10.1 and then lower the priority accordingly. Input/feedback/comments would be appreciated.
