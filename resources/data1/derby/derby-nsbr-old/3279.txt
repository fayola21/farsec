Derby 10.3.X ignores ORDER BY DESC when target column has an index and is used in an OR clause or an IN list.    Running the following produces the error seen in Derby 10.3.X but not in 10.2.X nor in 10.1.X.Don't know if this related to DERBY-3231.First query is incorrectly sorted whereas the second one is okay when there is an index on the table. If the table is not indexed  the sort works correctly in DESC order.------create table CHEESE ( CHEESE_CODE VARCHAR(5)  CHEESE_NAME VARCHAR(20)  CHEESE_COST DECIMAL(7 4));create index cheese_index on CHEESE (CHEESE_CODE DESC  CHEESE_NAME DESC  CHEESE_COST DESC);INSERT INTO CHEESE ( CHEESE_CODE  CHEESE_NAME  CHEESE_COST)VALUES ('00000'  'GOUDA'  001.1234)  ('00000'  'EDAM'  002.1111)  ('54321'  'EDAM'  008.5646)  ('12345'  'GORGONZOLA'  888.2309)  ('AAAAA'  'EDAM'  999.8888)  ('54321'  'MUENSTER'  077.9545);SELECT * FROM CHEESE WHERE (CHEESE_CODE='00000' OR CHEESE_CODE='54321') AND CHEESE_NAME='EDAM'ORDER BY CHEESE_CODE DESC  CHEESE_NAME DESC  CHEESE_COST DESC;SELECT * FROM CHEESE WHERE (CHEESE_CODE='AAAAA' OR CHEESE_CODE='54321') AND CHEESE_NAME='EDAM'ORDER BY CHEESE_CODE DESC  CHEESE_NAME DESC  CHEESE_COST DESC;
