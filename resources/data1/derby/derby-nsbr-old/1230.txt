Remove the huge log files (TesterN.out) left from running 'stress/stress.multi'    See http://www.nabble.com/derbyall-test-uses-%7E11Gb-disk-space-when-run%21-t530808.html#a1433024 :'I discovered that when I now run the derbyall test it uses ~11Gb disk space!I find 4 x 10 '..../multi/Tester*.out' files which each is ~270Mb! (=&gt;10.8Gb.)'I will upload a patch which makes ij/mtTester.java able to tell if the mtTester detected errors  which then is used by harness/MultiTest.java to decide if the .out file can be deleted.mtTester is currently only used by harness/MultiTest.java.
