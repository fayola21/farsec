Let BasePage.fetchFieldFromSlot use the special single-col FetchDescriptor ctor    BasePage.fetchFieldFromSlot needs to construct a FetchDescriptor with single column. To do this it creates a FormatableBitSet that identifies the correct column and then passes this bitset to the FetchDescriptor constructor. But FetchDescriptor has a special constructor for the single column case  that doesn't need a bitset. Using this constructor instead makes the code simpler  and presumably more efficient as well.
