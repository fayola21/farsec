Integrate upgrade tests into test suite    Currently there are no upgrade tests in the derbyAll suite.The upgrade tests java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting are run by script and require that the version to be tested by specified on the command line so that the classpath can be changed. runphases old_major old_minor old_engine new_engine# e.g.# runphases 10 0 c:/derby/10.0.2.1/lib c:/derby/trunk/jars/sanePerhaps this script can be rewritten in Java using class loaders and previous Derby verssions such as 10.0 and 10.1 be checked in so that this testing can be incorporated into the derbyAll test suite.
