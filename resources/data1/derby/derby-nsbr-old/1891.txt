error 58009.C.19  refers to non-existent codepoint secktn - needs correcting    error 58009.C.19=Network protocol exception: secktn was not returned. The connection has been terminated.This is NET_SECTKN_NOT_RETURNED in org.apache.derby.drda.client.net.NetConnection.javaI searched in the drda specs but I could not find SECKTN  but I did find SECTKN.So...I think the error message should get changed to SECTKN.The same non-existent codepoint seems to be referred to in: XN002.U=secktn was not returned.This affects the following: English messages .properties file(s) Brazilian messages .properties file(s) documentation for SQLStates.I didn't find any masters with this.It should probably go into 10.2.1  although it's not important enough to hold up a release. Targeting for 10.2.2 for now.Myrna
