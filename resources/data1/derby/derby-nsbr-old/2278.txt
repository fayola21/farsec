Add a generic utility tool to drive the Order Entry load phase.    Add a generic utility program that can take in the driver name and the database connection url to populate the order entry database. Currently the load phase for OE is completed and hence this driver program should allow one to be able to populate the database.Maybe once OE run is completed  we can add the driving of the transactions also. This driver can be in org.apache.derbyTesting.system.oe.runsee DERBY-1987 and sub-tasks for details.
