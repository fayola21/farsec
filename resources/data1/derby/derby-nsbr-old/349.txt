setByte() with executeBatch causes hang with client if mapping is invalid  e.g. setByte to DATE    setByte() followed by an addBatch() and then an executeBatch causes a hang.May apply to any setXXX call that will result in any invalid conversion  possibly only those conversions handled by the client.See the test jdbcapi/parameterMapping  look for this bug number in the code  to see the cases disabled when running with the client.
