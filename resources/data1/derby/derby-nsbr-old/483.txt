Error message  X0X07  has incorrect property name  db2j.database.classpath instead of derby.database.classpath    Example output is in the test lang/dcl.sql  extracted here.ERROR X0X07: Cannot drop jar file ''EMC'.'MAIL_APP'' because its on your db2j.database.classpath ''EMC'.'MAIL_APP''.Also the its should be it's (it is).Might also make sense to change drop to remove  as the procedure is called remove_jar.
