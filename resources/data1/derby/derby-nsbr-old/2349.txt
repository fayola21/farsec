Accessing a BLOB column twice in an INSERT trigger leads to errors in the value on-disk    Either the BLOB is stored with the incorrect value or the value on disk does not match the stored length on disk and an exception is raised. The BLOB was supplied as a stream value.See this with the new TriggersTest. The text fixture will have a comment with this bug number showing how to reproduce the problem.
