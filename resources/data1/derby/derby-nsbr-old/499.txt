Expose BOOLEAN datatype to end users    Veaceslav Chicu started an email thread on 8 August 2005 titled 'boolean type'. He was disappointed that Derby doesn't support the ansi BOOLEAN datatype. On closer inspection  Derby does internally support this type but does not expose this support to end users.Derby should let users declare table columns of type BOOLEAN. This should be an indexable datatype.
