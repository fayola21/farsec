performance of like in territory based collation databases may be improved by changing way collation elements are calculated.    WorkHorseForCollatorDatatypes.java has a method getCollationElementsForString() which currently getscalled when processing like clauses in databases that have been created with territory based collation  this isnot an issue in pre-10.3 databases or post 10.3 default databases.getCollationElementsForString gets the collation elements for the entire value of the String held bythe datatype using the class.If you take the case of pattern 'A%' and the value of datatype is 'BXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'  then it would have been better to better to get collation elements one character of the String value at a timeto avoid the process of getting collation elements for the entire string when we don't really need it One could imagine this might have a huge performance impact on running like against a long clob wherethe like pattern has leading fixed-length pattern to match.Comments on this from Dan and Dag can be found in DERBY-2416.
