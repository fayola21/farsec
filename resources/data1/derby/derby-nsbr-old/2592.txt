Wrong description of IndexName field in public JavaDoc for LockTable    The public JavaDoc for LockTable says the following in the description of the INDEXNAME retrieved from SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE: INDEXNAME varchar(128) - normally null. If non-null  a lock is held on the index  this can only happen if this is not a user transaction.I think the last part is wrong. Normal user transactions might also have a value in the INDEXNAME. For example  here is part of the lock table for three user transactions:XID |TYPE |MODE|TABLENAME |LOCKNAME |STATE|TABLETYPE|INDEXNAME---------------------------------------------------------------------186 |ROW |X |T2 |(1 9) |GRANT|T |NULL184 |ROW |S |T2 |(1 9) |WAIT |T |NULL188 |ROW |X |T1 |(1 11) |GRANT|T |NULL 186 |ROW |S |T1 |(1 11) |WAIT |T |NULL186 |ROW |S |T1 |(1 1) |GRANT|T |SQL070425023213370 188 |ROW |S |T1 |(1 1) |GRANT|T |SQL070425023213370 184 |ROW |X |T1 |(1 7) |GRANT|T |NULL 188 |ROW |S |T1 |(1 7) |WAIT |T |NULL Two of the lock entries have an index. I expect this to be the Scan lock that have been set during traversal of the B-tree.Proposed fix: remove the last part of the sentence.
