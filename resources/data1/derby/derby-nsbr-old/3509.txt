The replication log shipper is not notified when a new replication transmitter is instantiated in MC#handleException.    In MasterController#handleException  a new ReplicationMessageTransmit object is created if the exception is IOException. However  the logShipper is not notified that the new transmitter should be used. A possible solution would be to add a setTransmitter method to AsynchronousLogShipper. Note that the logShipper may contain state information that cannot be discarded  so it cannot be reinstantiated.
