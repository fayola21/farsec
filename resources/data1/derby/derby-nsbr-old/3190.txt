New simple demo suitable for supported Java ME platforms    DERBY-2216 added J2ME (Java ME) support in the simple demo (SimpleApp)  but broke the basic client functionality of the demo (at least in some VMs). Since DERBY-3187 fixes this by removing Java ME support from SimpleApp  a separate simple demo for Java ME should be included along with the other demos available in Derby distributions.Currently supported Java ME platforms are Java ME Virtual Machines with Connected Device Configuration (CDC) support and the Foundation Profile 1.1 or better  with the optional package for JDBC (JSR-169).The new demo should be easy to use and understand  and should be well commented. The demo code should demonstrate how to create and connect to a Derby database in a valid Java ME environment  and perform some basic database operations (insert  update  query). A readme file describing the demo (and instructions for building and running it) should be included.
