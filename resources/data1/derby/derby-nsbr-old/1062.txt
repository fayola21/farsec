Change the internal implemetation of SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE to share existing alter table    Change the internal implemetation of SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE to share existing alter tablecode. One suggested approach is to use the same mechanism as SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE. Suchan implementation would involve:o change the parser for alter table to accecpt some internal only syntax for SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLEo change the alter table constant action to get the required information for inplace compresso move most of the inplace compress driving code to a routine in alter table execution  following the same coding pattern as existing alter table compress.I believe doing this will have multiple benefits:1) shares existing alter table code  so things like error checking  security management  ... is all done by one piece of code2) by sharing the code I believe the following outstanding JIRA issues will be addressed: DERBY-719  DERBY-720 -3) future changes addressing ddl like grant/revoke will automatically work.
