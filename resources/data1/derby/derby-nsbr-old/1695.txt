testSecMec.java fails with JCC 2.6 and JCC 2.8    After the checkin for DERBY-528 testSecMec fails with JCC 2.6 and 2.8. My hope was to just wait until the masters were normalized with the conversion of this test to Junit  but I think that work has been deferred for a bit so I will look at the current test.I have had a problem with this test on my machine for sometime with DERBY-1114 like symptoms with all jvms and even with derbyclient. I need to investigate that or run on another machine to resolve this issue.
