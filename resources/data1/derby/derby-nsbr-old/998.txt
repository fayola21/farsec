tests jdbcapi/SURTest.junit and jdbcapi/SURQueryMixTest.junit run twice in derbynetclientmats    The tests SURTest.junit and SURQueryMixTest.junit both appear in derbynetclientmats.runall as well as in jdbcapi.runall. So it unnecessarily runs twice  because jdbcapi is already included in the suites in derbynetclientmats.properties. It should be removed from derbynetclientmats.runall.
