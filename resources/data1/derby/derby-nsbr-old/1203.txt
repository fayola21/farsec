(If you choose this option  the Test connection page is displayed.)I also can't see any option to test connection in this page.3) Stop the application server.The option is 'Press the button to stop the Network server'  and not the application server.I'm using:--------- Derby Information --------JRE - JDBC: J2SE 1.4.2 - JDBC 3.0&#91;/org/apache/derby/info/DBMS.properties&#93; 10.1.2.1 - (330608)&#91;/org/apache/derby/info/net.properties&#93; 10.1.2.1 - (330608)I don't know if my servlet's version is old  but those things are written in the manual for the version I'm using.I'm sending a diff file to adjust this page to what appears in the servlet I'm using.
