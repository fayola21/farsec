File java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages_en.properties - Message XSLAT.D    The message XSLAT.D (String LOG_SEGMENT_EXIST = 'XSLAT.D' states:XSLAT.D=Log directory {0} exists. Please make sure specified logDevice location is correct.But it seems by the source code that the problem is not that this directory exists  but the fact that it is not empty (// make sure log directory is empty  in LogToFile.java). So it seems to me that the following message would be better:XSLAT.D=Log directory {0} is not empty. Please make sure specified logDevice location is correct.
