Remove stale code from the statement classes in the client driver    Statement and ParameterMetaData contain flags called escapedProcedureCallWithResult_. These flags might have had a function before  but now they are always false. They are used in many if-statements and make the code harder to read. Removing the flags and the code that is only executed when the flags are true  would simplify the code and make it more maintainable.
