Network client: deleteRow() makes getter methods return nulls for the following rows.    On the network driver  the ResultSet.deleteRow() method causes the getXXX() methods in the following rows to return null values. It should be possible to use the getXXX methods after positioning the cursor in the next row. It also has this side effect on other result sets if these are created with the same prepared statement.The repro case is uploaded as an attachment 'testDeleteRow.java'Output of the report case:List all rowsRow: 1: Testing 1Row: 2: Testing 2Row: 3: Testing 3Row: 4: Testing 4Row: 5: Testing 5Row: 6: Testing 6Row: 7: Testing 7Row: 8: Testing 8Row: 9: Testing 9Row: 10: Testing 10List all rows and delete first rowRow: 1: Testing 1Row deleted!Row: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullRow: 0: nullList all rowsRow: 2: Testing 2Row: 3: Testing 3Row: 4: Testing 4Row: 5: Testing 5Row: 6: Testing 6Row: 7: Testing 7Row: 8: Testing 8Row: 9: Testing 9Row: 10: Testing 10
