Scripts in frameworks direcotry needs to be revisted to set up CLASSPATH properly    Need to revisit scripts in directory frameworks/embedded/bin and frameworks/NetworkServer/bin for setting up CLASSPATH properly. The current problem is as following:If user already has a CLASSPATH set on their system  the CLASSPATH is not set again within the script. Therefore  there are no derby classes in the CLASSPATH which results in java command failing as it can not find the derby class it is calling. Basically  to make the scripts work  user has to either issue command 'set CLASSPATH=' or have derby jar files be appended to their system CLASSPATH before running any frameworks batch script.In ksh scripts  there is same problem except that the user has to issue command 'export CLASSPATH=' or have derby jar files be appended to their system CLASSPATH only once as whatever CLASSPATH is set up by scripts is not visible once the script is done.So I am proposing the following solution so that frameworks scripts work properly without interfering with system classpath or without any setup from user.In batch scripts:-----------------------1. Before line 'call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.bat'  save the current classpath as follows:set SAVED_CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%2. Replace the following lines:@if Unable to render embedded object: File (&quot;%CLASSPATH%&quot;==) not found. call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.bat@if '%CLASSPATH%' == '' call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.batwithcall '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.batNote: I have given the above as example only. The name of script that is getting called may be different.3. At the end of script  reset the CLASSPATH to system CLASSPATH as follows:set CLASSPATH=%SAVED_CLASSPATH%In korn scripts:-----------------------In ksh script  even though system classpath is only modified within the script and is not effective once script exits  to be consistent with batch scripts  do the following:1. Before line '. '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.ksh' save the current classpath as follows:export SAVED_CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH2. Replace the following lines:[ -z '$CLASSPATH' ] &amp;&amp; { . '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.ksh}with. '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.kshNote: I have given the above as example only. The name of script that is getting called may be different.3. At the end of script  reset the CLASSPATH to system CLASSPATH as follows:export CLASSPATH=$SAVED_CLASSPATH
