ResultSet.getHoldabilty will return incorrect value when the ResultSet is obtained from a procedure call    EmbedResultSet40.getHoldability returns the holdability of the statement returned by ResultSet.getStatement().When a ResultSet is created by a procedure call  its holdability may not match the holdability of the Statement that called the procedure  which is probably what ResultSet.getStatement() should return.This may not be exposed as a bug yet  but I think this method should be directly obtaining the holdability of the ResultSet using the Activation.getResultSetHoldability() method  rather than through a Statement. Seems a safer approach.
