It's possible to get into a state where install retry is not possible if the agent stops heartbeating    This affects both Install and Add Host Wizards.Steps to reproduce:While installing components  stop the agent on one of the hosts.Waiting for a while puts the components on the host into the UNKNOWN state.Click Retry from the UI. This causes a server-side error and the UI gets confused (the hosts are shown with 'Waiting' message and no 'Retry' button is available).The user is not able to get out of this state.
