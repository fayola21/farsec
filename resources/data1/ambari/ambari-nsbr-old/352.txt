Add flow control - force redirects to appropriate pages based on cluster configuration status for better usability    If no cluster has been set up yet  redirect to the welcome page.If a cluster is being configured (but has not gone thru deployment)  redirect to Step 1 of the cluster init wizard.If a cluster is being deployed  redirect to the deployment progress page.If a cluster has gone thru deployment but failed  redirect to the re-install page.If a cluster has gone thru deployment and succeed  do not perform any forced redirect.
