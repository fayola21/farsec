UI allows adding already existing properties to custom core-site.xml /hdfs-site.xml settings and creates confusion    Steps:1. Go to 'Services' page.2. Select 'HDFS' service.3. Select 'Configs' tab.4. Open 'Custom core-site.xml' panel.5. Add property with name 'ipc.client.idlethreshold' to this panel.Result:Property with name 'ipc.client.idlethreshold' was added to 'Custom core-site.xml' panel. But there is already presented property with same name in 'core-site.xml' file. After saving added property was disappeared from UI  and after service starting value of the old was changed to new (on UI and in 'core-site.xml' file).Expected result:UI should not allow to add property with existing name in specified file.
