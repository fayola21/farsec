Rename alert titles and descriptions    Currently Nagios alerts are shown in Ambari UI like so: (green check) NameNode process down &lt;- means NameNode process is up (red X) NameNode process down &lt;- means NameNode process is down (green check) Percent DataNode down &lt;- means % of DataNodes that are up is above the threshold (red X) Percent DataNode down &lt;- means % of DataNodes that are up is below the threshold (green check) Nagios status log staleness &lt;- means Nagios status log is fresh (red X) Nagios status log staleness &lt;- means Nagios status log is staleWhen a user sees the word 'down' with a positive indication (green check) for it  it's confusing. It's like saying 'this is red' in green... is it green or red?The proposal here is to rename these alerts  like so: (green check) NameNode process &lt;- means NameNode process is up/healthy (red X) NameNode process &lt;- means NameNode process is down/unhealthy (green check) Percent DataNodes live &lt;- means % of DataNodes that are up/healthy is above the threshold (red X) Percent DataNodes live &lt;- means % of DataNodes that are up/healthy is below the threshold (green check) Nagios status log freshness &lt;- means Nagios status log is fresh (red X) Nagios status log freshness &lt;- means Nagios status log is staleAlso there are inconsistencies in the way we show component names in alert titles and descriptions (like 'templeton server status' to mean 'WebHCat Server status'  etc). These need to be fixed.
