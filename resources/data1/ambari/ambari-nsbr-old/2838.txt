Running Requests are not visibile on the UI since the API is not returning the running requests.    The issue is the following:getRequestsByTaskStatus behaves correctly and returns the latest N requests. Note that the N requests have M (M &gt;&gt; N) tasks.Then the call to findByRequestIds gets oldest N tasks where the requestId for tasks belong to the list returned by the first call. So instead of getting M tasks we only get N tasks that too N oldest tasks which are returned. As a result the call never returns that latest request/tasks. The fix is to drop the filter done by the calls findByRequestIds and findByRequestAndTaskIds. Filter should only be applied on the number of requests to be returned.
