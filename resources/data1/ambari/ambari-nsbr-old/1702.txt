Ambari/GSInstallers need to set the value of mapred.jobtracker.completeuserjobs.maximum    mapred.jobtracker.completeuserjobs.maximum is currently set to 0. This causes issues with failed(/successful) jobs from pig and other job submitters because the references to the failed job is cleared up asap in jobtracker preventing one from accessing the failure reason. This value should be bumped up to about 100 according to the MapReduce team.
