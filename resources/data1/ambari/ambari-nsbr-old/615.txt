Eliminate redundant and unused definition for the columns in the table ConfigProperties    ConfigProperties table has a column named 'display_type'.There's also a JSON-encoded 'display_attributes' column.The 'display_attributes' column has the attributes 'isPassword'  'displayType'  and 'noDisplay'. This is duplicate information is already stored by the 'display_type' column so these attributes are not needed.Upon inspecting the code  these attributes are not used so changing them have no effect. We should simply get rid of these attributes.
