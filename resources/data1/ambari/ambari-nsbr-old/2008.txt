Using mixed OS overwrites ambari.repo during install    Performed install on mixed OS environment with 8 hosts.Ambari Server = RHEL6Three Hosts = RHEL6Four Hosts = RHEL5Performed manual ambari-agent bootstrap of the Four RHEL5 hosts. I was able to successfully register all hosts. When install started  the four RHEL5 hosts failed on installing their first component. Looking at the servers  looks like the right HDP.repo and HDP-epel.repo files are put in place.But looks like the ambari.repo file had been overwritten at some point during the install process  and now is point to the RHEL6 repos  causing failures.
