Reinstall of cluster after failure to install results in failure    According to Bikas:I tried to install a single node cluster. That failed for some random issue.I was presented an option to reinstall.I clicked on that option and it asked me to uninstall.I chose uninstall and wipe data option.Uninstall failed.This happened because the install did not complete in the first place.Thu May 24 17:45:28 -0400 2012 /Stage17/Hdp-oozie::Service/Hdp-oozie::Service::Createsymlinks/usr/lib/oozie/oozie-server/lib/mapred-site.xml/File/usr/lib/oozie/oozie-server/lib/mapred-site.xml/ensure (err): change from absent to present failed: Could not set 'present on ensure: No such file or directory - /usr/lib/oozie/oozie-server/lib/mapred-site.xml at /etc/puppet/agent/modules/hdp-oozie/manifests/service.pp:61
