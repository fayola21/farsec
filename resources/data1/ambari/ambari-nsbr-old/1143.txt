tmpfs filesystem being added to the list in the dir used by Ambari    I saw this on a sles cluster. On EC2 they have a tmpfs mounted and Ambari picked it up.Not sure what the ideal solution is but i feel tmpfs should not be included in the available mount points.Also the tmpfs is being used in various directories that will have to change during the install.Attached screenshots.
