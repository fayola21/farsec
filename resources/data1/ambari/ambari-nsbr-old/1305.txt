Make sure that Ambari Web renders all elements correctly when the browser width is 1024px or narrower (refactor)    Current behavior is to dynamically layout elements as the browser viewport size changes. This causes elements to overlap  go outside the bounding box  positioned in a weird way  etc.Let's set minimum width to be 1024px (or maybe 980px to account for the scrollbar) and make sure that all elements are laid out correctly.Bigger than 1024px should still utilize more screen space as it does today.
