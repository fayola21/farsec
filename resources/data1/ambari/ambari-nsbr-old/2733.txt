Hosts and Host Details page UI tweaks    1. Hosts &gt; Design around full hostname being displayed. Consider being able to show 40 characters and then truncate &gt; 40 chars 2. Hosts &gt; Show # control should persist when navigating around app  and after logout/login3. Hosts &gt; Make Components list an expand/collapse control instead of a list with abbreviations4. Host Details &gt; Move Components area above Summary area since the Component Controls are used very often (much more often than viewing the Summary area info).
