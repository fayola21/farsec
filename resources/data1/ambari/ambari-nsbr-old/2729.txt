While a host component is being installed (INSTALLING state)  it does not show up in the Host Detail page    Say Add Hosts wizard fails to add a host and the host components are in INSTALL_FAILED state. In this case  the UI displays the host component with a red gear and shows the action menu with the current state 'Install Failed' and the action 'Re-Install'. Once you invoke 'Re-Install'  the host component disappears from the UI. Once the host component finishes installing  it magically appears again.
