ambari-web modifications to allow for Hadoop Compatible Filesystems (HCFS)    Make modifications to ambari-web that will allow for the selection of a Hadoop Compatible Filesystem. These changes include allowing HDFS to be unselected (either HDFS or HCFS must be selected). If HCFS is chosen  push appropriate configuration (site-conf.xml) files during the install so that systems will work with HCFS as the underlying filesystem rather than HDFS.
