changeUid.sh failing during installation    On SUSE  I received a puppet error on each agent that /tmp/changeUid.sh failed during installation. (Sorry I no longer have the error  I made puppet change and restarted to get by it). But in a nutshell  running the command manually gave:ip-10-82-233-26:/tmp # /tmp/changeUid.sh ambari-qa 1012 /tmp/ambari-qa /home/ambari-qa /var/spool/mail/ambari-qaChanging uid of ambari-qa from 1012 to 1012Changing directory permisions for /tmp/ambari-qa /home/ambari-qa /var/spool/mail/ambari-qausermod: UID 1012 is not unique.Note that the usermod is trying to change to an existing UID  so the command is failing everywhere
