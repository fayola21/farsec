Hive/Oozie database settings should accept custom JDBC URLs    Ran into issues setting up Hive and Oozie with an Oracle database.1. We are hard-coding port 1521 for the JDBC URL. 2. There are two types of JDBC URLs for Oracle: jdbc:oracle:thin:@&#91;HOST&#93;&#91;:PORT&#93;:SID jdbc:oracle:thin:@//&#91;HOST&#93;&#91;:PORT&#93;/SERVICEWe are making the assumption that it is the latter  but this may not work depending on how Oracle is set up.3. We prompt for the 'Database Name'. In Oracle context  this could be the SID or SERVICE NAME  but it's not clear what this is.As a solution to all of the above  we will construct the JDBC URL based on the database type  host  and name for Hive/Oozie and present it to the user as an editable text field during install.Post-install  the JDBC URL remains editable  but does not change automatically as changes other database-related parameters.
