Start button not available for various components within 10 sec after stop operation finishes    Steps to reproduce: 1. Stop a component. 2. Wait for the corresponding BG operation to finish. Result: 'Start' button isn't available for the component within 10 seconds since stop operation finished in UI. It appears later.This happens cuz of update interval  it is set to 15 seconds (App.contentUpdateInterval)  that's why in some moments it can take up to 15 sec to update components status  after request is done.Solution: Create a seperate update interval specialy for updating host components. In config.js we even have App.componentsUpdateInterval = 6000; But this value was not used anywhere in code till now.
