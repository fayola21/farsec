Hosts page layout fixes    1.Use Bootstrap-style tooltip for the hover tooltip on the host status dots as well as the disk usage bars. The current tooltip does not show up unless you rest your mouse cursor for more than a second - users will simply assume there's no tooltip hover when quickly moving the mouse cursor over them.2.We can kill some space between the status dots and the hostnames in the table as well.3.Also  there is too much margin at the top compared to the rest of the pages.
