Optimize query for getting service and host component status back from the server    The API response for getting service/host component status back from the server is unnecessarily big due to nagios_alerts being included as part of the response. This optimization can cut the payload in half or more  and also eases load on the server since it does not have to get Nagios alerts as part of fulfilling the API call.
