Agent heartbeat lost during install    Agent heartbeat can become lost during install. The underlying issue is that during install  various yum commands are executed for component installation. However  the heartbeat ALSO performs a 'yum -C repolist'. If that command is taking a long time  the yum process can become deadlocked. The results of the repolist'ing are not used at this time  so remove it until needed.
