Make single PUT call for multiple host overrides    Currently when we save host-overrides configuration  we have to do PUT of the delta on each host.This is problematic if admin provides an exception to 100 hosts. This will require 100 PUT calls which is expensive. There is a bulk update mechanism  but that requires the same content for all 100 hosts. This will not be the case if any hosts have other properties that are overridden.To save on network calls  we have to make one PUT call via the new API provided by AMBARI-1844.
