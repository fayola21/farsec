Provide way to optionally enable two-way SSL for Server-Agent communication    The two-way SSL mechanism used during server-agent registration exists to protect communication. This is useful in production environments but in typical 'first use' or POC scenarios  having this level of security is not necessary. As well  certificate generation can be problematic causing failures.We need to provide a way to make this mechanism optional:1) By default  ship with Server-Agent Two-Way SSL off.2) At any time post install  a user should be able to turn on Two-Way SSL and turn it back off  etc.
