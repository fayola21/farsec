Ambari Agent script should check for running processes before starting    PROBLEM: If the Ambari Agent installation fails for whatever reason then a process of ambari-agent is left running. This results in the ambari-agent status to show as it not running. If you then start another ambari-agent it dies because the port is already in use.If the script could check the PID file and check for a running process then it would resolve this issue.BUSINESS IMPACT: Not a huge business impact as the workaround is to kill the running ambari-agent processWorkaround: Kill running ambari-agent process before startingANALYSIS: I cannot reproduce this issue in house and the SE who raised it can not reproduce on demand.
