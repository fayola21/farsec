Oozie install fails with 'could not connect to database' when choosing 'use existing mysql database ' and choosing 'new mysql database' for Hive within Ambari    PROBLEM: When installing with Ambari and selecting an existing MySQL database for oozie and a new MySQL database for Hive  then the Ambariinstall fails when installing the oozie database. The error thrown is 'could not connect to database' [it appears to drop the 'existing' databaseand you are required to start MySQL on the machine and create the database]BUSINESS IMPACT: This will affect all customers who choose an existing MySQL database for oozie and a new MySQL DB for hive when installing a cluster using AmbariSTEPS TO REPRODUCE: Choose an exisiting oozie MySQL database and point Ambari at this  and select a new Hive MySQL database on the installation optionsACTUAL BEHAVIOR: It seems that it drops the exisiting oozie database and then fails with an errot of could not connect (This is due to MySQL being down  but also the Oozie database is not there anymore)After starting MySQL and creating the database then the installer can continue from where it left off.EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The installer should not stop MySQL and drop the oozie database if you select create a new Hive database and exisiting MySQL database for oozie.SUPPORT ANALYSIS: Reproduced in the lab in HDP 1.3.2 by following the steps above.
