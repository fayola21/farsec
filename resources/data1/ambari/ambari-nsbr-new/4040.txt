In installer  behavior of actions in manage config-groups dialog different from reconfigure    During reconfigure  in the Manage Config Groups dialog  the actions below the config-groups table (left table - Add/Remove/Duplicate/Rename) are immediate - you do not need to hit Save. Save is only for host membership changes. If host membership changes  the actions under left-table are disabled till Save. During install however  all actions are allowed till Save is hit. If you rename/duplicate and hit Cancel  all changes are lost - something which does not happen during reconfigure.The installer dialog should have similar behavior to reconfigure dialog.
