Filter state does not clear in Background Operation popup and causes a lot of confusion    In the Background Operations popup  the filter state persists at the Host and Task levels  even after closing the popup (the filter should be cleared once the user goes back up one level or closes the popup).This causes a lot of confusion because the user will expect these filters to be cleared but instead cannot see the hosts and tasks that they are expecting.
