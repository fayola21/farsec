Action definitions should be provided as declarative resources - read from XML files    Currently  action definition are stored in database. This is not in-line with the declarative definition of stack and custom commands (as part of stack). The custom actions are essentially same as custom commands except they are defined at the level of clusters. So we should move the custom actions to XML formatted files that ambari-server can read when starting up. This means that when one needs to make any edit they will have to restart ambari-server. This requirement is OK as adding/modifying custom actions is not a frequently done operation.
