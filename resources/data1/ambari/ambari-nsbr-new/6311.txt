Bulk Ops only targets a maximum of 'page size' hosts    It seems that the max number of target hosts for a bulk operation is capped by the current 'page size' on the Hosts page.For example  on the 2K cluster with 2K DataNodes: Go to Hosts page Click on Actions. Either going to Filtered Hosts (2005) or All Hosts (2005)  select 'DataNodes &gt; Stop' A confirmation popup tells me that 50 DataNodes are about to be stopped. This should have been ~ 2000 DataNodes instead. 50 is the current page size on the Hosts page that I set.Another scenario: Set page size to 50. Select 100 hosts using 'check all'  'next page'  then 'check all' Go to 'Actions &gt; Selected Hosts &gt; DataNodes &gt; Stop'. Again  it tries to perform actions on only 50 DataNodes.
