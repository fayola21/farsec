Text of installation stage doesn't correspond to reality    STD:On the latter stages of installing cluster  refresh page 'Install  Start and Test'..Result:Appeared 'Next' button and progress of installation is setted to 100%  but message of installation on the second host says that the Nagios Server is not installed yet. After clicking 'Next' all seems good and Nagios Server is installed normally.
