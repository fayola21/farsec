Remove RCO management logic at ambari-agent    In 1.5.0 release  ambari-agent will not need to process RCO to re-order/parallelizing tasks. Let's remove the code/unit-test and keep them aside in a JIRA targeted for release after 1.5.0. If possible  let's remove upgrade related code as well as there is no plan for automatic stack upgrade for Baikal. We can keep the python executor as there is a requirement for python executor.
