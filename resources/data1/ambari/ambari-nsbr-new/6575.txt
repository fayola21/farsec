Linked Ganglia charts from Host Details page don't show any graphs (except on NameNode host)    The UI links to Ganglia Web to display the graphs for a specific host as http://&lt;ganglia-host&gt;/ganglia/mobile_helper.php?show_host_metrics=1&amp;h=&lt;target-fqdn&gt;&amp;c=HDPNameNode&amp;r=hour&amp;cs=&amp;ce=Note that c=HDPNameNode is static.I believe this worked before as the NameNode gmond was repeated on all the hosts (we should not have and this has been fixed but now it's causing this issue).For this ticket  let's change the call the UI makes from 'HDPNameNode' to 'HDPSlaves' and verify that host-level Ganglia links work for all hosts on a multi-node cluster (including hosts with clients only).
