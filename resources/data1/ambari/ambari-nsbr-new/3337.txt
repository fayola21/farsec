When invalid jce policy file path is specified  ambari-server setup silently switches over to downloading the file from public repo    When an non-existent file is provided as jce-policy parameter we should get ambari-server setup process failed instead of downloading the file from public repo.Also  if the path is a folder then we should gracefully error out instead of allowing shutil.copy to fail with an error stack.
