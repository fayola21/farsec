issues with dialog keypresses    1) on 'manage config groups' pressing return does something even though return is not valid (i.e. can't save)2) Once you press return in #1  then you have to press esc twice to close the dialog3) once you open the nested dialog (to add a group)  esc closes the parent  then esc again  closes the nested dialog4) once you open the nested dialog  also notice it doesn't start focus on the name field  you have to click to get that focus.
