Significant lag between host status update and slave/master component start/stop    Steps: Go to any host with slave component (DataNode  for example). Click 'Stop' options for slave component.Result: status marker for slave component start blinking red  but status marker for host behaves strangely: sometimes it also start blinking red immediately/ sometimes changes status to not-blinking red only after slave component stopping will be ended.The same for slave component starting.
