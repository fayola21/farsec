Misleading hardcoded command in paragraph 2 on step 'Manual commands' of 'Move Master' wizard    STR:1. Deploy cluster with multiplied NN directory(in our case /grid/0/hadoop/hdfs/namenode  /grid/1/hadoop/hdfs/namenode).2. Start NN moving.3. Reach step 'Manual commands'.Actual results:Paragraph 1 contains information about all dirs we should move.Paragraph 2 contains message 'Login to the target host XXX and change permissons for the NameNode dirs by running:' and only one command with hardcoded NN dir:chown -R hdfs:hadoop /hadoop/hdfs/namenode/Screenshot attached.When there are multiple directories specified  we need to show the actual path (but replace commas with a space).In case of '/grid/0/hadoop/hdfs/namenode /grid/1/hadoop/hdfs/namenode' as in the attached image  we should display:chown -R hdfs:hadoop /grid/0/hadoop/hdfs/namenode /grid/1/hadoop/hdfs/namenode
