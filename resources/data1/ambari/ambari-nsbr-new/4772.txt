Security Wizard: History Server should be a different section for MR service.    Earlier History Server was not a different service component and was always co-hosted with JobTracker for HDP-1.x. So we had a same section for Job Tracker and History server in security wizard config page.After AMBARI-2617 and AMBARI-4207 fix  it's possible to have JobTracker and History Server on different host via Ambari web-ui. With this capability it's important to show Job History Server as a different section in Security Wizard MR service config page.
