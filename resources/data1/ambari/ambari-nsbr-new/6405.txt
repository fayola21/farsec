Move Wizard: get stuck if wizard is running second time for the same component without page refresh    STR:1. Run Move Wizard for some master component.2. Do not click Complete button after all operation will be finished. Close wizard (confirm closing).3. Without page refresh open wizard for the same master component and try it to reassign to another host (ex. back to the previous host).Wizard will get stuck  as source host for master component will be calculated incorrectly.This issue is related to host components mapper. After first running of move wizard in the model there were 2 masters one with host before moving and the new one. Old host component was deleted on server but UI model still contains it. And it brakes algorithm of calculating source host on assign master step.
