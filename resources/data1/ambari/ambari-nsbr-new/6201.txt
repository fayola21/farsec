Fix sub-resource names in /stacks API    The /stacks api uses sub-resource names such as stackServices and serviceComponents instead of services and components which are the names of the resources specified in the URL. These incorrect resource names would need to be used in any queries for stack resources.For example:To get stack service named HDFS the URL would be:api/v1/stacks/HDP/versions/2.1/services/HDFSBut  if we wanted to do a query of for HDFS services across all versions:api/v1/stacks/HDP/versions?stackServices/StackServices/service_name=HDFSInstead this should be:api/v1/stacks/HDP/versions?services/StackServices/service_name=HDFSFix all sub-resource names that are returned and fix sub-resource names used in queries and partial response.
