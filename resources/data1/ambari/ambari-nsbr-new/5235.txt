Add component of clients in Ambari doesn't work in a secured cluster    The reason of bug is wrong query formation while triggering API to create clients on host.The data sent with the POST call to create client components on the host is:{'RequestInfo':{'context':'Install Clients'} 'Body':{'host_components':[{'HostRoles':{'component_name':'CLIENTS'}}]}}This is incorrect. There is no component with name 'CLIENTS'.
