Starting/Stopping components based on restart indicator floods request history and execution queue    When starting/stopping components based on the Start/Stop Components buttons that show up after service reconfiguration  it creates one request per component (as shown in the Background Operations popup). This floods the request history and the user cannot see what has been done prior. From the user's standpoint  Start Components and Stop Components actions should each show up as one request.Also  this has major performance implications  since multiple requests cannot be processed in parallel by the server (unlike tasks within a single request).
