Host registering failure from primary/agent os checking on centos6    I am using Ambari (1.4.3.38) for hadoop cluster installation and management. All the cluster nodes are built on centos 6.0.During the ambari server installation  ambari-server recognized the primary/cluster os as redhat6 (see ambari.properties). During the ambari agent bootstrap/host register  ambari-agent regonized the agent os as centos linux6 (see log). From log files (ambari-server.log  ambari-agent.log)  I found the inconsistence caused the warning of ambari-agent bootstrapping and failure of host registering.I'm still not sure why this happen  but I guess it's caused by the differene of os checking methods among ambari server side code  ambari-agent bootstrap script (os_type_check.sh based on os release file) and registering script (Controller.py/Register.py based on os hardware profile) .I just share to see if anyone can fix the issue.BTW  for me  to solve the problem  I manually edited the script files to make it work temporarily:To avoid warning of agent bootstrapping  in os_type_check.sh  add current_os=$RH6 above the echo line or add res=0 after case statement;To make the node register work  in Controller.py  add data=data.replace('centos linux' 'redhat') before sending registering request;Thanks.
