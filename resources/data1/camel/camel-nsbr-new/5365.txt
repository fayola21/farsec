SOAPMessage to InputStream conversion needed for some CXF SOAPMessage Provider scenarios    When you have a SOAPMessage Provider based CXF endpoint in your Camel route and the message is forwarded to an input stream based processor or producer (e.g.  File)  it is necessary to have a converter that converts SOAPMessage into InputStream.It would be practical to have this conversion method included in CxfConverter.I am attaching a test case and a possible implementation. This implementation uses CachedOutputStream to make an InputStream from a SOAPMessage. There might be a better way to get an InputStream  but I don't know a simple one.Thanks.
