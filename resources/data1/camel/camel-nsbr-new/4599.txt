Add default for transactionName in camel-jms    Say you have a simple transacted route like:from('activemq:queue:foo') .transacted() .to(...);on new messages you get logs like:DEBUG JmsTransactionManager - Creating new transaction with name [null]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED ISOLATION_DEFAULTwhich isn't very helpful. It would be good to actual give the TX a name with some context. Thinking of something like the following would be better:DEBUG JmsTransactionManager - Creating new transaction with name [JmsConsumer[foo]]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED ISOLATION_DEFAULT
