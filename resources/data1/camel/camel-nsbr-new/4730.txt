Change cometd SslSocketConnetor to use SslSelectChannelConnector    Currently cometd uses SslSocketConnector for cometds connections. In its current configuration it can only support about 35 connections as SslSocketConnector is a blocking connector. Switching this to use the SslSelectChannelConnector in the same way it uses the SelectChannelConnector will fix this and allow the cometds to perform as the non ssl version.
