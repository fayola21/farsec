camel-jms: testConnectionOnStartup does not test connection for producers    I have a camel context which configures jms producers  but no jms consumers. With this configuration  the 'testConnectionOnStartup' jms option did not test the connection when I started the camel context. I have discovered that (with the current implementation) the 'testConnectionOnStartup' option only applies to consumers. I see that it is implemented in JmsConsumer.doStart() -&gt; JmsConsumer.testConnectionOnStartup(). It would be useful if this option could also applied to producers.As a workaround  I configured a dummy route and a dummy jms consumer.
