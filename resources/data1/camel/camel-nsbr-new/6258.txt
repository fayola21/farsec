Sql component - Add noop option to execute the query but dont change the message body afterwards    Seehttp://blog.mgm-tp.com/2013/04/camel-router-part1/comment-page-1/#comment-4161Even if the query returns a result set  you may not want to grab that or change the message body.For that we can have a noop=true|false option. If there is a better name for the option then we can go for that  though noop was the first name that came to my mind.
