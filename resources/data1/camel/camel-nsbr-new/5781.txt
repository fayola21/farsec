limitaions on s3 component. no means to specify acl on created object. objects do not inherit acl from the bucket they belong to.    When using s3 component to create new object on amazon bucket  there is no means to specify acl that will be applied to this newly created object. s3 objects do not inherit acl applied to the bucket they belong to. in s3 camel component (enpoint) we can specify bucket policy but not objects acl.the limitation is in s3producer.there is an attachment file (patch) to fix this quickly and whith little modifications to the existing code. but i think that we need to enhance the design of this component to be more flexible and rely on strategy that executes requests to interact with s3.for now there is no tests for s3producer in camel-aws thus i don't supply a unit test.if we enhance the design we can change or improve this layer with less effort. and we can do tests obviously.
