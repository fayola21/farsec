Dependencies with inconsitant paths in repository    Artifactory doesn't by default serve artifacts that have a path inconsistancy in it's repository. The used maven-shade-plugin version 1.4 used by camel 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT depends on such a component. this is fixed in version 1.6I was unable to add an attachement  so here is the patch inline:      Eclipse Workspace Patch 1.0#P camelIndex: parent/pom.xml===================================================================   parent/pom.xml (revision 1338042)+++ parent/pom.xml (working copy)@@ -1684 7 +1684 7 @@ &lt;plugin&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-shade-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;1.4&lt;/version&gt;+ &lt;version&gt;1.6&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/plugin&gt; &lt;plugin&gt;
