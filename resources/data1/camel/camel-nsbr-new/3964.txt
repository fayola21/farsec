Script arguments    As I said here : http://fusesource.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2946&amp;tstart=0  the ScriptEngine class (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngine.html) provides a put method which enable to add a Java object into the created script  thanks to the JSR-223. But Camel does not provide a 'bridge' to this method.So I propose to pass the arguments via the header map of the message.Indeed  on client side  I created a Map&lt;String  Object&gt; which contains the future scripts arguments. Then I put this map into the header.Next on the camel-script component  I check a particular key (a public static final attribute that I added) and if the value returned is a Map  I try to add the Map's objects with the engine.put(String  Object) method.
