camel-jms - Log at INFO level if shared replyTo queues are in use  as they are not as fast as temporary or exclusive queues    See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/fyi-SI-tp5716049.htmlWe should log at INFO (maybe even WARN level) if shared reply queues are in use as they are not as fast. They have their purposes though  such as a shared clustered queue  or if a queue is used by other apps too (not ideally thought). Temporary and Exclusive reply queues are faster.See the JMS docs at the request reply section  for much more details.
