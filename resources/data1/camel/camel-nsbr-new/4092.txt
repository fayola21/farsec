XML DSL having attributes that is a Class type should be a String type instead and use ClassResolver to lookup the class    In the XML DSL  some of the EIPs etc. have an attribute where you can configure a Class&lt;?&gt; type. For example &lt;xpath&gt; has a resultType attribute. The XSD type is a xs:string.The problem is JAXB can only convert the xs:string to a Class&lt;?&gt; if the class can be loaded by JAXB/JDK. This may not work to well with custom types in OSGi / JBoss etc. Instead we should use ClassResolver from CamelContext to lookup those classes  as it works in OSGI/blueprint/JBoss etc.
