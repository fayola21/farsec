Add Lazy Connection to XMPP    We are trying to use XMPP as an endpoint but we have a serious problem.If the XMPP server is inaccessible  we cannot start Camel - it just issues a FailedToCreateProducerException exception and shuts itself down.Given we are running Camel from an ActiveMQ instance this prevents critical infrastructure from being restarted when our XMPP server is offline.
