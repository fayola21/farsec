camel-sjms - Consumers should always use dedicated Sessions    If you add more then one MessageListener to a Session then that session will use a single thread to notify each MessageListener in turn. Which defeats the purpose of using multiple MessageListeners  at least in my opinion.sessionCount in SjmsEndpoint should be ignored for Consumers  each Consumer (consumerCount) should instead use a dedicated Session  like what happens when transactions are enabled.
