Include test directories in the archetypes    A reader of Camel in Action pointed out that typically folks write unit tests for their projects so we should of course add the test directories (empty or not) to the archetypes (http://www.manning-sandbox.com/thread.jspa?threadID=41702&amp;tstart=0). I agree but of course this is not possible with the current archetype descriptor we are using. Will do this once CAMEL-3611 is complete.
