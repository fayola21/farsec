BindyCsvDataFormat broken for pipe delimited files    Attempting to unmarshall a pipe delimited CSV file into a POJO using Bindy causese the first and last character the the line processed to be dropped. It appears that the BindyCsvDataFormat class removes the first and the last character from the line read from the CSV if the seperator is &gt; 1 characters in length (see below or line 162-165 in BindyCsvDataFormat). For pipe delimited files  you need to specify | as the seperator  as | is not evaluated correctly as a java regex by the split fuction. This leads to the first and last character for the line being parsed being dropped. From the comments it appears a 'fix' was added to remove the first and last character of the line when the seperator contains quotes or double quotes. Making this determination using the length of the seperator  rather than evaluating using a regex seems to be a poor solution that breaks other CSV delimiters.See Attached for an code example.
