Implement connection pooling in jt400 component    Instead of eagerly obtaining a new connection to the AS/400 system  Endpoint instances request one from a connection pool. Users can specify that their own connection pool be used  or let Camel provide one (default behaviour).Functionally speaking  this feature does not introduce any change (it can be viewed as an optimization in advanced usage scenarios).Thread safety: the producers/consumers  which were inherently thread-safe  became not thread-safe in regard to their start/stop lifecycle.The following text can be used as the documentation for the new URI option:NameconnectionPoolDefault valueAS400ConnectionPool instanceDescriptionCamel 2.10: Reference to an com.ibm.as400.access.AS400ConnectionPool instance in the Registry. This is used for obtaining connections to the AS/400 system. The look up notation ('#' character) should be used.
