Add allowNull option to @Converter to allow type converters to return null as valid response for special use-cases    See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Xpath-parameter-binding-NodeList-vs-Node-tp5738067.htmlThis avoids the situation with the NodeList -&gt; Node converter that may return null the 1st time  and then its regarded as a misses for conversion in future attempts.Just be annotation the method from@Converterto:@Converter(allowNull = true)Should allow to fix this. As then the type converter registry knows that a null response is valid.
