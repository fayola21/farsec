Tokenize pair - evaluated as predicate should close input stream    If you read from a file and use the tokenize pair in a predicate such as a filter / content based router  then the input stream should be closed. Otherwise OS such as Windows keep a lock on the stream  and the file cannot be moved/deleted after processing is done.See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Riding-on-org-apache-camel-language-TokenPairPredicateTest-tp5041981p5041981.htmlNote that using tokenizePair as a predicate is must likely very unusual  as its meant for splitting a stream into tokens  and thus most often only used with the splitter EIP.
