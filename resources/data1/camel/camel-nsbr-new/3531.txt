scala - xpath not working together with choice/when    When using the Scala DSL  xpath expressions inside when() do not work as expected. As an example: 'direct:a' ==&gt; { choice { when (xpath('//hello')) to ('mock:english') when (xpath('//hallo')) { to ('mock:dutch') to ('mock:german') } otherwise to ('mock:french') } }// Send messages'direct:a' ! ('&lt;hello/&gt;'  '&lt;hallo/&gt;'  '&lt;hellos/&gt;')Here we should receive 1 message in each of the mocks. For whatever reason  all 3 messages go to mock:english. Similar routes work as expected with the Java DSL.
