connectionTimeout property is ignored by JavaMail    JavaMail ignores the timeout values set via the connectionTimeout property. Within MailConfiguration::createJavaMailProperties the mail.&lt;protocol&gt;.timeout and mail.&lt;protocol&gt;.connectionTimeout parameters are set as long values In com.sun.mail.util.PropUtil::getInt (line 141) the property is ignored since it is a long valueChanging the type of connectionTimeout from long to int would be the cleanest solution - another suggestion would be to downcast the connectionTimeout in MailConfiguration::createJavaMailProperties
