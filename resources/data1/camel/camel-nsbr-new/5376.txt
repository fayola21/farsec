Mail component does not work as expected (Email Deletion is partially broken et Disconnect does not work well)    The way disconnect is implemented causes issues with some other options of the consumer. For instance 'disconnect' option is not compatible with 'delete' option.The delete action is done in completion action (processCommit: line 185). On line 305  processCommit method checks if folder is open  but 'disconnect' option force folder at null value at the end of poll method (Line 149).I guess disconnect method should be called on completion after any other completion actions occured: It is not possible to make completion actions if connection to mail server is closed.The result of the usage of disconnect option and delete option is a NullPointerException on test: 'if (!folder.isOpen())' statement on line 308.Issue should be always reproductible.I let you fix the priority of the issue  but it is an annoying issue even if there is a workaround by disabling disconnect option ...
