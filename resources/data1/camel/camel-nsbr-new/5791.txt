Adding blueprint based camel-cxf tests using camel-test-blueprint    Adding some blueprint scenario tests for camel-cxf using camel-test-blueprint.I put this in a separate test-only component under the tests folder. I can't put the test classes directly within camel-cxf because of the way how the bundle context is generated  namely the jars on the classpath are scanned and added to the context. Hence  the tests are in a separate component that refer to all the bundle jars that they need.I don't know if the tests folder is the the right location for this test component  though.
