Classloader mixup when consumers across bundles share the same camel-jetty port    Happens in an OSGi environment; but it is also applicable in modular servers that build dynamic classloaders (e.g. JBoss AS) per deployed artifacts (WAR  module  EAR  etc.).If bundles A and B are both creating camel-jetty consumers on the same TCP port  the consumers will share the underlying Jetty connector. Moreover  the Jetty connector is indeed created by the first consumer that initialises on that TCP port.Since the Camel route executes on the Jetty Connector thread  all class resolutions will happen against the classloader of the bundle that initialises first.This makes class resolution absolutely undeterministic and erratic. Quite a nasty bug IMHO.Perhaps this can be fixed by adding a call to Thread.setContextClassLoader() passing the classloader of the JettyHttpEndpoint  as soon as a request comes in?
