camel-aws won't build offline    If you build camel-aws in Maven's offline mode (-o)  you may get the following error:No versions available for org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-core-asl:jar:[1.4 ) within specified rangeThis will occur even if you have the libs locally. This is happening because Maven cannot download the remote metadata to get a list of versions for jackson-core-asl. Specifying a hard version for this (not a range) gets around the issue. Committing a fix shortly.
