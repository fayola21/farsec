bean component - @Handler should take precedence in a bean that implements Predicate    If you use a bean in a Camel route  and have not specified the method name to invoke. Then Camel has to scan for suitable methods to use. And for that we have the @Handler annotation which should take precedence in this process. However if the bean implements Predicate  or Processor  then Camel will use that. However the @Handler should be used instead  as this is what the end-user expects. And also what we tell in the docs.
