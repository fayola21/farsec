camel-mqtt - Nullpointer Exception when disconnected from broker    Hi  from time to time  we get the following exception when producing messages via camel-mqtt:Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.fusesource.mqtt.client.CallbackConnection.publish(CallbackConnection.java:551) at org.fusesource.mqtt.client.CallbackConnection.publish(CallbackConnection.java:545) at org.apache.camel.component.mqtt.MQTTEndpoint.publish(MQTTEndpoint.java:166) at org.apache.camel.component.mqtt.MQTTProducer.doProcess(MQTTProducer.java:66) at org.apache.camel.component.mqtt.MQTTProducer.process(MQTTProducer.java:38) at org.apache.camel.util.AsyncProcessorHelper.process(AsyncProcessorHelper.java:73)[...]From looking at the source of both camel-mqtt and the fusesource mqtt client  it looks like that this is caused by the mqtt-client being disconnected and trying to invoke the onFailure method on the callback:CallbackConnection.javapublic void publish(UTF8Buffer topic  Buffer payload  QoS qos  boolean retain  Callback&lt;Void&gt; cb) { queue.assertExecuting(); if( disconnected ) { cb.onFailure(createDisconnectedError()); return; } PUBLISH command = new PUBLISH().qos(qos).retain(retain); command.topicName(topic).payload(payload); send(command  cb); }camel-mqtt passes in null for the callback though. Wouldn't it be better if a more fitting exception were thrown  or if camel passed in a Callback in order to receive the onFailure event when disconnected from the broker?
