camel-jms: InOut exchange can time out even if response was received    When performing an InOut JMS exchange with a certain requestTimeout  if the reply message is received in time  but the following formula stands true: T0 + T1 &gt;= T!  where:T0 = JMS response timeT1 = remaining route processing time following the replyT! = requestTimeoutThen camel-jms will throw an ExchangeTimedOutException regardless of the fact that the reply was truly received in time.I'm surprised this bug has gone unnoticed until now  as it's been present since mid-2010.Example unit test: @Test public void testTimeoutNotTriggered() throws Exception { getMockEndpoint('mock:exception').expectedMessageCount(0); template.requestBody('activemq:test'  '&lt;hello /&gt;'); assertMockEndpointsSatisfied(); } @Override protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception { return new RouteBuilder() { @Override public void configure() throws Exception { onException(ExchangeTimedOutException.class) .handled(true) .to('mock:exception'); from('activemq:test') .inOut('activemq:test?requestTimeout=500') .delay(constant(1000)); from('activemq:test') .log('test'); } }; }
