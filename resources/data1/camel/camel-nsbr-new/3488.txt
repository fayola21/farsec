Some of JpaTraceEventMessage's attributes require @Lob annotation    JpaTraceEventMessage has a bunch of String attributes defined. Applying no annotations on String attributes of an @Entity result in generated database columns with a constrained length (e.g.  using EclipseLink and MySQL  a String attribute of an @Entity is mapped to a VARCHAR(255) field).Several values of JpaTraceEventMessage are probably carrying values larger than 255 characters. Using JPAs @Lob annotation tackles this problem by generating (C)LOB fields. The attached patch defines the @Lob annotation on attributes which are expected to carry such large values.
