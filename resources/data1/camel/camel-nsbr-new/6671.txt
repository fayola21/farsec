FTP consumer - Add option to not use LIST command    If you want to download a single file  and you know the absolute name of the file  then you should be able to download the file  without using any LIST commands. As some use-cases have permissions disabled for this  so you can only download that file only.The ftp/sftp consumers should have an option to ?useList=false  so they do not use the list command.
