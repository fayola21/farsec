Prevent 'FolderNotOpen' exception when closing out an email exchange    When an email exchange is complete it should set either the SEEN or DELETED flags in the folder on the email server. But if the folder isn't open  either because of automatic closing or timeout  attempting to set the flag results in a FolderNotOpen exception. The attached version of MailConsumer includes a check in processCommit() that opens the folder if it's not open at exchange completion.
