Add a Tracer that uses JMX Notifications and provides full details of Camel Messages    We should create a base for Camel Trace toolings so these can trace the full message content.The trace event should contain: all Exchange Data including properties all Message Data including headersThere should be a setting to truncate the message body as it can be quite long and often in tracing not all details are needed.One question is if this tracing should be combined with the current Notifications or should be a separate thing.
