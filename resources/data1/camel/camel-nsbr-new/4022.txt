Issue using errorBuilderRef with the xml dsl    While fixing issues around the errorHandler I noticed that &lt;onException&gt; definitions defined in the camel context are ignored if a route specifies its own errorHandlerRef. The reason is that we set the onException definition on the default error handler. I have a fix for that  but I discovered a different issue (I think) for which I would like to discuss the solution.When we have an onException definition that looks kinda like this:&lt;onException&gt; &lt;exception&gt; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException&lt;/exception&gt; &lt;to uri='mock:illegalArgumentException'/&gt;&lt;/onException&gt;... something happens  the IAE exception is caught  we do something  but in that process another exception is thrown. Currently  that would be caught by the default error handler  which may not be what we want.What error handler (if any) should handle exceptions thrown while in onException?The onException mechanism is somewhat similar to a try/catch. I don't think the exceptions thrown while handling onException should be handled by the same error handler configured for the route  or even the context scoped one. The processing should be very simple  predictable and immutable. Since the default 'CamelDefaultErrorHandlerBuilder' can be replaced  it is not imho a solution and we need one global one that does as little as possible (the problem would be agreeing what that is: no redeliveries  logging or not  etc).Thoughts?
