Testing headers in multiple messages    The need is something similar to expectedBodiesReceivedInAnyOrder applied to headers :I know that a given endpoint will receive 3 messages in any order  and I need to test ONE header in each of these messages.I wrote :getMockEndpoint('mock:zipSHP').expectedHeaderReceived('zippedFile'  '001.zip');getMockEndpoint('mock:zipSHP').expectedHeaderReceived('zippedFile'  '002.zip');getMockEndpoint('mock:zipSHP').expectedHeaderReceived('zippedFile'  '003.zip');for the route :for('file://filesToBeZipped/').to('bean:my.bean.ZipperBean').log('Zipped : ...');The endpoint effectively received the three messages (the results of three ZIP operations) but the test failed saying that the first message header was '003.zip' and not the expected '001.zip'.
