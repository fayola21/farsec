CXF Transport loses HTTP Matrix parameters    DefaultCxfMesssageMapper (note the typo - to be fixed in a follow-up JIRA) wrongly initializes CXF Message Message.REQUEST_URI property with the value of Camel Exchange.HTTP_PATH  even though Camel Exchange.HTTP_URI is available.The net effect is that the HTTP matrix parameters if any attached to the last HTTP path segment are lost. Another side-effect is that Exchange.HTTP_PATH will contain the decoded value (done at HTTPServletRequest level) which can lead to the matching issues at the JAX-RS level.A simple patch is attached
