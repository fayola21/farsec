camel-jt400 - no longer able to configure a pollStrategy on Jt400DataQueueEndpoint    With camel 2.11.0 we were able to configure a pollStrategy in the URL of an endpoint consuming information from a data queue.After upgrading to 2.12.0 we get an exception during camel startup stating 'Unknown consumer parameters=[{pollStrategy=#jt400PollStrategy}]'. The application no longer starts.Downgrading to 2.11.0 allows the application to be started normally.The problem seems to originate from the fact that Camel (in DefaultPollingEndpoint.createConsumer()) creates a new DefaultScheduledPollConsumer  which gets the poll strategy (no problem). Then afterwards in Jt400DataQueueEndpoint.createPollingConsumer() a Jt400DataQueueConsumer is created and inside configureConsumer() normal flow is stopped because there is no pollStrategy property in a Jt400DataQueueConsumer  and there is an entry for this property in the endpoint's consumerProperties map.I suspect that the consumerProperty pollStrategy should be removed from the endpoint's consumerProperties after it has been set on the DefaultScheduledPollConsumer...
