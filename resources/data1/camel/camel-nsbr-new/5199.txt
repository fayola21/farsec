initialDelay and idempotentRepository Endpoint URI parameters fail to be read from Camel context when Turkish language is set in host operating system.    org.apache.camel.util.ObjectHelper.capitalize() method uses native JAVA String.toUpperCase() method (without parameters)  which performs capitalization according to operating system current language and regional settings configuration. When these are set to Turkish  a call to capitalize() method  with a String starting with 'i' as parameter  returns Turkish dotted 'I' as capitalized 'i'  which is wrong according to programmatic language and expected behavior.This behaviour impacts  at least  in Endpoint URI parameters which names start with char 'i'  such as 'idempotentRepository' and 'initialDelay' URI parameters. When setter/getter methods lookup is performed for these parameters  wrong method names are returned due to ObjectHelper.capitalize() method. This method uses standard Java String.toUpperCase() function which returns a dotted 'I' instead of dotless 'I' for idempotentRepository and initialDelay parameters.To solve this  the attached patch consists of refactoring ObjectHelper.capitalize() method. Instead of calling toUpperCase() method  it is called toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH) to enforce 'I' character (dotless) return.
