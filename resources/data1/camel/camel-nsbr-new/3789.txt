org.apache.camel.component.file.strategy.MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy is not thread-safe    MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy is not thread-safe. When I run a File endpoint with more than one thread the MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy only deletes the last file to start being processed. The MarkerFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy uses global variables: private File lock; private String lockFileName; and gives them values on the acquireExclusiveReadLock method. When another thread calls the releaseExclusiveReadLock method it uses the global variables to delete the locked file. That means that if another thread came and called the acquireExclusiveReadLock it would have changed the values on the global variables. If lock and lockFileName are not global variables the problem seems to disappear and I can a multithreaded File endpoint and not locked file is left undeleted.
