interceptSendToEndpoint with predicate and skip    The &lt;when&gt; clause in the interceptors behave like filters. This is okay with intercept and interceptFrom  where the only possible route manipulation is &lt;stop /&gt;  which is expressed inside the routing block.However  with interceptSendToEndpoint there is one edge case that could cause ambiguity. When skipSendToEndpoint=true  along with a &lt;when&gt; clause  the user might expect that the skipping will only occur if the condition is met. However  it occurs always. The &lt;when /&gt; only determines whether the routing logic contained inside the body of the intercept block will occur or not.I propose to add a new attribute onlySkipWhenConditionMet  so that when this is true  the &lt;when&gt; clause will be evaluated to determine if the originally intended endpoint is actually skipped or not.
