FtpConsumer fills up log file with 'Cannot connect/login' WARN level messages    If the FTP server becomes unavailable  the container log gets flooded with WARN-level messages and gets filled with lines like:16:32:34 511 WARN &#91;org.apache.camel.component.file.remote.FtpConsumer&#93; Cannot connect/login to: ftp://adpt5@localhost:21. Will skip this poll.16:32:49 048 WARN &#91;org.apache.camel.component.file.remote.FtpConsumer&#93; Cannot connect/login to: ftp://adpt5@localhost:21. Will skip this poll.16:33:03 576 WARN &#91;org.apache.camel.component.file.remote.FtpConsumer&#93; Cannot connect/login to: ftp://adpt5@localhost:21. Will skip this poll.i.e. a WARN message gets added to the log every five seconds. We only need to be notified once per incidence.The issue is in org.apache.camel.component.file.remote.RemoteFileConsumer.prePollCheck().I recommend a table of latches  keyed by endpoint key. The latch is set when the initial warning is logged  then cleared upon any subsequent successful connection.
