LDAP Component lose headers    When we call to a LDAP endpoint  the result is returned in the Out body and we lose the IN headers (see http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/LDAP-Component-lose-headers-td5696602.html). A fix seems relatively easy. The solution could be add this line inside the process() method in LdapProducer.java exchange.getOut().setHeaders(exchange.getIn().getHeaders());
