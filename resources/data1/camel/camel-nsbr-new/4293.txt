@Bean method name is ignored    Since 2.8.0 Exchange.BEAN_METHOD_NAME is always used instead of @Bean method name (see BeanInfo.createInvocation(Object pojo  Exchange exchange)). As a consequence  the wrong method is choosen when I use a beanref invokation on a method that uses @Bean parameter binding.I built a simple test case as a zip file containing an Eclipse Helios maven project (see attachment). The test fails with camel 2.8.0 and succeeds with 2.7.3 and earlier (at least until 2.6.0).regards Vincent MATHON
