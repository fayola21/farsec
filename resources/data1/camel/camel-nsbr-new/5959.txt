Dead Letter Channel - Store failed route id on Exchange    Seehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Retrieve-failed-Route-from-deadLetterChannel-tp5725420.htmlWe should store the route id where we failed  this allows end users to get that as a detail if they route to another route as part of DLC. You can get the current route  but if you let DLC be a route  then its that route you get  and not the route that failed.So we need to store this as part of the RedeliveryErrorHandler logic inside camel-core.We do have failed endpoint store already. eg if it failed sending a message to an endpoint. But we lack the route id.
