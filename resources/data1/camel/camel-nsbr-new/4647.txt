Simple expression does not find method toString()    In a route builder  we have a log definition: from('direct:testSimple') .log('${body.toString}');The body contains an object  that implements a public toString() method. But the problem is  that the simple-expression does not find the method toString() and route processing stops without throwing an exception.The funny thing is  that when we just rename the method  e.g. toInfoString()  then it works:from('direct:testSimple') .log('${body.toInfoString}');Why does simple expression have a problem with a method named 'toString'?
