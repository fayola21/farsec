camel-aws can allow SNAPSHOT transitive dependencies    The camel-aws component depends on aws-java-sdk which has several dependencies defined using version ranges. The problem with version ranges is that they can introduce SNAPSHOT versions if they are available on your system which is not so good... in my case I had this http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/mail/javax.mail/1.4.5-SNAPSHOT/javax.mail-1.4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar jar in my local repo so camel-aws promptly used that SNAPSHOT lib.
