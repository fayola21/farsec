Avoid parsing URI each time when getting uri from endpoint    In Camel 2.9  a new EndpointConfiguration was introduced  which has more fine grained details about an URI.However the getEndpointUri method on Endpoint is now parsing the uri on each call  this is not needed  and is also unnecessary overhead.We should parse this once.Also Camel's built-in type converter should be used during the parsing  and not just the hardcoded PropertyEditorTypeConverter which is to be considered removed as its not thread safe causes unforeseen side effects when 3rd party projects register property converter
