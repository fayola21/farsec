SJMS component's pom.xml missing taskmanager package in camel.osgi.private.pkg    Hi I know it's not out in the wild yet but with this tiny patch SJMS is usable in my spike project.Sadly doesn't affect the number of passing/failing tests.The pom's &lt;camel.osgi.private.pkg&gt; section is missing an entry for the org.apache.camel.component.sjms.taskmanager package.thanks Caspar
