option to add bundle directives in the generated test bundles by camel-test-blueprint    The generated test bundle by camel-test-blueprint has the plain test class name as the bundle symbolic name in its manifest.Some test cases may require bundle directives to be added to the bundle symbolic name entry in the manifest.One such test case is for disabling xml validation.To support such blueprint test cases  I would like to add an option in CamelBlueprintTestSupport to customize the bundle directives.
