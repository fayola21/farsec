After restarting route a camel-quartz component fires right away (and it shouldn't)    I am adding a new QuartzRouteRestartTest that demonstrates this issue. Not only a message is fired right after restart  but the scheduled times are messed up as well. I tried to keep the fire interval as low as possible  but it has to be large enough to demonstrate the problem. So I went down to 0/5 (fire every five sec)  but it's more obvious with 0/10 or 0/15  the trigger starts firing at the wrong time.
