Archetypes fail to build in offline mode    If build tooling/archetypes with the --offline Maven argument you may see an error like&#91;ERROR&#93; Unresolveable build extension: Error resolving version for plugin 'org.apache.maven.archetype:archetype-packaging'Seems the version for archetype-packaging in the dependencyManagement section defined in the parent pom is not propagating down to build extension... when Maven is not in offline mode it can simply grab the latest version from the metadata at central. I'm committing a simple fix shortly.
