OsgiServiceRegistry to lookup services with filter on name=blah    OsgiServiceRegistry to lookup services with filter on name=blahWhen using the # bean resolver prefix in plain OSGi (not blueprint) the only way to lookup a service is by specifying the full registered class/interface name of that service.The OsgiServiceRegistry should also try and lookup a service like the OsgiComponentResolver does using a filter on a service property. I suggest that the filter be on a property called 'name'.This means the method public &lt;T&gt; T lookup(String name  Class&lt;T&gt; type) should try to lookup the service with the class from the type parameter and filter on '(name=' + name ')'...
