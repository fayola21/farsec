camel-quartz - Stateful job - Redeploying bundle/war and having changed endpoint uri issue    Seehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/In-came-quartz-route-after-bundle-update-jobs-are-not-triggred-tp5734196.htmlIn these situations we should use job.name to name the job unique so when you change the endpoint uri and redeploy the apps/bundles  then camel-quartz can find the old job in the quartz persistent store.There may be logic needed to lookup using job.name as the unique name in these situations  and then allow endpoint uri options to change over time  such as the cron trigger etc. Which should be adjusted accordingly as well.
