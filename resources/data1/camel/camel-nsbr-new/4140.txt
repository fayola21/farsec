Improve pom.xml for camel-jibx - use maven-jibx-plugin    I have a patch attached that updates the pom.xml in the camel-jibx component.1. The maven-jibx-plugin has fixed http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JIBX-3552. Using a profile to allow a user to skip the unit tests using -Dmaven.test.skip=true. The plugin will run even if unit tests are skipped  so using a profile to correct that.
