CamelContext is started twice when using camel-blueprint    For example if you run the testRouteWithAllComponents test in CamelBlueprintTest in tests/camel-itest-osgi you will see a lot of logging. But notice[RMI TCP Connection(1)-10.0.1.2] INFO org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiDefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.6-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: 67-camel-2) is starting[RMI TCP Connection(1)-10.0.1.2] INFO org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiDefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.6-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: 67-camel-2) started in 0.147 secondsThen blueprint does something[Blueprint Extender: 3] INFO org.apache.camel.blueprint.BlueprintCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.6-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: 4-camel-5) is starting[Blueprint Extender: 3] INFO org.apache.camel.blueprint.BlueprintCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.6-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: 4-camel-5) started in 0.071 secondsAnd likewise both CamelContext's is shutdown when the test completes. There are logging events for that as well.Pay attention to the name of the 1st CamelContext 67-camel-2. This is the correct name as its based on the bundle id  our end user Camel application is given. This ensures that the CamelContext from his application has a name which is unique and refers to the bundle id as well.Now if you look at the 2nd CamelContext being started its given another name 4-camel-5. That id is most likely using a shared bundle id with a low number. For example camel-blueprint or camel-core bundle  or something like that. In essence camel-blueprint should only create one CamelContext and it should use the 67-camel-2 as the name of the CamelContext (eg. include the bundle id of the end user application).
