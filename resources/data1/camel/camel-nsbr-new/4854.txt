BAM - database constraint violation when restaring application    Take BAM example from http://camel.apache.org/bam-example.html (or any other one  it doesn't matter).Here is the one I'm using: ActivityBuilder request = activity('eaiBroker:topic:SOME_TOPIC?concurrentConsumers=1').name('Request') .correlate(xpath('/MessageRequest/@Id').stringResult()); ActivityBuilder response = activity('eaiBroker:topic:SOME_OTHER_TOPIC?concurrentConsumers=1').name('Response') .correlate(xpath('MessageResponse/@Id').stringResult()); response .starts().after(request.completes()) .expectWithin(seconds(15)) .errorIfOver(seconds(30)) .to('log:com.eai?level=error'); First run of the application and everything works. Restart application and try to activate one of BAM rules  there will be an exception that database constraint has been violated. Every time application is started  Camel tries to do following sql insertinsert into CAMEL_ACTIVITYDEFINITION (name  processDefinition_id  id) values (?  ?  ?)but name columne must be unique in CAMEL_ACTIVITYDEFINITION .Workaround for this is to purge BAM tables every time you want to restart the application  but it's not a solution.
