Expose setDeliveryMode property in org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent    It would be beneficial if org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent would allow to specify JMS deliveryMode explicitly. Currently  from what I can tell  there is only boolean deliveryPersistent property which is not enough if JMS provider supports additional non-standard delivery modes. Example is Tibco EMS RELIABLE_DELIVERY mode.
