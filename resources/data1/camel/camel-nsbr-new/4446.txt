camel-bindy - Marshaling using CSV will insert wrong char separator if using an escaped separator char such as a pipe    When using bindy in CSV format with a separator in the model as '|' to denote a pipe character  then it does not work consistent for marshal and unmarshal. In marshal it will insert / as separator  but it should use | instead.See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/bindy-different-behavior-between-marshal-and-unmarshal-with-pipe-separator-tp4798488p4798488.html
