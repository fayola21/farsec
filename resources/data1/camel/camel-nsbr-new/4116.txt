SpringWebserviceConsumer should check if there is an Exception connected to the exchange and throw that one if it exists so that the default Errorhandling in spring-ws can take place    If an Exception is thrown in the camel flow then that exception is not propagated to spring-web-services.Example: &lt;camel:from uri='spring-ws:rootqname:{foo.com}BarRequest?endpointMapping=#endpointMapping'/&gt; &lt;camel:to uri='bean:exceptionThrower?method=throwException'/&gt;This would result in an empty response from spring web-services with a status code of 202 (accepted).If the check was made on the Exchange to see if there was an Exception thrown then that one could be rethrown and the Exception-handling in spring web services could do its magic.In SpringWebserviceConsumer add this to the invoke method: if(exchange.getException() != null){ throw exchange.getException(); }
