file endpoint to raise a warning msgs if unable to auto-create the starting directory    The file component tries to auto-create any non-existing starting directories however it does not raise any warnings if its unable to create the directory (e.g. due to file permission or due to unmounted file systems). It should at least log a warning msg if it cannot auto-create the starting directory.
