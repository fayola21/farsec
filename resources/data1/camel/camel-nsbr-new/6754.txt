UnitUtilsTest cant manage a locale different from US    When locale is set to a language different from english (for example italian)  the unit test in org.apache.camel.util.UnitUtilsTest fail  because in the italian locale the decimal separator is the comma  not the dot.The test compare the results of printUnitFromBytes to static strings formatted with the dot  and in an italian locale fails because it espects '1.0' and get instead '1 0'.I have patched the test code to make it works in every locale (building the expected results with the current locale decimal separator)  and i have attached the patch to this issue.
