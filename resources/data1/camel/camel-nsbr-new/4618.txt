Add support for PGP data format in Java and XML DSLs    The new PGP data format from CAMEL-4549requires to create it from Java code.We should add some syntax sugar and have it in the DSL directly like the other data formats.We may also want to look into how to configure a public and private key file  and have it load the PGPPublicKey and PGPPrivateKey for you automatic.Instead of using the PGPDataFormatUtil class.
