option to force sending original JMS message    When using mapJmsMessage=false you would think that Camel would send along the original JMS message. However  if you touch the Camel Message headers (get or set) this effectively disables the mapJmsMessage option. I came across this issue when using the failover loadbalancer. We should add an option to force Camel to send along the orginal JMS message.
