Support attaching to SQS queues where the user doesn't have permission to list the queues (manually build URL)    Currently the code assume that the user either has permission to list all the queues on their account or run a query request to get the queue url. In situations where security is more controlled you might have permission to read/write to/from a queue but not have permission to query SQS for the URL. In these cases there needs to be a way to manually build the URL from the pieces in the configuration.
