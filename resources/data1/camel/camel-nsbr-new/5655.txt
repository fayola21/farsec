Camel Endpoint ignores camelContextId property in Spring configuration    Camel Endpoint  if configured outside camelContext element in Spring configuration  ignores camelContextId property. Steps to reproduce: Configure two contexts in spring configuration. Then in the same config file configure two endpoints outside camelContext  but with camelContextId specified. Both endpoints will be created pointing to the same (first) camel context  despite being configured to different contexts. Attempting to use them by reference results in failure  as endpoint camelContext doesn't match the expected one.
