javax.script dependency in camel-core    The OSGi imports for camel-core ends up with a non-optional dependency on javax.script due to it being used in the Activator. However  the karaf feature for camel-core doesn't have a dependency on org.apache.servicemix.specs.scripting-api-1.0 .One of two things should be done:1) mark javax.script as optional. This MAY require some updates to the Activator to work when it's not available.2) Update the karaf features file to add:&lt;bundle dependency='true'&gt;mvn:org.apache.servicemix.specs/org.apache.servicemix.specs.scripting-api-1.0/${servicemix-specs-version}&lt;/bundle&gt;
