SMSC initiated unbind spawns exponential amounts of reconnect threads    It took me a bit of time to put my finger on this problem.When an unbind PDU is sent from the SMSC side to a camel-smpp endpoint  a cascading amount reconnect threads are spawned by the reconnect code. I can reliably re-produce this problem having a simple smpp consumer to a SMSC / simulator and issuing an unbind from the SMSC / simulator.Here are some logs (I have added additional debug messages to the SmppConsumer to show the object references and state of the SmppSession objects):
