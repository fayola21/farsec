CxfPayloadConverter may start failing to convert a CxfPayload to a Node    There is an issue with CxfPayloadConverter that can lead to a failure in converting the CxfPayload into something which is actually convertible. This problem happens when you try to convert a CxfPayload instance that has an empty body list into a Node instance. This returns null and subsequently registers this type mapping key (CxfPayload-&gt;Node) in org.apache.camel.impl.converter.BaseTypeConverterRegistry's conversion-misses table. Because of this  a subsequent conversion using a CxfPayload instance with an non empty body list will permanently fail.I am attaching a modified CxfPayloadConversionTest that includes testCxfPayloadToNode that illustrates this problem. Currently  the last assertion of this test is failing when this issue is present.I think we can fix this problem by returning Void.TYPE instead of a null for this case.In this way  the conversion is regarded as a success and there will be no entry in the conversion-misses table.So  I am also attaching the modiefied CxfPayloadConverter class that can handle this test case.
