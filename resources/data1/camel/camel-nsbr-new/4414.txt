CamelLogger should not be a Processor and a log class at the same time and it should not have ServiceSupport    CamelLogger currently does too many things.1. It is a log class that stores a log level and a slf4j logger. It suppports some methods for logging with the set level2. It is a processor for logging exchanges3. It extends ServiceSupport even though it has no services (is apparently needed fro ThroughputLoggerSo what I propose is: Leave the current class as is but mark as @Deprecated Introduce a new CamelLogger that only supports 1. Introduce a CamelLogProcessor in processor that only supports 2. Make ThroughputLogger not extend CamelLogger but instead delegate to the new CamelLogger
