New restlet endpoints don't work if route is created after restlet server is started.    If a route with restlet endponit is created after restlet server is started  restlet can't handle the endpoint correctly  because restlet translate all URI pattern of routes at server starting  but don't it for later attached routes. So we must translate the URI pattern before attach it to restlet after restlet server is started. See http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=988.
