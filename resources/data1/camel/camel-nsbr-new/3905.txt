camel-cache exception message: CamelCacheOperation not specified in the message header [CamelCacheKey]    Caused by: net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: CamelCacheOperation not specified in the message header &#91;CamelCacheKey&#93;Sound like a mistake? Or maybe my English is so bad? as this message doesn't make sense for me...Simply it should be:Caused by: net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: CamelCacheOperation header not specified in message
