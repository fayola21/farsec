Upgrade maven-bundle-plugin to version 1.3.4    According to Guillaume Nodet we should try to upgrade to the 1.3.4 version of the maven bundle plugin as it simplyfies several osgi related definitions.I will do a full build before committing but as far as I know we do not test in osgi so we need some testing in osgi too. Perhaps Willem can run some servicemix tests.
