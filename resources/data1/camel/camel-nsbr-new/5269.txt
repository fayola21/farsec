Make it possible to change the remote file name without changing the local file name    Currently  if you change the remote file name by changing the message header Exchange.FILE_NAME  this will not only change the remote file name but also the local file name. This is often undesirable. Instead it is a common requirement to archive the files that you process locally with their original file names unchanged.This has been discussed on the user mailing list:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/how-to-specify-remote-file-name-when-using-FTP-endpoint-td5697227.html
