BeanInfo not reset when new bean looked up    In camel-bean  when a bean is looked-up and it is not the same bean as the previous one beanInfo has to be reset.This is done in getBean() method of org.apache.camel.component.bean.RegistryBean but the test is placed after setting bean=value so beanInfo is never reset :if (value != bean) {  bean = value;  processor = null;  if (!ObjectHelper.equal(ObjectHelper.type(bean)  ObjectHelper.type(value))) { beanInfo = null; }
