camel-mina - Make it easier to use a custom thread pool for the consumer    It should be easier to use a custom thread pool for the mina consumer  in case you use it in sync mode  where the consumer thread would then be synchronous  and thus take up a thread. So in case you put load on the mina consumer  it will use up the default thread pool size of 10 threads.We should add documentation in the wiki  how to use a custom thread pool / and pool profile.See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/inflight-exchange-and-queue-of-apache-camel-tp5112396p5112396.html
