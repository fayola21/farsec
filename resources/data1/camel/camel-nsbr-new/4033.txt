Loop EIP - Add copy option to let it start next loop with a copy of the original exchange    The Loop EIP will use pipes and filters. So if you loop 3 times  then on the 2nd and 3rd time its the output from the previous processing that is being used.We should add an option so people can use a copy of the original exchange instead  so its the same copy being looped on each iteration.The wiki documentation should be updated to describe the difference in these two modes.See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Loop-usage-tp4432628p4432628.html
