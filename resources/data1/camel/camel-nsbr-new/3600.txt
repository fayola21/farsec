ServiceHelper - Avoid started/stopping service if already started/stopped    We should optimize ServiceHelper to detect if the service is already started/stopped (if it extends ServiceSupport  as then it provides state).Also DefaultEndpoint should extends ServiceSupport to provide state so we know if the endpoint is started/stopped.This avoid double starting or stopping services which is not needed.And some custom components may not work well if they are started twice  just because Camel handles it lifecycle and invokes start multiple times.Also refine the logging in ServiceHelper from TRACE to DEBUG level so its easier to spot the lifecycle.
