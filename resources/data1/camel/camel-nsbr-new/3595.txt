FTP rename fails    (This is related to the user group discussion http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Problem-renaming-existing-file-in-FTP-td3307670.html)When using a tmpPrefix when uploading  the rename from the tmp-file to the destination file fails  if the destination file is already present  even though the option fileExist=Override is used.We have the problem on just a few destination servers which all seems to be windows machines.I have fetched the 2.4 branch of camel-ftp to find out why it does not work  since the unit test you refer to in your previous post do excercise the problem.It appears that the cause of the problem is  that the FtpOperations.existsFile fails to return true  which then causes the code not to enter the part where it deletes the exisiting file.The reason for the FtpOperations.existsFile to return false  is  that the list of existing files has the directoryname prepended  e.g. I'm trying to upload Test.REN to folder test/rename  and in the code 'if (existing.equals(onlyName))' existing=test/rename/Test.REN and onlyName=Test.REN - which returns false - but causes the later rename to fail as the target folder did contain the Test.REN. My guess is that it is server dependent whether the returned list of names in the directory include the directory name or not?To fix this I have added the following line of code before the if-statementexisting = FileUtil.stripPath(FileUtil.normalizePath(existing));So it will strip the path part of the file name before comparing it to onlyName.
