NoRedeliveryOnShutdown doesn't work for DeadLetterChannel    See http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Wrong-test-for-allowRedeliveryWhileStopping-possible-bug-td5726184.html for details.The assumption is if we use 'allowRedeliveryWhileStopping(false)' in an error handler definition which use a dead letter channel  the message should be send to the configured dead letter channel if we are in a delivery by stopping Camel (instead of dropping the message).
