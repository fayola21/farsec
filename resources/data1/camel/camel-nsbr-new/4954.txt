Camel 2.9.0 incapable of working with % in endpoint URIs    In the class org.apache.camel.util.URISupport which will be used to resolve endpoints (DefaultCamelContext#normalizeEndpointUri) the method parseParameters will be called.At first the java.net.Uri#getQuery will be called with according to the javadoc 'Returns the decoded query component of this URI' returns a decoded URI. If that fails the java.net.Uri#getSchemeSpecificPart method will be called which according to the javadoc 'Returns the decoded scheme-specific part of this URI.' returns a decoded URI.So to summarize we get in any case a decoded URI.This URI will then be than in the method org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#parseQuery(String) again decoded with java.net.URLDecoder#decode(String String).This code leads to the following behaviour: If a % is properly encoded with %25test the %25test will be substituted by the first call to %test and the decoded again which leads to an Exception.In the http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=1166508 commit you can see that the % was uncommented from org.apache.camel.util#UnsafeUriCharactersEncoder. Maybe this is related.However... Double encoding of URIs seems quite odd. With any URI char there is no issue with that. But with % the % will be decoded again  which makes a % unusable in Camel.
