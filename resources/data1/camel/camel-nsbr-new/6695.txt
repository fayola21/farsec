mbeansRegistered in DefaultManagementAgent isn't ThreadSafe    This is more or less a 'corner-case' I stumbled upon  thoughthe HashSet/HashMap (2.5/2.10 camel versions) in the DefaultManagementAgent containing the registered Mbean mbeansRegistered isn't Thread-Safe. This has been an issue for us while using the ProducerTemplate in a wrongful way  by instantiating the ProducerTemplate during every Route run. As this might be a common mistake by users I'd suggest to improve the mbeansRegistered by using a Synchronized Map.
