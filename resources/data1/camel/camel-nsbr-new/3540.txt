Jt400DataQueueConsumer incorrectly implements timeout semantics (jt400 component)    Jt400DataQueueConsumer implementation of receive(long) passes the timeout argument directly to com.ibm.as400.access.DataQueue.read(int)  not performing unit conversion. However  Jt400DataQueueConsumer.receive(long) accepts milliseconds  whereas DataQueue.read(int) accepts seconds as the time unit.Also  invoking Jt400DataQueueConsumer.receive() results in a call to DataQueue.read()  which is not a blocking call; on the contrary  it will not wait for entries.Code snippet below.Jt400DataQueueConsumer.java DataQueue queue = endpoint.getDataQueue(); try { DataQueueEntry entry; if (timeout &gt;= 0) { entry = queue.read((int)timeout); } else { entry = queue.read(); }Note that the submitted patch floors the timeout value when converting to seconds  but different rounding might be desired  which should be specified in the class documentation.
