Camel JMS producer can block a thread under specific circumstances    This is an edge case  but when the following circumstances concur  the asynchronous routing engine in Camel become blocked: Sending an InOut exchange over JMS (request/reply)  where: Persistent messages are enabled (deliveryPersistent=true) useMessageIDasCorrelationID is enabled replyToType is Temporary queues (default) (using TemporaryQueueReplyManager) a timeout is setYou have to be really unlucky  but if the following condition is satisfied  a thread will become blocked:time the broker takes to ACK the produced message &gt; message timeoutHence  if we have a timeout of 3000ms  and the broker takes 4000ms to ACK the message (e.g. slow Disk I/O while the journal is rotating - it happened to us)  at some point we'll see this.2012-10-30 10:46:57 680 | WARN | CorrelationMap | 89 - org.apache.camel.camel-core - 2.8.0.fuse-06-11 | Exception occurred during purge task. This exception will be ignored.java.lang.NullPointerExceptionThe CorrelationMap is rendered useless  so if subsequent exchanges time out  the ReplyHandler may never get an onTimeout callback  thus leading to the waiting thread getting blocked forever if the async routing engine was in place.
