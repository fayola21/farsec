Tidy up AST model to proper support output or not    We should tidy up the model  so they clearly indicate if outputs supported no outputseg when an EIP supports output  they can be nested/added to it  eg in XML its like&lt;split&gt; &lt;output 1&gt; &lt;output 2&gt;&lt;/split&gt;But some EIPs indicate they support output  but they dont. For example &lt;to&gt; should not support output as it doesn't make sense.We should introduce a isOutputSupported on the ProcessorDefinition and then check each EIP.This will cause changes to the XSD in that regard EIPs which really didn't support output (eg it was hacked that way in Java code) but the XSD would allow outputs  eg&lt;to uri='xxx'&gt; &lt;output 1&gt; &lt;output 2&gt;&lt;/to&gt;Now this would not be possible and you would have to do&lt;to uri='xxx'/&gt;&lt;output 1&gt;&lt;output 2&gt;This will in fact reduce the XSD and make it more concise when outputs is supported or not.
