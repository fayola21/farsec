EventHelper.notifyRouteStarted skips all remaining notifiers if one if the notifiers ignores route events    Having two or more notifiers registered at the management strategy of a camel context  where one of the notifiers (not the last one) is set up to ignore route events  results in all remaining notifiers to be skipped when notifying a RouteStartedEvent.Look at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/branches/camel-2.10.x/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/util/EventHelper.java?revision=1340446&amp;view=markup  line 237: There's a 'return' which actually should be a 'continue'.Note: CamelContextStoppingEvents are also affected.
