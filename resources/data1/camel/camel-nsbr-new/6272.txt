Bean - Improve choose method logic for no parameter methods    We should optimize the logic and if a method name with no parameters has been defined  eg.to('bean:myBean?method=foo()')Or in ognl's such as.when().simple('${body.foo()} != null').to('direct:foo')Then we should optimize the logic to filter out methods with methods  as foo has been declare with no methods explicit by ().
