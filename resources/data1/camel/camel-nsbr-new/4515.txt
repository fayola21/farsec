Spring-WS should populate Camel Header with the SOAP Header    Currently the Camel-Spring-WS component does not support the setting of SOAP Headers and has issues getting them. The current issue getting the SOAP Headers when receiving a message is that the resulting header key includes the namespace.Change the component so that a Camel header 'CamelSpringWebserviceSoapHeader' can be populated with an intended SOAP Header for a request  and that this Header is also populated from the SOAP Header on a response.
