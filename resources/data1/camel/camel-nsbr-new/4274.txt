MDCUnitOfWork behaviour incorrect with nested routes    MDCUnitOfWork.clear() removes any content set by MDCUnitOfWork from MDC.If there are two separate exchange running at the same time in the same thread  as happens when a ProduceTemplate is used from Java  this is incorrect because the MDC of the parent is cleared after the child completes.Conceptually the MDC should be a stack  but MDC only accepts strings so the simplest thing to do is for MDCUnitOfWork to replace the previous values in clear().
