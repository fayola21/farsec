camel-netty can't distinguish between Sharable and Unsharable codecs    Camel-netty uses general configuration model for referenced encoders/decoders for channel pipelines  see DefaultServerPipelineFactory. That is  create encoder/decoder objects at configuration parsing time and store them in a list  then use them when a pipeline is established. However  this will make encoder/decoder objects shared among different pipelines  that may cause data conflicts  when the encoder/decoder is not Sharable(has object status/not annotated as @Sharable)  e.g. a LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder.Although we can avoid the problem by totally writing a new serverpipelinefactory for our apps  several problem still remains  please see detailed description and testcase for this bug at:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/camel-netty-bug-and-the-need-of-best-practice-for-creating-referenced-parameter-object-on-looking-up-td5627926.html
