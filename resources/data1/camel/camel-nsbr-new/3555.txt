camel-jms - Improve logic waiting for ReplyTo destination to be computed when doing request/reply    When you use request/reply over JMS a JMSReplyTo destination must be computed which happens async by the MessageListenerContainer which is to listen for the replies.The currently logic uses some low-level thread wait/notify scheme.We should change that to use the concurrency API using a countdown latch. That's much better.
