Consumer URI parameters ignored after Route Restart    The URI parameters for a consumer appear to be ignored or disappear when the route where this consumer defined gets restarted.One example could be JPA query passed in the URI and is used to filter the results from the consumer.The attached test case shows this.Look at the Readme.txt  camel-context.xml  and JPARouteRestartTest class for more information.Also  took a stab at fixing the problem and provided a patch with a possible solution. I ran the unit tests after that change and all passed.
