camel-netty - unable to consume on UDP multicast addresses    When using a route to listen to UDP multicast address   no messages seem to get consumed. No exceptions are observed. Multicast address is defined as addresses in the range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address)Input was simple string (e.g. 'Test String')Example Route:&lt;route&gt; &lt;from uri='netty:udp://225.1.1.1:8001?allowDefaultCodec=false&amp;sync=false&amp;broadcast=true'/&gt;&lt;/route&gt;Found an old topic in the user discussion forum that seems related. Did not find any unit tests in the Camel source code exercising this behavior. (http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/camel-netty-and-multicast-tt4638622.html)
