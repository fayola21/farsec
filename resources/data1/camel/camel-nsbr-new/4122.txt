JMX API to create/delete endpoint    we can create endpoints on the fly via the camel-web REST API; or by just sending a message to a new endpoint URI or consuming from a URI. But there is currently no JMX way to do so which is a bit of an omission.Something like...createEndpoint(String uri);would be a nice addition to the MBeans API on a ManagedCamelContext. Maybe a removeEndpoint(String uri) too would be handy.
