Scala DSL: no tokenize('...') method    This is related to issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-5803It looks like the fix included tokenizeXML() method  but there is still not tokenize()  I have a usecase where I have to split my in message body (text) by semi-colon character for downstream processing  so I need to be able to do something like the following in Scala DSL:split(_.in) tokenize(';')I fix would be very welcome  also  if there is a work around with TokenizeLanguage etc - please let me know  thank you!
