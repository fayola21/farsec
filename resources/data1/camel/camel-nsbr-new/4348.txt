Add String->TimeZone converter so that time zone can be specified for camel-quartz    It is possible to specify a time zone for Quartz  however  in order for that to work Camel needs a String to TimeZone type converter since Quartz requires a TimeZone.Attached is a patch containing a type converter that works. By setting the type converter explicitly on the context like this context.getTypeConverterRegistry().addTypeConverter(TimeZone.class  String.class  new String2TimeZoneConverter());it is possible to create an endpoint URI looking like this:quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=&lt;cronExpression&gt;&amp;trigger.timeZone=Europe/StockholmHowever  it would be really useful if this type converter could be included in camel-core. This has been discussed on the camel user list:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/How-to-specify-a-time-zone-for-camel-quartz-td4700077.html
