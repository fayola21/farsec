BlueprintCamelContext should not get started in the init() method but later when the blueprint container is fully initialized    The init() method in BlueprintCamelContext should not call maybeStart(). but instead should be started when the blueprint container is done doing all its dance and initialization.For example Spring sends on ContextRefreshedEvent when its done.We need something similar for blueprint to tell us when its done doing its initialization et all.The problem is that the CamelContext should not be started until all that other stuff is initialized as well.
