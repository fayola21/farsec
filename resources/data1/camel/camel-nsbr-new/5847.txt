camel-mongodb - Add converters for files or inputstreams    Inserting files into MongoDB doesn't work like this:from('file:///tmp/test/apachecon?runLoggingLevel=TRACE') .to('mongodb:connectionBean?database=x&amp;collection=y&amp;operation=insert');It requires an explicit .convertBodyTo(String.class). The attached patch adds Converter}}s for File and InputStream object  detecting and supporting both {{JSON and BSON files/streams.The new String(input  'utf-8')) fragment seems a bit dodgy  but I don't really see a better way.
