Detect uncaught exceptions in UoWProcessor to ensure UoW is done even for those uncaught exceptions    The Camel routing engines will handle this in 99.9% of the cases  but when you shutdown a Spring AC then Spring may stop beans in whatever order and this can cause those beans to fail operating during a graceful shutdown. And in worst case exceptions is thrown in situations where they are not normally done.To cater for that and other situations the UoWProcessor should detect this and act accordingly.This ensure the in flight registry will be tracked and we are not stuck with a missing inflight message  causing Camel to wait for the 300 sec timeout to shutdown.For example just try hitting ctrl + c in that camel-example-management and you can see such an example.
