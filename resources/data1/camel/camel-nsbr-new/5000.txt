Error handler not called when recipient list has non existing endpoint    Given this route onException(Exception.class) .handled(true) .to('mock:dead'); from('direct:start') .recipientList(constant('fail:endpoint')) .to('mock:result');You would assume the on exception will handle the exception from the recipient list with the non existing endpoint.This is not the case. We should let recipient list detect and let the error handler handle it.
