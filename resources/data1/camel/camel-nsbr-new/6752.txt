Bean binding to covariant methods throws AmbiguousMethodCallException    Attached is a patch and test case for an issue in the bean binding code which prevents binding to an overloaded method with a covariant return type from the base class. The fix is to check for method covariance at the last moment before throwing AmbiguousMethodCallException. If all methods remaining are covariant  any one of them can be called. Unfortunately this happens in 3 places in the code- if we pre-filtered the list of methods then we could lose annotations on either of the method signature which could be problematic depending on the resolution type.
