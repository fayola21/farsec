Bindy should support clipping fields if they exceed maximum length allowed when using fixed length    Adding a new option to bindy annotation /** * Indicates to clip data in the field if it exceeds the allowed length when using fixed length. */ boolean clip() default false;Then if enabled it will clip the data so it can fit the length.Also now Camel throws an exception if the data is too long and you have clip set as false.
