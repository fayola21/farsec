EventNotifiers don't work under Blueprint    EventNotifiers don't work with Blueprint Camel Contexts. Testing on latest 2.10-SNAPSHOT  updated on 22 May 16:45 GMT.After some debugging  it looks like the bean lookup performed on line 202 of AbstractCamelContextFactoryBean.afterPropertiesSet() triggers the initialization of the CamelContext as part of the lookup. As part of the init  all services are started  including the ManagementContext and its EventNotifiers (which we were just looking up).EventNotifiers are then added but never started because they came in late.
