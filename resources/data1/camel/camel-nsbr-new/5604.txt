camel-jackson - Make it easier to support List as output out of the box    See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/JSON-Jackson-return-list-rather-than-POJO-tp5717341.htmlWe should look into making it easier to output a List as output with jackson json. On the nabble link there is an example and pseduo code how to do that.We should find a way to make that easy in Camel. Either as some new option  or somehow auto detect its a List etc.
