OSGi - No possibility to enable ehcache clustering as: ehcache.xml is ignored and there is no possibility to set cacheManagerFactory described camel-cache docs    This bug is caused by more than one problem as:1. camel-cache bundle provides ehcache.xml config which is ignored so then default ehcache-failsafe.xml is taken by ehcache bundle.2. according to camel-cache docs there is a way to set cacheManagerFactory but it seems to be not implemented asa) default CacheManagerFactory instance is created when when CacheComponent is instantiated.b) setter method: public void setCacheManagerFactory(CacheManagerFactory cacheManagerFactory) is used just nowhere.c) there is no suitable filed in class CacheConfigurationAll above problems cause camel-cache to be not able to work in java- clustered world as default failsafe config. is really failsafe- w/o clustering.
