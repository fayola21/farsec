jt400: program call should support binary format    Data queue message exchange supports both text and binary formats and so should the remote program call exchange. The specification is the same as the one for the data queue.Additionally  this patch supports the concept of ommiting a parameter. This is achieved by passing null as the parameter value.Implementation note:Since I don't know Camel's policy regarding API breaking  I opted to refer to Jt400DataQueueEndpoint.Format; but Format should now be a top-level class  since the concept is the same for data queues and programs.
