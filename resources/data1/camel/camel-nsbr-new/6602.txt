camel-cxf ClassCastException when use cxf FailoverFeature    With PAYLOAD data format used  the first element in argument is casted to a CxfPayload instance and the argument is changed into a List&lt;DOMSource&gt; instance by the method 'setParameters' in class org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfEndpoint.Then FailoverFeature calls retry  the class-cast action throws a ClassCastException.btw: 'message.remove(DataFormat.class)' at the end of the method 'setParameters' dosn't work. The method 'remove' is inherited from Map  and a new message with data format PAYLOAD is created when retry.
