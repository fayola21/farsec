Main is bound to DefaultCamelContext    We are using our own CamelContext  which is extending the DefaultCamelContext. Using Main is impossible in this case  since the getCamelContextMap()-method creates statically a DefaultCamelContext. Overriding this method doesn't works either  since the field registery is final  and no other accessors are defined.The given path doesn't breaks existing code bases  and gives an easy possiblity to override the context-creation  as well as access to the registry.
