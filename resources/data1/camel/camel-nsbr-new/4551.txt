NotifyBuilder wereSentTo condition fires too eagerly    Problem is:NotifyBuilder notify = new NotifyBuilder(context)  .whenDone(2).wereSentTo('mock:bar');The wereSentTo condition will fire after first message gets to endpoint 'mock:bar'  so either needs to take preceding whenDone into account  or wereSentTo needs to have a count condition added to it's method signature.See nabble trail for full details:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/NotifyBuilder-condition-fails-to-match-on-an-out-activemq-endpoint-tp4689038p4867857.html
