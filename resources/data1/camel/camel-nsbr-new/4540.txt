Unable to convert jms textmessage to bytemessage    When receiving a jms textmessage and just forward it to a another queue as a jms bytemessage the original textmessage is sendt without being converted to a jms bytemessage. JmsBinding.makeJmsMessage seems to use the exchange headers to determine of a new jms message should be created or the original send.Exchange headers seems to be populated if you do routing or set a dummy header.See http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Convert-jms-message-from-textmessage-to-bytemessage-tc4895362.html/preben
