Move org.apache.camel.Main to org.apache.camel.main.Main    I am currently looking into the dependencies betwen packages in camel-core. The packages org.apache.camel and org.apache.camel.spi form the camel api.So I am trying to make them not depend on other packages from camel-core. One problem there is the starter class Main. It needs access to impl packages as it needs to start camel. So it should not live in org.apache.camel.I propose to move it to org.apache.camel.main. To not break anything right now I will create a deprecated class Main in org.apache.camel that extends the moved Main. We can remove the deprecated version in camel 3.0
