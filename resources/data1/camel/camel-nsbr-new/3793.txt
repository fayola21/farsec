Try to copy file when rename fails    I have a setup where I use file component to move files after being processed ou when processing fails.As I have no troubles neither on my development workstation neither on local directory on my linux environnement. It fails when the monitored directory is a NFS mounted directory pointing to a Windows 2008 Server shared directory.While it's not a camel bug  the generated logs are just useless because we can't get the reason of failure.Investigating the source code tells me that the File.renameTo method is used (with the three times try hack for Windows   so I can't get any further information on the reason.Could you implement a fallback strategy like copy the file and delete the original one ? (should it be made optional)To workaround this  I currently do the move operations manually by invoking the FileUtils.moveTo(...) from commons-io (which implements exactly the fallback method I described on renameTo failure).But  I have side effects as I'm forced to use the noop attribute.(in fact  it doesn't explain why the rename fails  but it works  and should it be a failure I'll get an explicit error message).
