Camel-Redis: Serializer passed through URI is used only on consumer    Please add camel-redis componentThe serializer passed through URI is used only on consumer and not on producer. Beside been unexpected and undocumented I think it can cause problems on interacting with the Redis DB if the same serializer is not used in both ways.You can find the example and discussion of this problem on this thread on the forum:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/camel-redis-strings-serialization-td5738994.htmlI put as minor because from the discussion it looks like it is possible to have a workaround using a RedisTemplate.
