When a route is removed from camel  LifecycleStrategy is called twice    DefaultCamelContext.removeRoute method has these lines among others if (getRouteStatus(routeId).isStopped()) { routeService.setRemovingRoutes(true); shutdownRouteService(routeService); removeRouteDefinition(routeId); ServiceHelper.stopAndShutdownServices(routeService);I think the last line from this snippet is not needed  because the route should be already stopped in order to pass the IF statement and then it is shutdown through this call shutdownRouteService(routeService); ServiceHelper.stopAndShutdownServices(routeService) tries to stops again the route if not stopped  but the worse is it shutdown the rout again.It seems to me like a bug  other thoughts?
