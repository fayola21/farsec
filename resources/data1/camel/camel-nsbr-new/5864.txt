Pre-XSLT and Validator Type Conversions from byte[] may easily fail    XsltBuilder.getSource(Exchange e  Object o) tries to convert the payload to a Source. If you have a byte[] payload  then the following type converter will likely be picked:InstanceMethodTypeConverter: public javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource org.apache.camel.converter.jaxp.XmlConverter.toSAXSource(byte[] org.apache.camel.Exchange) throws java.io.IOException org.xml.sax.SAXException javax.xml.transform.TransformerExceptionThis type converter requires the Exchange (InstanceMethodTypeConverter.useExchange == true)  but line 461 of XsltBuilder doesn't pass it on.Therefore  a NullPointerException happens because the conversion method tries to access the Exchange.
