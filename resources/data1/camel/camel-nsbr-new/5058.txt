Bug: Unique Endpoints Leaking in DefaultInflightRepository    If you have an endpoint protocol which uses unique URIs you will leak Strings in the HashMap stored in the DefaultInflightRepository (org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultInflightRepository)It seems there is a reference counting scheme in place  but it doesn't do a remove until the 'stop' method is called to shut the system down. We are running XMPP endpoints  which use a protocol like xmpp://someaccount@domain/password?to=someOtherAccountWhen there are 10 million accounts  not all of which are active  but all of which may message at some time or another  no references are removed to the endpointCount.When the count becomes 0  the reference should be removed and the size method will still return the appropriate result.Please be careful in the implementation to synchronize on some object (perhaps the AtomicInteger) reflecting a read/write lock on the endpoint count modification.
