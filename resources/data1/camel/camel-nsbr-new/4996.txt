DigitalSignatureEndpoint not clearing headers after verify    The DigitalSignatureEndpoint has a clearHeaders option that is supposed to clear headers after a verify operation. However that is not working because the headers cleared are not the actual header values  but the name of the java String fields  which is irrelevant at runtime.The default value of the clearHeaders should also be true  so that Camel does not leave debris in the Exchange after a verify operation.
