FileIdempotentRepository fileStore does not get loaded on bootrapping  therefore files are processed again    I am using JVM based initialization of Camel using Spring.I use the documented Camel initialization procedure of main.setApplicationContext('my-spring-camel-config.xml');main.start()I also use the documented FileIdempotentRepository that points to a FileStore.However  when Camel initializes this filestore is not loaded up. Hence  the LRU cache contained within this is empty.As a result  all my files are FTPed again from the remote server.This happens everytime I start my JVM resulting in expensive FTP of files.
