When performing lookup in registry and having expected type as parameter  then report better failure if ClassCastException    When Camel lookup in the registry  it may lookup in different runtime registries  such as OSGi blueprint. If an explicit type has been provided as a parameter you will get a ClassCastException if the type does not match. But you cannot see which types was a stake. So we should provide a better exception.Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException at java.lang.Class.cast(Class.java:2990)&#91;:1.6.0_24&#93; at org.apache.camel.blueprint.BlueprintContainerRegistry.lookup(BlueprintContainerRegistry.java:43) at org.apache.camel.impl.CompositeRegistry.lookup(CompositeRegistry.java:47) at org.apache.camel.impl.PropertyPlaceholderDelegateRegistry.lookup(PropertyPlaceholderDelegateRegistry.java:54) ... 42 more
