The debugger doesn't work in the CamelSpringTestSupport with route defined in XML    The debugger doesn't work in the CamelSpringTestSupport with route defined in XML. This issue is related to CAMEL-4368 (closed and I cannot re-open).I've created a patch with 2 new tests that show the problem and a solution (check the doSetup() method in the tests). However I think this could be improved by moving the SpringCamelContext.setNoStart(true); to CamelSpringTestSupport).
