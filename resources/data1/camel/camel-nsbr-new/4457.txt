Resolve cycle between language.simple and language.simple.ast    Currently we have a big dpendency cycle between language.simple and language.simple.ast.As simple creates the ast this dependency is necessary. In the other direction ast needs types and exceptions that are inside simple.So I propose to nove these classes into a package simple.types. As I think these types and exceptions are not used outside the camel-core I will not create compatibility measures.
