Spring-WS consumer and producer do not propagate some custome headers and attachements to a response message    Hi!I wanted to send back as response or as a request some soap messages with modified header.I found out that SpringWebserviceProducer and SpringWebserviceConsumer do not populate a soap header for any outgoing message from a camel exchange.In the attachments I am sending you a patch against camel-spring-ws 2.10.1 that solves this issue.Please let me know  what do you think about it.Best regards Andrej
