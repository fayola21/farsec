SLF4JLog does not work with JdbcDriver for Quickfix/J    I discovered that to use SLF4J log  JdbcDriver cannot be present in the Quickfix/J config file. Otherwise  the default LogFactory - ScreenLogFactory will be used. We need JdbcDriver setting as it is used for persisting FIX messages into database for FIX session management.After debugging the code  I found out that this could be fixed by swapping those two lines in QuickfixjEngine.java298: isJdbcLog(settings  impliedLogFactories);299: isSL4JLog(settings  impliedLogFactories);Can we please have this fixed for the next release?
