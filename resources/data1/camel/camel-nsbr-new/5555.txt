In ScheduledRoutePolicy a suspended route cannot be started    If a route is suspended using the ScheduledRoutePolicy and its subclasses (CronScheduledRoutePolicy)  it cannot be resumed or started.Looking at the code in ScheduledRoutePolicy.onJobExecute()  on start/resume actions  the route status is first checked and must be stopped or suspended before any actions is taken.Suspension of a route  only suspends the consumer and not the route  and hence the start/resume after a suspend does nothing.One solution could be to also check the status of the consumer on start/resume. This would require adding a isSuspended() to serviceHelper and should be relatively straightforward.
