EIPs using custom aggregation strategy should fail if not possible to find in registry    Some EIPs support using a custom aggregations strategy. And if you use XML DSL to refer to a custom strategy  then you may have typo  or the strategy do not implement the interface.What we should do is to ensure to fail if the custom strategy could not be looked up. Some EIPs such as the content enricher will fallback and use a default strategy. This is wrong.
