Wrong slash in FTP component for doneFile    I tried to use the doneFile with FTP component.When I used it to my FTP on my windows machine everything goes fine.When I tried to act the same with a FTP host on a Linux machine  I got an issue.I sniff the packet to see what goes wrong and I see this :the doneFile DELE public/Test/in/myFile.txt the file to processDELE public/Test/in/myFile.xmlAfter a Quick look on the code:org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileEndpoint line 682 String answer = pattern; if (ObjectHelper.isNotEmpty(path) &amp;&amp; ObjectHelper.isNotEmpty(pattern)) { // done file must always be in same directory as the real file name answer = path + File.separator + pattern; } if (getConfiguration().needToNormalize()) { // must normalize path to cater for Windows and other OS answer = FileUtil.normalizePath(answer); }We use the 'File.Separator' but in this case  it should get a kind of 'FTP.Separator' or the FTP component should return true to the needToNormalize method and change the narmalizePath method to manage this case.
