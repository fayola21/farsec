Make SqsConsumer support async processors    Switch SqsConsumer from using getProcessor().process() to getAsyncProcessor().process() with a callback to allow use of async processors.As I understand it is ok to always use the async processor call as its to show that 'the caller supports having the exchange asynchronously processed' rather than specifically always process it asynchronously.
