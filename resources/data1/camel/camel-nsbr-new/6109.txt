step in a  block runs when the  tag is closed in the wrong place    Example route:&lt;doTry&gt; &lt;to ... &gt;&lt;/doTry&gt;&lt;doCatch&gt; &lt;exception&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/exception&gt; &lt;to uri='log.... '/&gt;&lt;/doCatch&gt;The &lt;to uri='log...'/&gt; line will execute every time  regardless if there is an exception or not.I believe the preferred behavior would be that the route should fails to load/validate. Alternatively  the &lt;to uri='log..' /&gt; should not run when there is not an exception.Thanks!
