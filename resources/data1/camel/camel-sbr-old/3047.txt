JettyHttpComponent.doStop() shuts down all servers in the VM  not just those associated with the component    We are running several bundles in Karaf with separate Camel contexts  each of which uses the camel-jetty component to expose services over HTTP. Each bundle has an assigned port and may listen on multiple URIs. We noticed that when we updated or shut down one of these bundles  all of the Jetty servers in the other bundles would stop listening on their respective ports.The problem is that the map of ConnectorRef objects in JettyHttpComponent is static  and therefore shared across the entire VM. Changing this from static to an instance variable fixed the issue for us.
