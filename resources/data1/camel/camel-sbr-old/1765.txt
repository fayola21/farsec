License for One-JAR classes not included in camel-example-spring one-jar artifact. Also apache legal files missing    The license for the com/simontuffs/onejar files is at http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=documents&amp;file=license.When I build camel-example-spring neither this license nor the apache license nor apache notice file is in the one-jar.jar artifact.I'd suggest disabling the one-jar plugin until someone can figure out how to include these files.
