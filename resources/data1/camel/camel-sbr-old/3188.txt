Concurrent consumers on seda endpoint can cause content routing to mismatch    When consuming concurrently from a seda endpoint  when the route contains a content router based on the header  it will randomly route through the wrong choice.In my specific case  I was consuming from an activemq queue  which would receive messages with a header that would then determine which route it would follow. It would randomly send messages down the wrong path. When I turned on tracing  it would behave itself. It also behaved itself when I limited it to only a single consumer. I was  however  able to duplicate it with the unit test below. Due to the concurrency issue  the test can occasionally pass  but run it a couple times and it should fail. It'll either receive 2 messages when it should have only gotten 1  or it will get no messages when it should have gotten 1.ConcurrencyTest.javaimport org.apache.camel.EndpointInject;import org.apache.camel.Produce;import org.apache.camel.ProducerTemplate;import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;import org.apache.camel.component.mock.MockEndpoint;import org.apache.camel.test.CamelTestSupport;public class ConcurrencyTest extends CamelTestSupport { @EndpointInject(uri = 'mock:result') protected MockEndpoint resultEndpoint; @EndpointInject(uri = 'mock:otherResult') protected MockEndpoint otherResultEndpoint; @Produce(uri = 'seda:start') protected ProducerTemplate template; public void testSendMatchingMessage() throws Exception { String expectedBody = '&lt;matched/&gt;'; resultEndpoint.expectedBodiesReceived(expectedBody); otherResultEndpoint.expectedBodiesReceived(expectedBody); template.sendBodyAndHeader(expectedBody  'myDirection'  'send'); template.sendBodyAndHeader(expectedBody  'myDirection'  'received'); resultEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(); } @Override protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() { return new RouteBuilder() { public void configure() { from('seda:start?concurrentConsumers=10')// from('seda:start?concurrentConsumers=1') .choice() .when(header('myDirection').isEqualTo('send')).to('mock:result') .when(header('myDirection').isEqualTo('received')).to('mock:otherResult'); } }; }}
