Apply removeHeader also to the underying JMS message delegate    In case of a JMS message  header information is redundantly stored in org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsMessage (here Camel-Message) and in its javax.jms.Message jmsMessage delegate (here JMS-Message). Currently you cannot remove effectively any header from the Camel-Message instance as in the next processing step those removed headers resurrect from the underlying JMS-Message.Please provide any means to remove or or at least mask out those headers from the underlying JMS-Message.
