Improve URISupport.sanitizeUri and apply it in additional places    In this issue  I propose that URISupport.sanitizeUri method sanitizes the password token in URIs that contain it (i.e.  URIs in the form scheme://user:password@host). JT400 component URIs directly benefit from this improvement.Additionally  I suggest that this method be invoked in additional sensitive places (in much the same way as DefaultEndpoint.toString()).Proposed patch attached.
