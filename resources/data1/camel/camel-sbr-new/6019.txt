Add PGP signature and signature verification support to PGPDataFormat    PGPDataFormat currently supports PGP encryption (equivalent to 'gpg -e') and decryption (equivalent to 'gpg -d')  but does not support simultaneously encrypting and signing (equivalent to 'gpg -e -s') or simultaneously decrypting and verifying (equivalent to 'gpg -v -d').This patch adds three new optional attributes to the PGPDataFormat class (signatureKeyUserid  signatureKeyFileName  signaturePassword)  which can be used to sign while encrypting  or to verify a signature while decrypting.
