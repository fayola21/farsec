The camel-cometd component does not support a custom SecurityPolicy or Extension as described on http://cometd.org/documentation/howtos/authentication    The camel-cometd component does not support a custom SecurityPolicy or Extension as described on http://cometd.org/documentation/howtos/authenticationA simple solution is to add setters for SecurityPolicy and Extension to the component. If these attributes are set then also set them on the underlying AbstractBayeux class.About the patch:The existing unit test is based on an interactive scenario that involves human intervention. A similar test is made that uses an extension and another one is made that needs authentication. To provide feedback on a failed authentication a cometd listener is used. The version of the cometd-dojo extension used does not support listeners so this dojo extension has also been upgraded to 1.1.4.
