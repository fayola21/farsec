camel-mybatis should do a proper transaction demarcation while reading/writing from/to database.    See http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/MyBatis-Component-Bug-consumer-onConsume-hits-error-transactions-are-committed-instead-of-rollback-td5716774.htmlOther than DefaultMyBatisProcessingStrategy the same issue exists by MyBatisProducer as well.Another thing which is currently missing completley is that there's no transaction demarcation by the Producer at all while reading from the database  e.g. by SelectOne or SelectList statement types.
