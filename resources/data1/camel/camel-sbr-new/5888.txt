When call removeRouteDefinition the route doesn't removed from collection of route Definitions.    When I call removeRouteDefinition for DefaultCamelContext  the route doesn't removed from collection of routes. public synchronized void removeRouteDefinition(RouteDefinition routeDefinition) throws Exception { String id = routeDefinition.idOrCreate(nodeIdFactory); stopRoute(id); removeRoute(id); }it is just remove it from running route service if context is running.When we do restart context this route started again. Workaround for this issue is call removeRouteDefinitions and wrap single route into collection.But when I call removeRouteDefinitions - it is process correctly: remove from collections of definitions and after removed from running route services. public synchronized void removeRouteDefinitions(Collection&lt;RouteDefinition&gt; routeDefinitions) throws Exception { this.routeDefinitions.removeAll(routeDefinitions); for (RouteDefinition routeDefinition : routeDefinitions) { removeRouteDefinition(routeDefinition); } }
