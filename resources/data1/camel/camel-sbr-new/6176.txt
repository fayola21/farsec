Camel 2.10.1 incapable of working with + in endpoint URIs    In the class org.apache.camel.util.URISupport which will be used to resolve endpoints (DefaultCamelContext#normalizeEndpointUri) the method parseParameters will be called.At first the java.net.Uri#getQuery will be called with according to the javadoc 'Returns the decoded query component of this URI' returns a decoded URI. If that fails the java.net.Uri#getSchemeSpecificPart method will be called which according to the javadoc 'Returns the decoded scheme-specific part of this URI.' returns a decoded URI.So to summarize we get in any case a decoded URI.As workaround for CAMEL-4954 all % are encoded  i.e. replaced by %25.The URI will then be decoded again in the method org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#parseQuery(String) with java.net.URLDecoder#decode(String String).This code leads to the following behaviour: If a + is properly encoded with foo%2Bbar the foo%2Bbar will be substituted by the first call with foo+bar and then decoded again which leads to foo bar. If the + is not encoded at all foo+bar will be decoded to foo bar in the first step and not be changed again in the second step. If the + is double encoded to foo%252Bbar the first call will transform it to foo%2Bbar  then the workaround for CAMEL-4954 will change it back to foo%252Bbar and the final decode will change it again to foo%2Bbar.Thus  currently there is no way to use a + in passwords or similar parameter values if the parameter has to be supplied via endpoint URIs.
