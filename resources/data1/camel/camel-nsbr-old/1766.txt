Upgrade maven build to use apache 6 pom and related features.    Geronimo recently has had some problems due to unversioned snapshots of camel. Since nexus automatically cleans up old snapshots it's preferred to use unique timestamped snapshots when publishing to apache nexus.There are some other nice standard featrues of the apache 6 pom and related work such as automatic source archive creation. I'm attaching a patch that updates to apache 6 pom and cleans up a few other things.Since the build fails for me before the changes I can't be very sure that these changes break nothing.
