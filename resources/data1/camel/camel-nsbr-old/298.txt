Remove tangle between impl and impl.converter    Currently impl and impl.converter reference each other. If possible such cycles should be avoided.When I looked into it I found that impl.converter references only a single class CachingInjector. No other class in camel-core seems to use this class. So my suggestion is to move CachingInjector to impl.converter. So the cycle i removed. As far as I can see this should cause no ther issues.
