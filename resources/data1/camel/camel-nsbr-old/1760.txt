Unable to read post params from request    If consuming messsages from jetty endpoint there is no way to read post parameters from HttpServletRequest. In example getting HttpServletRequest from body :HttpServletRequest req = exchange.getIn().getBody(HttpServletRequest.class);req.getParameterMap() returns allways empty mapThe problem is that jetty Request.extractParameters() method is trying to read post parameters from Request.getInputStream(). But unfortunately someone strips the input stream before and req.getInputStream() returns allways 0 bytesThe workaround for me is to extend DefaultHttpBinding as described in: http://camel.apache.org/jetty.htmlMyHttpBinding .javapublic class MyHttpBinding extends DefaultHttpBinding { public void readRequest(HttpServletRequest request  HttpMessage message) { request.getParameterMap(); super.readRequest(request message); }}calling request.getParameterMap() will cache parameters inside jetty Request and it's possible to query params later  without having inputStream
