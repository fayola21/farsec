Current mina component can't tansfer the exchange fault message body    I just found MinaTransferExchangeOptionTest don't show how to set fault message and the fault message is not a part of MinaPayloadHolder.You can't set the exception on the exchange in the processor   sine the camel DeadLetterChannel will try to redeliver the message.So we just need to support put the exception which need to send back to the camel client into the fault message body.
