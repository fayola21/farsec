template   consumerTemplate  service  proxy can't be set with right camel context if there are more than one camel context in the spring application context    Current camel support to define a producer template OUTSIDE a camel context  I think it works well just like the autowire function which is provided in Spring.If there more than two Camel context in the Spring Application context   the user should specify the camel context which the template should use.But I have a concern that even we put the template INSIDE the camel context  the template will not be set with a right version of camel context  since we use a CamelPostProcessor to inject CamelContext.So I did a quick test on the current Camel code and found there is a bug if there are more one CamelContext &#8211; CamelPostProcessor will inject the last create camel context into the CamelContextAware object. Since it is not easy to add the camelContext referece id into the template element attribute  we'd better just support to parser these elements inside the camel context.
