JMS-Headers are ignored in Producer    Camel jms producer ignores some JMSHeaders. For example the header JMSPriority is ignored - due to the comment in the code  because it is set by the producer. But it should not only be set by the produer due to the received message  it should also be possible to set a priority using the JMSPriority header on the consumer. (See also the option preserveMessageQos on the jms endpoint - if every JMSHeader is ignored by the producer it is impossible to set Qos-Properties on the message.)The reason for the bug is in org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsBinding#appendJmsProperty. The follwoing JMS message headers are useful for sending messages and therefore should be copied to the jms message: JMSDestination JMSDeliveryMode JMSExpiration JMSPriority JMSMessageID JMSTimestamp
