CamelContext's setErrorHandler is not effect when the jmx agent is disabled    The example applications from Camel 1.4 source distribution work correctly on my machine. After comparing the sample Spring XML configuration and my Spring configuration  I noticed there is no jmxAgent element in the sample XML where my configuration has this element. The problem I noticed was that when the disabled attribute of the jmxAgent element is set to true  the redelivery policy does not work. http://www.nabble.com/DeadLetterChannel-Configuration-Camel-1.4-td18622356s22882.html#a18622356
