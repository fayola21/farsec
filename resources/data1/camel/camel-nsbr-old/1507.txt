Allow sending multipart/alternative MIME messages with both a plain-text and text/html body  and allow sending images inline    To send a multipart/alternative email you have to follow a pretty specific course.This adds a property (which is poorly named in this patch) to the MailConfiguration that names the header that contains the plaintext version of the email  and adds a property where you can embed images inline. If an attachment has a filename starting with 'cid:' then this will add the 'Content-ID' header to that multipart body - which will allow the email client to put the image in the appropriate place when it is viewed. (i.e. the html email has something like &lt;image src='cid:0001' /&gt; and the attachment is named 'cid:0001' - when it sees an inline attachment with 'Content-ID: 0001' it will put it in the right spot)
