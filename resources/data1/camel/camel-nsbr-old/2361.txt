Keep the lastModified timestamp when writing a file    &gt;&gt; I do the following:&gt;&gt;&gt; 'ftp://tata@.../ftp.input?&amp;recursive=true&amp;binary=true&amp;consumer.delay=1000')&gt; .to('file://M:/FTP.INPUT/');&gt;&gt; I would like to have my file in transfered and keeping their&gt; lastModifiedTime.
