doCatch() - Without any exception given should report that as a problem    Code like this .doTry() .to('mock:b') .throwException(new IllegalArgumentException('Damn')) .doCatch() .to('mock:catch') .end();Should report a failure in the route as doCatch must have at least 1 exception as parameter.It should correctly be .doCatch(Exception.class)We could also consider using Excpetion.class as default but in Java you must also provide the exception to catch and thus its more intuitive if its 100% like Java
