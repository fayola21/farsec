GenericFileProducer.writeFile method creates instance of un-used InputStream    org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileProducerMethod: writeFileThis method has the following statement:InputStream payload = exchange.getIn().getBody(InputStream.class);This internally results in calling a TypeConverter to convert an object into InputStream type. However this InputStream has not been used and is eventually closed in the finally block. In the same method calling method storeFile on FileOperations (boolean success = operations.storeFile(fileName  exchange) also opens an InputStream on the same message.
