jms aggregation does not work    I found this issue when I test Camel 1.4.0 RC2 kit  I just add a test case to show the error.https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/camel/trunk/components/camel-jms/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/jms/AggregratedJmsRouteTest.javaYou can reproduce the error if you remove the x character from xtestJmsMulticastAndAggregration() method.BTW the test case works with the Camel 1.4.0 RC1.
