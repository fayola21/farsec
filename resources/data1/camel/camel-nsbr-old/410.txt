Exception handling of the ErrorHandlerSupport class    When you configure your route builder and say you want to configure two exceptions lets say: NullPointer and Exception. Now say the bean you call as your end point throws a NullPointer  wouldn't you think the NullPointer policy would handle that exception? Well I'm seeing sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't due to the map not keeping the exceptions in any particular order. Is there anyway this could be changed to a LinkedHashMap or a List?Issue with class: org.apache.camel.processor.ErrorHandlerSupport
