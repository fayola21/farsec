Aggregation raises NullPointerException if last file in batch is not to be aggregated.    When trying to aggregate files from a directory  it seems that camel-core raises a NullPointerException if the last file of the batch is a single file. That is it doesn't match the correlationExpression with any other files and therefore should just pass through. If such a file is the first file or in the middle of the files (alphabetically) this issue is not present.See:http://old.nabble.com/Aggregator-problem-with-files-(Camel-2.3)-td28778641.html#a28780522
