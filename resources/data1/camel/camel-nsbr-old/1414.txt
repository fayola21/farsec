JMSMessage vanishes attachments    When using this kind of route&lt;from uri='activemq:queue:test'/&gt;&lt;camel:process ref='mailProcessor' /&gt;&lt;to uri='smtp://localhost:25?to=user@localhost' /&gt;and trying to enrich the message in the mailProcessor withexchange.getIn().addAttachment('attachement.txt'  new DataHandler('Hello world'  'text/plain'));The received mail doesn't contains any attachment.If the input 'from' is a 'direct' instead of activemq  it works fine.Inspecting source code  MessageSupport.copyFrom(Message that) doesgetAttachments().putAll(that.getAttachments());but the child class JmsMessage doesn't.
