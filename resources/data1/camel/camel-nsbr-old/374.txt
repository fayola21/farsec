HttpBinding.writeResponse doesn't set the response status code (i.e. it's always 200)    When writing out an Http response  the HttpBinding should check for the existing of the header HttpProducer.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE and set it in the response if it's there. This allows requests made via the http component to be output with the correct status code info. If also allows processors in the flow to control the status code by setting the header themselves.
