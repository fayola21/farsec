A request route with a topic node incurs a 20 second wait and refers to the wrong MEP.    If a route contains a node that publishes to a topic  the route is incorrectly suspended for a default 20 seconds at the topic node. Further  JmsProducer.java checks the MEP of the original request Exchange and not the endpoint of the topic.For example  say I have a route built like this:from('activemq:queue:request'). to('generate_news'). to('activemq:topic:news'). to('do_something_else');The original request is expecting a reply. However  after the 'news' is pumped into the news topic  there is a default 20 second wait (requestTimeout). This wait always results in the exception: 'The OUT message was not received within: 20000 millis on the exchange...' After reading the JmsProducer code  I changed the route to the following:from('activemq:queue:request'). to('generate_news'). to('activemq:topic:news?exchangePattern=InOnly'). to('do_something_else');This reveals the root of the bug  which is in the first few lines of method org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsProducer.process(Exchange):// public void process(final Exchange exchange) { final org.apache.camel.Message in = exchange.getIn(); if (exchange.getPattern().isOutCapable()) {The above if statement checks the MEP of the original request's Exchange and not the new endpoint of the news topic. This makes the above '?exchangePattern=InOnly' configuration useless  because the original request MEP is InOut. The result is that after that 20 second time-out  the temporary queue for the original request has expired  so the whole request failed. Note that the next node 'do_something_else' is never reached due to the time-out exception.
