Tracer - allow configuration of fixed size of leading breadcrum or let it be variable sized    The TraceFormatter fixes the breadcrum to 65 chars. If you output the exchange id and its based on the computer name it can be long  and thus cut important parts such as the destination.Allow it to be wider and add option to configure the length or let it be variable.breadcrumLength = 65. Setting it to 0 will let it be flexible. Maybe bump the 65 to 80 to let it be bigger from the start.
