Improper configuration of MINA connector and acceptor instances; Better producer    A sample scenario where both MINA producer(s) and consumer(s) are used in the same route (e.g. some kind of dispatching or proxying):from('mina:tcp://localhost:8888?lazySessionCreation=true&amp;sync=true') .to('mina:tcp://localhost:7777?lazySessionCreation=true&amp;sync=true');from('mina:tcp://localhost:7777?lazySessionCreation=true&amp;sync=true') .process(/prepare answer/);Due to improper configuration of MINA acceptor and connector instances in MinaComponent#createSocketEndpoint()  no more than 15 incoming threads can be served at port 8888 &#8211; the producer becomes unable to open an outgoing session. This is actually an issue of MINA  not of Camel &#8211; a test application written using 'raw' MINA shows the same behaviour.A solution is to apply configuration rules described  e.g.  at http://mina.apache.org/configuring-thread-model.html  as done in the attached patch.Moreover  the standard Camel-MINA producer is not thread-safe &#8211; actually a well-known point. A second attached file contains a thread pool-based reentrant version  which can be efficiently used for TCP endpoints with both parameters 'lazySessionCreation' and 'sync' set to true.
