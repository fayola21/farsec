Can only interact with servicemix-http if logging is at DEBUG    Given the following camel DSL:from('activemq:queue.testJms.in')  .to('jbi:service:urn:oms:testHttp?mep=in-out')  .to('activemq:queue.testJms.out'); and the following xbean.xml for the smx (3.3) SU:&lt;http:endpoint  service='oms:testHttp'  endpoint='testHttp'  role='provider'  locationURI='http://localhost:8080/testP1'&gt; &lt;/http:endpoint&gt; then Camel operates correctly (or at least as desired) only if DEBUG logging is enabled in the org.apache.servicemix.http package. This seems to be because a DOMSource is returned (which Camel can convert). If the log level is reduced (say to WARN) then a StreamSource object is returned instead which Camel appears unable to convert. This results in stack traces such as:ERROR - DeadLetterChannel - Failed delivery for exchangeId: ID-davisond-laptop/53380-1232099798317/0-0.
