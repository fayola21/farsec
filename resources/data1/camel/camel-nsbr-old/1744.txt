ScheduledPollConsumer - Should not throw polled exception on stop    See CAMEL-501And nabble:http://www.nabble.com/Bug-in-ScheduledPollingConsumer--td24151070s22882.htmlIf an exception occured during a poll Camel will handle it by a ExceptionHandler you can set on the DefaultConsumer. The default impl will log it at WARN level.But the ScheduledPollingConsumer will remember this and when it does a doStop in case of shutdown or the likes it will throw the first exception occurred during a poll.This will indicate in an ERROR when doing a shtudown and its not really related as the poll error could have happened like 3 months ago.We should not do this. But only handle the poll exception when it occurred. End users can configure their own ExceptionHandler if they want to do something differently than logging.
