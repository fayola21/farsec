Revamped IRC component event adapter logging    Currently only the camel-irc producer installs an event listener on the IRC connection to log incoming messages from the IRC server. This patch revamps the logging so that the component installs an event adapter to do logging before the connection is even established so it's easier to debug various issues that could be occurring with the connection to the IRC server.
