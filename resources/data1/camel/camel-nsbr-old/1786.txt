camel-irc parsing of channel name and parameters is incorrect    If you try and pass some parameters to camel-irc it turns out that camel joins a different IRC channel than expected  for example a URI like:irc://camel-con@irc.codehaus.org:6667/#camel-test?nickname=camel-concauses camel to join #camel-test?nickname=camel-con and not #camel-test with a nickname of camel-con. Will attach a patch that addresses this and updates the unit test.
