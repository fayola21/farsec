JcrProducer node creation throws javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException when using exchange ID as node name    To reproduce  use the camel-jcr component without specifying a node name in the message properties. JcrProducer will attempt to use the exchange ID as the node name  but in ServiceMix 4  this ID contains path separator characters  which results in a PathNotFound exception when the producer attempts to create the node. IMHO  the producer should attempt to create parent nodes as needed when the value of either the exchange ID or the property named JcrConstants.JCR_NODE_NAME contain path separators.
