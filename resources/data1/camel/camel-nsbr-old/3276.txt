Multicast with pipeline may cause wrong aggregated exchange    This is a problem when using 2 set of nested pipeline and doing a transform as the first processor in that pipeline from('direct:start').multicast(new SumAggregateBean()) .pipeline().transform(bean(IncreaseOne.class)).bean(new IncreaseTwo()).to('log:foo').end() .pipeline().transform(bean(IncreaseOne.class)).bean(new IncreaseTwo()).to('log:bar').end() .end() .to('mock:result');
