Cleanup unnecessary copy related methods in Exchange    There are currently 4 apis related to copying exchanges that overlap for the most part  are confusing and unnecessary. The consensus is to replace: Exchange newInstance(); Exchange copy(); Exchange newCopy(boolean handoverOnCompletion); void copyFrom(Exchange source);with: Exchange copy(); Exchange copy(boolean handoverOnCompletion);newInstance() does not bring much value copyFrom() is semantically equivalent to copy()newCopy() will be just renamed to copy(boolean) See nabble thread:http://www.nabble.com/-DISCUSS--Exchange-copy-api-cleanup-td24400340.html
