Graceful shutdown - Add option to shutdown manually added/started routes    If you for example add routes later at runtime  then those where not enlisted on startup and thus not part of the process to be stopped.Those routes added manually should be part of this so they are also shutdown. There should be an option to control this behavior so you can turn it off  in the odd cases you dont want that.
