Support user-defined shutdown timeout for CamelTestSupport    Would be nice if CamelTestSupport could allow user to define the Shutdown timeout of CamelContext.We at Neociclo are finding difficult to debug through JUnit tests because of the hard-coded 10s timeout.public void setUp() ... { ... context = createCamelContext(); assertValidContext(context); // reduce default shutdown timeout to avoid waiting for 300 seconds&#8211; context.getShutdownStrategy().setTimeout(10);++ context.getShutdownStrategy().setTimeout(getShutdownTimeout()); ...}+ protected int getShutdownTimeout() {+ return 10;+ }
