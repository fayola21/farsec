javax.xml.transform.Source and StreamSource wrapped should be easier to route with JMS    See SM-1826What end users need to do is to use .convertBodyTo(String.class) before sending to a JMS queue with Camel when the payload is XML based  eg the javax.xml.transform.Source class that can be wrapped in a StreamCache as well.It should be able to route out of the box by converting to byte[] in the JMS producer
