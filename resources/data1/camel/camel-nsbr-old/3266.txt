support the Ordered Interceptor Strategy configured in spring    Now spring support user to configure their own Interceptor Strategy  but it cannot specifiy the wrap order of the interceptor strategy.So we need to support a feature to let the user define the interceptor's order:user can choice to implement the org.apache.camel.util.Ordered interface for the customed interceptor strategy ;if the interceptor strategy does support a Ordered interface  the camel context will loaded the interceptor-strategies and wrapper the process by the order;For example if I write two interceptor-strategy(A   B)  if A's order is 0  and B's order is 1. the camel will always wrapper the processor as {A{B{Processor}}.
