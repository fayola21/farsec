XmppBinding will add non-serializeable header values to the outgoing xmpp message    I started using velocity in my project which seems to add some headers to the message exchange  the values of which are apparently not serialize-able. As a result when a message in my route gets to the camel-xmpp component it fails in XmppBinding with an IllegalArgumentException as the binding tries to add the bad header. This patch that by not inserting any headers into the xmpp message that don't have serialize-able values.
