xpath expression with $header and the header doesnt exist on the in message results in NPE    Using the $headerkey shorthand for xpath expression throws a NPE if the headerkey doesn't exists on the in message.We should try to find a better workaround for key doesn't exists. The NPE is thrown by SUN in their xpath engine.Check nabble:http://www.nabble.com/Camel-XPath-and-no-variables-found-in-MessageVariableResolver---What-should-Camel-do--td18603960s22882.html
