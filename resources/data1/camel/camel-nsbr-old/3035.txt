provide an optional interface Endpoints can provide to generate a simple String ID which can be used within the class loader to make JMX / REST APIs simpler to avoid having to encode large URIs    rather than taking the URI and encoding it  it would be nice if endpoints could just generate their own unique ID on construction (then we don't have lifecycle issues of keeping track of endpoints coming and going and maintaining a parallel map of Endpoint -&gt; ID etc).We could use the same ID when registering endpoints with JMX etc
