camel-jms - allow a header like JMSDestination to override the destination to send to    We cannot use JMSDestination as it would not work when you do a route from(jms A) to (jms B) as it will go into round about as when received from jms A the header will contain JMSDestination = queue:A and thus Camel will send it back to itself.So we should a different nameCamelJmsDestination
