RoutingSlip - Let it be expression based    Currently the Routing Slip EIP is a bit inflexible as it mandates the attached slip has been created beforehand.It would be nice if you could let it be expression based to generate the initial attached slip.Then end users can use a bean to generate the slip.This requires a change in the DSL which is not backwards compatible.But it makes the EIP in line with Recipient List and others which is expression based.
