java.net.SocketException: Too many open files with Apache Camel(Netty TCP) 2.4.0.    I've got a unit test that works fine with Apache Camel 2.3.0  but as soon as I upgraded to 2.4.0 it consistently started to fail.It performs a number of concurrent requests using this url:netty:tcp://localhost:2048?sync=trueIn both the client and server side of the unit test.There's also a sister test which does the same thing with Netty directly and that works in isolation  so it would appear something has been broken in the transition to 2.4.0. Previously this code was also using a beta version of Netty  but even updating that specific dependency has made no difference.
