File component - write to temp file and rename to real name startegy    When producing files an idea is to write to a temp file that has a name pattern that will be skipped by consumers (such as starting with a dot) and then after the write rename the file to the correct name.Then the consumers wont need to use exotic locking to get exclusive read access to the file. Works on all file systems.There is a nabble discussion on this issue somewhere.
