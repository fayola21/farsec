camel-jetty - Exchange failures should not be returned as 200    The code below: protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception { return new RouteBuilder() { public void configure() throws Exception { errorHandler(noErrorHandler()); from('jetty:http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice').process(new MyBookService()); } }; } public class MyBookService implements Processor { public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception { throw new IllegalArgumentException('Damm'); } }Will return http response code 200. We should let end users easily set what response code they want and in case of route failures we should probably return 500 and return the stracktrace in the body
