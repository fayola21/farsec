Type Converter - if not possible to convert LOG a WARN    An end-user had a route that didn't work and had trouble figure out the problem. Could be the fact that the type converted failed for some reason and no trace in his log.We should add some DEBUG logging to the type converter stuff what it does  especially in cases where it cant convert.http://www.nabble.com/Marshaling-jdbc-output-with-xstream-td19065283s22882.htmlNotice we have another ticket about type converters should fail instead of returning null etc.
