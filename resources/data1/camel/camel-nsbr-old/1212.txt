Improve JMS header name endocing/decoding strategy    We have a scenario where we need to perform the following style of integration:HTTP -&gt; JMS -&gt; HTTPThe final HTTP endpoint needs to receive the headers as they were in the original HTTP request. However  I am finding that the HTTP headers that contain a hyphen (such as Content-Type  Content-Length etc) are being omitted when the messages go onto the queue. JmsBinding has two static methods to perform some basic header manipulation to 'encode' and 'decode' headers that are not valid Java identifiers. However  the strategy employed does not handle hyphens or other illegal characters  only periods. Secondly  as static methods they cannot be overridden by my own extension of JmsBinding. And finally  JmsHeaderFilterStrategy has a static link back to these methods in JmsBinding so that makes it hard to replace.To me  it would be more appropriate that HeaderFilterStrategy implementations should actually contain the code to Advise if a header needs to be encoded/decoded  which it already does  but in addition; Actually perform that encoding/decoding in it's own implementation-specific wayThis affects 1.5.0 but it's also in the trunk like this.I have a workaround which is a little messy but it works Thanks Jason
