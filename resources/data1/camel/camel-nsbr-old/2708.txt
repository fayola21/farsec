File name lost when it starts with the same characters as the relative directory on the endpoint    When polling file from a directory using a relative file URI  the file name gets lost when it starts with the same characters as the directory name.E.g. a directory 'orders' containing 'orders-1719.xml' and 'orders-1819.xml'from('file:orders').process(new Processor() { public void process(Exchange exchange) { // there's no file name on the message here (exchange.getIn().getHeader(Exchange.FILE_NAME) returns null) }});
