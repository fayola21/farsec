CamelContext should support autoStartup    We now have option autoStartup on routes. Lets also have this on the camel context itself so it replaces the shouldStartContext option that is a bit confusing. &lt;camelContext id='myCamel' xmlns='http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring' autoStartup='false'&gt; &lt;route&gt; &lt;from uri='direct:start'/&gt; &lt;to uri='mock:result'/&gt; &lt;/route&gt; &lt;/camelContext&gt;For example the code above will not start Camel on startup. You can then later start camel manually by SpringCamelContext camel = (SpringCamelContext) ac.getBean('myCamel'); camel.start();And then all runs.This also means that we will remove the option shouldStartContext! so if you use this option you must migrate to the autoStartup instead.
