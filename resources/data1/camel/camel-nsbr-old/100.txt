Most recent snapshot requires ActiveMQ    This may be moot given the projects' relationship  but it's a recently introduced side effect. Before the most recent snapshot  I was able to use Camel without any ActiveMQ jar's floating around so long as I never tried to use any 'activemq:queue:foo' URI's. Now with the most recent snapshot  the first time I do something that uses AnnotationTypeCoverterLoader  ActiveMQConverter gets loaded  and then causes a NoClassDefFoundError for ActiveMQDestination.
