The problem is with the test itself that actually returns 'Bye ' + body + '/n'! Because the test uses the 'textline' mina codec  the encoder actually adds another '/n'. With the textline codec there's one message per line  so the extra /n makes it two lines and hence the extra message. The decoder at the other end suppresses the LineDelimiter (/n)  so the extra message is actually an empty string.Removing the extra /n in the message fixes the test  but the notes above should be considered when camel-mina is used with the textline codec.
