Provide a flag to avoid mapping a JMS message to it's actual type    CAMEL-1853 adds the ability to use a custom Spring MessageConverter to map an incoming (or outgoing) JMS Message  and also makes it easier to do a pass through route where Camel does not try and deserialize a serialized object message. This improvement is to add a simple flag that achieves a similar effect but without having to supply a MessageConverter implementation.
