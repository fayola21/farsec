camel-cxf: URI option for serviceClass does not support lookup in registry    Having an endpoint such as: String cxfEndpoint = 'cxf://http://localhost:8080/part-five/webservices/incident' + '?serviceClass=org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint' + '&amp;wsdlURL=report_incident.wsdl';The serviceClass option currently only supports defining a FQN for the class. I think we need to support Registry lookup as well using the # notation. So you can do: String cxfEndpoint = 'cxf://http://localhost:8080/part-five/webservices/incident' + '?serviceClass=#reportService' + '&amp;wsdlURL=report_incident.wsdl';And then have it defined in Spring XML:&lt;bean id='reportService' class='...'&gt;The # notation is already supported if you use the cxf Spring XML configuration. We need this in the Java DSL as well.Sorry if it already exists. But I got a hint from a Camel end user that it didn't
