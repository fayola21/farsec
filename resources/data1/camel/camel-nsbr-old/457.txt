Camel should raise an exception if parsing of xslt file fails    Consider a Camel route that involves an xslt component. When Camel sets up the route  the XsltBuilder ignores any errors coming from the xerces xml parser and continues constructing the route even though the xslt transformer is not initialized. Later when the route is executed Camel correctly checks if the transformer is initialized and raises an error if not:java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No transformer configured!However in case of a parse error in the xslt file  the whole route becomes unusable and the setup routine that constructs the route should fail with an appropriate error message. A sanity check needs to be added in methodorg.apache.camel.builder.xml.XsltBuilder.setTransformerSource(javax.xml.transform.Source).
