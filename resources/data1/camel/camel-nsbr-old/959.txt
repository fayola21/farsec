JMS InOut operations should default to non transacted even if the JMS component or endpoint defaults to transacted; as typically RPCs over JMS are not transacted    currently there is no automatic transaction commit inside the send of the request when doing InOut with JMS; so the transaction won't commit if the component/endpoint is transacted - then the message won't reach the request and things will time out.This will be confusing to users.So if things are transacted; lets default to using non-transacted for InOut - and force a new property  transactedInOut to allow that to be transacted if folks really want that (which they usually won't I'd have thought).
