camel-cxf bundle doesn't specify any Import-Package version    The camel-cxf component is currently generated against CXF version 2.2.2.As a result  the camel-cxf module as well as the camel-cxf bundle require CXF 2.2. More importantly  that bundle does not work correctly with CXF 2.0 (note that this is an expected behavior  CXF has had API changes with its 2.2 version).Now  the trouble is that the camel-cxf JAR's MANIFEST has an Import-Package on org.apache.cxf.* components without specifying any version! As a result  when it looks for CXF and both CXF 2.0 and 2.2 are present on the platform  it sometimes chooses the wrong one.To solve this issue  version specifiers should be added to the Import-Package declarations of the camel-cxf bundle. I guess an import on version 2.2 would be enough (we don't need to specify 2.2.2 explicitely).CheersS. Ali Tokmenhttp://ali.tokmen.com/
