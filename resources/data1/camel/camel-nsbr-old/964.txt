loggingErrorHandler should default to ERROR and LoggingErrorHandlerBuilder should operate as a builder    Please see attached patch which changes the default level created by the LoggingErrorHandlerBuilder to ERROR instead of INFO.Also some of the methods on this builder to not return 'this'. This breaks the chain when attempting to use the builder resulting in:LoggingErrorHandlerBuilder errorBuilder = loggingErrorHandler('my.logger.name');errorBuilder.setLevel(LoggingLevel.ERROR);errorHandler(errorBuilder);instead of:errorHandler(loggingErrorHandler('mylogger.name').level(LoggingLevel.ERROR));I have added on builder methods for 'level' and for 'log'. I have left the properties that currently exist as following the pattern on DeadLetterChannelBuilder the builder method names should not include 'set'. Whoever applies the patch may wish to remove the getters and setters  depending how they feel this will affect existing users.
