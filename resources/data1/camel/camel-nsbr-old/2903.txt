update camel-http and camel-cxf features to use Commons Codec 1.4    The latest version of Commons Codec is available as an OSGi bundle  so it would be nice to update the features file for Camel 2.3 to use that version:&lt;bundle&gt;mvn:commons-codec/commons-codec/1.4&lt;/bundle&gt;I've been installing 1.4 by hand and removing the org.apache.servicemix.bundles.commons-codec/1.3_2 without any ill effects on camel-http.
