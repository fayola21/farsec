Let LazyLoadingTypeConverter load the converters from camel-core on startup    When using lazy loading type converter and Spring XML you will trigger the type converters to be loaded on startup due XML configuration needs to convert from String -&gt; other types etc.So we should let Camel always load the type converters from camel-core as they are essential. Then the package scanning converters can be loaded on demand later.
