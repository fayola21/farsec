cxfbean creates another instance of the class instead of directly using the referenced bean    ... this makes it impossible to inject properties to the @WebService class&lt;camelContext&gt; &lt;route&gt; &lt;from uri='....' /&gt; &lt;to uri='cxfbean:handler' /&gt; &lt;/route&gt;&lt;/camelContext&gt;&lt;bean id='handler' class='a.b.c.Handler'&gt; &lt;property name='prop1' value='5' /&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;when 'handler' is created by Spring  its 'prop1' is set to '5'when the cxfbean:handler is triggered  the 'prop1' is null  because CXF created another instance of Handler instead of using the one created by Spring
