Support Issue: Routing a TextMessage from a  to a JMS queue    I did not find any example or documentation for using the &lt;camel:proxy&gt; with a simple send(String textMessage) method and a route sending the textMessage String as body to a JMS queue (for example).The thing is that &lt;camel:proxy&gt; creates a messages with body of type BeanInvocation. I would expect that Camel provides some builtin transformer/converter to change the body to the String argument  so that the message on the queue is of type TextMessage.Did I miss something?
