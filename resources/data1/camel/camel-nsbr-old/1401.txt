JaxbDataFormat is not thread-safe    JaxbDataFormat reuses the Marshaller/Unmarshaller instances.However  according to the https://jaxb.dev.java.net/faq/index.html#threadSafety  Marshaller/Unmarshaller instances are NOT thread safe  so you can't use them from separate threads at the same time.Due to this we are getting exceptions from the JAXB implementation (like ClassCastException or 'org.xml.sax.SAXException: FWK005 parse may not be called while parsing.'). Everything works nice with our custom JaxbDataFormat that creates new Unmarshaller/Marshaller instance on every request.Also  lazy-creating instances (like JAXBContext) in getter methods is not thread-safe as well (because explicit synchronization is required).
