JMX Instrumentation - PerformanceCounter - last processed timestamp when failed    I thought about another real life use case we have at work once in a while.a) when was the last time the integration worked?b) when was the last time the integration was invoked?We do have option a covered now with lastExchangeCompletionTime.However I would like another timestamp for lastExchangeTime that is just a record the last time it was processed (even if it failed).PS: At work we do have to grep through logfiles in our legacy EIP platform.
