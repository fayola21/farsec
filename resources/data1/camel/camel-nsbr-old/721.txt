Log component should use ExchangeFormatter for formatting log output    Currently log component only logs the payload. We have a nice ExchangeFormatter that can format an exchange with all kind of options.The options could be enabled on the log component so you can customize your logging. Also there should be a multiline option to the exchange formatter so it can log all the stuff on multi lines if for instance there are many options  they get very long.
