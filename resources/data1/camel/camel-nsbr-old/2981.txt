DefaultHttpBinding's populateRequestParameters should be more flexible when checking the content type on POST    Line 126 in DefaultHttpBinding checks if the request's method is POST and the content type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. This unfortunately fails to populate the request parameters of a POST request where the content type includes the charset  e.g. 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'. Could the equals be changed to startsWith?
