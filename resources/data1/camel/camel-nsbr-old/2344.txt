MailConsumer should log exception in processRollback    The MailConsumer logs in the rollback case the exchange (line 162 in revision 893983) but the exchange contains (usually ?) an exception which is not logged.In my case the exception is thrown from a custom Expression which splits a mail message.Only a rollback warning which contains the headers of the mail message is logged which makes finding the actual cause difficult.
