request/reply over JMS using temporary queues - if connection lost the temporary queue is not re-created which causes the producer to not work anymore    To recreate the problem you need a route with a jms inout endpoint that is configured to use a temporary destination for replies. Till now I was only able to show the problem with tibco ems. Start broker Start the jms consumer that replies to the request Start the route Send a request/reoply exchange (should work) Stop the broker Wait long enough for the client to do a full reconnect (I used connectionFactory.setReconnAttemptCount(1) on the client so I do not have to wait so long) Start the broker -&gt; The jms component will do a full new connect Send a request/reoply exchange -&gt; Now a InvalidDestination Exception happensThe client route will not work anymore until a restart as it creates the temporary destination only once and it is invalid now.
