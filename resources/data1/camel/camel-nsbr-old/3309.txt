Stepwise change of directory unfit for production (ftp/ftps/sftp)    In Camel 2.5  the logic for changing directory for ftp/ftps/sftp has changed in order to fix the problems discussed in the following thread: http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/How-to-change-directory-while-using-sftp-component-td2806817.html#a2807611In Camel 2.5 changing of the remote directory is now done in a stepwise manner. This is a strategy not fit for production since it assumes that the logged in ftp/ftps/sftp user has access to all intermediate directories all the way down to its home directory. This is rarely the case.Also  when testing ftp/sftp on Serv-U  a Windows based ftp/ftps/sftp server  it turns out that it reports the current directory in a 'Windows way'  e g /C:/temp/servu/user/sample/file2sftp. The topmost folder is not '/' but '/C:'. This also breaks the new stepwise way of changing directory since it always tries to change to '/' if an absolute path is used.I propose to introduce a configuration property to enable/disable stepwise changing of directories where disabling it should be the default. I will upload a patch shortly.
