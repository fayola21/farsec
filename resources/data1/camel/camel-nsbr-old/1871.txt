camel-jms - DefaultJmsKeyFormatStrategy should replace . with _DOT_ to avoid conflicting with end user using _    If an end user sends a JMS property asMY_KEYThen it should be preserved when Camel route it  so the receiver side using Camel as well will see it as: MY_KEY and not MY.KEY.The code should be: String answer = key.replace('.'  '_DOT_'); answer = answer.replace('_DOT_'  '.');
