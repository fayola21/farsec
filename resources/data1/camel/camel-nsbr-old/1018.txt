camel http Uri from the message header    Imagine a use case when the target systems  where http messages have to be sent to  are maintained in a database. In that case the http uri is cannot be set in the camelcontext but it should come from the header of the message.So the http client should check first if there is an uri in the header and if not than use the one given in the camelcontext (like for querystring).
