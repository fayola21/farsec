Use  forkMode=once for the surefire plugin to significantly speed up tests    We need to reduce the testing time in Camel since we got so many tests now. For this to work wee need to make sure there are no side effects outside of a test (which is not always simple).Side effects usually stem from using static fields in classes shared across multiple tests (such as caches of Exchanges  or whatnot)  which should be avoided.
