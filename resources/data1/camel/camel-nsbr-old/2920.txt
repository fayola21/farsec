more eager validation of routes    it seems you can dynamically create invalid routes which don't fail fast if there are errors.e.g.from('seda:foo').beanRef('doesNotExist'  'noMethodCalledThis')its only if a message is sent to 'seda:foo' that the whole thing barfs. We should maybe check that the to can be validated first before allowing the consumer to startup? If nothing else failing faster and earlier helps users spot errors sooner
