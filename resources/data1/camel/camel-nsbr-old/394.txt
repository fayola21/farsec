Improve logging for camel-mina    Currently camel-mina does not log using similar log classnames for a MinaProducer and MinaConsumer. This can be a bit misleading in the log files.MinaConsumer uses an anonymous inner class to do the IoHandler where as MinaProducer does not. This renders the loglines such asMinaConsumer$1 - XXXMinaProducer$RecieveHandler - XXXMinaConsumer should use a non anonymous inner classes so logging is the same:MinaConsumer$RecieveHandler - XXXMinaProducer$ResponseHandler - XXX
