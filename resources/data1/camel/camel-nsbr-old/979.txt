FileLanguage - to support constant expressions    Currently the simple language does not support constant expressions  that actually is useable in the file component that uses simple language to set file namesSo if an end-user want to produce a file with a fixed name  then its not possibleexpression=MyBigFile.txt Is not possible.But this is:expression=MyBigFile-${header.foo}.txt is as there is a ${} placeholder and then the simple language can evaluate it.
