Change default DeadLetterChannel strategy in Camel    The current DLC strategy in Camel is to retry 6 times with 1 sec delay. If still failed it will be moved to a log WARN.This default behavior is not feasible for most end-users  in fact none. We should have a better default strategy in Camel.Also we should force end-users to setup a strategy from the start.And we should improve this in the documentation so end-users is aware of this.
