The  in Spring XML should support using serviceRef to lookup a reference for an endpoint    Even though people can use the ref component  but that is hardly technique.So you can do using serviceRef to refer to the endpoint &lt;!-- create a proxy that will route to the direct:start endpoint when invoked --&gt; &lt;proxy id='myProxySender' serviceInterface='org.apache.camel.spring.config.MyProxySender' serviceRef='cool'/&gt; &lt;!-- define the endpoint we want to proxy --&gt; &lt;endpoint id='cool' uri='direct:start'/&gt;
