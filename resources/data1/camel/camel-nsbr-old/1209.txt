camel-xmpp to work with google chat    See blog entryhttp://www.andrejkoelewijn.com/wp/2008/12/30/using-google-talk-from-java-example/There is a solution that works with plain java. Could be used to identify what needs to be fixed in Camel to get it working with Google chat as well.Notice I haven't verified if it doesn't already work with google chat. Just created this ticket to not forget it.
