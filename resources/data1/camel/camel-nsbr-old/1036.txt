Add ability to configure log level on exceptions from DLC retry mechanism    Right now  when Camel tries to redeliver an message a number of times (using the DLC)  the exceptions are logged as ERROR. Sometimes though  these retries may be considered part of normal operation. I'm going to put in DSL options to configure this log level. Something like this will be possible:onException(AException.class).maximumRedeliveries(5) .retriesExhaustedLogLevel(LoggingLevel.DEBUG) .retryAttemptedLogLevel(LoggingLevel.DEBUG) .process(new MyExceptionProcessor('I got an Exception.'));
