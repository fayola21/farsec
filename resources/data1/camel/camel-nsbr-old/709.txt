CXF - Easier use for end-user to retreive POJO data    I am working on a web app example that uses CXF to expose a webservice.During the process I thought that getting my POJO object (InputReportIncident) was a bit clumsy as I had to do; MessageContentsList list = exchange.getIn().getBody(MessageContentsList.class); InputReportIncident in = (InputReportIncident) list.get(0);So I have created a patch that improves the getBody to be more end-user friendly.You can now do  as you always do in Camel: InputReportIncident in = exchange.getIn().getBody(InputReportIncident.class);Just cast it to what you expect and want to work with.InputReportIncident is a POJO object generated by the CXF wsdl2java generator.Willem could you take a look? Maybe I have misunderstood the CXF and there is a easier way already. But I don't like the need to get the List and then get (0) to get my POJO.Sending the response is already supported nicely: // the response OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident(); out.setCode('Bye Claus'); exchange.getOut().setBody(out);
