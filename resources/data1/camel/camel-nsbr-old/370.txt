SftpConsumer is not connecting and retrieving remote files    SftpConsumer does not connect to server due to patch for CAMEL-251. The SftpConsumer also checks remote file modification timestamp against last poll timestamp but incorrectly converts seconds to milliseconds using integer math so the resulting conversion is always negative and will never retrieve file. I will attach the fixes to this issue.
