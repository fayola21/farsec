Should preserve the exchange type in the routing slip    Currently  the routing slip will create a new InOut exchange for each target based on the target endpoint type. This means that someone calling from a jbi endpoint (or other endpoint with custom exchange) into the routing slip will have their exchange type changed (to mostly likely DefaultExchange). I will be including a patch to fix this issue shortly.
