Converting from stream/reader to string changes line breaks other than '/n'    The IOConverter#toString(Reader/Stream) copies the input data line by line. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('/n')  a carriage return ('/r')  or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. Unfortunately  the lines are always concatenated with '/n'  so that HL7 messages (which use '/r') become unusable after conversion.Also see http://www.nabble.com/HL7-messages-become-unusable-after-convertBodyTo%28String.class%29-td23219748.html
