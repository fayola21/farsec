camel-cxf - Empty body causes http error 500 even for GET when using cxfbean    CxfSoapBinding has a bug that it mandates a body to exist. But when you send a GET then there is of course no body.The code below fixed this in the method getCxfInMessage // body can be empty in case of GET etc. InputStream body = message.getBody(InputStream.class); if (body != null) { answer.setContent(InputStream.class  body); } else if (message.getBody() != null) { // fallback and set the body as what it is answer.setContent(Object.class  body); }Willem Tam can you review if that is okay? Maybe the code can be more finer to check the HTTP method and in cases of GET etc. it allows no body.I will commit my fix to get the unit tests passing.
