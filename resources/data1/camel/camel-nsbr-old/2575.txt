CXFRS Routing in 2.2.0 does not behave like in 2.0.0    CXFRS Routing in Camel 2.0.0 works well with these endPoints:&lt;cxf:rsServer id='restRouter' address='/restRouter/'  serviceClass='com.project.service.impl.ServiceManagerImpl' /&gt; &lt;cxf:rsClient id='restEndpoint' address='http://localhost:8080/services/rest' serviceClass='com.project.service.impl.ServiceManagerImpl' /&gt;In Camel 2.2.0  Routing fails with error causing the CXF Client to invoke a 404 not found Rest Service which is 'http://localhost:8080/services/rest/restRouter/Path'.The address of cxf:rsClient is being appended by the cxf:rsServer's address
