Redelivery policy's retryUntil option should be renamed as retryWhile    The semantics of retryUntil are a bit counter-intuitive. I would naturally expect retryUntil(predicate) to mean retry until predicate is true  but it actually means retry until predicate is false. If you change the name of the option to retryWhile  you would get the natural interpretation retry while predicate is true.
