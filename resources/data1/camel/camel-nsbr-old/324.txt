bad content length header value in http response    By default HttpBinding class copies all request header attributes from the request to the response including 'Content-Length'. So the consequence is that the response is declaring the same size as the request which can lead to serious truncation problems! the workaround is simply to add the line:out.removeHeader('Content-Length'); in the writeResponse method of the httpbinding class allowing jetty to set the right value.
