Aggregator EIP - Add option to ignore timeout completed    See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Aggregator-Howto-remove-from-persistency-tp2852702p2852702.html&gt; I was thinking about something like a removeOnTimeout (default=false of&gt; course) that would use the existing completionTimeout attribute but change&gt; its behavior to remove the aggregated message instead of publishing it.&gt; &#8211;Yeah I can kinda see an use case for this. You are using the timeoutas a last resort to just say hey we could not aggregate this in letssay 4 hours.So lets just ignore the message.Having an option on the aggregate to just auto discard those messageon timeout would help there to avoid the CBR and checking yourself.Just wondering if this is a use case others use? Its still kindadangerous to discard messages.
