camel-spring - Spring 3.0.x - Add depends-on in the namespace handler to make it easy for end users to use Spring and Camel without considering ordering of their beans    Spring 3.0.x behaves differently when discovering bean dependencies. For example if you have a &lt;routeBuilder ref='xxx'/&gt; in &lt;camelContext/&gt; than the xxx bean will not by default be dependent on the &lt;camelContext/&gt;. This causes Spring maybe to create the xxx before the camelContext. And you most likely want CamelContext to be created beforehand  so IoC allows you to inject CamelContext into that xxx or whatnot.See nabblehttp://old.nabble.com/Spring-3.0-and-Camel-2.2---Route-configure%28%29-called-before-Spring-beans-injected-ts28415437.htmlWe do already have logic for this in the namespace handler  but we need to add it to more places to have it working for all kind of camel types.
