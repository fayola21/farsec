ExceptionHandler - Let it be able to log additional information such as a custom message or current exchange    This will output better exceptions in the logs when using the default exception handler which just logs it.The ExceptionHandler is used in consumers (polling  event driven) which cant send the exception back to a client and thus must handle it somehowand best shot is to log it  but you can plugin your own handler if you like
