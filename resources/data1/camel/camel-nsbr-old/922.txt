Remove deps on persistence-api jar  non compliant with the spec    I mentioned a while ago a warning I couldn't explain in eclipse related to the use of @UniqueConstraint in camel-jpa.It turned out to be due to the fact that camel-jpa has a dependency on persistence api  but used for testing openjpa that has a dependency on geronimo-jpa_3.0_spec. So camel-jpa pulls in two different implementation of the same spec. So far so good. It also turns out that the definition of the @UniqueConstraint annotation is different in the two jars  the persistence-api (and the camel-jpa code as implemented) being non spec compliant. I found other inconsistencies in the persistence-api impl and it seems to be based on an older version of the spec.(More precisely persistence api annotates the @interface UniqueConstraint with @Target({TYPE}) whereas the spec and the geronimo impl use: @Target({}))My recommendation is to replace the dependency on persistence-api with the geronimo version. I will commit a change for this in the next hour or so  but leave this issue open. If anybody has any objections please shout and I will revert the change.
