Race condition in IdempotentConsumer    A possible possible race condition exists in the IdempotentConsumer implementation:The code first checks in the MessageIdRepository if the message was already processed. If not then it processes the message andafterwards adds the id to the repository. (See also http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1451). There is no lockingbetween the check with 'contains' and the insert with 'add'. So if multiple threads/instances try this in parallel for the same id  thenit might happen that more than one finds the id not yet contained in the repository and the same message is processed multipletimes.I enclose an extended version of IdempotentConsumerTest which illustrates the problem.It is important to note that even if the test demonstrates the issue with an MemoryIdempotentRepository a solution should alsoaddress the case of a database based respository in a clustered environment. So this might imply that some locking mechanism on thedatabase is required.
