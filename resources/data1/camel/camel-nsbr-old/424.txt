Improve FTP component wiki documentation    The wiki documentation for FTP usage could be improved with: java code examples (snippets in unit test classes) that you need the convertTo(String.class) for ASCII file transfer The FTP component is an extension of the File component so it inherits behaviour  features and options from file. State precise witch options a FTPProducer and FTPConsuer can use. Consuming using FTP there are special header key/values for the remote filename etc. that could be of interest for the end users (Maybe for the producer as well)
