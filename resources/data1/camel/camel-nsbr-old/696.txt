ProducerTemplate doenst honor exchange pattern when it extracts the result    The code the extracts the result that is returned when you use the sendXXX  requestXXX methods on the producer template doens't honor the exchange pattern. protected Object extractResultBody(E result) { Object answer = null; if (result != null) { Message out = result.getOut(false); if (out != null) { answer = out.getBody(); } else { answer = result.getIn().getBody(); } } return answer; }It defaults to preferring out messages all the time. But in some circumstances the out body could be set to null but the real response is in the in body.Setting the exchange pattern to InOnly doesn't honor this.Maybe this ticket is a symptom of the MEP problem that we have in Camel. See the discussion on the dev forum.
