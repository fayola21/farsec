Add alternative start token for simple language to avoid clash with Spring PropertyPlaceholder    When using Spring property placeholders it will scan for ${ } tokens  which is the same set the Camel Simple language uses.This makes it harder to configure file endpoints where the file name is a simple expression because Spring interferes.So by introducing the $simple{ as alternative start token  we can avoid the clash.
