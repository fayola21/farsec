Simple language support for AND / OR to concat multiple expressions fails if string constants are enclosed in single quotation marks    The current implementation for CAMEL-1637 fails if the string constants in the two expressions are enclosed in single quotation marks as given in the following example ${in.header.foo} == 'abc' and ${in.header.bar} == '123'This is due to an issue with the GROUP_PATTERN regular expression in SimpleLanguageSupport.java. The matching pattern in between the single quotes is greedy and thus does not match correctly.
