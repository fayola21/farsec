HttpProducer premature out message creation    I believe there is incorrect flow in the HttpProducer which can subvert error handling in the route:in Camel 1.4.0 in HttpProducer on line 76 a 'blank' out message is set on the exchange:Message out = exchange.getOut(true); try { int responseCode = httpClient.executeMethod(method);...1. If an IO error occurs on connect  the out message will be passed to the error handling code and if the originating endpoint was a JmsMessage it will cause an NPE when JmsMessage.getMessageId() is called. It also obscures the offending message I believe.2. A similar situation will happen if the HTTP service returned an error code; the out message will contain a reply message even though the processing resulted in an error (e.g. HTTP Status 500) 3. Also  shouldn't this code test whether the exchange expects an 'out' altogether  and if not  perhaps  put just put the return HTTP status into the 'in' message header.--Bill
