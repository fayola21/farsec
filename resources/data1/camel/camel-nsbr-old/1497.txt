JmsPollingConsumer - receive does not work    The timeout values to set on Spring JmsTemplate is wrong. We should uses the provided constants on JmsTemplate for this /** * Timeout value indicating that a receive operation should * check if a message is immediately available without blocking. */ public static final long RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT = -1; /** * Timeout value indicating a blocking receive without timeout. */ public static final long RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_INDEFINITE_WAIT = 0;Is the correct values. Looks like the values was reverted in the camel-jms code
