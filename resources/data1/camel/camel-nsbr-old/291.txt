MulticastRecipientList - recipient list that uses multicast processor    Probably it would be useful to have recipientList that in InOut mode doesn't work as a pipeline. I faced that problem  however InOnly is ok. It seems in InOut it reminds of RoutingSlip. Optionally we could use MulticastProcessor to process 'recipients'. If you think it makes sense  attached patch enhances camel-core with such feature.
