Remove specialized Exchange and make DefaultExchange final to pave the road for optimization by reducing exchange copies    The code in DefaultEndpoint.createExchange(Exchange exchange)  calls on getExchangeType() to figure out if a new copy of Exchange needs be created. The code relies though on the generic argument of the Endpoint type to figure out the actual Exchange type. With the generics removed part of CAMEL-872  getExchangeType() always returns null  forcing a copy every time.There is no real need to extend Exchange  so the proposal for this to make the Exchange final and move the component specific bits  if any  in the Message.
