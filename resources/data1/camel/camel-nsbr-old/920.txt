file component consumer.regexPattern does not work as expected (matching is applied not only to file  but also to directory)    file component consumer.regexPattern does not work as expectedexample : from('file://d:/the_input_dir?consumer.regexPattern=.*/.xml$'.to(whatever)(should match only files  that has extention .xml)the result of the above regexPattern is  that no file will be proccessed  regardless if an existing filename matches the pattern.FileConsumer.pollFileOrDirectory() applies the regexPattern on the starting directory (the_input_dir) which will not match.
