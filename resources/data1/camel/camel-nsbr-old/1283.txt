SQL component doesn't handle wrong number of parameters    NPE thrown when null body sent to to SQL endpoint. When to many parameters are set then exception is thrown but nothing wrong happens when to less parameters are set.It should be possible to set null as a body as there might be parameterless statement to execute. There should be consistent Exception thrown when wrong number of parameters is set.
