QuartzEndpoint does not set the job name properly    Looks like the job.name argument is not se properly on the endpoint and defaults to the uri path.Another nastier issue (for which I should have probably created a separate issue) is that the uri gets messed up if it does not have the double slashes after the scheme (as in 'quartz:&lt;uri&gt;' vs 'quartz://&lt;uri&gt;') and the @cron argument contains '?'. The workaround (arguably) is to start the uri with 'quartz://...'.See nabble thread. Many thanks to SK for reporting this.
