polling of feeds in FeedEntryPollingConsumer is broken.    The FeedEntryPollingConsumer class implements the poll() method for the 'splitEntries' mode of the RssEndpoint is broken.You can think of two ways that polling feeds could work:1) A feed is created  then one item is processed  then the delay  then process another item. This way the feed is kept between calls to poll().2) A feed is created  then all the items are processed  the feed is cleared  and then the delay.But the way it presently works:A feed is created  one items is processed  and the feed is cleared  then the delay  and again the feed is created and the next item is cleared.This is clearly wrong. Feed entries can be missed  because the index of the next item to process is stored over polls but the list isn't. Also this creates a big network overhead when polling very active feeds such as twitter search...This is easy to fix. In the below code:public void poll() throws Exception { Object feed = createFeed(); populateList(feed); while (hasNextEntry()) { Object entry = list.get(entryIndex--); boolean valid = true; if (entryFilter != null) { valid = entryFilter.isValidEntry(endpoint  feed  entry); } if (valid) { Exchange exchange = endpoint.createExchange(feed  entry); getProcessor().process(exchange); // return and wait for the next poll to continue from last time (this consumer is stateful) return; } }The return (at line 56 of org.apache.camel.component.feed.FeedEntryPollingConsumer) should be deleted.
