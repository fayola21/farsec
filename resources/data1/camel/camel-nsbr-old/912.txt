camel-cxf component is not passing request context through correctly    CxfProducer.process() is not setting up the request context correctly during createCxfMessage  so later in that method propagateContext has no request data to propagate. Also  we need the exchange properties to be added to the request context  so that non-camel components can pass properties into the cxf request context.I have coded a fix for this  along with a unit test of course. I'll attach the patch to this JIRA.
