Synchronous mode should handle exceptions being thrown from MINA    Camel MINA in synchronous mode (InOut exchange pattern) does not handle exception thrown from MINA. Currently MINA intercepts this and logs the exception at WARN level.We should override the proper method in Mina and handle it so the end user can deal with it.Also it has been raisen on the forum that it does not propogate header and other properties. This should be raised in another ticket.In the weekend I will work on a patch for Camel to fix this problem.
