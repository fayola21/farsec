Workaround for UnsupportedEncodingException    Reference this discussion: http://old.nabble.com/Camel-Mail-issue-with-unsupported-charset-td24755585.htmlCamel-mail fails to process a message with an unsupported charset in the Content-Type. It throws an exception and can never get past that message...subsequent messages in the inbox never get processed.Claus and I came up with a fix  where we make a copy of the MimeMessage object and modify the Content-Type header  stripping the unrecognized charset.
