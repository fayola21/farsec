EventDrivenConsumer - Wait starting them until all other processors / routes have been started    We should wait starting the input to the CamelContext until all child processors and other services have been started.Then at the end we should open the gates by starting all the input consumers.That should also help unit testing on slower boxes where these consumers might start a bit early and the remaining work starting the other processors is slow and thus the consumer is too fast.
