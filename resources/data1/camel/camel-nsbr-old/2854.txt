No consumers available on 'direct://xyz' endpoint    The following warning in log4j log shows up with no predictable reason:2010-06-24 14:07:01 090 WARN &#91;DefaultMessageListenerContainer-7:DirectProducer.java:42&#93; No consumers available on endpoint: Endpoint&#91;direct://UserCancelJobRequest&#93; to process: Exchange[JmsMessage: RunnerBase{locationToRunId='DV02YcABTE43HTRPATEGCBFk0m0'  jobrun_id=1234  requestOrigId='null'  secretKey='null'  replyToQueueOrTopic='null'  corrolationId='null'  requestCreationTime=Thu Jun 24 14:07:01 PDT 2010}]The endpoint &#91;direct://UserCancelJobRequest&#93; could be a number of different endpoints in our application and all of them are of 'direct:' type. When this happens  all messages that run through that endpoint will fail  and it will never recover unless the application is restarted.Also  if I restart the application and use that route immediately  that warning will not occur and the request will finish successfully. It seems to happen to routes that have not been used for a while after startup.When this happens  I can find the exact Camel endpoint/route/processor in JConsole  and nothing seems to be wrong. How can a 'direct:' endpoint runs out of consumer? Isn't the thread that product this warning THE thread to process the message?We recently upgraded from 5.2 to 5.3.2 and this starts to show up randomly. It is a show stopper!--Michael
