camel-jpa doesn't use EntityManager.merge(entity) in the right way    The EntityManager.merge(entity) method returns the merged entity. The exchange in message body should be updated with the merged entity (what camel-jpa currently not do).I running into this problem  because after saving an entity in the database  the id field was still null. So  we don't know  which entity in the database is the corresponding to this entity... Have a look in the process method of JpaProducer and the Java doc from the EntityManager.Christian
