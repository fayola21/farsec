<title>Issue 13939 -   chromium -    Autofilled username portions cannot easily be deleted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a page with a GAIA login and highlight the last half of the username.    Press delete.  Nothing happens.  I suspect we are aggressively re-filling the   username back in even though the user has just pressed delete.    Tim  did you do password manager autofill?  I forget. </pre>
