<title>Issue 18845 -   chromium -    Search for slash and a letter in url bar is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198    OS version               : 10.5.6            1.Type N/A in url bar and hit enter      Google results of the search for &quot;N/A&quot;      Chromium tries to go to &quot;http://n/A which is broken for me.    A quick dns query could solve the issue.   </pre>
