<title>Issue 22674 -   chromium -    Spell checker shouldn't mark words in all caps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4    Spell checker should ignore words that are in all caps  as these are likely acronyms or   other special names.  See an example in the attached screenshot.    Just having one capital letter in the word (esp. if it's the first letter) probably is not   sufficient to exempt it from spell checking  since it may simply be the first word of a   sentence rather than a proper name. </pre>
