<title>Issue 2353 -   chromium -    Flash freezes chrome and I found a strange fix. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load many  tabs (at least 4 I think) with flash videos  2. As one video finishes buffering  load another.  3. Wait and continue.      Google Chrome will freeze in periodic spurts and eventually lock down   because of Flash Player.      Chrome just sits there and stops updating the screen.. until flash returns   something i guess.    Please provide
