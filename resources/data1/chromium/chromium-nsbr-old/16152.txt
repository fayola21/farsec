<title>Issue 16152 -   chromium -    On Dual Monitors Chrome Reopens Off the Right Side of the Secondary Monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    Please Note: Only reproducible on dual monitor setups. I have reproduced it   on Windows 7 build 7100 and Windows XP SP2.      1. Drag Chrome Window onto Secondary Monitor  2. Close out Chrome completely  3. Open a new instance of Chrome      Chrome should reopen at the last coordinates which it was closed. This   works fine if it was closed in the primary monitor.      If closed in the secondary monitor  Chrome reopens almost entirely off the   right side of the screen. There is still enough of the window on screen to   drag it back onto the screen fully. See the attached screenshot (arrows   added by me).   </pre>
