<title>Issue 20323 -   chromium -    Middle click forward and backward to open in new tab [feature request] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 4.0.204.0 (24372)  It would be useful to have the ability to middle-click on the   forward/backward buttons and have the appropriate page open in another tab.  I think this may be a regression as I remember being able to do this in   earlier builds  currently I can only do this for the home button (which is   great)  Thanks </pre>
