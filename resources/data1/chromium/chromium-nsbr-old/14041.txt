<title>Issue 14041 -   chromium -    Undo and redo in address bar is suboptimal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Enter some text in the address bar by typing  2. Use the undo function      The last user action should be undone  that includes all typed in   characters.      You have to undo each typed in character individually  which makes the undo   function way more useless. The behaviour is not consistent with normal text   boxes.    It works for cutting/pasting text though.   </pre>
