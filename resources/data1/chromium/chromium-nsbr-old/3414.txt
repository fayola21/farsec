<title>Issue 3414 -   chromium -    SanDisk.com horribly broken in Chrome (works in Safari) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://sandisk.com">http://sandisk.com</a>  2. Notice the header layout for the site is horribly broken.  3. Do the same in Safari 3.1 and it looks fine.  4. For fun  I tested the same in Chrome using Safari's UserAgent string and it still looks broken.     </pre>
