<title>Issue 8068 -   chromium -    Single tab cannot be dragged back onto another browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a few tabs  any sites will do  2. Drag tab off of pane onto desktop area.  New browser will open around   that single tab.  3. Try to drag the single tab back onto the tab area of the original   window... No way  it's stuck as a standalone browser.      If a pane has multiple tabs  then each is draggable.  Why should it be any   different for a single tab?  I should be able to drag that single tab to   any window      Dragging single tab is the same as dragging the frame: the entire pane   moves.    Please provide
