<title>Issue 9092 -   chromium -    Drag and Drop UI: Setting dropEffect to &quot;link&quot;  the same cursor as for &quot;copy&quot; is shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1         Safari 4: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Firefox 3.1: Fails &quot;link&quot; operations completely    When using the HTML 5 drag operation model  setting the dropEffect to  &quot;link&quot; succeeds. However  the cursor displayed to the user is the same as  for &quot;copy&quot; operations leaving the user confused. The expected cursor would  be something similar to what Safari 4 displays. </pre>
