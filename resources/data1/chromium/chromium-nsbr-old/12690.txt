<title>Issue 12690 -   chromium -    Soft hyphen breaks search function and doesn't select whole word on double click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to   <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/09_maggio_26/Frenda_berlusconi_famiglia_4d1">http://www.corriere.it/cronache/09_maggio_26/Frenda_berlusconi_famiglia_4d1</a>  e3aa6-49b7-11de-8785-00144f02aabc.shtml  2. Look for the text &quot;Barbara  Eleonora e Luigi&quot;. There are 2 entries:   there should be 3.  3. Look for &quot;e Luigi&quot; and you'll find one toward the end of the article   that follows the word Eleonora  the one that was NOT found by the previous   search.  4. View the source of the page and look for Eleonora: it won't find that   one entry  though it's there and it is not written in a particular way   (e.g. it isn't split in 2 parts). Look for &quot;e Luigi&quot; again to identify that   part.  5. Go back to the rendered page. Double click on the letter &quot;l&quot; of Eleonora   to select the entire word. It will only select &quot;Ele&quot;  as if the word was   split.  6. Now it's pretty random... However  the point is that you have to click   in the word &quot;Eleonora&quot; (between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;) and drag to the left  in order   to select the beginning of the word and maybe previous words. Things that   SOMETIMES SEEM to help reproduce the bug:  -Before clicking there  click towards the end of the word Eleonora  -When you are draggin to select  move the mouse a bit downwards.  Try doing it a few times if it doesn't happen at first.      The text should be selected normally.      Weird selection: see attachment. It also selects a part of the sentence   that is AFTER the point where you click  and the colour of the &quot;extra&quot;   selected text is strange.    <b>Please provide
