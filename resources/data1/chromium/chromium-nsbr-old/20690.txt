<title>Issue 20690 -   chromium -    bad plug-in install experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 4.0.202.0 (win)    1. go to some page on nytimes.com  2. get infobar saying &quot;you need a plug-in to view some part of this page&quot;  3. click Install    Infobar goes away. Did something happen? Was I just pwned by a malware ad?    The infobar should have told me the name of the plug-in but didn't. When I   clicked install it should have confirmed what it did  if it did install   something.   </pre>
