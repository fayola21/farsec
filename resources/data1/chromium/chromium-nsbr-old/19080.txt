<title>Issue 19080 -   chromium -    Save link as.... doesn't work as expected for .crx files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Say you're interested in just downloading (and not installing) a .crx file so   you can unpack it and take a look at its script. When you right click on a   link to one and choose &quot;Save link as...&quot;  you get the install UI popping up.    Then  say you chose to save the .crx to your desktop. Once you hit the Cancel   option on the install UI  the file gets deleted from your desktop.       </pre>
