<title>Issue 14824 -   chromium -    Add a &quot;Try Again&quot; button to error pages (e.g. timeout errors) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.189.0 (Offizieller Build 18569)    Currently for reloading these pages which will be reloaded quite certainly    you either have to hit F5 or the Reload button. Having a bigger  focused &quot;Try   Again&quot; button would make this easier (both that button and the Space key are   easier to hit).   </pre>
