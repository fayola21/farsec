<title>Issue 7444 -   chromium -    [french] wrong shortcut - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> annec on July 30 2008 02:42:  Notes  Steps to reproduce:  1. Click on the Page icon  2. Click on Zoom texte  3. Check the shortcuts in the sub-menu    Actual results:  ��_��_ was assigned as a shortcut to &quot;Normal&quot;. Accented characters are not   appropriate as shortcuts.   =============================================  annec on July 30 2008 12:50:  It must be happening because I am using an AZERTY keyboard instead of a   QUERTY  like most people in France. The ��_��_ is in place of the 0.  Can this please be changed? In FF  for example  the shorcut displays   correctly: Ctrl+0.   =============================================  cpu on August 05 2008 16:39 (Assigned)  I can repro if I use the AZERTY layout.    I just did a quick debug under the debugger  the code is working fine. The   code lands in a windows call:    wchar_t key =  MapVirtualKeyW(key_code_  MAPVK_VK_TO_CHAR)    The input (key_code_) is 0x30 which is the scan code for '0' and the output   is '��_��_'    So it is windows who thinks this mapping is valid.    I am tempted to close the bug as invalid except that Firefox gets it right    I need to find out if they hardcode it or they are doing something smart.    In any case seems that it is a low impact bug.    ================================================  annec on August 08 2008 02:46  FIY: found a similar issue under Page icon&gt;Developers     </pre>
