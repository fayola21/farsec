<title>Issue 22051 -   chromium -    ssl warning looks too similar to harmful site warning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;include svn revno; e.g. dpkg -s 4.0.209.0~svn20090914r26159-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty&gt;  OS + version : Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32 bits  window manager : gnome  URLs (if applicable) : just for examples   <a href="http://securescantools.com/page.php?id=45">http://securescantools.com/page.php?id=45</a> and <a href="https://paris.indymedia.org/">https://paris.indymedia.org/</a>      first important thing : It's not really a bug  but I think it's a serious   problem and it's for that I making a bug report.    for reproduce this problem  found a website who use sftp whithout to have a   valid ssl certificate  for example : <a href="https://paris.indymedia.org/">https://paris.indymedia.org/</a> and look   at the error message than chromium show for explain the problem.  My personal oppinion is that https is always safer than http even if there   is no ssl certificate. And there is no warning like that when you go visit   a http website even if no one http website have ssl certificat.    next go to a website reported as armful and look how the sreen look similar   espetially the red background. For example !BE CAREFUL!   <a href="http://securescantools.com/">http://securescantools.com/</a> !BE CAREFUL! if you don't want to oppening you   can look at my attachment    I usually go to some website who use https whithout ssl certificat like    for example <a href="https://linuxfr.org">https://linuxfr.org</a> (It's just a news website) then when I saw   the message for the harmful website I thought that it was a ssl error and I   said &quot;ok proced anyway&quot;. It's was not very serious becose I'm under Linux   but whith windows if it's beginer for computer it's could be more serious.    Then I think the message fot ssl error is too frightening. at least it's   need to change the color. Grey could be good. And perhaps it's possible to   say in the message thant the ssl error are not every time serious. But   could be serious in the case of payment websites.     </pre>
