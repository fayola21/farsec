<title>Issue 8890 -   chromium -    DOM UI pages (like new tab page) don't work in single process mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The problem is that we make up a fake PID for the (nonexistant) renderer   process in browser_render_process_host.cc. This fake one is used to grant   privledges in the security policy for the process.    But when the DOM UI requests com in  we use the real PID of the process.    I think having a fake PID is bad and we should remove it somehow. </pre>
