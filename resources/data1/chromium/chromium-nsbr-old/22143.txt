<title>Issue 22143 -   chromium -    Open in new tab sometimes not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43 (Windows)            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      This happens only sometimes  when you right click on a link and try to   click open in a new tab (even though it is highlighted)  it won't work  no   matter how many times you click. You have to move the mouse around a bit   and click again. Never had this problem with other software... I must admit   it only becomes apparent after long usage. I'm sorry I cannot provide more   accurate reproduction steps - maybe there is a simple bug in the code and   someone could look at it a bit. </pre>
