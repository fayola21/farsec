<title>Issue 14361 -   chromium -    [www.wow-europe.com]: WOW EU Account Management language dropdown has hover problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="https://www.wow-europe.com/account/index.html">https://www.wow-europe.com/account/index.html</a> Browser: Chrome 3.0.187.1 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.187.1 Safari/531.0] Severity: Cosmetic problem Third time I'm filing this damn bug through this broken findit form  grr.    You need an EU World of Warcraft login to view this bug.    The language dropdown that appears on this site works fine for Webkit   Windows  but fails in Chrome.  Hovering over the language dropdown and then   exiting the dropdown to the left results in the dropdown remaining visible;   the hover state is correctly clearing for other browsers  and works without   problems if you exit by going off to the right or going down through the list   back to the page.    Only left fails.  Almost like the box is wrong  or something.     </pre>
