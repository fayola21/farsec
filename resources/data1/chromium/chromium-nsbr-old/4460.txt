<title>Issue 4460 -   chromium -    A broken download can't be re-downloaded properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download some files.  2. Your internet connection gets disconnect.  3. Try to download the same files again.        Chrome should download the files properly.      I tried to download GWT Incubator files from the URL stated above. I did   this on train while being connected to Internet through my 3G mobile. The   speeds were not special but at least it was downloading the files. In my   case the download stopped/got broken because I had too long time no signal   for my mobile so chrome decided that my download was completed. Chrome   downloaded about 370kb of the first file and 2.7mb of the second file. I   got home and started downloading the same files through my   broadband(100mbit). The downloads finish as fast as I click them and the   sizes are always the same 370kb (should be 2.7mb) and 2.7mb(should be   10mb). I removed every entry of those downloads from the download list as   well as from my HDD. I also restarted Chrome. Still nothing fixed those   issues so I fired up Safari and it did download those files properly.      Please provide
