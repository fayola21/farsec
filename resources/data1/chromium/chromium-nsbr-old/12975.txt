<title>Issue 12975 -   chromium -    Confusing labels in History page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   pt-pt    3.0.183.0 (17274) and previous    Win7rc x64 en    History page navigation links    From 'chrome://history/#p=1' on  page navigation links are labelled:    'Mais recente' 'Mais recente' 'Mais antigo'    1. On 'chrome://history/#p=1' there's no need for two links  since they   both point to the same page.    2. On older pages  having the same label for 'chrome://history/' and   'chrome://history/#p=x' links causes confusion - the issue comes from the   lack of distinction between expressions Most/More  Newest/Newer in   portuguese language  but is accentuated by the lack of a corresponding   'Oldest' link.    Maybe using Previous/Next (Anterior/Seguinte) instead  or using the   starting date of each page  would be a better (and more useful) choice? </pre>
