<title>Issue 21120 -   chromium -    Don't load NTP background image during startup if NTP is not in the set of startup tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We still need to load this image &quot;soon&quot; so creating a new tab won't block    but we could get it out of the heavy-disk-contention period of browser start   or at least move it later.  This might help startup time for themes with   large NTP background images (especially common on artist themes). </pre>
