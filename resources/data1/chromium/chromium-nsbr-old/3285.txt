<title>Issue 3285 -   chromium -    NPConstructFunctionPtr not working correctly in NPRuntime implementation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)  URLs (if applicable) : Attached test case            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Make sure Java SE 6 Update 10 (current build from   <a href="http://jdk6.dev.java.net/6u10ea.html">http://jdk6.dev.java.net/6u10ea.html</a> ) is installed.  2. Navigate to attached test case.        Expect that the &quot;new&quot; operator in the JavaScript engine correctly invokes   the NPConstructFunctionPtr in the registered NPClass for the object that   was previously returned to the browser  as in Firefox 3.        The browser reports an exception:    type = not_constructor  arguments = undefined  name = TypeError  constructor = function (msg) {}  message =     The new Java Plug-In expects the NPConstructFunctionPtr to be hooked up   correctly in the JavaScript engine and the plugin bridge in the browser to   fully enable the Java/JavaScript bridge in NPAPI compatible browsers.
