<title>Issue 6416 -   chromium -    Menus do not render properly after crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43      1. Chrome occasionally freezes when downloading large files and is   unresponsive.  After using Ctrl-Alt-Del to end the task  menus in Windows   are not rendered properly and &quot;stick&quot; after clicking on them (see attached   screen shots).  i.e. after the crash  if you right click on desktop and   choose &quot;Properties&quot;  the right click menu goes away but the &quot;properties&quot;   option remains on screen floating above any windows that are opened.   </pre>
