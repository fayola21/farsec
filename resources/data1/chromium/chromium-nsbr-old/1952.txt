<title>Issue 1952 -   chromium -    Feature: Display most used search forms under the history search on the new tab page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Search frequently on websites. E.g. Youtube  Wikipedia  Google  Gmail..      On the new tab page I can search in my history. I would like to see other   search forms there. Can it display my five mostly used search forms? It   would be great if Chrome detects which search forms are used the most by   the user and displays them on the new tab page under the search history   form.      -    Please provide
