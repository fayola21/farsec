<title>Issue 19406 -   chromium -    6-channel audio distorts after scrubbing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Play a 6-track audio video (eg.  trek6.ogv or term6.ogv).  2. Scrub the video  stop  scrub again.  3. Repeat 2 until you have a problem.  Usually about 3-4 scrubs.      The audio should playback like normal.    Instead  after a few scrubs  the downmixing code breaks.  The center   channel ends up on the right side.    Eventually  the sound completely breaks up and you only get static.    Stopping/starting the video does not fix it.  Reloading the video does. </pre>
