<title>Issue 5556 -   chromium -    Application mode problem: no pop-up indicator of URL when mouse hovers over embedded link in webpage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Bring up a webpage with embedded links (e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>) in   a regular Chrome window  2. Create an application shortcut on your Desktop  3. Bring up the webpage in the application Chrome window (e.g. --  app=<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a> )  4. resize the windows so you can see the entire window of both Chrome   normal and Chrome application (see attached screenshot image  chrome-app-  vs-regular.JPG)  5. for both Chrome normal and Chrome application  hover your mouse over one   of the embedded links on the webpage (e.g. &quot;About Google&quot; in the Google   main page)  6. notice when you hover your mouse over a link in Chrome normal you see a   pop-up indicator in the lower-left part of the screen with the full URL   (e.g. &quot;www.google.com/intl/en/about.html&quot; appears in the lower left when   the mouse hovers over the &quot;About Google&quot; embedded link on the Google main   page)  7. notice when you hover your mouse over a link in Chrome application you   do NOT see any indicator of the full URL          You should see an indicator of the full URL whenever you hover over an   embedded link  in Chrome application mode or Chrome normal mode.  This is   very important from a security consideration point of view  to allow the   user to really know which URL and associated host is being referenced.        In Chrome application mode there is no indication of the URL associated   with a link until the link is clicked and the URL is launched.  This is a   security risk for users running application mode.    Please provide
