<title>Issue 17777 -   chromium -    pressing/releasing ctrl while using the omnibox should not set the selection to the first element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.195.1    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Enter something in the omnibox  wait for a few suggestions in the   completion popup  2. Hit ctrl-n a few times to go to the e.g. third suggestion  3. Release ctrl  (4. Hit Enter)        After 3.  the third suggestion should still be selected  so that step 4 opens   that suggestion.        For some reason  every time ctrl is pressed or released  the first suggestion   is released. That makes it virtually impossible to use ctrl-n/p to select   suggestions. Annoying and frustrating. </pre>
