<title>Issue 10576 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't work with Win7 &amp; AppLocker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows 7     1. Enable AppID  2. Create default Exe rules and also create a path rule to allow everything   under &quot;%osdrive%users&lt;user&gt;appdatalocalgoogle*&quot;  3. Launch Chrome    Not able to browse any site!    Event viewer logged one allow event and one deny event for chrome.exe    If you see the event viewer you will find two events:  one where chrome is   allowed and the other where chrome is denied. For the first instance  the   matching rule is the path rule that you created for AppData  but the second   instance is denied by the default deny rule.      This is probably because Chrome's renderer process is created with   CreateProcessAsUserW and matches the &quot;deny&quot; flags being set.     </pre>
