<title>Issue 12440 -   chromium -    End/home buttons do wrong thing with selected text in render view text editor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Type the following in an input field in webkit:    wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt    Now put your cursor in the middle of the second line so that it looks like  this:    wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  ooooooooooooo|oooooooooooooooooooo  tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt    Holding shift  press up. You should see the second half of the first  line and the first half of the second line is selected. Now  still  holding shift  press End.    What does happen:  - On linux  mac and windows:  the cursor moves to the end of the second line (it appears that the &quot;End&quot;  is relative to where the selection started  not where the cursor is  currently). You have the second half of the second line selected.    What should happen:  -On linux and windows:  the cursor moves to the end of the first line. You only have the first half  of the second line selected (and the newline between the first and second  lines).  -On mac:  the cursor moves to the end of the last line. You have everything from  halfway through the first line to the end of the last line selected.    Note that I tested on windows and mac safari. On windows safari  the  behavior matches windows chrome (so it's wrong there too). On Mac safari   the behavior is also wrong  but is wrong in a different way: everything  from the middle of the second line to the end of the last line will be  selected.    I suspect the fix lies in the chromium webkit port  so I'm filing this here  instead of bugs.webkit.org.    Personally I find this very annoying  but I guess some others might not  care at all if they don't edit text the same way I do. </pre>
