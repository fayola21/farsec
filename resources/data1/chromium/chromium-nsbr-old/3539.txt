<title>Issue 3539 -   chromium -    Download file is broken in 154.3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> prereq: in the options  check the box that says that you want to always ask   for a filename.    1. Download a .exe file    problem #1 : in the save as box I see unconfirmed_50667.download  which is   not good. I should see the name of the file.    problem #2 : The original file name was setup.exe  I did not want that  so   I changed the name in the save as dialog to something.exe  but it still got   downloaded to setup.exe.    problem #3 : Don't ask me to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot;. I just got that choice in   the save as dialog.    So: If the save as dialog is to be shown (because the option is checked  or   for any other reason)  we should revert to the old download behaviour.     </pre>
