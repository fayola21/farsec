<title>Issue 6770 -   chromium -    Accurate-tab-borders change broke Fitts' Law in screen corner - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Glen made sure with the old (inaccurate) tab-selection code to extend the   selectable area of the leftmost tab up to the screen corner in maximized   mode.  The new tab selection code is super-accurate  and broke this.  We   should special-case this behavior for user convenience.    (Not magic browzR-related) </pre>
