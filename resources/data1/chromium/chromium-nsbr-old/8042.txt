<title>Issue 8042 -   chromium -    Kill remaining vsprops files. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am trying to create a .sln in tools  e.g.  srctoolsfoofoo.sln    I wish to develop the tool without putting everything in srcchromechrome.sln (at   least not at this point.)    I am modeling foo.sln after srcmediamedia.sln.    I want to add srcbasebuildbase.vcproj to foo.sln.  I can't do this.  When I add base.vcproj to foo.sln  VS refuses  because base.vsproj   contains the line:   			    InheritedPropertySheets=&quot;$(SolutionDir)..builddebug.vsprops;.base.vsprops&quot;    Notice that for both chrome and media  $(SolutionDir).. is src  but for foo.sln  it   is srctools  so it can't find debug.vsprops    This means that if I want to use the common vsprops  my .sln file has to be exactly one   level below src  which is inappropriate for my .sln.  Can the build system be fixed to   that this restriction is lifted?         </pre>
