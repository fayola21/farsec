<title>Issue 6460 -   chromium -    port net/base/net_resources.grd to mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> net/base/net_resources.grd is needed by browser_main. This is more than  just a simple grit step  as it relies on net/tools/tld_cleanup to run and  generate something. Looks like we need to do some xcode work to get this  tool setup and running (there are vcproj and scons files for it). </pre>
