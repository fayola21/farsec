<title>Issue 9085 -   chromium -    Hang for a few minutes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Chrome freezes for minutes at a time.  I can open the task manager  only   the Browser task is running  none of the other pages get any CPU time.  I   can switch tabs  but their content does not get displayed  just a blank   page.  This happens 4/5 times a day.  Chrome usually recovers after 1 or 2   minutes  one time it crashed.        The 1.0 based Beta never had that issue.          <b>Please provide
