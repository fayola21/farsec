<title>Issue 8141 -   chromium -    Using keyboard select RTL text: Highlight goes to opposite direction from FF&amp;IE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug is a clone(split) of <a title="Using keyboard select RTL text: Highlight goes to opposite direction" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3830"> issue 3830 </a> and <a title="Home/End key do not work correctly for English and RTL mixed text" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4556"> issue 4556 </a>    Test case is attached.    Currently  Chrome/Webkit text selection always follows logical order  no   matter on bidi text or on pure RTL text  no matter in an RTL text box (for   example  set dir=&quot;rtl&quot;) or in LTR text box.    By logical order  I mean shift-left-arrow moves cursor logically backward    while shift-right-arrow moves cursor logically forward.      But that is not the case for FF and IE.    For FF&amp;IE  in LTR text box  text selection followings logical order  same   as Chrome.      But in RTL text box  FF&amp;IE follows anti-logical order.    Given the pure RTL text in the test file  text selection follows the same   order as visual order.  Given the 1st bidi text example in the test file  text selection follows   anti-logical order  which means shift-left-arrow moves cursor logically   forward  while shift-right-arrow moves cursor logically backward.       </pre>
