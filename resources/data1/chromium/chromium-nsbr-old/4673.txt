<title>Issue 4673 -   chromium -    UI: tab overflow when maximized on second monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.23         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK         IE 8b2: OK      1. move Chrome to second monitor  2. maximize chrome  3. Open enough tabs so that the tabs should start resizing to remain on   screen      The tabs continue to shrink down so they remain on the screen        They do not shrink  they overflow the screen so you cannot access the   overflow tabs without closing or detaching others to shrink the area      Additional Info:  OS: Vista premium 32bit  Both my monitors run at 1680x1050  In the screen shot the first shot is maximized chrome on my second monitor   showing the overflow issue with only 9 tabs being shown and one of those is   overlapping the general window controls. The second shot is still on my   second monitor but not maximized and it shows all 11 tabs I have open. The   third show is maximized on my primary monitor and it shows all 11 tabs I   have open           </pre>
