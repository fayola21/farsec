<title>Issue 21730 -   chromium -    Extension functions that operate on tabs need to include a 'document_id' or 'navigation_id' parameter. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  we have chrome.pageActions.enableForTab()  but we will in the   future have other things that operate on a document.    There can be a race in these situations where the extension attempts to   operate on one document  but the tab has actually navigated by the time the   browser receives the message.    Right now  as a hack around this  enableForTab() takes a URL parameter. The   page action is not applied unless the URL parameter value matches the tab's   current URL.    However  this is not exactly correct since the tab could *reload*. To make   this correct  we really need tabs to have a property that contains an ID   that uniquely represents the currently loaded document.    I believe that we already have such an ID in the session history system.   Something like a 'navigation id'. </pre>
