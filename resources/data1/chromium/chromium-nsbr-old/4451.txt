<title>Issue 4451 -   chromium -    Install target - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> scons should have an install target. It is needed by downstream to build  packages.    It's fine to let scons publish files in chrome/Hammer by default (build)   but at least for linux/unix platforms  an install target is needed.    The usual 'install' target accepts a prefix (like /usr or /usr/local)   and also DESTDIR (like $RPM_BUILD_ROOT  or debian/tmp) making the build  tool install files into $DESTDIR/$prefix/{bin lib ...}.    Ideally  it should accept something like this:  scons --site-dir=../site_scons PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=debian/tmp install    This also brings the question of where chromium should live ?  $PREFIX/lib/chromium/ ? $PREFIX/lib/chromium-x.y.z/ ? (with a link in  $PREFIX/bin)     </pre>
