<title>Issue 8743 -   chromium -    Chrome &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; dialog is confusing and inefficient - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1      The chrome &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; dialog appears to have been borrowed   wholesale from Firefox without much thought applied. Users shouldn't need   to understand the difference between the cache  their cookies  the password   store  the download list  and also have to make a decision about the   timeframe.    This dialog should be re-designed to help accelerate common-case use and   help users &quot;do what they mean&quot; without needing to understand the guts of   chrome. This would also be a reasonable place to introduce a cache policy   configuration setting (in addition to the &quot;advanced&quot; main preferences   list). </pre>
