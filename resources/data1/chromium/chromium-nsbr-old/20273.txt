<title>Issue 20273 -   chromium -    'Find' does not find the text in it when a new tab is opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0    OS version               : 10.5.8 Build 9L30      1. Open any webpage and search [ctrl+f] for a text  2. Open another tab but make sure it has the text you searched on the   previous tab  3. Press ctrl+f again and you'll notice it doesn't pick up matching word[s]   on the new tab. electing the text in the find box and hitting return doesn't   work either.      On same version of Chrom on Linux  it finds matching words on the new   tab automatically.    Machine details:  Processor: 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo  Memory: 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 </pre>
