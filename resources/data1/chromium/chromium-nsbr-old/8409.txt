<title>Issue 8409 -   chromium -    Windows 7: use new Save dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Win7 provides new fancy open and save dialogs. Without making any changes    we already get the fancy open dialogs  but we get the old ones for &quot;Save   page as...&quot; and &quot;Save image as...&quot;    Here's the relevant info from MSFT about how to make sure we get the new   hotness:    1)       Use the new IFileDialog family of APIs    The new family of IFileDialog APIs (IFileDialog  IFileOpenDialog    IFileSaveDialog  IFileDialogCustomize IFileDialogEvents    IFileDialogControlEvents) replace the legacy GetOpenFileName and   GetSaveFileName APIs starting with  Windows Vista. These new APIs provide a   more flexible mechanism with picking and interacting with items in the   shell namespace. The new APIs also provide a new data-driven customization   model for adding common controls to the dialog as well as a rich callback   mechanism for handling dialog events. Calling into the new IFileDialog APIs   guarantees that new file dialog user interface will be displayed.         2)       Do not customize the Legacy File Dialog    If you do not make any customizations (template based hwnd or event hook)   to the legacy API Windows will automatically thunk to the new user   interface. Specifically  in your OPENFILENAME structure do not set the   lpfnHook  hInstance  lpTemplatename members or the OFN_ENABLEHOOK |   OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE flags. If you need to make customizations to the dialog   or handle events  use the new IFileDialog family of APIs.
