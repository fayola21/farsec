<title>Issue 21888 -   chromium -    Implement layoutTestController.keepWebHistory in test shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/fast/history/clicked-link-is-visited.html  LayoutTests/fast/history/subframe-is-visited.html    These layout tests to see if link colors change after visiting a page. They  does this by using layoutTestController.keepWebHistory() to turn on a  temporary web history. layoutTestController.keepWebHistory() is not  implemented in test shell.    More comments from Tony Chang:  Brett tells me that setting up a temporary history database for this test   is a pain and we have our own unit tests for link coloring.  I'm just going   to move the test to the ignore list since it doesn't really test anything   useful for us.   </pre>
