<title>Issue 23136 -   chromium -    UI changes to bookmark sync in response to user study - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1 - Add dialog after successfully setting up sync that reads:  &quot;Success! Your bookmarks are now synced to Google Docs. Next: To merge and  sync you bookmarks to Chrome on another computer  rrinse  lather  and  repeat on that computer..&quot;    2 - Amend the initial dialog to read:  &quot;Bookmark Sync makes it easy to keep the same set of bookmarks on multiple  computers. When you enable sync  your bookmarks get stored online in your  Google Account. Each additional computer on which you enable sync will  receive the same bookmarks.&quot;    3 - Remove the Docs link on the NTP  since it's mostly confusing.    4 - Amend confirmation dialog when you stop syncing to read:  &quot;If you disable sync  your bookmarks will no longer be kept in sync with  those stored in your Google Account or on your other machines. No bookmarks  will be deleted; all existing bookmarks will remain on this computer and in  your Google account.&quot;    5 - In bookmark manager  turn &quot;Synced to...&quot; into a menu item  with one  entry titled &quot;Sync settings&quot; that opens up settings. </pre>
