<title>Issue 3617 -   chromium -    retskrivning.dk is not added as a search engine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3 (Official Build 3339)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://retskrivning.dk/">http://retskrivning.dk/</a>    I can't search by typing &quot;ret&quot;  &quot;retskriv&quot; or even &quot;retskrivning&quot; + &lt;tab&gt;   in the address bar. It's probably because of a non-standard system on the   site  but if it's something that Chrome can detect  it would be nice.    Other sites automatically add themselves  e.g. facebook.com  ordbogen.com    imdb.com and many more. </pre>
