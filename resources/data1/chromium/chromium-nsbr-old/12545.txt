<title>Issue 12545 -   chromium -    Extensions auto-update needs to keep its schedule across browser restarts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The initial implementation of extensions auto-update will just use an in-  memory timer set to something like 5 hours  but we need to persist the value   of &quot;next expected check time&quot; across restarts. On browser startup  we should   read this value and setup the timer appropriately (making sure it's not too   soon after startup though).     </pre>
