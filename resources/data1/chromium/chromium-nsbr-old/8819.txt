<title>Issue 8819 -   chromium -    Double-click of right-most tab's close button causes Chrome to accidentally maximize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open at least two tabs.  2. Double-click any tab's close button.      One tab should close. Instead the tab closes AND chrome is maximized.        Note this is a split from <a title="[magic_browzR] Double clicking the new tab button maximizes window" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2827"> Issue 2827 </a> which has its original problem fixed   but not the one mentioned in comment 4. </pre>
