<title>Issue 6085 -   chromium -    The Chrome system menu is not mirrored in RTL locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1109298&gt;      When running Chrome in an RTL locale (like Hebrew)  the menus are properly   mirrored like the rest of the UI. For example  the menus of the menu   buttons (Chrome and Page)  the Tab menu and the menu that appears when   right clicking within a page are all properly mirrored. However  the Chrome   system menu is not localized (it still contains the text in English for   Close  Minimize  etc.) and it is not mirrored.    Repro steps:    1) Run &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot;  2) Right click on the Chrome title bar to show the system menu. You'll see   that the menu elements are not translated to Hebrew and that the text is   not right aligned.       </pre>
