<title>Issue 5065 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Maximized window position/frame painting problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Show or hide the Windows taskbar (see below)  2. Maximize the Chromium browser window  3. Observe positioning/painting problems (see below)          Maximized browser window is positioned properly and frame edge is properly painted (here   &quot;proper&quot; means &quot;identically to Google Chrome 0.4.154.29&quot;).          There are two cases: with Windows taskbar visible  and with Windows taskbar hidden.    With the taskbar visible  when the browser window is maximized  the top several pixels of the   browser window is off the top of the screen.    With the taskbar hidden  when the browser window is maximized  (1) there is a small gap at the   bottom of the screen where windows below show through; and (2) the left and right edges of the   browser frame are not painted properly.    These problems appear in both single and dual monitor modes.      <b>Please provide
