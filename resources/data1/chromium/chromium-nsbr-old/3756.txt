<title>Issue 3756 -   chromium -    About box: RTL layout incorrect for credits and ToS message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In 154.8  The new messages in the about box for credits and the terms of service are   not properly laid out in RTL languages (ar  he).     See attached.    The parentheses around the version in the status message are also   incorrect.  I do not know if that is new in 154.8.    I might not hold up the release of 154.8 for this  but it needs to get   fixed in an update soon if I do not. </pre>
