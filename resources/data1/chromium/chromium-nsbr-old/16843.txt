<title>Issue 16843 -   chromium -    Dragging tab is super janky when the renderer is slow getting running. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have a repro case.  After a bout of compiling and stuff  I grabbed a tab I hadn't looked at in   awhile  and tried to drag it out.  It looked to me like I was waiting for the tab to render before the   drag could start. </pre>
