<title>Issue 10764 -   chromium -    for a file download link  even if 'target' is set to 'blank'  opening a blank tab leads to a less  desirable user experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a file download link (with target=&quot;_blank&quot;) is clicked  we open a new   tab and download in the new tab. IE opens an empty pop-up window and   download there.     Somehow Firefox3 manages to download without opening a new tab/window.       This issue was reported in the Chrome Korean U2U group and I was about to   reply that it's because 'target=&quot;_blank&quot;' is specified for a link and   there's not much Chrome can do about it when I realized that Firefox 3   works 'better' for most users (who do not know about 'target=blank'.      For instance  go to <a href="http://bbsmovie.com/thread-569080-1-1.html">http://bbsmovie.com/thread-569080-1-1.html</a> (a Chinese   file download site)  look for '33.17' and click the link to the right of   33.17KB.      I'm not sure how Firefox tells (early enough) a file download from actually   opening a new page (html) in a new tab/window.    </pre>
