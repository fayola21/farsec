<title>Issue 10676 -   chromium -    Unconfirmed downloads of normal window are shown as cancelled in Incognito mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry if it is a dupe  I could not able to track for it.    Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13939">r13939</a>)    -Download few exe's in Normal chrome window (don't respond to the dangerous   download confirmation bar)  -Go to downloads page in Incognito window.    As shown in the screenshot  most of the unconfirmed downloads of normal   window  are shown as cancelled ones in incognito mode.    PS: not pretty sure  we regressed here ??       </pre>
