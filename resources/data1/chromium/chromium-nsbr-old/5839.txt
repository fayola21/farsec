<title>Issue 5839 -   chromium -    Recently closed tabs: tab animation anomaly upon clicking on single-tab entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 1.0.156.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7453">r7453</a>)    Repro  -----  1. Close an open tab.  2. Go to New Tab page.  3. Click on entry in Recently Closed section corresponding to the tab just  closed.    Note the tab animation upon clicking the entry. Instead of opening the page  in the current tab  it looks like it opens a new tab and closes the current  tab. The tab is created in the next position  then slides back to the left.    This doesn't happen  for example  with Recent Bookmarks. </pre>
