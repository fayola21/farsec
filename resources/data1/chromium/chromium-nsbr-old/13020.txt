<title>Issue 13020 -   chromium -    Autocomplete dropdown doesn't repaint properly when reducing number of items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STEPS TO REPRODUCE  1. Click a text field  e.g. the search bar above.  2. Start typing something for which there are at least two matching items.  3. Type more such that there are fewer matching items.    EXPECTED RESULTS  Autocomplete dropdown gets smaller.    ACTUAL RESULTS  Autocomplete dropdown doesn't repaint properly  leaving multiple lines   with the same term  or leaving some terms visible that should be removed.    e.g. if I type &quot;i&quot; I'll get &quot;ian.hickson&quot; and &quot;is:starred&quot; as autocomplete lines.   If I then type an &quot;s&quot;  the autocomplete widget should just say &quot;is:starred&quot;    but instead I get two lines saying that. (The bottom border is painted below   both  indicating that it is trying to shrink the box but not repainting   properly.) </pre>
