<title>Issue 18084 -   chromium -    &quot;Undo&quot; does not work in location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1      1. Paste something in the url bar  2. Hit cmd-z to undo the paste        Pasted text should disappear          Nothing.    Might be related to Edit-&gt;Undo not being validated correctly (seems to be   always disabled atm  and doesn't flash when cmd-z is hit in web contents). </pre>
