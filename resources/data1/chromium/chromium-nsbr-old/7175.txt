<title>Issue 7175 -   chromium -    &quot;Clear formatting&quot; broken in GNotes on WebKit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Upstreamed from Buganizer http://b/issue?id=1355217  URL: <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">http://www.google.com/notebook/</a>    michaeljh on September 02 2008 11:10 (New)    Summary:    &quot;Clear formatting&quot; broken in GNotes on WebKit  Component:  Chrome &gt; WebKit &gt; Layout  CC:         chrome-bugs  notebook-feedback  Type:       Bug  Priority:   P2  Severity:   S2  In prod:    false  URLs affected:  &lt;none&gt;    This appears to be a WebKit bug as the issue doesn't occur with FF  but I'm  cc'ing notebook-feedback as well.    Verified that this occurs in Chrome (and Safari/win as well) but not  Firefox 3. Steps to reproduce:    1. Paste a paragraph of text into a new Note. Verify that the note opens  and closes correctly.  2. Hit Ctrl-A (select all) and click the &quot;clear formatting&quot; button.    The note will now be &quot;broken&quot; and cannot be fully opened (in any browser)  -- when open it only takes up two lines of text. When closed and reopened   it only takes up one line of text. It's possible to use the arrow keys to  move through the other lines  but there does not appear to be any way to  &quot;fix&quot; the note other than copying and pasting it into a plain-text editor   then copying and pasting that back into a new Note.
