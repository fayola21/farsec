<title>Issue 17244 -   chromium -    Memory leak in WebCore::SVGZoomEventInternal::previousTranslateAttrGetter() in v8::internal::Object::GetProperty() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happened in LayoutTests/svg/custom/immutable-properties.html  during the fishing expedition   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg  Presumably it would also be reproduced by more specific commands   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom  or   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom/immutable-  but I haven't verified that.    Valgrind complains  20 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 267 of 956     at operator new(unsigned int) (vg_replace_malloc.c:212)     by WebCore::SVGZoomEventInternal::previousTranslateAttrGetter(v8::Local&lt;v8::String&gt;   v8::AccessorInfo const&amp;) (V8SVGZoomEvent.cpp:65)     by v8::internal::Object::GetPropertyWithCallback(v8::internal::Object*   v8::internal::Object*  v8::internal::String*  v8::internal::Object*) (objects.cc:191)     by v8::internal::Object::GetProperty(v8::internal::Object*  v8::internal::LookupResult*   v8::internal::String*  PropertyAttributes*) (objects.cc:554)     by v8::internal::LoadIC::Load(v8::internal::InlineCacheState   v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::Object&gt;  v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::String&gt;)  (ic.cc:620)     by v8::internal::LoadIC_Miss(v8::internal::Arguments) (ic.cc:1240)   </pre>
