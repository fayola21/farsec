<title>Issue 20276 -   chromium -    Regenerate our test server certificates using subjectAltName - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now our test server certificates have  &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; in the CN (common name) of the  subject field.  I suspect that's why we get  certificate name mismatch on the Mac.    IP addresses should be encoded as iPAddress  in the subjectAltName extension.  We should  regenerate our test server certificates that  way and see if it fixes the certificate name  mismatch problem on the Mac. </pre>
