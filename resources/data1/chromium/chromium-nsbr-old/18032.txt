<title>Issue 18032 -   chromium -    Click operations treated as drag operations: missing drag-rect support? (affects usability of Chrome) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	3.0.195.1 (Official Build 21222)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.1 Safari/532.0          Firefox 3.x: OK    Linux Chrome has made me aware that I'm a sloppy mouse clicker. No other   application I use interprets what I mean to be click operations as   drag/move operations.  They all seem to have a &quot;drag rectangle&quot; which  if I   keep the mouse within they treat as a click operation (even if I move it a   few pixels) and only treat the operation as a drag if I move the mouse   outside the rectangle.    This is very annoying when trying to right click on a link: instead of   being able to select &quot;copy link address&quot;  my mouse moves down 1 pixel and   Chrome interprets the mouse-up message as a selection and instead fires off   the &quot;open link in new tab&quot; operation.    This is also annoying on pages where you click on an image to cause some   effect on the page. (Such as pages where clicking on one of many thumbnails   causes a larger image to show a detailed view of the selected thumbnail.)   There is definitely a drag rectangle here  but it appears to be only about   3 pixels which isn't much on today's monitors.  FireFox has a much larger   drag rectangle in this case and I don't accidentally drag images when I   mean to click on them.      1. Run on Linux  2. Open any web page  3. Select some text  4. Right button down  5. Move mouse down *1* pixel  6. Right button up          Minor mouse wiggling on mouse-down shouldn't be treated    any differently than 0 mouse movement on mouse-down.          The top item in the menu is selected on mouse-up if you    move 1 pixel but not if you move 0 pixels.     </pre>
