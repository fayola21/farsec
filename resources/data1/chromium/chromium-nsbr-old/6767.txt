<title>Issue 6767 -   chromium -    dragging an image from a webpage to ms word results in a link rather than an image - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When dragging links to Word  I get the same behavior in IE7  FF2  FF3b4   and Chrome (only the link  no link text).  When dragging an image to word   only IE7 gives me an image  the rest give me a link to the image.    In Chrome  I tried commenting out the code that stores the link data in the  drag object and I was able to get an image dragged into Word.  So the  CF_HTML data is there and it's valid  but Word decides to prefer the URL to  the CF_HTML data.  For an example of the CF_HTML drag  select all on  google.com and click and drag starting at the &quot;copyright 2008 google&quot; text.    Looking in the debugger  it seems like IE7 has CF_HTML version 1.0 data and  we have CF_HTML 0.9 data.  Maybe switching to 1.0 would fix this?  I'm not  sure.  Anyway  we match the behavior of FF and Safari  so I'm not sure how  big of a deal this is.   </pre>
