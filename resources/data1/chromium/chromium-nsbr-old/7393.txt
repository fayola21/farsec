<title>Issue 7393 -   chromium -    Page reloaded  but form data is from cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48    When you go back (using &quot;Back&quot;) to page in HTTPS mode the page is reloaded   from the server with new form data  but document.form[0] in javascript   returns a form with old data.    We haven't seen such problem with IE  Opera and Firefox. We have seen (but   not tested in details) this bug in Safari.     </pre>
