<title>Issue 22038 -   chromium -    automatically attempt to fix up URLs provided via bookmarks APIs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The bookmarks editor does some smart corrections of URLs that users type in   (for example automatically prepending &quot;http:// in some cases).  We should do   the same work in the bookmarks API so that callers don't need to reinvent the   wheel.  All it takes is a call to URLFixerUpper::FixupURL. </pre>
