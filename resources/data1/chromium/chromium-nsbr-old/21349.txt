<title>Issue 21349 -   chromium -    Can get stuck in window drag with custom frame + kwin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Kubuntu 9.04/kde 4.2.2  chrome 4.0.206.0    1. turn on custom frame  2. maximize chromium  3. bring a non-maximized window to the front  4. click on the chromium tab strip while chromium is not the active window   (make sure not to wait too long before releasing or it doesn't work)  5. Observe that you are stuck in a drag (clicking again releases the drag)    really  three problems here:  1. drag is initiated when the user doesn't move the mouse  2. drag doesn't go away when the user releases the mouse button  3. drag is initiated when the window is fullscreened </pre>
