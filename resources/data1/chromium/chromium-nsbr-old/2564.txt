<title>Issue 2564 -   chromium -    Kingsoft Powerword cannot read off words in the web page rendering area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From <a title="translation service built into Google toolbar is not available  "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2428">issue 2428</a> :    The Google-Kingsoft Powerword (a Chinese-English translation software)  can't capture the words in the web pages of Chrome. However  it can capture  the words in the titlebar of a tab  menubar  or anywhere else. Also  it  works perfectly for IE or Firefox. I don't have Safari installed  so i  don't know whether this is a bug in WebKit engine.    --------------    Kingsoft Powerword ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerWord">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerWord</a> ) is available   at <a href="http://cp.iciba.com/">http://cp.iciba.com/</a>      Other similar software like Babylon may have the same problem.
