<title>Issue 19404 -   chromium -    RenderThemeWin depends on Settings::defaultFontSize  (and shouldn't) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a previously internal bug:  &quot;&quot;&quot;  This is an unfortunate dependency because RenderThemeWin has no way to   directly get at Settings::defaultFontSize.  We work around this by adding a   setter to RenderThemeWin for the default font size.  It would be better if   methods that need this value would pass the value in as a method arg.  This   requires some changes to WebCore so punting for now.  &quot;&quot;&quot;    We should probably go ahead and clean this up.  Each page is supposed to have   its own setting  which this breaks.  I don't know if this manifests itself as   any other bugs or has real world consequences  but someone should probably   take a look. </pre>
