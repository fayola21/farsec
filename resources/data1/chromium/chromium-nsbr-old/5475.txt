<title>Issue 5475 -   chromium -    Recently closed tabs not working properly anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>    Not completely sure       At start  seeing the titles of the recently closed tabs  and clicking them   to open them in a tab       As name it sais &quot;Window&quot; (I didn't have multiple windows open when I   closed chromium) and it has the chromium-image behind it  I can't see what   site/page it will open.   I first noticed it few days ago when the first link under recently closed   tabs always only said &quot;Undefined&quot;  clicking it opened the right page in a   new window  and removed the link from the recently closed tab list.   This new problem (It only saying &quot;Window&quot; started after closing the only   open chromium window  that had the Downloads tab open.    Please provide
