<title>Issue 7688 -   chromium -    Chrome 2.0.162 cannot connect through ISA server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>         My computer is in a domain network and connect to internet through an   ISA server.   As for Chrome 1.x  I can surfing the internet  however  Chrome 2.x   cannot.   I think it maybe a bug in Chrome 2.x  can hope it can be fixed in next   release version.                 Please provide
