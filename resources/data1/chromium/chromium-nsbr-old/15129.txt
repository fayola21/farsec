<title>Issue 15129 -   chromium -    Need page setup option to customize headers and footers while printing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31  URLs (if applicable) : N/A          Firefox 3.x: OK        When I print a page  Chrome does not give me an option to turn off the  headers and footers. I don't want the URL  date/time  etc  when I print  something  because it's just unnecessary and clutter  especially when I'm  printing something for long-term archival  like phone bills  mutual fund  statements  etc.    I currently have to switch to FF  copy-paste the url  login to corp SSO  again  etc. </pre>
