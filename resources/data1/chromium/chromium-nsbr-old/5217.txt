<title>Issue 5217 -   chromium -    Link-opening problem. blue-colored browser error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open an email checking program and open and email with a link in it that   takes you to the website or anything that opens Google Chrome with a link.   Then click on the link (they may be called hyperlinks I don't know  the   blue colored and underlined URL's) I've noticed the browser's border   changes from black to blue when opening links. I'm not for sure if that's   because of the error or that's what it is programmed to do when opening   links.      It is expected to open the browser and take you to the link.          as soon as you click on the window you will see an error message as shown   in the picture included labelled &quot;google&quot;.
