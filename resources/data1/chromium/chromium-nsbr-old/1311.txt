<title>Issue 1311 -   chromium -    Bad highlighting behavior for text boxes (switched single- and multi-line box behaviors?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit a page with a single-line text box and a multi-line text box  for  example  <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t?#">http://translate.google.com/translate_t?#</a>  2. Type a sentence into the single-line text box.  3. Type a few lines into the multi-line text box.  4. For each box  try selecting the left half of a line  starting somewhere  in the middle.      Upon dragging leftward  the part of the line to the left of where you  started is highlighted.  With the single-line box  only the cursor's horizontal position determines  what gets highlighted; dragging up/down at any time has no effect.  With the multi-line box  if you drag up or down  more lines can be highlighted.      For the single-line box  if you drag downward during or after dragging  leftward  the right side of the line is highlighted instead of the left.   Since a natural  careless drag tends to dip downward  I often encounter  this problem.  (Also  if you drag up-and-rightward  the left side of the  line is highlighted instead of the right.)  For a multi-line box  once you exit the left side of the box  all lines  above the target line are immediately highlighted as well.  To highlight  just one line  you have to carefully stop right at the start of the line   which is inconvenient.    Please provide
