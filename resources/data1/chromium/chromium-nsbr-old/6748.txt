<title>Issue 6748 -   chromium -    Prefs return default value if names partially conflict - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you have a pref called...    foo:&quot;string&quot;    ... and you add another pref ...    foo.bar=true    ... then when looking for foo.bar it finds foo and since the type isn't  right it returns the default value for foo.bar  creating the effect that  the pref is never saved. It should probably DCHECK because the type isn't  right. </pre>
