<title>Issue 13089 -   chromium -    Regression: Javascript console not usable for javascript debugging anymore... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3        No other browser has this amazing feature anyway :-)      --------------------------------------  1. Ctrl+Shift+J (open js console)  2. try to do anything or evaluate an object      ----------------------------  Showing the object  with the arrow for expanding and investigating all   children of object.      ---------------------  It will only writes 'evaluating...'  and then '[object Object]'      Since 3.0.182.2 it did not work at all  I mean the only thing we got from   it is 'evaluating...'  now it shows something  but only the most minimal   detail.  The javascript console also hangs lot of scripts while it is open. Closing   it resumes the scripts.    BTW - where did the debugger window go? (Not that I understood how to use   it...)   </pre>
