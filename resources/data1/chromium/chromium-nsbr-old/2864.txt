<title>Issue 2864 -   chromium -    History page needs to show URL in blue bar when mouse hover over an entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    When viewing the History page  it needs to show the full URL of each entry   in the blue bar at the bottom when your mouse hovers over it.    This is the exact same functionality as any other webpage  and it is also   necessary for the History page as well.    You cannot always know which history page you want to go to just by reading   the title.  And untitled pages just show as &quot;Untitled&quot;  which is no help.    Also  if there are multiple copies of the same page (with the same title)   but different pages (eg. ver1.htm  ver2.htm  etc.) you cannot use only the   title to know which page to go back to.    Therefore  it is absolutely critical and necessary to also display the URL   for each entry in the blue bar for the History page. </pre>
