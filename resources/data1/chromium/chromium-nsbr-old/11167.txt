<title>Issue 11167 -   chromium -    Change password fields get filled erroneously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0  URLs (if applicable) : Drupal based applications i.e. <a href="http://tout.essaye.sauf.ca/">http://tout.essaye.sauf.ca/</a>      1. Register new account on <a href="http://tout.essaye.sauf.ca/">http://tout.essaye.sauf.ca/</a>  2. Save password from Chrome yellow bar  3. Go to: My account and Edit Tab  4. E-mail and password are automatically replaced by Chrome.  5. In addition: Save button will generate validation error.    It cause many problems  if you have stored different accounts no the same   website. It's override existing value of field with probably the first one   from stored password list.      When any of field (i.e. login and password) are already filled with some   default values  Chrome shouldn't fill them automatically. It should ignore   them.      Existing proper values are overridden by different one causing confusion   and validation errors.  Other serious problem: If you have stored admin password and when you   editing some other user account  its populate your (admin) details into his   account without your knowledge.   </pre>
