<title>Issue 21246 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Shift+J should open Javascript Console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To inspect elements  it is more convenient to open the developer tools (with   javascript console collapsed) by mouse click.    To type javascript  it is more convenient to open the developer tools (with   javascript console opened) by keyboard shortcut.      --  Another related issue:  The developer tools also need some keyboard shortcuts to access functions.  eg. ctrl+&gt; to toggle javascript console.     </pre>
