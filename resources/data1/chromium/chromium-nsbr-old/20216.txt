<title>Issue 20216 -   chromium -    Inconsistent omnibox single-click behavior  even on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Move cursor to omnibox.  2. See vertical line/pipe text cursor  move it to a point.  3. Single click to select that point in the text.  4. Quickly start typing characters.        You select the point in the URL text.  The typed characters are inserted at   that point.      You select the entire text of the URL  then the typed characters overwrite   the entire URL.    The text cursor indicates that this is a text field  so that single click   will select an insertion point  double click will select a word.    I've read some arguments (related to the Linux omnibox issue) that you are   &quot;selecting the omnibox&quot; not &quot;selecting text&quot; and that therefore this   behavior &quot;makes sense&quot;.  If that's so  then the cursor is wrong  since it   indicates selection of text within a text field and leads to user   confusion/cognitive dissonance.    And if you do change the cursor  then you need to get rid of the current   behavior which allows you to select a range of text without first clicking   on the omnibox.    <b>Please provide
