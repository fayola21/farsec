<title>Issue 16868 -   chromium -    Chinese page font too small and there is no easy way to change it per site or globally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open popyard.org  2. some user might think the default font in the page is too small. You can   use ctrl++ to enlarge the font of current page. But the enlargement will   not work if you open the same page in a another tab. By comparison  when   using ctrl++ to enlarge page font in both IE and FF  the preference is   preserved.           font issue is very important for Chinese users. Ordinary users might not   notice or care the speed/simplicity of Chrome  but they care the look and   feel of the pages they browsing.  Chrome should preserve user's font preference per page  or per site  or   globally  instead of asking user to set it for every single page. And/or   Chrome should set appropriate minimum font size and re-rendering the page   when minimum font size changes.        Following page has user complains:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=389f306a52817110&amp;hl=en     </pre>
