<title>Issue 4389 -   chromium -    Find-in-box is not highlighting all the instances of the search word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to http://go/reductions/find-in/myname.html  2. Get find-in box using Ctrl+F and search for sunandt    What is the expected output?   All the instances should be highlighted    What do you see instead?  The first instance on each line[2 3... n] will not be highlighted. When the   search for the word is pointing to the first word on line 2 or 3  closing   the find-in-box(click x on the box) will highlight it.     </pre>
