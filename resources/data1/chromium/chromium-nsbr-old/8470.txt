<title>Issue 8470 -   chromium -    Implement LoadTemporaryCert in ssl_test_util.cc for Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we have to import our test root CA certificate  (src/net/data/ssl/certificates/root_ca_cert.crt) into the  Windows system certificate store before we can run all the  tests in net_unittests.exe.  It is a hassle.  Morever  on  Windows Vista it is tricky to import a root CA certificate.  You need to run the certificate import dialog as Administrator  and import it into some &quot;physical&quot; certificate store.    It should be possible to import the test root CA certificate  into a temporary certificate store and trust it only for  the unit tests.  We should figure out how to do that. </pre>
