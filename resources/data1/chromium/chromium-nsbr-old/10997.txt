<title>Issue 10997 -   chromium -    Yellow security warning triangle on secure sites using non 443 ip port - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Connect to a https website on a non 443 port (example to please keep   secret https://cr(minus)hs2(dit)hobsoft(dat)net(colon)444/) To see the   problem  you will have to trust the certificate :-)          Yellow pad lock at the end of the address bar  and when clicking on it  the   dialog with 3 green check marks.      There is a yellow warning triangle (even if you trust the certificate).  When cklicking on it the dialog says that there are &quot;not secured resources&quot;   (ie the middle test in the dialogue is orange exclamation).  You will also see that this (second test) is a problem even if you do not   trust the certificate. Then you will of course get the yellow triangle   because now also the first test has a yellow exclamation.    When looking at the same web site  only changed to port 443 it works.    <b>Please provide
