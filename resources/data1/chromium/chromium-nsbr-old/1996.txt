<title>Issue 1996 -   chromium -    Picasa Feature available in Firefox  but not in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This feedback is about a feature that is present in Picasa when using  Firefox  but is absent from Picasa when using Chrome.    If a picasa user sends you a web album and it is available for Downloading   there is a button/dropdown on the album view page of picasa that says  &quot;Download&quot;.  This button is missing when opening the same album from Chrome.    I am using Picasa 2.7 on a Windows machine.    </pre>
