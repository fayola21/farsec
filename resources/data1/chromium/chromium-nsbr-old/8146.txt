<title>Issue 8146 -   chromium -    Clip transparency bitmaps to the screen when practical - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The patch I'm going to soon submit to <a title="Cleartype text not rendered correctly with opacity applied" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=559"> issue 559 </a> can potentially crate large   bitmaps. In some cases  we should be able to clip the bitmaps to the screen   to reduce the size of the allocation.    This will make us less likely to hit the failure case identified in <a title="Handle allocation failure in TransparencyWin" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8145"> issue   8145 </a>. </pre>
