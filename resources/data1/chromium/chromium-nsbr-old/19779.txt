<title>Issue 19779 -   chromium -    Single client sync tests should not be in the &quot;TwoClient&quot; sync test  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a bunch of tests with &quot;SC&quot; in their name as part of the   TwoClientLiveBookmarkSyncTest.  These should either be in the single-client   file  or if you want to keep them in the same file separate them into a   separate test class.  This is more standard  orderly  and easier to follow   when examining test output than categorizing by random prefix of the test   name. </pre>
