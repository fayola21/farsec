<title>Issue 4278 -   chromium -    Some options in the 3rd parameter of javascript method &quot;window.open&quot; don't take effect in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.16             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK      I found this problem when I was creating a reduction  when using javascript   method window.open  some options of the 3rd parameter like &quot;menubar=1&quot;    &quot;toolbar=1&quot; seem not take effect in Chrome.    The questions is  is it possible to display the menus of Chrome(the two   menus on right of omnibox) in the pop-up window when setting &quot;menubar=1&quot;   and &quot;toolbar=1&quot; in window.open? As they are working in Firefox and Safari.   In IE  window.open always opens the pop-up in a new tab  so it doesn't have   the same problem.     See attachment for a demonstration:     </pre>
