<title>Issue 2629 -   chromium -    Customize you news in news.google.ca does not update with drag and drop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to news.google.ca with an existing account with existing customizations.  2. Add a new category.  3. Try to drag and drop the category to another place in the layout.  4. My experience was that it moves and stays  but returns to the end when  new layout is saved.  5. Tried same procedure in FF and it performed as expected  new layout  saves with the category where you dragged it.                Please provide
