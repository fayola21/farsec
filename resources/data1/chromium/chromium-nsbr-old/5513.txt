<title>Issue 5513 -   chromium -    Compilation Dependency Error on Open Suse 11.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.155.0        When you compile on OpenSuse 11.0 you have problem with ICU version.  The src/ tree requires ICU sources under CHROMIUM_ROOT/src/third_party/icu38    OpenSuse 11.0 support ICU 3.8.1 and also the Chromium build tree seems to  need this version (see the name icu38).    common/time_format.cc requires headers unicode/plurfmt.h and  unicode/plurrule.h that belongs to ICU 4.0    Chromium On Line documentation doesn't specify the ICU version to have.   </pre>
