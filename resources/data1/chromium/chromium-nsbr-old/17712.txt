<title>Issue 17712 -   chromium -    Regression: Draggin Tab animation different then windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0~svn20090724r21527-0ubuntu1~ucd2~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : compiz      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Works correctly      1. Open two or more tabs in chromium  2. Drag a tab over the another tab.  You will see animation which moves   tab over  3. Release the dragged tab to reposition it.      You should see animation which shows the dragged tab moves to its new   location.      You see the dragged tab move to its original position and then back to   its new position.  This seems little &quot;weired&quot; and does not seem as smooth   as old behavior  which is what window does.   </pre>
