<title>Issue 17559 -   chromium -    Button apears above chromium window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 0)  URLs (if applicable) : All  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    This is a problem with the browser  and not display of webpages. This   happens when you go to a webpage  doesn't matter which one  but it doesn't   happen all of the time.    What happens is when you go to a website  sometimes  something that looks   like a stubby button appears near the center of the screen. If you put your   mouse over it  it immediately moves down and to the right. If you move your   mouse over it a few times it will go away  or it will move off the screen   as it moves when you mouse-over it. </pre>
