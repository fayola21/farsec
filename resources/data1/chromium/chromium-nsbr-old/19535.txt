<title>Issue 19535 -   chromium -    With an non-ASCII character in the CL description  gcl barks out on Linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux:    1. gcl change foo  2. Put some non-ASCII characters in the description (save the result in UTF-8).  3. gcl change foo    # once more     Expected result: my editor pops up with the description in the buffer.     Actual: exception: ASCII codec cannot blah blah...    I have a two-line fix and worked fine on Linux (adding 'encode(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)' and 'decode(&quot;UTF-  8&quot;)' in Change() ). I wonder why this hasn't been an issue on Windows (I've had multiple   CLs with non-ASCII characters in their descriptions on Windows).        </pre>
