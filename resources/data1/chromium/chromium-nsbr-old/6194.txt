<title>Issue 6194 -   chromium -    Form widgets not the correct size or position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;2.0.156.1&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open Chrome  2. Navigate to above URL  3. Note the offset of the button due to its size versus IE/Firefox/Safari      Form buttons should have padding around the text and should have some space   between elements.      Chrome currently has no additional padding and sizes buttons based on font   size.  Could be related to the orange border taking up the space between   the bottom of the form text field and the form buttons as well. </pre>
