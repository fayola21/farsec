<title>Issue 16648 -   chromium -    Background tabs opened from Google Reader auto-close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit Google Reader and middle click the gray  circular &quot;chevron&quot; image to   the right of a post's title.  For me  a background tab opens and then quickly   closes again (!).  Dragging from the chevron to the tab strip (which opens as   a foreground tab) works fine.    Not sure what other places this can affect. </pre>
