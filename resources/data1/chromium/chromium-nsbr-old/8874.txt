<title>Issue 8874 -   chromium -    Start menu bloat - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Currently  on installing Chrome inserts its own folder and an uninstall   link into the start menu. This is unnecessary and adds an extra click for   everyday use (except of course for people with more prominent shortcuts).   Safari and IE have just a single icon  and Firefox only has a folder for   its &quot;safe mode option&quot;. I think Chrome should do likewise. Uninstall can be   accessed from the Control Panel just like all other software. </pre>
