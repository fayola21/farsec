<title>Issue 9300 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Must click twice on buttons and checkboxes in browser UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12458)    This appears to affect (possibly) every button and checkbox in the browser UI.    This is a regression.  Will try to narrow down when the regression took place.    Example repro:    1. Wrench Menu &gt; Clear browsing data to bring up dialog.  2. Click on a checkbox to toggle checkmark.  3. Checkmark is not toggled  but but checkmark gets keyboard focus (as  indicated by dotted rectangle).  4. Click on checkbox again.  5. Checkmark state is now toggled  and will continue to work OK as long as  this checkbox has focus.    What is the expected output?     Checkmark should be toggled upon first click.    What do you see instead?    Must click twice to toggle checkmark.  Buttons display similar behavior.   </pre>
