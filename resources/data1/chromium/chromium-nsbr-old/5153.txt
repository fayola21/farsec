<title>Issue 5153 -   chromium -    Request: Extract links (from text selection) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello  Please provide a way for extracting all the real addresses (links) from a   page selection.  This would be specially useful for extracting links from forum/blog posts    when people post large files separated in several RAR files.  My guess it that it could be a functionality of the Developer menu  and   extracted the links as plain text to the clipboard.  Thank you </pre>
