Do tabbing on &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; to get keyboard focus on &quot;Cancel&quot;   button  2. Hit return Key on the button.    What is the expected output?   Should cancel the dialog.    What do you see instead?  Clears the data.    Bumping this to P1  as we are doing unwanted activity.       </pre>
