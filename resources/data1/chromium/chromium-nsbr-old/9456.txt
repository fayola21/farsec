<title>Issue 9456 -   chromium -    Twiki page editing control - inserted text overwrites existing text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)  URLs (if applicable) : twiki.org (download a version)          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Open any Twiki page  2. Click to edit  3. In the main text box  try to freely edit the page and insert text in the   middle of an existing line.        Normal text box behavior - inserted text moves existing text to the right.        Inserted text overwrites existing text. You see text disappearing as you   type.    When pressing Ctrl+A  the hidden text is revealed  because the control is   repainted to show the entire text selected.   </pre>
