<title>Issue 5650 -   chromium -    FilePath::IsPathAbsolute vs. file_util::AbsolutePath - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like we have two definitions of absolute paths.  IsPathAbsolute   only verifies that the start of the path is at the root  whereas   AbsolutePath not only roots the path  but also flattens all &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;   path components.  I think the latter one is correct.  As far as I've seen    this is the meaning of the term in other APIs and toolkits.  People often   use these functions as a way of testing for path equality and also for   verifying path containment.   </pre>
