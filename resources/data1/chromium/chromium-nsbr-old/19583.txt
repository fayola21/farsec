<title>Issue 19583 -   chromium -    Card DO change their width  ever with a hoovering mouse arrow over them. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	3.0.195.6 (Oficjalna wersja 22526)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.6 Safari/532.0    I don't know what's the English name for what I'll refer to as cards and   card-bar - I mean the topmost row in which browser diplays all opened   windowpages.    Before updating Chrome to the version 3.0.195.6  it kept constant width of   cards as long as mouse arrow was over the cards-bar. It allowed for easy   closing of many cards  because the cards didn't change their width or   position. Now they do.     </pre>
