<title>Issue 18135 -   chromium -    Buttons not showing up on GTK+ theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Can't repro on my work machine. May be a 9.04 thing.    The buttons reappear if I mouse over them. Only happens with Human or Human-  Clearlooks GTK themes. The non-GTK default theme is fine.    See screenshot    Assigning to erg@chromium.org since you worked on the GTK themes. </pre>
