<title>Issue 18826 -   chromium -    Customizing the favicon of a bookmark. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39    Bug: Can't change the image of the favicon.     In the &quot;edit bookmark&quot; menu there isn't an option to change or assign an   image or custom icon of your choice to the bookmark.    I prefer to have favicons on my bookmarks without written text as I can fit   more on the bar. Its also easier and quicker to identify a bookmark via   image than reading.     The problem arises when bookmarking multiple pages of a website or websites   which don't have favicons resulting in chrome displaying the default white   page icon needing text to be added to identify it. </pre>
