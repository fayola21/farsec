<title>Issue 3825 -   chromium -    Closing chrome while hung creates zombie processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chrome  2. Browse to the front page of www.youtube.com  3. Open process explorer and suspend (right click / suspend) the plugin   process  4. Try to close the main chrome window.        The window should be hung  a dialog should be displayed saying that it's   hung and asking if we want to kill it. (A chrome dialog would be great  but   the Windows dialogs is better than nothing).      What I am seeing is the main window going away  and creating zombie   processes. If I try to restart chrome  chrome does not come back correctly.      Note:  With a previous build (154.6 for example)  you can trigger the Microsoft   hung window dialog by right clicking the task bar item and selecting   &quot;Close&quot;. </pre>
