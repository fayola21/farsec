<title>Issue 17767 -   chromium -    Opening webpage outside browser doesn't bring browser to foreground - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> First off  apologies if this is already reported: I simply have no idea   what keyword to search for to see if it has been.    Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21222">r21222</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  window manager : Gnome  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Brings browser to foreground  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Unknown      1. Set Chrome to default browser  2. Click a URL on an outside application (e.g.  http URL on Pidgin  or an   HTML file on the desktop)      Page is opened  Chrome comes to foreground      Page is opened  but one must navigate to Chrome  which is in the   background  in order to view the page.    No backtrace information available  screenshot seems unnecessary.   </pre>
