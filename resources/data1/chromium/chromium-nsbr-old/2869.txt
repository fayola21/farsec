<title>Issue 2869 -   chromium -    History page needs to be collapsable/expandable by date/day and website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a       Safari 3  - OK     Firefox 3 - OK     IE 7      - OK     Opera 9   - OK    The History page needs to display a tree/hierarchy view where each date/day   is clickable and all history pages for that day will either collapse away   or expand out.  As well  it must provide the option to list according to   time visited in that day  or grouped together by site.    This feature is just plain required history management.  All the other   major browsers provide this.  It is absolutely unreasonable that the   History page gets longer and longer as more pages are viewed and more days   are stored.  A collapsable/expandable tree view is crucially necessary.    Yes  you can filter by searching  but _searching is NOT the answer to   everything_.  In cases where you don't remember any keywords  or don't know   the term to find  or want to find a site but only remember you went to it   yesterday  etc. searching is not able to help.    Actually  that brings up a point: can the History page search for a date   and show me all the pages that were browsed during that day?  That is a   crucial search criteria.    Regardless  a collapsable/expandable tree view for the History page is   required. </pre>
