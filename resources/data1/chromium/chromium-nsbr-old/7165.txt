<title>Issue 7165 -   chromium -    Esc on drag and drop cancels the dropping of the tab and also Find-In box. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1298451&gt;    Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8817)    --Open two tabs and navigate to google.com and yahoo.com  --Ctrl + F to Find-In box in yahoo tab.  --Drag out and hold yahoo tab. While transparent image shows up  hit 'Esc'  to cancel the dragging.      One small issue is  I lost my Find-In  box in yahoo tab. I want my find-in  box please :)    Imagine  if you are searching a very large page. For some reason  you  wanted to drag the tab into a new window  but wanted to cancel the dragging  in middle. In this case  you will miss all your find-in search status as  the find-in box is dismissed.   </pre>
