<title>Issue 20235 -   chromium -    Play button is still clickable when media element has errored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load an audio/video with an unsupported src (i.e.  a text file) with  default controls enabled  2. The element should appear &quot;disabled&quot;  3. Right click on the element  you should see a disabled &quot;Play&quot; option  4. Click the play button      You can't tell visually  but the element receives the click and calls  play().  If you right click on the element  you'll notice that &quot;Play&quot; is  now &quot;Pause&quot; :)    We should ignore all user-input to the element if it is disabled. </pre>
