<title>Issue 4426 -   chromium -    Nested &lt;q&gt; tags not rendered as nested quotes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.18             Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Display HTML page with nested &lt;q&gt; tags  e.g. &quot;He said  &lt;q&gt;I said    &lt;q&gt;Meh.&lt;/q&gt; And then I stopped.&lt;/q&gt; And then he stopped.&quot;      Nested &lt;q&gt; tags are rendered as nested quotes. For example  the snippet   above would have been rendered in Firefox as: He said  ��_��_��_I said  ��_��_��_Meh.��_��_��_ And   then I stopped.��_��_��_ And then he stopped.      Chrome renders the snippet as: He said  &quot;I said  &quot;Meh.&quot; And then I   stopped.&quot; And then he stopped.     </pre>
