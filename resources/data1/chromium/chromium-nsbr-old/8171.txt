<title>Issue 8171 -   chromium -    Regression: History and download page should refresh immediately after clear browsing data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open History tab and Download tab  click on Wrench/Clear browsing data          I expect that the open tabs of history (downloads and browsing history)   would be &quot;cleared/refreshed&quot; after running Wrench/Clear browsing data..  It's the only natural step to expect really.      All history remains until close/reopening the tabs    Please provide
