<title>Issue 523 -   chromium -    Show source after POST command isn't what you expected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Do a POST action which result in different content  but the url stays   the same.  2. View Source(Ctrl+U).        A exact code(html) representation of what you see in your tab.      It shows the code of the page where you pushed the 'POST button'  but not   the code of the page were you are at that moment.    I understand why  because a new tab opens with: 'view-source: url...'. So   the POST command isn't executed again. A option for 'show real source' is   desirable.   </pre>
