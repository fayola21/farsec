<title>Issue 283 -   chromium -    Print dialogue lags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Press Ctrl-P          IE 7 takes about 1-2 seconds to load the print dialogue box  i would expect   a similar result to this.      It may be different on other pc's  however  the chrome dialogue box takes   3-5 seconds and nearly hangs. This is from just testing on the google   homepage which has limited information to print.    Please provide
