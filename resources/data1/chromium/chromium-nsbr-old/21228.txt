<title>Issue 21228 -   chromium -    Some menu item texts don't match the text the rest of OS X uses  other menu item text tweaks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1  10.5.8    SysPrefs-&gt;Keyboard shortcuts has functionality to bind keyboard shortcuts   to menu items  and the menu items are identified by text. For this reason   (and for general consistency)  Chrome/Mac's menu item texts should   match the rest of the system.    Examples:    View-&gt;(Make Text Bigger  Make Text Default  Make Text Smaller) should   be View-&gt;(Zoom In  Actual Size  Zoom Out)  (and the order should be   &quot;Actual Size  Zoom In  Zoom Out&quot; to match the rest of the system  though   that part is less important).    Window-&gt;(Next Tab  Previous Tab) should be Window-&gt;(Select Next Tab    Select Previous Tab)    View-&gt;Reload should arguably be View-&gt;Reload Page (matches Safari and   Camino)    (Bookmarks-&gt;Bookmark Current Page is Bookmarks-&gt;Add Bookmark in   Safari  but &quot;Bookmark Current Page&quot; is clearer and what Camino uses  and   Firefox uses something else  so there's not much consensus on this item   anyway -- so don't change it)    Other tweaks:    File-&gt;Open Locations��_��__ should be File-&gt;Open Location��_��__ (only one   location being opened)    File-&gt;Open Recent should be removed  it's pretty much useless.    File-&gt;Reopen Closed Tabs��_��__ should be File-&gt;Reopen Closed TAb��_��__  as in   95% of all cases  this reopens a single tab. And two people I know have   been confused by the plural.     </pre>
