<title>Issue 572 -   chromium -    SSPI authentication for Windows-based networks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Our proxy and corporate servers all use SSPI for authentication. The lack   of SSPI support means that for every new internal server and every time   Google Chrome is restarted I need to re-enter my login and password. With   Firefox I can enable SSPI authentication via about:config  Google Chrome   should support it somehow too. </pre>
