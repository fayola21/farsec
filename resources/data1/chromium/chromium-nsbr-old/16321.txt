<title>Issue 16321 -   chromium -    Buildbot for ARM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome can build for ARM by setting target_arch=arm.  It can cross compile   by also setting v8_use_snapshot=false. eg:    ./tools/gyp/gyp build/all.gyp -Dv8_use_snapshot=false -Dtarget_arch=arm -f   make    Setting environment variables for the build tools (CC  CXX  etc) to your   cross compiler is sufficient for cross compiling.  I used packages from   Ubuntu's ARM port to link against.    It would be good to have a buildbot to keep this in a working state.    Other notes:    One other work around when building for armv5 is necessary; compiling   icu38/source/i18n/rematch.cpp with gcc 4.3.2 causes an ICE.  This can be   worked around by changing from -O2 to -Os  as I did with the attached   patch.  This effects the entire icui18n target so might not be a long term   solution.    Building with -mthumb works fine for armv5  and produces a binary that is   ~25% smaller (20MB) when stripped.    There are other ICE's in gcc 4.3 when attempting to build for armv7 and   thumb. </pre>
