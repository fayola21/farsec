<title>Issue 2017 -   chromium -    Richtext box doesnt display text at beggining of line if its a long word carried down from next line. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I get a error when typing on a rich text box.  I think it might only be for   phpbb as the error does not occur here.  To reproduce i simply type a long   word at the end of a line and i get the results in the screen shot.    Also  as an aside  could you please add a &quot;are you sure you want to close   multiple tabs?&quot; message box when clicking the cross.  Too many times have i   closed 5 tabs by accident.  Sorry to post this here but i could not find a   feature request submit page.    Thanks   Michael Pierce </pre>
