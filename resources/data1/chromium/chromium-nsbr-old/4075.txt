<title>Issue 4075 -   chromium -    Netilla WebTop slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4585)    Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.0  IE 6          Firefox 3: OK        1. Login on a Netilla WebTop site ( Remote access )  2. The loading times are MUCH slower than that of IE 6 and FF3    I cant give login information for security reasons  so could prove hard for   you to test this.    It seems to be a general problem with remote access clients (java ones) in   Chromium - they are generally slower than in IE and FF  Aventail is another   example ( see issue id: 1591 )  </pre>
