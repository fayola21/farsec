<title>Issue 20050 -   chromium -    More magic for Linux omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From brettw:    &quot;I think the following behavior would make me happy 99% of the time  but   might be unpredictable the other 1%. It uses a heuristic of whether the   current URL is loaded or not to determine what to do on middle click. Left   click would always select all:    &quot;- Middle click in the UR when the the &quot;current&quot; loaded URL is displayed   replaces the URL with the current selection. This solves the case when I   want to paste a new URL in.    &quot;- Middle click in the URL when you've edited the URL  inserts the   selection at the clicked point. This solves the case where I'm pasting in   multiple parts of a URL (happens actually pretty often to me since I use a   terminal-based IRC). I can middle click on the end to append more parts.&quot;    I think we should try this. </pre>
