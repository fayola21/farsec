<title>Issue 11365 -   chromium -    Google translate: Translation bubble offset by scroll amount - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 2.0.178.0 (Developer Build 15144)    See <a title="In Google Translate  the balloon does not appear." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10697"> issue 10697 </a>  which fixed Chromium so that the translation bubble   appears.    Visit this URL:  <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?">http://translate.google.com/translate?</a>  u=<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail%3Fid%3D10697&amp;hl=en&amp;langpa">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail%3Fid%3D10697&amp;hl=en&amp;langpa</a>  ir=auto|zh-CN&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8    Scroll down the page and hover over some text in Chinese.    Note that the translation bubble showing the text in English is offset too   high (by the amount the page is scrolled). The bubble won't even show if   you scroll too far down.    Works fine in Safari 4.0 Beta (though I haven't tried with a WebKit   nightly).   </pre>
