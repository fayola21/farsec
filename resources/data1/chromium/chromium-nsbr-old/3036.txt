<title>Issue 3036 -   chromium -    Transformed objects sometimes leave turds if they are moved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example  see this page:  <a href="http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/css-animation/">http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/css-animation/</a>  There is a demo on animating  and that red square doesn't always erase   properly when you hover over it and it moves.    This is pretty consistent across different demos. It turns out  we're not   rounding the bounding boxes properly in AffineTransformSkia (we're supposed   to round out  not to nearest in mapRect(). </pre>
