<title>Issue 10280 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/inline/dirtyLinesForInline.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   This test has hover effects that change the font size. This test also  moves the mouse around  resulting in a layout that dances around.  Depending upon when the snapshot is taken we get different results.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  SVG TESTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------   DEFER WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/fast/inline/dirtyLinesForInline.html = FAIL PASS   (Automatically generated from line 645 to line 653 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
