<title>Issue 7639 -   chromium -    Language options dropdown in spell checker is truncated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium version 2.0.163.0 (9655)      1. Go to options &gt; minor tweaks &gt; Change font and language settings &gt;   languages     What is the expected output?       What do you see instead?
