<title>Issue 21311 -   chromium -    ClientSocket::IsConnected() is inappropriately named - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  ClientSocket::IsConnected() has the semantic that if the peer has   shutdown() writes on its side of the socket (the TCP connection is half-  closed)  then ClientSocket::IsConnected() will return false.  This is wrong    because the send side of the ClientSocket has not been shutdown() yet.  This   led to <a title="REGRESSION: [ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo]: FTP downloads are broken" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21127"> issue 21127 </a>.    We should rename most/all existing uses of ClientSocket::IsConnected() to   another name.  ClientSocket::IsConnected() should return false if the the   client has never Connect()'d the socket  or has already called Disconnect()   on it. </pre>
