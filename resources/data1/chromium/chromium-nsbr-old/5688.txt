<title>Issue 5688 -   chromium -    Too many resource requests by renderer can cause memory exhaustion and eventual browser crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run attached test in the browser  2. Stop after a few runs (give it a few minutes)        After stopping the test  all requests should be canceled and the activity   stop. Instead  the browser keeps trying to querying WinHTTP PAC  which can   be observed by looking at the task manager and recurring &quot;Resolving proxy   ...&quot; status changes.    As Darin suggested  the solution could be putting a queue in front of the   WinHTTP PAC  so that we can clear it upon request cancellation.   </pre>
