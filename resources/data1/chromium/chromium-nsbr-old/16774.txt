<title>Issue 16774 -   chromium -    Need tool that detects layout test success  updates test_expectations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often  a layout test starts passing consistently but the test is still marked   as expected to fail/timeout/etc. in test_expectations.  Many tests end up   filling up test_expectations when we really should be expecting to pass them.    We should have a utility that detects if a test has passed for the last X   builds  and if so  remove it from the test_expectations expected failures.    This would help keep test_expectations to a minimum and have the builders   reflect regressions. </pre>
