<title>Issue 19421 -   chromium -    IMEs do not work well in the omnibox due to a race condition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Observed in 3.0.198.1 (and 196.x)    1. Go to the omnibox  2. Switch to the Korean 2-set KBD  3. Press the following key sequence in QWERTY:       gksrmf     Expected: '�Ǖ�_��_��' shows up in the omnibox    Actual: '�Ǖ�_' (the first syllable) is followed by '��_��-��_��__' (the sequence of letters   comprising '��_��'  the second syllable).     By pressing the backspace 3 times to delete the 3 letters and typing 'rmf'   again  I can type what I wanted to type. However  only the 1st syllable is   taken into account for 'suggestion' in the omnibox.      Moreover  after the second syllable is entered this round-about way    entering more syllables are even harder. Subsequent syllables show up not   only as decomposed but also the first letter of each syllable is lost. For   instance  when I type 'gksrmf' followed by 3 delete keys and 'rmfrmf'  I get   '�Ǖ�_��_�ѕ�_����_��__' instead of '�Ǖ�_��_�ѕ�_��' where '-��_��__' are the 2nd and the 3rd letters of   the syllable '��_��'.           </pre>
