<title>Issue 11145 -   chromium -    webkit frequently loses focus in mac chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a couple of cases where I hit this that make dogfooding hard:  -On page load (e.g. login forms don't get focus because webkit doesn't have  focus and tabbing into the page doesn't work  gmail doesn't have focus  onload  so key commands don't work)  -On doing any action in gmail  e.g.  click inbox and then type g+s to load  the starred items  click on a conversation and then type j/k to move to  another conversation  etc.    Marking as a P1 since it makes it really difficult to use mac Chrome as my  primary browser and I've heard others express the same sentiment. </pre>
