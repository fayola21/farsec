<title>Issue 656 -   chromium -    Suboptimal behavior for multi-tabbed webapps launched via desktop shortcuts (i.e. no browser controls) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : docs.google.com    When I launch Google Docs  or any other similar web app  as a Desktop  shortcut (i.e. no visible browser controls) and the application opens a new  window (when a user click on a document on google docs document list  for  example)  it opens a new tab in a standard browser window. It would be  better if the new tab were placed in the same &quot;chrome-less&quot; window where  the app is currently running  if the new tab has same domain.      1. Launch a Chrome Google Docs desktop shortcut  2. Login to Google Docs  3. Click on a document on the list      The document is shown in the same window (&quot;chrome-less&quot;)  as a new tab.      The tab goes to another regular browser window.   </pre>
