<title>Issue 13324 -   chromium -    viewing a big svg file is problematic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28    Dear Chromium team   Thank you for your great browser.  I report my feature request in this ticket.    Have a nice day!    Adrien.        1. Load a big SVG file (several screen width/height)        There is no scroll-bar. This is problematic to scroll  as the &quot;Middle-Click&quot;+Drag is not   very precise.      Showing a scrollbar would be great.       </pre>
