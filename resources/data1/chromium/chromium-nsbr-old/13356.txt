<title>Issue 13356 -   chromium -    Test MassiveConcurrentLookupTest in dns_master_unittest.cc is DISABLED - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test was an attempt to stress test the DNS pre-resolution system.  The current version of DnsMaster includes congestion detection  which then  causes &quot;stressful&quot; prefetches to be discarded.  I need to decide what I   want to test given the newer functionality  and implement it in the place   of the current test. </pre>
