<title>Issue 19744 -   chromium -    &quot;Default search&quot; setting in Preferences. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.0 (203.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7            1. Go to Chromium - Preferences - Basics tab. Select the &quot;Default search&quot;   dropdown box  and choose a search engine. Notice how it starts filling in   information from other web sites (possibly the ones that are listed on the   &quot;New Tab page&quot;          The expected result is to allow one to change/configure the default search   engine.      It adds entries to the dropdown box and chooses them instead. They   appear to be sites from the &quot;New Tab Page&quot; or from history. Been going on   for a couple days now. It breaks the search engine option completely. </pre>
