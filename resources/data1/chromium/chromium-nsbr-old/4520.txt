<title>Issue 4520 -   chromium -    Keyword addition should check keywords case-insensitively  since keyword editing does - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.22(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5545">r5545</a>)  This looks like bizarre for me.    -add a keyword 'g' for google.com search engine (case sensitive is important)  -add keyword 'G' for another search engine say yahoo.com (-deto-)    At this time  it accepts both of the above keywords.    Now try edit to keyword for Google.com search engine.    Surprisingly  you will notice &quot;Ok&quot; button is disabled in &quot;Edit Search  Engine&quot; dialog with keyword 'g'.    It is clear that at the time of entering keywords  we are treating existing  keywords with different case  as new keywords.     Would be nice  if we make keyword case insensitive at the time of creating  them itself.       </pre>
