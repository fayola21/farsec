<title>Issue 13625 -   chromium -    hover effects on table rows extremely laggy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570) // Mozilla/5.0  (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko)  Chrome/3.0.183.1 Safari/531.0         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK (3.5 with -moz-box-shadow)           IE 7: n/a           IE 8: n/a      1. Open the attached testcase  2. Hover the rows really fast      The rows should change color without delay.      The :hover effect is greatly delayed and makes the browser lag      Looks like it doesn't matter how deeply nested the :hovers are  being  contained in a box-shadow is enough to make it lag. Safari reportedly  doesn't have this issue  although I couldn't test myself.    Larger objects make the lag a lot more apparent (increase the width to  1000% and see for yourself) </pre>
