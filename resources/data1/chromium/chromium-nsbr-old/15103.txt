<title>Issue 15103 -   chromium -    RTL new new tab: The info-bubble is not RTL correctly after click the &quot;X&quot; button on thumbnail  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19059)     OS: Any    Other Browsers:         Webkit: N/A  Firefox3.0.11: N/A            IE8: N/A    Steps:  1. Run Hebrew Chrome with --new-new-tab-page  2. Hover the mouse on the thumbnail on the new new tab  3. Click the &quot;X&quot; button now  4. Observe the info-bubble popped up    Result:  The info-bubble is not RTL correctly  for example:    1. The punctuation dot or ellipsis is showing at the begging of the   sentence  2. The Undo link is showing at the rightmost     Expected:  The info-bubble should be RTL correctly:    For result #1  the message is not translated yet  I am not sure if the   issue will go away once the translations come back  For result #2: the Undo link should be at leftmost for RTL Chrome </pre>
