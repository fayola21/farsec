<title>Issue 6485 -   chromium -    RTL: Tab titles not ellided correctly in case of RTL text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was sure there was a bug on file for this  but I couldn't find one  so:      1. Navigate to www.ynet.co.il      If the tab title is in an RTL language  it should be truncated RTL  (ellipses should appear on the left).    Actual result:  Tab title is truncated LTR (see attached screenshot)    For me this is the most visible bug related to RTL. </pre>
