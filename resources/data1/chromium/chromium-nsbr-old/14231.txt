<title>Issue 14231 -   chromium -    URLRequestHttpJob deletes URLRequestContext before HttpNetworkTransaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This can result in HttpNetworkTransaction having a dangling reference to an   already deleted ClientSocketPool.  This can happen quite often in test code    but is unlikely to happen in actual use  except possibly during shutdown. </pre>
