<title>Issue 4093 -   chromium -    Save page as does not always give &quot;Web Page  Complete&quot; option. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm making the assumption that &quot;Web Page  Complete&quot; should always be an   option when saving a page's resources.    I'm making this assumption based on the observation that in the previous   beta channel version  I was able to do a &quot;Web Page  Complete&quot; save of   www.nytimes.com  and now I am not.    On the trunk  all pages checked give the option to save &quot;Web Page    Complete&quot; as expected.      1. visit <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> with the beta version 0.3.154.9  2. page -&gt; Save page as...  3. note that the only option given is to save as html           </pre>
