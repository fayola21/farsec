<title>Issue 21232 -   chromium -    In navigator.userAgent the localization should be the chosen localization of the user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: FAIL (they put it in an other variable that only works on   IE)      1. execute an alert in javascript that displays the navigator.userAgent   string  2. notice that it always is 'en-US'  3. it should be the first of the preferred languages OR the language of   Chrome's interface (I guess they are most of the time the same).    for example: my userAgent string is  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML    like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.206.1 Safari/532.0  but my language is nl-NL (dutch) </pre>
