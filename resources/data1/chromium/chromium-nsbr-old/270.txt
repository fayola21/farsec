<title>Issue 270 -   chromium -    EXCESSIVE disk thrashing when browser is in background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Leaving the browser open in the background while using other   applications. The disk thrashing happens after a few seconds.            Garbage collection and process optimization shouldn't use the disk that   much.        Disk I/O starts up after a bit  and becomes so excessive that the system   becomes non-responsive temporarily.  I have a hardware RAID 5 with   extremely fast random writes  and the thrashing is so bad that even it   can't keep up for Windows to service other system requests. The problem   disappears immediately if Chrome is brought into focus  or if Chrome is   closed.      Please provide
