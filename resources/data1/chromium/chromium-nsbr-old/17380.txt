<title>Issue 17380 -   chromium -    app startup lets the menubar draw before we have localization support active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> app_controler_mac manually runs the localizer on the main menu.  This is too   late  and results in a flash of the menubar unlocalized first.  We can't put the   localizer into the nib file because it will try to do its work before the we've   started up enough of the browser.    we need to circle back to this  put in the localization markers on the titles and   see if we can get things startup up slightly earlier so we can fetch localized   strings during startup awakeFromNib on the main menu.    footnote: when we get to app shortcuts  we might want to revisit how we   handle the menubar in general  and start it up with a minimal app menu  and   then load in the rest of the menus from the main bundle  that could solve this   ordering problem also. </pre>
