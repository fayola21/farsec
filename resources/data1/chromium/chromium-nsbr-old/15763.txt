<title>Issue 15763 -   chromium -    Salesforce HTML email &amp; dynamic tracking blocks Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try to use the HTML email / dynamic tracking feature of Salesforce  2. Salesforce asks you to upgrade to IE 6.    This seems like an evangelism case.  We should reach out to Salesforce and   ask them to unblock/detect Chrome correctly.   </pre>
