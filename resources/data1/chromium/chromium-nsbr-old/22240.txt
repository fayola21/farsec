<title>Issue 22240 -   chromium -    Do ligature substitution on web content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (26435)  OS + version : Linux   CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome    Behavior in Firefox 3.x    What is the expected result?:    Firefox automatically substitutes certain character combinations  by their ligatures. For example &quot;fl&quot; is automatically rendered  as the fl ligature of the font (fi-&gt;fi-ligature  ffl  ffi  ...).        No ligatures are rendered with Chrome.          I have attached two screenshots from the Atlantic website.  Notice how all ligatures are nicely rendered in Firefox;  the letter-spacing is also much better in general. </pre>
