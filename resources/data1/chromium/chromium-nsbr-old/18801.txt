<title>Issue 18801 -   chromium -    &quot;Next Tab&quot; Keyboard Shortcut not Working when text field has focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (Mac)      1. Use the shortcut.  2. Nothing happens.        The expected result is that the screen flips to the next tab.        Nothing happens unless you go into the &quot;Window&quot; menu and physically   click &quot;Next Tab&quot;.   </pre>
