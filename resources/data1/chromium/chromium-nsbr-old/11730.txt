<title>Issue 11730 -   chromium -    Vertical scroll incomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.8 (Official Build 14017)  URLs (if applicable) : any  eg. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/</a>  Other browsers tested: --      1. Load any web page with sufficient amount of content (about 5-10   PageDowns to reach the end of the document; if needed resize browser window   to make scrollbar &quot;longer&quot;)  2. Scroll down anywhere  3. Grab the scrollbar handler with the mouse and scroll all the way up      The page should scroll all the way up      With probability about 15%-20% scroll handler reaches the top of the bar   whereas the document does not scroll all the way up. The amount of clipped   content depends is proportional to ratio between length of the document and   height of the viewport.  You can still click the &quot;^&quot; button on scrollbar or   press &quot;Home&quot; / &quot;PgUp&quot; key to reach the top  however the point is that   scrollbar handler doesn't behave properly.  Note that this bug does not happen every time  you might have to nudge the   scrollbar several times in order to see it.      Attach a screenshot if possible. </pre>
