<title>Issue 8772 -   chromium -    Font fallback bug causes fast/text/cg-fallback-bolding.html to fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout test fast/text/cg-fallback-bolding.html is failing on the linux  builder.  This happens if you run fast/regex/test4.html before you run  fast/text/cg-fallback-bolding.html.  This has to do with how the font is  getting selected for the hebrew glyph.  What should happen is that we  fallback to the default font for the font family  but some times we  fallback to a different font (last loaded?).    A simpler test case is attached (the two glyphs should be different because  the current fallback font is arial).  If you switch the order of the  glyphs  you get a different result for the glyph which tries to use the  Ahem font.    I give up on finding where we go wrong. </pre>
