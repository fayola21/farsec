<title>Issue 16485 -   chromium -    Need stored password browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the &quot;Show Saved Passwords&quot; button just opens Keychain Access.   For a variety of reasons relating to the metadata we store on the side and how   we use it  we should probably have our own UI for browsing and removing   entries like what exists in Windows.    The first part of this is the backend support for building the list  then we can   wire up some UI. </pre>
