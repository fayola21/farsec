Scroll down and up with the arrow keys      The text of the comment zone displaying correctly.      When you scroll down and up  the following happens:   - Mouse wheel: the text in the comment area disappears.   - PgUp/PgDn: the text in the comment area disappears.   - Arrows in the scroll bar: the text shows correctly.   - Arrow keys: the text shows correctly.    When the text disappears  eventually some lines of text appear randomly.  IIRC this bug appeared recently  since some weeks ago the site showed correctly for me. </pre>
