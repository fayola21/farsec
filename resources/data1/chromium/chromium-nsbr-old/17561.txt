<title>Issue 17561 -   chromium -    Tab doesn't have response in click close button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Sometimes the tag crash for any reason  and I click the button close   several times and it does not close shut. Hence I have to go to task   manager in Google Chrome and close the process.   It would be better  when the tab was with these problems  we automatically   clicked on the tab icon close end the process without the need to go in the   Task Manager?      Fix close process          <b>Please provide
