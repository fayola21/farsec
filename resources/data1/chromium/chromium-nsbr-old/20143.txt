<title>Issue 20143 -   chromium -    Delete journal files when deleting text databases for history. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we delete the indexed page data from history when you clear all  we   just delete the files.    If one of the files has a hot journal  there will be a second file. So if we   have &quot;History Index 2009-08&quot; there will also be &quot;History Index 2009-08-  journal.    Any associated journal file should also be deleted when we're deleting the   main index file. </pre>
