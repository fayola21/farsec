<title>Issue 8614 -   chromium -    Regression v 2.0.169.0: Salesforce customized button does not function anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Into SalesForce we handle cases.  2. Click on (customized button &quot;Edit TS Case&quot;)  3. Change the status of a case  4. Click on &quot;save&quot; but nothing happens.        The status of the SalesForce case should be saved and the screen should   change.        The screen stays on the &quot;edit case&quot; page  clicking on the button seems not   to work  if like the button is not clickable anymore.    Please provide
