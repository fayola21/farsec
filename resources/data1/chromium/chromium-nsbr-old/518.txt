<title>Issue 518 -   chromium -    Random lock-up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   There isn't a real reason I can indicate  which produces this problem. But   I believe these are part of it:  1. Have a couple tabs open.  2. Have atleast 1 flash movie playing  or a flash scene running        I expect the browser to just keep working without hitches.      Chrome freezes for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. After that Chrome just   works like it should. The browser or tabs don't crash  but the surfing   experience is really handicapped  becaus every 10 minutes or so you have to   wait a minute for Chrome to become unfrozen again.    Please provide
