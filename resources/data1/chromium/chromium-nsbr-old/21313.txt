<title>Issue 21313 -   chromium -    Color sync profiles seem to screw up colors in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.206.1 (Mac Chrome)      I can't reproduce it exactly.  It seems to have to do with creating windows on   one monitor vs. the other.    Screenshot attached.    If you need to followup with me or test anything out  you can email me at   roma@google.com. </pre>
