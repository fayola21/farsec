<title>Issue 22700 -   chromium -    Skia color alpha blending calculation is slightly different from other webkit libs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/fast/canvas/canvas-getImageData.html    The layout test fails because of skColor alpha blending calculation.    In skia  the original RGB is converted to skia color by extending the alpha   from 0-255 to 0-256  then returning the floor of RGB*Alpha:  third_partyskiaincludecoreSkColorPriv.h:  #define SkAlphaMul(value  alpha256)     (SkMulS16(value  alpha256) &gt;&gt; 8)    This seems different from other webkit libs that round (RGB*Alpha) to the   nearest integer value. The color difference caused by this probably can be   ignored in real world  but this layout test fails because of this tiny   difference.    This could also cause some other layout test failures. </pre>
