<title>Issue 7350 -   chromium -    Chrome: support postponed submit / page open / refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0        Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL    All web browsers have the same old problem: connection may be unstable (or   can be lost for minutes and even hours)  and most manipulations (open new   URL  submit form  refresh page) require user to be online.    However  a browser can easily detect that connection became available   again--and perform actions that failed earlier (due to connection lost):   submit form or open a new web page.    Compare it to email clients: in most of them  you can submit an email   letter from offline  and be sure that it will be sent to the server once   connection becomes available.    Google Gears is great  but it will take years to become integrated into   many websites--while this feature can be implemented relatively easily  and   doesn't require anything from web site owners.    To start with  manual &quot;Update tabs that failed to load/submit due to   connection lost&quot; command will do the job. </pre>
