<title>Issue 13911 -   chromium -    Searching in dropdown menus by typing not possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.187.0 (not sure because of the menu crashes in   this version)    <a href="http://www.motorola.com/governmentandenterprise/northamerica/en-">http://www.motorola.com/governmentandenterprise/northamerica/en-</a>  us/selectcountry.aspx        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://www.motorola.com/governmentandenterprise/northamerica/en-">http://www.motorola.com/governmentandenterprise/northamerica/en-</a>  us/selectcountry.aspx  2. Click the dropdown box  3. Type 'an' or 'net'      Andorra / Netherlands is selected      Only the first letter is registered  and Afghanistan / Namibia is selected.    There is another related problem  which occurs in 1 of the pages in my   website where (for example)  the entries 'Tammy'  'Tom' and 'TT' occur.   Typing 'T' selects not 'Tammy' as expected  but 'TT'. </pre>
