<title>Issue 22843 -   chromium -    Casing looks weird in the Text Encoding menu (View:Text Encoding) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Menu items like &quot;Western (macintosh)&quot; look wrong.  Mac menus use title case    and even if they didn't  Macintosh is a proper name and should not be   lowercased like this.    In fact  in cases where the items contain proper names like Macintosh and   Windows  maybe we should uppercase them on all platforms. </pre>
