<title>Issue 17581 -   chromium -    manifest missing from Debug builds of mini_installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It seems debug builds of mini_installer.exe do not contain the manifest that   is part of the project (mini_installer.exe.manifest). Because if this debug   build always tries to elevate on Vista even for user level installs.    I tried to find a fix in gyp file  but was in way over my head. </pre>
