<title>Issue 16223 -   chromium -    Font size of the tab title and URL bar doesn't respect Gnome's settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0~svn20090707r20021-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  window manager : Metacity (Gnome)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Also too big    Now that Chromium supports native Gtk themes on Linux  it would also be  nice to respect my Desktop's font settings for the titles of the tabs and  the URL bar.
