<title>Issue 17572 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: worker ui tests all fail in debug builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: worker ui tests all fail in debug builds    This appears to be a regression from merging to webkit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46270">r46270</a> from <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46229">r46229</a>.    David said I should just disable the tests and file a bug.  Here you go! </pre>
