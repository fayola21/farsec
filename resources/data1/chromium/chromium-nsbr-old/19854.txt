<title>Issue 19854 -   chromium -    &quot;/bin/sh: Argument list too long&quot; error in build on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23611">r23611</a>  v8 is <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2702">r2702</a> from &quot;bleeding_edge&quot;  OS + version : arch-linux current  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit    I followed the compilation steps listed at  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxChromium64">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxChromium64</a>   and encountered  the following make error:  AR+RANLIB  /home/dzwell/downloads/packages/chromium64/src/chromium/src/out/Debug/obj/webkit/libwebcore.a  make: execvp: /bin/sh: Argument list too long    The problem is the &quot;ar&quot; command:      cmd_alink = $(AR) rc $@ $(filter %.o $^) &amp;&amp; $(RANLIB) $@    A workaround is to build in a shorter directory  like /tmp/c. A more  technically correct solution would be to break this into multiple calls to  &quot;ar&quot;. The ranlib call isn't necessary if ar is invoked with &quot;rsc&quot; instead  of &quot;rc&quot;. </pre>
