<title>Issue 6132 -   chromium -    Strings in tables are displayed LTR when they should be RTL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1252245&gt;      1) open chrome  Hebrew UI  2) open a few tabs  3) open chrome task manager      Actual Result:  notice that the resource name (tab  plugin etc) incorrectly appears after   the title    Expected result:  Strings should be RTL  the resource name should appear at the very right.      Looks like if the tab title is pure Hebrew  it works fine.  But if the title is LTR text  the direction is wrong with mixed LTR title   and the Hebrew tab/plugin keyword. </pre>
