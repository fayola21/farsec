<title>Issue 22473 -   chromium -    Sign-in Error Message doesn't go away upon next try of Login on Sync Login Dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.211.4 (Official Build 26653)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.11  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.211.4 Safari/532.0      1. Start chrome with sync (--enable-sync flag) and try sign-in with invalid   credentials  2. Login dialog has 'Error Signing in' message.   3. Upon next try (even with valid credentials)   I see sync going through   various steps  but error message still stays on the dialog.    What is the expected output?   Upon next attempt of login  previous state should be gone. No error message   should be there on login dialog.    What do you see instead?  I see 'Error Signing in' message on login dialog which sticks around even   though I tried next time with valid credentials and I can see sync going   through various steps like 'setting up' but error stays there.
