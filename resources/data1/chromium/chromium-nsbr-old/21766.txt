<title>Issue 21766 -   chromium -    Suggestion: allow for a default window size like Chrome Apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Any    One of the feature of chrome is the tab snapping (when you move a tab to   the side of the screen or of a window). But one problem that arises from it   is that when you are done comparing stuff (meaning  putting the tabs side   to side) and close all the windows  next time you open them up  Chrome is   still only covering half the screen (or the bottom of the screen  ect).     So what I suggest is a default side like the Chrome Applications shortcuts.   My Gmail Chrome Application keeps it size no matter what  just like my   Pandora Chrome Application (I made it small so that I only see the actual   player  not the ads).     Just like that  I would like my actual Chrome to go back to my most used   size (unmaxed  in the middle of the screen  covering most but not all of   it).  </pre>
