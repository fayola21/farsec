<title>Issue 2713 -   chromium -    need to better acknowledge open source code in about box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the about box has an URL (which you can't click):    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=100336">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=100336</a>    It would be better if the about box text read a bit more thankful and   linked to an easier to read page along the lines of:    <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/terms.html">http://code.google.com/chromium/terms.html</a>    This page should also have a copyright column for the third party software. </pre>
