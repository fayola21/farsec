<title>Issue 6517 -   chromium -    Need text for multiple malware/phishing interstitial page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need new text for the safe browsing interstitial that reports multiple errors.  This page is shown when a page contains multiple resources which are malware and   or phishing.    The page lists for each flagged resource the type of threat (Phishing or   malware)  the URL  as well as a link to get a diagnostic and a link to report an   error (phishing only).    We need some text for all the following cases:  - multiple malware resources  - multiple phishing resources  - mixed of phishing and malware resources     </pre>
