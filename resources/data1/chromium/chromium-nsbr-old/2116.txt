Click on an external link (other TLD) in Google Reader  2. Open Task Manager -&gt; new tab runs in the same process group      A new process for the new domain.      The new domain runs in the same process as Reader.      Google Reader opens default all external links in a new tab (window). This   means that there are three ways of opening a link:  (1) just click -&gt; a new tab opens in the foreground  (2) middle click -&gt; a new tab opens in the background  (3) right click and 'open link in a new tab' -&gt; a new tab is opened in the   background    Options (1) and (2) run the new tab in the same process. Option (3) starts a   new process.  All three options should start a new process.    </pre>
