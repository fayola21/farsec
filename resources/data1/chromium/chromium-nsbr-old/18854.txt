<title>Issue 18854 -   chromium -    Chrome windows have no title in expose - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.12      1. Hit F9 to open expose  2. Move cursor over a chrome window        The title of the current tab should be displayed above the window  like with   every other app's windows.          No text is shown.      This is because we do not set a title on the browser window  because we   don't want cocoa to paint the window's title. Now that we draw the window   ourselves (because of themes)  we might be able to just set the title  which   would fix this issue. See workarounds in BrowserWindowCocoa::UpdateTitleBar(). </pre>
