<title>Issue 5958 -   chromium -    Incorrect maximized size on secondary displays under certain circumstances. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36             Safari 3: ?      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Maximize Chrome on a secondary display that has a different resolution  than the primary display and/or is displaying an application that reserves  desktop space on that display.          Chrome should maximize to fit into the working area of the secondary display.      Chrome seems to maximize to the size of the primary display  thereby  cutting off parts of chrome from view.      The application reserving desktop space on the secondary display in this  case is MultiMon's Taskbar. Chrome maximizes properly when no program is  reserving desktop space on the secondary display. A screenshot is attached. </pre>
