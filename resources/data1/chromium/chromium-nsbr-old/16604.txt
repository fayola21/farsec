<title>Issue 16604 -   chromium -    Voice browsing on chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The basic idea is that One should be able to say 'go back'  'search  xxxx'  'twitter'  'history' or 'search history for xxxx'. We can also  enable the navigation by the text appearing for link. So that ilnks  like 'inbox'  'compose mail' will start working automatically. We can  also support filling out any form by speech. The goal is one should be  able to browse the internet by folded hands and without having to  touch keyboard or mouse. To tell what you want is more intuitive than  clicking or typing.
