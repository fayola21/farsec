<title>Issue 20086 -   chromium -    Accesskey for location bar (Alt+D) should be localizable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   German      4.0.202.0 (Offizieller Build 23673)      WinXP SP2      Alt+D focuses the location bar  even though Windows Explorer uses Alt+S and   IE7/IE8 use Alt+E (since Alt+D is used to open the File/Datei menu).    As long as accesskeys are shared with web content (see <a title="No accesskeys for Chrome menus." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=906"> issue 906 </a> comment   #9)  Alt+E would actually be the better solution  as in my experience more   web pages use S as an accelerator (for Save/Send) than E. </pre>
