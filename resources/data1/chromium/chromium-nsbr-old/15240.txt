<title>Issue 15240 -   chromium -    Use eggtreemultidnd.c to improve multiple row dragging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our bookmark manager can drag multiple rows at once  but it suffers from   this problem: &lt;<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/gtk-app-devel-">http://www.mail-archive.com/gtk-app-devel-</a>  list@gnome.org/msg13485.html&gt; Currently the only way to get it to work is to   start dragging during your last ctrl- or shift-click. This is annoying and   unintuitive. I believe the attached file circumvents this problem and has   apparently been the standard solution (rather than say  fixing it in gtk)   for some years now. </pre>
