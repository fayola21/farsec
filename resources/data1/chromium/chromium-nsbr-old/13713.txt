<title>Issue 13713 -   chromium -    resizing window doesn't adjust tab strip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. create a window with a bunch of tabs (4 or 5)  2. resize the window to make it more narrow    expected:  - when you get narrow enough such that the right edge of the window hits  the tabs  the tab strip should shrink such that all tabs are still visible  along with the &quot;new tab&quot; button.    actual:  - tabs get cut off.    this happens regardless of normal or incognito window. </pre>
