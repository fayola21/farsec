<title>Issue 20999 -   chromium -    Chromium crashes on Ubuntu 9.04 with &quot;check failed&quot; and &quot;pipe error 9&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0  Operating System     : Ubuntu 9.04 kernel version: 2.6.28-15-generic    I installed chromium last week. Its been working fine until yesterday. When  I click on the launcher  it would say chromium is starting. Chromium would  then open for a split second and then close.  I tried running it through the terminal and I get this error:    [7822:7828:59094221743:FATAL:/build/buildd/chromium-browser-4.0.206.0~svn20090902r25168/build-tree/src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/async_resource_handler.cc(145)]  Check failed: read_buffer_-&gt;data().

I think this problem was due to the latest update for chromium.  Any ideas to whats going on? </pre>
