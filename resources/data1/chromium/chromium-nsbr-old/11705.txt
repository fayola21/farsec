<title>Issue 11705 -   chromium -    Bad behavior when increasing DPI in Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Increase the size of the font in Windows (DPI) to something like 120 or   130 (default is 90)  2. Boot Computer  3. Start Chrome      The Minimize  Maximize and Close buttons should work normally. Also the   Tabs should work normally.      The aforementioned buttons are not clickable  and they don't change color   when hovering above them with the mouse cursor like they should. The Tabs   don't start resizing themselves in the Tab Bar until after there's about 3   or 4 tabs &quot;too much&quot; on the tab bar  ie. the last tabs go out of sight   until it starts resizing them  always leaving a couple of tabs unselectable   if there's many of them.    <b>Please provide
