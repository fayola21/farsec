<title>Issue 9613 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/dom/clientWidthAfterDocumentIsRemoved.html influences next test in the run. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test causes a following test to get a console error:  -CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 13: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property   'documentElement' of undefined    We need to fix the the console error is getting inserted into a different   test than the one actually being run. It's not clear to me whether this   points to an actual Chrome bug or just to a bug in test_shell.    This showed up when running tests in parallel as the order of tests being run   changed  so a different test started getting this console error.    To reproduce this  just run all the tests in LayoutTests/fast/dom (without   skipping this one obviously) and one of them will get this console error. </pre>
