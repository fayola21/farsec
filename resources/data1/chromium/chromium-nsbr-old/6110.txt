<title>Issue 6110 -   chromium -    Inspector UI is not mirrored properly on RTL locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1123306&gt;      1. Run &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot; go to a web page    2. right click in an empty area within the page and choose the bottommost   options in the popup menu.         The UI for inspecting a web page has mirroring problems. Specifically:    1) The Chrome Window used for displaying the inspector (SimpleXPFrame) has   problems with the menu button and the title not being displayed properly.    2) The inspector UI itself (the HTML UI) is not mirrored.        from devint: If any developer tools will not be internationalized by   intention  #2 is not an issue. </pre>
