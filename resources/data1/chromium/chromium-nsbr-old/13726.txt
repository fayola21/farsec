<title>Issue 13726 -   chromium -    Chrome Views dialogs should be able to compute height based on contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the internal bug tracker ( http://b/issue?id=1278081 )    ------------------------------  We currently size our dialogs based on number of lines of text * the height   of a line of text.  However  this sometimes causes the contents to   sometimes be truncated at the bottom.  This is because some elements in the   dialog have a fixed height  which the above calculation doesn't account   for.    Instead  we should compute the height by laying out the elements (provided   a width) and size the height of the dialog dynamically.  This will remove   the need for the various heights provided in locale_settings_*.rc files.    -----------------------------------    See also <a title="Some controls in Options dialog run off" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13366"> issue 13366 </a>   </pre>
