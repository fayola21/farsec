<title>Issue 18548 -   chromium -    Background images in the header don't line up with the background images in the body of the NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because we don't have padding on the left  our images are horizontally off  by a few pixels. Do we want to shift the header pattern to compensate?    An example is the theme &quot;Legal Pad&quot; at the theme gallery:  <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a> . </pre>
