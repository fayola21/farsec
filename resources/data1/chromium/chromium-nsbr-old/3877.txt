<title>Issue 3877 -   chromium -    Google crashes when printing to Canon FaxPhone 80. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Any print command (CTL+P) or (Right Click + Print) will crash the   browser.  Works fine with my other printers - Dell 3100N  HP 2100 InkJet.  2. I tried setting these other printers as default printers to see if this   may be an issue but the print commands worked fine.                  Please provide
