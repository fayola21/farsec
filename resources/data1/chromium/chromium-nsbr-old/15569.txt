<title>Issue 15569 -   chromium -    Images are fetched twice  breaking captchas on orkut.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.127.33 (Official Build )  URLs (if applicable) : See steps below           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1.Login to orkut.com with user &quot;orktchromebug@gmail.com&quot;  password   &quot;orangeblue&quot;. (This is a demo account for your convenience  you may use   your own account.)  2.Navigate to this URL &quot;<a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#CommMsgPost.aspx?">http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#CommMsgPost.aspx?</a>  cmm=39966102&amp;tid=5352634947283850117&quot;. (Again this link is for your   convenience  you may post to any Orkut community.)  3.Enter any string with a URL such as &quot;google.com&quot; in the &quot;Message&quot; field   and click on submit.  4.You will see a captcha image. Try answering the captcha.  5.Your captcha answer will not be accepted  even if it is correct.      The captcha answer should be accepted.      Correct captcha answers are not accepted even on repeated attempts.    Explanation:  After some digging I discovered that Chrome 2.0 fetches the captcha image   twice  and renders only the result of the former fetch. This can be   verified by using Wireshark to monitor the HTTP requests while performing   the above steps. For your reference  the captcha image is an image tag of   the form &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://www.orkut.com/CaptchaImage?xid=...">http://www.orkut.com/CaptchaImage?xid=...</a>&quot;&gt;.    On our server (i.e. Orkut) a new captcha string is generated for the user   for every fetch of the captcha image (since it is a request to the   /CaptchaImage servlet). Thus the user ends up seeing the wrong captcha   image (because they are shown the earlier fetched image  not the later   one). Note that this is not reproducible on the latest Chrome 1.0 or 3.0   builds. </pre>
