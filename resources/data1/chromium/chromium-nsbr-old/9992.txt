<title>Issue 9992 -   chromium -    Shadow regressions from merge 42364:42403 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These three tests began failing (image only) with the 42364:42403 Webkit merge.      LayoutTests/fast/repaint/box-shadow-h.html = FAIL    LayoutTests/fast/repaint/box-shadow-v.html = FAIL    LayoutTests/fast/text/shadow-no-blur.html = FAIL    The first two are missing the box shadows on the right column of squares. The last one has a   grey first row of text rather than a fully saturated one.    Possibly due to changes to WebCore/platform/graphics/skia/GraphicsContextSkia.cpp.    <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42375">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42375</a>  Tentatively assigning to Brett. </pre>
