<title>Issue 22878 -   chromium -    Chrome can fail to shut down if closed during session restore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is caused by the nested run loop in SessionRestoreImpl::Restore.    Repro:  - Open a whole bunch of tabs  and turn on session restore.  - Close Chrome.  - Open Chrome  and immediately close the main window. Hopefully you did this   before session restore finished opening the tabs (before the nested run loop   finishes).  - Chrome will never shut down.    Tested on Chromium trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26805">r26805</a>  Vista 64. </pre>
