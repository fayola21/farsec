<title>Issue 3500 -   chromium -    The refresh link in calendar doesn't seem to do anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. go to calendar.google.com  2. click the refresh link beside the date      nothing happens. The events on the calendar should refresh if there have   been changes made.      Note: you may need to open calendar in another window and make some changes   there to test.    This works properly in Firefox.    [reported by jobl]       </pre>
