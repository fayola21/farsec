<title>Issue 13204 -   chromium -    Pasting in email resulted in unknown user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Kyle Prete ran into this issue (cc'd)      1. Edit a new issue and click on the reviewers box  2. Paste in a reviewer's email (scherkus@chromium.org)  3. Auto-complete shortened it to &quot;scherkus&quot;  4. Save and publish+mail      Kyle reported that my name was auto shortened to just &quot;scherkus&quot; and that   rietveld reported unknown user.    If you look at his change:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/118122">http://codereview.chromium.org/118122</a>    You'll see that I'm a reviewer however from my perspective it doesn't show   up:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/user/scherkus">http://codereview.chromium.org/user/scherkus</a>    Also when I'm logged in it does show &quot;Me&quot; as a review  but instead a link   to scherkus.       </pre>
