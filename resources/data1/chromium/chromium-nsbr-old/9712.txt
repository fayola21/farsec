<title>Issue 9712 -   chromium -    Bookmark's status (star) is not shown for long titles in New histor page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.172.2 (Official Build 13060)    -Bookmark a page which has long title (eg:  <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/</a>)    -Check the bookmark status (star) for the page in History page.    You can't find it  because of it's long tile which is eclipsed.     I guess we should show the star button after the eclipses.  </pre>
