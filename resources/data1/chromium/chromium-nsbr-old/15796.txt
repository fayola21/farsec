<title>Issue 15796 -   chromium -    Themes need to control New Tab Page background repetition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In addition to ntp_alignment  we need to add display_properties.ntp_repetition with the possible values 'no-repeat'    'repeat-x'  'repeat-y' and 'repeat. These values should be stored internally   as an int (see our ntp_alignment code) and reflected in the NTP theme CSS.    This will allow theme authors to specify how their image tiles. </pre>
