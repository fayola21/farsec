<title>Issue 1887 -   chromium -    heavy flash site hangs the entire browser  not just the tab it's living inside. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : www.deezer.com            Firefox 3: FAIL        1. Open a tab on Deezer  and some other tabs  2. Launch some music  3. During the load of the music (first seconds) the whole browser is  hanging while it's supposed to have one process per tab..      As per the documentation  it is expected that if deezer is hanging a tab   the browser should still be alive.      The browser is hanging and waiting for the website to be  loaded/functionnal  etc.. The site is highly loaded with flash scripts  but  this seems to slow the entire browser and not _only_ the TAB where it's  running inside    </pre>
