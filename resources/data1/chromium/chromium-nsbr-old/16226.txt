<title>Issue 16226 -   chromium -    Use IconManager's asynchronous loading for Mac UI components - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The IconManager loads icons from the system on the file thread in order to   prevent the UI thread from blocking on possible file system delays.    Any Mac UI component (such as the download shelf) should use this   infrastructure rather than loading icons directly on the UI thread. </pre>
