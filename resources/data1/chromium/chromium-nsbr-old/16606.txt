<title>Issue 16606 -   chromium -    DevTools: page reload while on a breakpoint does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> there should be a way I can reload the page after I've made a change  in my source editor. Right now if I click reload and it's stopped in  the debugger the throbber spins infinitely. If the page isn't stopped  in the debugger it goes black. If I click reload again I get sad tab.  If I click reload again the page reloads. </pre>
