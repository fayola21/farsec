<title>Issue 19685 -   chromium -    Icon loader should load NSImages instead of SkBitmaps on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  icon_manager-&gt;LoadIcon() loads an NSImage and converts that to   an SkBitmap  an all callers convert the bitmap back to an NSImage. Issues with   that:    * It's inefficient  * We lose all but one of the variants stored in the the NSImage. </pre>
