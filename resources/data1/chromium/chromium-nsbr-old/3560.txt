<title>Issue 3560 -   chromium -    Enable SSL session resumption - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I discovered today that the new HTTP stack does not resume SSL sessions  so   every new SSL connection is established with a full SSL handshake.    My web search shows that this is because we're using a new Schannel   CredHandle (credentials handle) for each connection.  I did a quick   experiment in which I used a  global CredHandle for all SSL connections    and we're resuming SSL sessions.    But we can't use a single CredHandle because it specifies which versions of   SSL are enabled.  So even if we can use one CredHandle for multiple   servers  we still need additional Credhandles for:  - handling TLS-intolerant servers (with TLS 1.0 turned off)  - whenever the user turns on or turns off some version of SSL protocol in   SSL configuration settings.  - supporting SSL client authentication: client certificate is specified in   CredHandle. </pre>
