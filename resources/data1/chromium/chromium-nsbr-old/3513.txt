<title>Issue 3513 -   chromium -    Regression: Can't resize the browser window by holding mouse pointer with bottom border - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the regression with v-155.0 where default MagicBrowzr is enabled.  Works fine with 154.0 (with magic_browzr option)    -Make sure chrome browser window is un maximized.  -Keep and hold mouse pointer on the bottom border of the window and try to   resize the window. You can't.     But you can resize the window by keeping the mouse pointer on either   bottom left/bottom right corners.         </pre>
