<title>Issue 22604 -   chromium -    CRC checksum error in rar / zip file when the file is downloaded by Google Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4 (Official version 26653)  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL / download link that is containing a zip /   rar file  Other browsers tested: Successfully downloaded the file as the CRC is   correct and the file can be decompressed.    Firefox 3.x: Successfully downloaded the file without error           IE 7: Successfully downloaded the file without error      1. Just get to any website that has a download link of rar and zip file  2. Download the file by using Google Chrome  3. Try to decompress it and you will find it cannot be decompressed as the   CRC checksum is incorrect. This problem only occurs after updated the   latest release of Google Chrome (4.0.211.4).      I expected that I can decompress the file without any CRC checksum error.   This problem occurs all the time when I have downloaded a rar / zip file   from the Internet by using Google Chrome.      CRC checksum error occurred in the files (prolly in all the files that   downloaded from Google Chrome or just those compressed rar and zip files). </pre>
