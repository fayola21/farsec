<title>Issue 6304 -   chromium -    Add layout tests for non-BMP character rendering  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Partly due to the lack of a freely distributable font (there are quite many   free fonts  but their license terms may or may not allow making them as a   part of our build system)  there's very few (if any) layout tests for non-  BMP characters.    One quick way to fix this issue is to make a simple 'Ahem-like' font for   non-BMP code points. Perhaps  we also need to make a simple (perhaps rather   ugly) non-BMP font with actual glyphs (rather than black box glyphs in   Ahem).     Once we have those fonts  we can add layout tests for bugs like <a title="font fallback does not work for non-BMP characters" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6303"> issue 6303 </a>   and CSS (Unicode range check)  non-BMP character rendering  and so forth.      </pre>
