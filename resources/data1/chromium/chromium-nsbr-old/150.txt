<title>Issue 150 -   chromium -    Type-ahead-find - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 1583        Firefox 3: OK    Type-ahead-find is a very nice feature in Firefox. It basically allows you  to start typing a search string while not in any text field  which will  then open the ctrl-f find bar automatically.    I see why this could confuse some users but for those who are used to it   it's really a nice (and hard to live without) feature  so an option would  be great.    </pre>
