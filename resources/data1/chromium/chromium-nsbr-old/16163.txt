<title>Issue 16163 -   chromium -    Feature request: Clicking on active tab will minimize it and show previous opened tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox          On Opera 10 browser it has an option to Minimize the active tab when  clicking on it and show the previous opened tab.  I think Chrome could implement this as default.  Why: It's practical and as Chrome doesn't do any action when clicking on  active tab  I think this is the best use for it.    Obs: see the video to see this in action on Opera Browser </pre>
