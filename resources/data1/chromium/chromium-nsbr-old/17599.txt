<title>Issue 17599 -   chromium -    Theme heuristics on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lots of interesting components to the Chrome theme system on Linux...    When the user first starts Chrome  they should get the standard Chrome   theme/buttons etc  but with the frame/toolbar tinted to the system colors.   This matches the intent of what we try to do on Windows and Mac. (On Windows   we match either Luna Blue or Aero Glass  on Mac it's unified gray).    When you turn back on the standard WM frame  feel free to also use the   system buttons etc. at this point.    What I am saying is the default theme should be the system-theme derived   chrome-styled frame. This means you don't have to show/ship blue by default. </pre>
