<title>Issue 5540 -   chromium -    Layout isn't called if a views::Window is maximized without changing size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) maximize a window with tabs  2) drag a tab out  3) tab gets maximized size (so when you maximize it  it has identical   bounds)        Layout() should be called for the toolbar view  but it isn't because the   bounds don't change.  This affects the target area of the back button. </pre>
