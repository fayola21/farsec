<title>Issue 18710 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Refresh doesn't change omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to www.google.com  2. Clear the omnibox and type in www.yahoo.com  3. Refresh      Expected: Upon refreshing  the omnibox shows the URL of the current page    no matter what I typed in before  Actual: Omnibox stays the same.    I swear this was working at some point -- I'd been using it as a   replacement for undo (<a title="Undo not implemented in omnibox"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18210">issue 18210</a>) when I accidentally paste into the   omnibox when I meant to copy.    Works as I expect on Windows. </pre>
