Sizer (<a href="http://www.brianapps.net/sizer.html">http://www.brianapps.net/sizer.html</a>) adds a system menu to resize   any window to a defined size. a must for developers.  2. right click on the window title  a menu to resize the window appears.      The window resizes at the defined size  i.e. 1024x768      Only with Chrome  the option seem available  but it does nothing.  The same menu is usually available right-clicking the &quot;maximize&quot; window   icon too. Not with Crome.       </pre>
