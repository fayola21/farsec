<title>Issue 19192 -   chromium -    Refactor UtilityProcessHost / UtilityThread for single-process mode and unit tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the design coupling of UtilityProcessHost and UtilityThread do not   transparently handle single-process mode and unit test contexts. Instead   existing consumers have to branch their own code to avoid using them in   single process mode or unit tests  and end up duplicating some of their code   from UtilityThread. This is fragile since changes in one place may not be   made in the other.     Ideally UtilityProcessHost would determine if the context is single-process   mode or a unit test  and do the calls to the code in UtilityThread on a new   thread instead of a separate process. </pre>
