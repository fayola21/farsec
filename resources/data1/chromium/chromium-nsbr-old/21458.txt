Think that Arial is comparatively ugly (because it is)  3. Visit some web pages that use font-face:sans-serif  4. Suspect that the text looks like Arial  but be unsure because it's too   small  5. Press command-+ (plus) a whole bunch of times to enlarge it      Expect: Helvetica  or for an even more Mac-like experience  Lucida Grande  Observe: Arial  Also observe: bad press for getting this wrong    We're using Arial as the default sans-serif font and we shouldn't be.    We're also hard-coding Arial in a number of places in our code  and we   shouldn't be doing that either.      4.0.206.1 official release (206 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25349">r25349</a>)  4.0.208.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25632">r25632</a> </pre>
