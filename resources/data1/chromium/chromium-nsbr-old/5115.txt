<title>Issue 5115 -   chromium -    Ctrl+U should show up view-source on Application shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.31(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)  I guess  It never worked  as the build: 149.30 also has the same behavior.      1. Create a application shortcut for any webpage and launch the application.  2. Press Ctrl+U on the application to show up view-source.      What is the expected output?   Should show up view-source of the page.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.    Works fine with Context menu.         </pre>
