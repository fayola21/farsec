<title>Issue 21163 -   chromium -    Double click starts jQuery UI Draggable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.0 (Official Build 25285)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable">http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Goto Url  2. Double click the grey box of demo        Nothing happening.      The drag starts and cannot be stopped. The Draggable keeps attached to the   mouse until reloading the page.    I am not sure if this is an issue with Chrome or jQuery. I tried several   options for .draggable (distance  delay) but the drag is still starting. </pre>
