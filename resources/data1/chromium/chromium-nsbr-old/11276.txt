<title>Issue 11276 -   chromium -    Add icons to recently closed in 2.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14309">r14309</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14310">r14310</a> replaced 'Window' with an icon and '2 Tabs' under Recently   Closed on the new tab page.    That came too late for the 2.0 string freeze  but Window doesn't look great.    I want to pull over that change without the string changes for 2.0.    I'll give it a shot and pass back to sky if I can't get good results. </pre>
