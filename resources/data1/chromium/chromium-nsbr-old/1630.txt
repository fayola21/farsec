<title>Issue 1630 -   chromium -    Pictures Shown Behind Menu Bars on Websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Check out the home-page of this website: <a href="http://www.ecanadaplus.com/">http://www.ecanadaplus.com/</a>  Put the cursor over the link &quot;FTA Satellite&quot;  then put the cursor over &quot;FTA   Recievers&quot; and you'll notice that the menu links are cut off and displayed   behind the site's main image. This does not occur in other browsers. It   looks like a Javascript extension issue. Check it out...    HOLLER! :D    P.S. are you guys hiring in Canada for summer intern students? I'm in   Electrical Engineering at U of T  I've done Linux web server development    for servers comprised purely in C++ executables. E-mail me at   dj_4ward@hotmail.com </pre>
