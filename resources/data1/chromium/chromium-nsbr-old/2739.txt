<title>Issue 2739 -   chromium -    UMA response should control UMA upload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> UMA response data is currently a fixed xml string with tags indicating the  types and certain limits on the quantity of subsequent UMA uploads.  Most  of that data is currently ignored.  MetricsService should upload or not  depending on the content of that response and more options should be  designated in the response to fine-tune the upload.  This bug used to be  here: http://b/issue?id=1332000&amp;cookieId=2008268100756396   </pre>
