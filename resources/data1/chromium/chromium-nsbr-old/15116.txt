<title>Issue 15116 -   chromium -    video related webkit tests are rather flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While doing the sheriff duty today  I found that various video-related   webkit tests are flaky (fails in one cycle  goes green in the next cycle).    For instance  in XP (dbg3) has the following tests failed at one point   today:    video-timeupdate-during-playback.html    video-src-change.html ( more than once)    video-display-toggle.html  ( &gt; 4 times today)    video-seeking.html    video-played-collapse.html (unexpected success) </pre>
