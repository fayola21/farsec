<title>Issue 1446 -   chromium -    hand cursor's hot spot is misplaced - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The hot spot of the hand cursor is placed at (or near) 0 0. This makes it   awkward to click on items in Google Maps for example.    Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">http://maps.google.co.uk</a>        Firefox 3: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to Google Maps.  2. Note the transition to/from the hand cursor when entering/leaving the   map or hovering over items (such as wikipedia markers).      The hot spot should be somewhere near the middle as it is in other   browsers.     </pre>
