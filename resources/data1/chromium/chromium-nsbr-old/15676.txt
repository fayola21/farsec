<title>Issue 15676 -   chromium -    2 window borders on HTTP authentication dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4 (Official Build 19293)  URLs (if applicable) : Any with an HTTP Authentication request           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to a website that requires HTTP authentication on a Windows Vista   system (I haven't tested  nor have access to  to other Windows versions)  2. Observe that the HTTP dialog has 2 window borders. It appears that one   is the Vista dialog  and one is being drawn by Chrome itself.        1. A dialog with standard Windows Vista appearing window borders. However    an acceptable result is just having 1 window border   </pre>
