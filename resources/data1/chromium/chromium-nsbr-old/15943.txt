<title>Issue 15943 -   chromium -    Plugins in extensions get overridden by plugins in Firefox's plugins dir - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4    1. Make an extension that has a plugin in it.  2. Make sure to reference the plugin the extension's manifest.  3. The mime type of the plugin should be the same as a plugin in Firefox's  plugins directory.    What is the expected output?     Chrome loads the extension's plugin.    What do you see instead?    Chrome loads the Firefox plugin.    It is useful for extensions to be able to provide a Chrome-specific plugin  for a mime type that is handled by other browsers. For example  when  porting a Firefox extension to Chrome  it is desirable for Chrome to load  the Chrome extension's plugin rather than the Firefox extension's plugin. </pre>
