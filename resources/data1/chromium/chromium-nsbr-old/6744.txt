<title>Issue 6744 -   chromium -    pre-population of search engines should be run as a step at first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is so the first run info bubble has always something valid to show for   default search engine.    peter says :  &quot;Prepopulation doesn't run in the case where you already installed the   browser  messed with your profile  uninstalled  and are installing again    which is the case where you can reach here.  It would run if the profile had been nuked  but then you wouldn't have no   default either.&quot;    ======= 0 ========    Note: There's a single function call you can have the TemplateURLModel do   to  prepopulate.  Do this before import runs  but adfter the TemplateURLModel has initialized  itself on the main process.       </pre>
