<title>Issue 2456 -   chromium -    Title Bar is not painted well  If the top level window is minimized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> -Maximize Google Chrome Browser window.  -Launch Any other window (any non-chrome window  like notepad  paintbrush    etc)   Make sure this window is un-maximized and its title bar overlaps with   Step1 window's title bar.  -Minimize the top level window (i.e step2 window) to task bar.    Issue: The title bar is not painted well. We can see the shadow of top-  level window - See the first screenshot(MagicBrowzer_TitleBar.jpg).    In this case  If I right click or click on the title bar  I can see   straight horizontal white line across the title bar and I can notice two   sets of Window frame control buttons. (but this behavior is intermittent).    See the rest of the screenshots.              </pre>
