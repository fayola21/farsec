<title>Issue 5639 -   chromium -    Input box's context menu/Spell-Cheker options/language settings should set &quot;Languages&quot; tab as active tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 1.0.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7162">r7162</a>)    We have the new option for input box's context menu called &quot;language  settings..&quot;  If user selects Spell-Cheker options/language settings then we bring up  &quot;Font and Languages&quot; dialog displaying &quot;Font and Encoding&quot; tab as active  tab always.    I guess  we should set Languages tab as active tab all the times  if user  navigated thr this context menu -&gt; as the name itself says language settings... </pre>
