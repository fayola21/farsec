<title>Issue 8246 -   chromium -    Autocomplete drop-down on code.google.com is out of place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10684)      1. Edit a bug on code.google.com.  2. Start typing in a label field: Mst    EXPECTED:  Drop-down below the form field that has all labels beginning with Mst.    ACTUAL:  The list of fields beginning with Mst is 150px above the field (or however   far down the page is scrolled).      I'm guessing this is a webkit merge-induced regression.   </pre>
