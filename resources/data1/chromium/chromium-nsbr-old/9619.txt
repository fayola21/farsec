<title>Issue 9619 -   chromium -    Bookmarks manager accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit SHIFT + ALT + T to set focus to the toolbar.  2. Right arrow to the wrench menu.  3. Down arrow to 'Bookmarks manager'. Hit Enter to activate.  4. Tab through the fields  using a tool like Inspect32 to track focus and view the exposed MSAA   information.        Issues:  1. 'Search' edit box reported as role client  which is the default role  when none is provided by   the programmer. Expected behavior: get_accRole should return ROLE_SYSTEM_TEXT.  2. No label for edit box  which means that there is none programmatically connected to the   corresponding field. Expected behavior: get_accName for each form field will return the label   string.  3. Organize and Tools menus are not keyboard accessible.  4. No way to Import/Export bookmarks from the keyboard alone (the menus are not keyboard   accessible  but the options in the Organize menu appear in the context menu for each option.   However  Import/Export does not).     </pre>
