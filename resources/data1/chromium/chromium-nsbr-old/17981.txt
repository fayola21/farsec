<title>Issue 17981 -   chromium -    Cannot specify chrome-extension:// in a valid match pattern for content scripts  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (21423)    It would be nice to be able to run content scripts in pages loaded from a   chrome-extension:// path. It would enable interesting patterns for cross   tab and window communication in chrome extensions (i.e. you can abstract   various API to content scripts and make them available to different pieces   of an extension that uses multiple tabs/windows).      1. Try to specify chrome-extension://* as a match pattern for a content   script.  2. See error dialog on loading chrome.      That chrome-extension://* would be a valid match pattern for a content   script.      Dialog pops up on load saying that I specified an invalid match pattern in   my extension's manifest.   </pre>
