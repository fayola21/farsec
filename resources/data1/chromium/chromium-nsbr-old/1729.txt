<title>Issue 1729 -   chromium -    Too much white space at the end when copying and pasting from Google Documents into Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I opened a new email in Gmail  2. I opened an old document in Google Documents  3. I copied the whole text from the document by CTRL-A. CTRL-C  4. I pasted the whole text into a new Gmail email by CTRL-V.  5. This resulted in too much white space at the end of the message.      There should be just 2 lines of white space at the end of the pasted text   as the reply will come beneath it.      There is at least 40 lines of white space.    Please provide
