<title>Issue 12918 -   chromium -    Print something when launching just pings a foreground process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome.  2. Hide the window some place you didn't notice.  3. Launch Chrome again from the terminal.      I expect there to be some notification that something happened.  Instead I'm just dumped back to the command line.    I guess we could print something.   </pre>
