<title>Issue 7511 -   chromium -    password saved on one google email - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have 3 gmail accounts. I had one of these mail accounts with my username   and password saved. When I went to another of my google email accounts  I   accidentally selected 'never save...'    Well  it stopped saving for any of my gmail accounts.    I thought  well  I'll delete all saved passwords. shut down. restart. then   resave passwords. It worked for some sights  like MSN Live mail  and   Facebook  but gmail and other accounts I sign into don't give me the option   to save anymore.    How do I reset this?? I've looked around to see if I could alter the file   manually  but can't find it.    Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 1.0.154.48&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com       </pre>
