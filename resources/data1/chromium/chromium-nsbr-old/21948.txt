<title>Issue 21948 -   chromium -    extension API tests - race condition with multiple toolstrips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current default implementation is to call chrome.test.runTests([...])   inline in either a background page or a toolstrip.  The problem with that is   that this code may run before other components of your extension  so the test   may have a race in it if it depends on interaction between background pages   and toolstrips or multiple toolstrips.  Perhaps we should have an event that   the extension system hands down when all components have finished loading.    This might be useful outside of the test infrastructure as well. </pre>
