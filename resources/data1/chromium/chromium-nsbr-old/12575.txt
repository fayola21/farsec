<title>Issue 12575 -   chromium -    Not a serious bug  but not following a convention - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28    If we open a bookmark folder  and we move to the next bookmark folder  it   does not open that folder. We are supposed to click on the folder itself and   it is contrary to the conventions in doing so.    The same is true for page and settings icons which are next to the address   line.    My suggestion is to group these and set some &quot;clicked&quot; boolean value to true   for that group until clicking one of the folders  bookmarks or somewhere   else. Thus it will be permitted to move among folders without clicking. </pre>
