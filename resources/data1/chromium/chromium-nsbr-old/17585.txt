<title>Issue 17585 -   chromium -    Re-enable DataGrid once it's functional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're turning off ENABLE_DATAGRID in WebCore (<a title="Disable DataGrid in WebCore until it's more functional" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17567"> bug 17567 </a>) because the implementation is very   incomplete. We should turn this flag back on once the HTML5 &lt;datagrid&gt; tag is functional enough   for developers to use.    I'll update test_expectations.txt to point to this bug for the three DataGrid layout test failures. </pre>
