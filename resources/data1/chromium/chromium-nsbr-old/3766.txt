<title>Issue 3766 -   chromium -    Symbol and Wingdings fonts are not handled properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TESTCASE:  <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/css/fonts/family/006.html">http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/css/fonts/family/006.html</a>    The test should say PASS three times and have a smiley at the bottom. On   Webkit trunk  it passes all but the top line. On Chrome  it fails   everything except the smiley.    Feel free to contact me if you need advice with respect to how to implement   this (in particular  &lt;font name=wingdings&gt; still needs to fallback to the   non-unicode direct codepoint mapping for legacy reasons). </pre>
