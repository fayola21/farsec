<title>Issue 9925 -   chromium -    Failures from WebKit merge 42324:42364 may just need re-baselining - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These failures started in WebKit merge 42324:42364. They differ in the   width of the reported RenderView  which is probably just due to the change   from using docWidth() to overflowWidth(). Re-baselining is likely all   that's needed  but that should be verified.
