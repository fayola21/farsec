<title>Issue 23124 -   chromium -    WebInspector: No way to discover keyboard shortcuts for debugging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm happy to discover that you added keyboard shortcut support for stepping   through the code when I'm debugging.    However  there is no way to discover these.    Maybe you could add the keyboard shortcuts to the tooltips? </pre>
