<title>Issue 15896 -   chromium -    Tab to search keyword overtaken by different domain name autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I have a search engine set to use the keyword &quot;wh&quot;  2. To use this keyword I would usually type wh  hit tab then type my search   term.  3. Recently a domain starting wh (not the site the keyword refers to) has   become higher on the omnibox list and so typing wh and pressing tab   autocompletes to whirlpool.net.au (rather than my wowhead.com search)      I would be prompted to enter my search term      whirlpool.net.au autocompletes upon hitting tab so my tab-to-search does   not work without deleting the autocompleted domain name    <b>Please provide
