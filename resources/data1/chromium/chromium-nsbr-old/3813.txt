<title>Issue 3813 -   chromium -    Referrer is not preserved across back button navigations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> *** Repro ***  Go to page A. Click links to navigate from pages A to B to C. Click the   back button while on page C to return to page B (may need to clear cache to   force a new load).    Observe the request headers -- the request for page B should include A as   the referrer.    This same problem affects restoring tabs during session restore.    *** Cause ***    The problem seems to be that in the renderer  we do page load using a   HistoryItem. The history item does not include referrer (although it looks   like it does include referrer for form state).  We need to add some plumbing such that loading history items adds the   correct referrer to the request. </pre>
