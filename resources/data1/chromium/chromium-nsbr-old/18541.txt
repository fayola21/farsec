<title>Issue 18541 -   chromium -    &quot;javascript unresponsive dialog&quot; should not show if there is a modal dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Wait for a modal javascript dialog to come up (in this instance  say  a   Google Calendar reminder)  2.  Wait for some time and the pop up indicating a page has become   unresponsive will show  but the page isn't unresponsive  I just haven't   clicked on the button to dismiss the calendar reminder         Chrome should be able to tell if a page has become unresponsive vs.   waiting for user input      See #2    <b>Please provide
