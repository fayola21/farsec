<title>Issue 16257 -   chromium -    linux: tab dragging very janky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It takes close to a second on a warpstation to render the dragged tab   contents when it is first pulled out of the tab strip. I would rather have   no such visual effect than have one this janky.    After a short bit of snooping around the code  the reason is simple: we copy   the backing store from X to client space  then back to X again. I intend to   fix this. </pre>
