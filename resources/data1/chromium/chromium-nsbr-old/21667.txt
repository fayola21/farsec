<title>Issue 21667 -   chromium -    Estimated download time text is trunkated  becoming useless  see attached screenshot. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43        1. Download any file with long name  e.g. <a href="http://sunet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ogre/ogre/1.6.3/OgreDemos1.6.3.msi">http://sunet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ogre/ogre/1.6.3/OgreDemos1.6.3.msi</a>  2. Try to guess downloading estimated time        Estimated time fully shown. Also I think it would be nice if estimated   download time is shown on download tab.        Estimated time label is trunkated.     </pre>
