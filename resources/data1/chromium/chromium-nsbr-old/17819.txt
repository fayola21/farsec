<title>Issue 17819 -   chromium -    make ctrl+shift+q the quit accelerator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ctrl+q closes the browser and all windows on linux.  This was done to match   all other GTK+ and KDE apps which close on ctrl+q.    Reasons why we might want to remove this key binding:  1) Can result in data loss.  Session restore is good  but doesn't always   work (e.g.  sites that involve POST data or a session cookie).  2) Terminal seems to not implement this key binding and use ctrl+shift+q   instead (probably because emacs and other apps use ctrl+w).    One could argue that we should make session restore better to handle case   (1) better.  E.g.  we could make a single entry in session restore for all   windows when application quit normally.    Using ctrl+shift+q seems weird to me  but there is some precedence.  It   would be in the menu so it's kind of discoverable.    It was also suggested that we have a dialog like Firefox  but that seems   less likely since the preference is to have a way to recover rather than   prompt. </pre>
