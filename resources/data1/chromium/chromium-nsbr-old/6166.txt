Click &quot;Proceed Anyway&quot;  4. On a normal webpage  this brings up the auth box.  Here  it instead   throws Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE): Unknown error.  5. If I go back to the URL bar and hit &quot;enter&quot; again  to reload the page    the authentication box now appears.  I can log in and the web interface   loads.

Upon re-  submitting the same URL  the page then authenticates and loads properly  as   if it had connected the first time.     Please provide
