<title>Issue 22180 -   chromium -    Mac about box does not give me the finger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you hover over a link in the about box now that <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26482">r26482</a> added clicky   links  you should get the finger.  I expected to get the finger  but Chrome did   not give it to me.  Instead  I got the I-beam. </pre>
