<title>Issue 20198 -   chromium -    Bookmarksfolder does not open by just pointing  need to click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :4.0.202.0      1. Click from bookmarks toolbar a folder  2. Then point another folder at the same toolbar  3. It did not open      When you have activated bookmark folder then other folders should just open   only by pointing.       Nothing happens. This should be similar feature as in Firefox where folders   open only by pointing. No need to click so many times.   </pre>
