<title>Issue 12428 -   chromium -    1 Failing Worker Layout Test without Using v8::Locker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as   WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:    // This is expected to fail after we remove the uses of v8::Locker when we  // switch to process-per-worker model. Re-enable this when we fully support  // worker thread.  SKIP : LayoutTests/fast/workers/worker-terminate.html = CRASH FAIL </pre>
