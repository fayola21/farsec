<title>Issue 22856 -   chromium -    Default Sans-Serif font has has change to &quot;Arial&quot;  but Vista x64 does not have this font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Upgrade from Chrome 2.x to 3.x  2. Web pages now look wrong  as they are displaying a serif font where   there should be a san-serif font.        When Chrome is upgraded  it should either include the default fonts it   requires or select a different san-serif font that is installed on the   system.        A font named &quot;Arial&quot; does not exist on Windows Vista x64 Ultimate SP1. So   Chrome displays all san-serif fonts with a serif font instead         </pre>
