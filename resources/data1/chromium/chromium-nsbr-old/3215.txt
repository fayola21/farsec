<title>Issue 3215 -   chromium -    Default button should change as other buttons are focused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You can see this in the first run dialog. Try the following:    1. Launch chrome with --first-run  2. When the dialog comes up notice that focus is on the 'start chromium'   button and it looks like the default button.  3. Press tab.    Notice 'start chromium' stills looks like the default button and pressing   enter activates it. This is wrong. When focus moves to the cancel button   the cancel button should become the default button and enter should   activate the cancel button. </pre>
