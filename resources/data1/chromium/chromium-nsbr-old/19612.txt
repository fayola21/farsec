<title>Issue 19612 -   chromium -    in-page search reports wrong result count if page text is changed when search box is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Log in to facebook (or likely other page that uses AJAX to change the   page contents)  2. Click &quot;older posts&quot; (at the bottom).  3. Find some text that appears only in the older posts that have just   appeared.  4. Reload  so that older posts are no longer displayed.  5. Hit Ctrl+F and search for the text that you found in step 3.  Chrome   should display &quot;0 of 0&quot; and deactivate the next/previous search result   buttons.  6. Click &quot;older posts&quot;  7. Hit Ctrl+G to search again.      Chrome should find and highlight the text.      Chrome moves the browser to the found result  but then displays &quot;1 of 0&quot;   results  and &quot;2 of 0&quot; if you hit ctrl+g again.  The number increases if you   hit ctrl+g repeatedly  but after a time period (a few seconds -- possibly   while Chrome is still loading the new text?)it stops incrementing  at which   point Chrome loops back to 0.  One time it displayed only up to 2  and   another 3  and another time I got it up to 15.  The page in question only   has one correct result    <b>Please provide
