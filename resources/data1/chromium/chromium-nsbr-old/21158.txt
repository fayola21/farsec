<title>Issue 21158 -   chromium -    Incompatibility with OpenOffice.org Calc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Copy any cell with some text or number from OpenOffice.org Calc.  2. Paste to any textfield in Chrome.      It must copy and paste the text from cell in OpenOffice.org Calc to   textfield in chrome.      But it paste nothing  and only after 9 paste it paste copyed text  and also    it add &quot;r&quot; symbol to the end of copyed text.    I think this is a BUG in chrome  and you must to fix it. </pre>
