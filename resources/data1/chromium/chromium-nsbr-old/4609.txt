<title>Issue 4609 -   chromium -    NSS_Shutdown reports leaks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In base/nss_init.cc  there is a call at shutdown time to  NSS_Shutdown.  This returns failure if there are any leaks.  This happens currently when running base_unittests.    I used to have this as a DCHECK  but it was too annoying   so I changed it to LOG(ERR) and filed this bug. </pre>
