<title>Issue 6190 -   chromium -    Windows taskbar no longer pop-ups if Chrome is maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Maximize Chrome  2. Move mouse to bottom of screen        The Windows taskbar should popup from its hidden state      Taskbar (in auto-hide mode) does not pop-up    Seems related to the new version in the Dev channel (perhaps the new align   to monitor's edges feature) </pre>
