<title>Issue 16154 -   chromium -    &quot;Restrict how third-party cookies can be used&quot; option does not let us log into GMail. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 3.0.192.0  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open &quot;Under the Hood&quot; tab in Chrome preferences.  2. Change Cookie options to &quot;Restrict how third-party cookies can be used&quot;.  3. Try logging into GMail.    Expected:  We should be able to log into GMail.    Actual:  We get &quot;Your browser's cookie functionality is turned off. Please turn it on&quot; message.      1. This happens only for GMail. I can log into Yahoo  Facebook and Twitter without a problem.  2. On windows chrome  I can log into Gmail with this cookie option.  3. &quot;Restrict how third-party cookies can be used&quot; should work the same way as &quot;Accept cookies   only from visited web sites&quot; in Safari. Safari lets me log into GMail with &quot;only from visited web   sites&quot; cookie option selected.       </pre>
