<title>Issue 6796 -   chromium -    Ensure Gears interceptors do not cause perf hits - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A 1% perf hit we took on the DHTML page cycler was never fully explained   but led to the following worry:    &quot;Making an HTTP request calls us to load in Gears and hook up the   interceptors.  They won't actually do much for file: requests  but they'll   at least cause us to make a virtual function call and a hash table lookup   on every request.  I can try commenting this stuff out and seeing what   effect it has.  We could also try commenting this out  or doing something   more drastic with Gears  and seeing what effect the HTML page cyclers show    to make sure our current Gears code is not hurting real perf too much.&quot;    This bug is about investigating to ensure Gears interceptors have zero  or   as little as possible  perf impact.     </pre>
