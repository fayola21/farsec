<title>Issue 9438 -   chromium -    Naver download (��__��_��ԕ�__ ) : search button does not work  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> reported in Chrome-Korean U2U : <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-kr-">http://groups.google.com/group/google-kr-</a>  Chrome/browse_thread/thread/dcd9f2a5801e5e17#    1. Go to <a href="http://file.naver.com/search.php">http://file.naver.com/search.php</a>  2. Type 'ꁕ�_���' (Chrome written in Korean script) in the search box below   the blue tab bar and left of drop-down list(selection)  3. Press the green button (with '��__��_��_��__' in white with green background)   right of the text input box   4. Nothing happens.    The text input field has a name attribute ('q') but does not have ID.  However  onclick handler for the button (goSearch at   <a href="http://file.naver.com/search.php">http://file.naver.com/search.php</a>) refers to it using getElementById('q').    This works  only in IE (even in IE8  it works) where getElementByID can be   used to retrieve an element/node with name attribute but without an id.     In standard-compliant browsers  it does NOT work.     It can be trivially fixed by giving an id to the text input field.     Naver is #1 portal in Korea. I'll ask the reporter to contact them. I'll   also find a way to contact them. I believe they will fix it right away once   alerted.      </pre>
