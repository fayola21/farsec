<title>Issue 21595 -   chromium -    download adds extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open new tab  2. paste   '<a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.r25707.tgz'">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.r25707.tgz'</a> in   the url bar and hit return        The download starts for &quot;chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25707">r25707</a>.tgz.gz&quot; instead of   &quot;chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25707">r25707</a>.tgz&quot;    It seems like this would help someone post a bogus file (&quot;foo.bar&quot;)  and   have chrome add an extra extension changing what happens on the user.    This would open up sending something to an exploit in winzip  etc.    Depending on what extensions we might auto add  it might even let   someone post a file and get it routed into MS Word  etc. </pre>
