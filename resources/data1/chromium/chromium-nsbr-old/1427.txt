<title>Issue 1427 -   chromium -    Sort Bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version  : &quot;0.2.149.27 (1583)&quot;    Please implement a feature to sort bookmarks by name.    I like to keep all of my bookmarks organized in folders  and within those  folders are sometimes 10-30 bookmarks as well as sub-folders. As it is now  I can not sort my bookmarks by name  which makes trying to find bookmarks  confusing.    As a further suggestion I think it would be cool if I could right-click on  a bookmark folder on the bookmark bar and be able to select &quot;Sort By Name.&quot;      Thanks  keep up the good work   NeoAngelic </pre>
