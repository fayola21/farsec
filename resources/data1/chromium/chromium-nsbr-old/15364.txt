<title>Issue 15364 -   chromium -    rebaseline tool grabbed the wrong png and checksum files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Yesterday  I marked LayoutTests/editing/execCommand/remove-  formatting-2.html as needing rebaselining and ran the rebaseline tool.    Two things went wrong.  1. It didn't get results for the Mac.  2. It got the wrong expected checksum and png files for Windows.    In this case  only remove-formatting-2-expected.txt should have changed    but it changed the checksum and png files to something incorrect. Maybe   it grabbed the results off the wrong bot?    You can see the patch  with the incorrect checksum/png here:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=19158">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=19158</a>    I committed that  then realized it was wrong. Then I manually grabbed the   checksum and png files from the windows webkit bot and checked those in   (and they were correct).    Marking this as a P1 since we really need to be able to trust this tool and   this tool is so crucial to us staying on top of layout test failures. Feel free to   change that if you think I'm wrong. </pre>
