<title>Issue 14826 -   chromium -    Linux: Remove use of ICU from sys_string_conversion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently on Linux SysWideToUTF8 and SysUTF8ToWide call into ICU.  I believe   the idea of sys_string_conversions is to have the system-level conversion    and not depend on ICU.    I believe we should just use wcsrtombs / mbsrtowcs.  I will draft a patch   tomorrow. </pre>
