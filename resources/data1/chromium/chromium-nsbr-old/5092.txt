<title>Issue 5092 -   chromium -    SUN Java Vulnerability affecting all browser (on Windows) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've found that repeatedly loading and unloading Java in quick succession   causes read  write and execute access violation exceptions in all browsers   that I tested on Windows. I think it's pretty safe to say that there is   some memory corruption going on  probably caused by reentrancy issues. This   vulnerability can potentially be used to execute arbitrary code (except on   Chrome - I think). I believe the flaw lies in Java  but I've not   investigated (I've very little knowledge of Java and how it plugs into   browsers).    I have not reported this yet because I would like to investigate the scope   and cause of the issue first. I want to know what's causing this - Chrome   or Java.

It will start   loading and unloading java and should normally cause an AV of some kind   within a minute.     </pre>
