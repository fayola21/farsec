<title>Issue 6583 -   chromium -    Right-click on links brings up wrong context menu if font is enlarged - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : SRWare Iron 1.0.155.0 (6886)  This should essentially be the same as Chrome: &quot;The current Beta of Google   Chrome uses Version 525.19 of the Rendering-Engine WebKit  how the   Browserstring tells. In Iron we obviously use the most actual WebKit-Version   (528.5).&quot; (<a href="http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron_chrome_vs_iron.php">http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron_chrome_vs_iron.php</a>)    The attached images show the problem  with OSNews.com as an example. normal.png   shows that the correct context menu pops up when the font size was not modified.    schrift-vergroessert.png  however  shows that the wrong context menu pops up   when the font size was enlarged before (I had pressed 'ctrl' and '+' twice).   The menu behaves as if the mouse pointer was not on a link. </pre>
