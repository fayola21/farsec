<title>Issue 109 -   chromium -    Lacks Session Saver - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Run browser  2. Close Browser  3. Restart Browser  4. Observe all my purty tabs are gone        All my purty tabs should still be available.      I realize that Firefox kind of pushes this for crash resilience  but that   isn't the only reason to have this.  Its also extremely useful to be able   to reboot the machine and have my browser (and the browser of other users   logged onto the system) come back to just where they left it.       </pre>
