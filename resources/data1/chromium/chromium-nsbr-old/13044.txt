<title>Issue 13044 -   chromium -    Extensions fail to install if the temp directory is under an NTFS junction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3 (Official Build 17055)  URLs (if applicable) : Any extensions    <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples</a>   works  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Get a second drive or partition (for me it was a separate drive; subst   may also work but I dunno.)  2. Move or delete the existing Chrome profile  3. Create a NTFS junction (I used Sysinternals Junction tool  Vista and   up's mklink tool should work  as should XP's fsutil hardlink) to redirect   the User Data folder to an empty folder on another drive.  4. Launch Chrome and try to install an extension.      The extension should install.      It does not.  Instead nothing seems to happen after allowing the install.    The extensions page shows nothing (once it showed an error about not being   able to write to the temp folder  unfortunately I forgot to save it and   have been unable to reproduce it).  Process Monitor's log does not show   anything useful (all operations appear successful).    A TEMP_UNPACK folder is left in the user's profile's Extensions folder    containing the downloaded CRX.  There are also new 0 byte tmp files in the   profile folder and the Default folder in the profile folder.  None of these   files are cleaned up after the failed install  as they are after a   sucessful one.  &quot;Extension Cookies&quot; file is also created (THIS is correct   behavior I think).    From what is happening  and the error message  I believe this may be   related to the old problem of the Google Chrome updater not being able to   write to the temp folder if it was on a different drive than the Chrome   application folder. </pre>
