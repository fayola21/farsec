<title>Issue 3289 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes when I try to respond to a forum message or send a bug report - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Type a response to a Chrome forum message.  2. Try either to copy the response by highlighting it and right-clicking  or  3. Try to post the response without attempting to save it first.    What is the expected result? In the former case  that the response is  saved  in the latter  that it is posted to the forum.      What happens instead? The browser crashes and I lose the response I had  written....       Please provide
