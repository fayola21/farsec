Windows Explorer and Firefox will both use Foxit as default reader.  4. Try to open a PDF file from Chrome browser        Open PDF file in a separate Window  using Foxit reader.        The PDF file is opened using Acrobat reader inside the browser window    which is very slow if it works at all (see attached screen dump).     Please honor user preferences  even if that means opening the PDF document   in a separate window (which is actually also a user preference).      </pre>
