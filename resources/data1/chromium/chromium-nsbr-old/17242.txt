<title>Issue 17242 -   chromium -    Memory leak in WebCore::SVGSVGElementInternal::viewportAttrGetter() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happened in  LayoutTests/svg/custom/detached-outermost-svg-crash.html  during the fishing expedition   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg  Presumably it would also be reproduced by more specific commands   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom  or   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom/detached-outermost-  but I haven't verified that.    Valgrind complains    28 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 306 of 834     at operator new(unsigned int) (vg_replace_malloc.c:212)     by WebCore::SVGSVGElementInternal::viewportAttrGetter(v8::Local&lt;v8::String&gt;   v8::AccessorInfo const&amp;) (V8SVGSVGElement.cpp:137)     by v8::internal::Object::GetPropertyWithCallback(v8::internal::Object*   v8::internal::Object*  v8::internal::String*  v8::internal::Object*) (objects.cc:191)     by v8::internal::Object::GetProperty(v8::internal::Object*  v8::internal::LookupResult*   v8::internal::String*  PropertyAttributes*) (objects.cc:554)     by v8::internal::Object::GetPropertyWithReceiver(v8::internal::Object*   v8::internal::String*  PropertyAttributes*) (objects.cc:152)     by v8::internal::Runtime::GetObjectProperty(v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::Object&gt;   v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::Object&gt;) (objects-inl.h:631)     by v8::internal::Runtime_KeyedGetProperty(v8::internal::Arguments) (runtime.cc:2626)   </pre>
