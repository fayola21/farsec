<title>Issue 21444 -   chromium -    Tab image in &quot;Press [Tab] to search&quot; doesn't look Mac-ish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type &quot;goog&quot; in the omnibar.      Expect: &quot;Press [Tab] to search Google&quot; to  look Mac-ish.  Observe: it doesn't.    We should make the tab key cap icon    chrome/app/theme/keyword_hint_tab.png  look like a tab key cap on a   Mac keyboard.  It should have the flat rounded appearance of an Apple key   cap.  Apple hasn't used a capital letter on a keyboard in a really really long   time.  The label should be &quot;tab&quot; set in lowercase VAG Rounded as Apple   currently uses on keyboards.    Yeah  that's really the typeface's name.  Don't worry  that's not how it's   pronounced.    Here  look at it  courtesy of Wikipedia:    <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Apple_iMac_Keyboa">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Apple_iMac_Keyboa</a>  rd_A1242.JPG      4.0.206.1 official release (206 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25349">r25349</a>) </pre>
