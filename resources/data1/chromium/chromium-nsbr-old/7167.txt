<title>Issue 7167 -   chromium -    Keyboard strokes should be ignored while resizing the browser window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1242381&gt;  Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8817)    --Navigate to google.com and set focus to google search box.  --Keep mouse pointer on one of Browser window borders to resize it and at  the same try to type some thing.    User can do both activities at a time: resizing the window and typing.    This goes more annoying while focus is on Ominibox. You don't see mouse  pointer ( &lt;--&gt;) anywhere  but you can still resize the window and can type  in OmniBox at a time. </pre>
