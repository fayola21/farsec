<title>Issue 6961 -   chromium -    Support app menu/close on single-/double-click of upper left corner - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  OS                   : Windows Server 2008 (x64) == same as Vista x64.                         Not tested but assumed to also happen on XP.             Safari 3: ? untested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      Double clicking the top left of a window in a Windows environment closes   the window. Most programs do this through their icon  however  applications   such as Explorer  which do not have an icon  still support closing when the   top left of the &quot;frame&quot; is double clicked.      The window should close when the top left is double clicked (in normal mode   and maximised mode)      Chrome maximizes the window if it is in normal mode when the top left is   double clicked. In maximized mode  nothing happens.    To fit in better with the windows environment  Chrome should follow the   normal window rules such as closing when the top left of the window (on the   frame) is double clicked. </pre>
