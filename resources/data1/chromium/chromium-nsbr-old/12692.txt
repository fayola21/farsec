<title>Issue 12692 -   chromium -    Paste into inactive text field causes lockup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Defect+on+Linux">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Defect+on+Linux</a> in  Chromium  2. Go into another app (eg. a terminal) and copy some text.  3. Right click on one of the (now inactive) text fields in chromium and  select &quot;Paste&quot;      The text is pasted somewhere into the window. (If the text to paste comes  from Chromium rather than another app it often gets pasted into the wrong  text box  but that is a separate issue).      Chromium locks up.    <b>Please provide
