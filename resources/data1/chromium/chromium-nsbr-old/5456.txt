<title>Issue 5456 -   chromium -    Text area in phpbb2 doesn't update text correctly when deleting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36              Firefox 3:OK           IE 7:OK      1. Got to a phpbb2 site (forums.browncoatsguild.com)  2. type a comment in the forums (no need to submit)  3. arrow back to somewhere within the text and hit the delete button a few   times.  Notice that the text doesn't update within the text area.  You can   see the new text if you highlight it  or if you change focus.    This could be a problem with the text area used within phpbb2  but it works   correctly within Firefox and IE.   </pre>
