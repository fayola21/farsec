<title>Issue 22231 -   chromium -    New FTP should handle request with HTTP Range header - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new ftp implementation should handle HTTP range header and replies   with a net::ERR_REQUEST_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE error.    HTML elements like &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; are protocol agnostic  meaning   that they would pass along whatever src they receive to the browser process.   There is one thing particular in HTTP protocol used by such elements that   they use &quot;Range:&quot; header to request ranges  and they would submit such   request for whatever src they receive. It mean that  in the case of &lt;audio&gt; or   &lt;video&gt;  the network backend needs to understand this &quot;Range&quot; header.   Right now http:// and file:// has it implemented but not ftp:// we don't need   full implementation for this request but need to at least know how to fail.   </pre>
