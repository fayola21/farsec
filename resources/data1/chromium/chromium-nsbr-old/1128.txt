<title>Issue 1128 -   chromium -    vBulletin &quot;compose post&quot; text box does not accept formatting shortcuts on Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : flyertalk.com and probably other vBulletin forums        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Compose a post on flyertalk.com (or probably other vBulletin 3.6.7   forums)  2. Press CTRL-B while in the text box        The tags [B][/B] appear in the text box.      Nothing.         - Many forums use software use plaintext entry fields  where rudimentary   HTML tags can be used to format the text.  One would write in a text   field &quot;This text is [B]bold[/B].&quot;    - To make this functionality available to people without knowledge of   HTML  these text entry fields offer the possibility to press formatting   buttons directly above the text entry fields  or shortcuts such as CTRL-B   or CTRL-I to insert these text for the user.    - At least for vBulletin 3.6.7  these shortcuts don't work in Chrome   (example forum: flyertalk.com)  but work in the other browsers.    - as I assume this functionality is implemented in JavaScript  this might   be a bug in V8     (this is the same bug as in <a title="Can't use Ctrl+I  Ctrl+Z  or other text commands in text boxes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=102"> Issue 102 </a>  which was closed as problem was not   described well enough  hope it is more clear now) </pre>
