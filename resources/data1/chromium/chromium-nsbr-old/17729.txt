<title>Issue 17729 -   chromium -    Windows 7  when using Larger - 150% display size  tabs extend over window's min/max/close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Set Control Panel -&gt; Display settings to Larger - 150% (re-login to take    effect).  2. Open enough tabs to span the entirety of the &quot;tab bar.&quot;  3. Additional tabs added  after the &quot;maximum &quot; will cover the window's   minimize  maximize  and close buttons.      The expected result is the tabs will not cover the window's state controls    and the tabs will compress in width with respect to the area to the left of   the window's controls.      The tab(s) continue to open in full-width  covering the window's minimize    maximize  and close controls. As well  the &quot;new tab&quot; + is pushed out of   the window's viewport.    <b>Please provide
