<title>Issue 1103 -   chromium -    Tab homepage never rerenders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Get a website added to your homepage w/ thumbnail  one that you control.  2. Change the layout/design/colors of the page.  3. Thumbnail never updates with the new layout.      I would think eventually it will check to see what the page looks like.      It looks like the old layout  possibly forever?    Please provide
