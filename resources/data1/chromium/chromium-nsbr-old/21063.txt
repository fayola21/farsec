<title>Issue 21063 -   chromium -    Provide reliability try service. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to provide reliability try service so that anyone can schedule a   ChromeBot experimental run and query the result as long as the person   provides a private Chrome build. In addition we can hook up the service   with try server so the user can just schedule ChromeBot run with &quot;gcl try -  -reliability&quot;.    The service is mostly provided for people making large/risky code change or   rolling deps on components like Webkit and V8. But the system should be   designed in a way that canary build and extension system can also use it.     To make the service useful  the system needs to have coverage close to   ChromeBot test for ToT build. The minimal requirement is 40K URL loading   test. The URL coverage is configurable. However  if the resource is   constrained  we prefer running test longer and getting more coverage than   fast turn around time. The #1 goal is to give a good indicator on   reliability result if checking in to the tree.   </pre>
