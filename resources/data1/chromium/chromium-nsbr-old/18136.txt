<title>Issue 18136 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 197.0 (Developer Build 22133)  OS version               : 10.5.7    On the Bookmarks menu there is no Bookmark manager option. When you   right click on the  Bookmark Bar and select Bookmark Manager  nothing   shows up. As a result  bookmarks are frozen in place; they can't be shifted   into folders.  </pre>
