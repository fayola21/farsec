<title>Issue 11424 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behaivor with Default browser info bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.62    I can see the inconsistent behavior with the following two use-cases while   throwing the 'Chromes is not ...Default browser' info bar to the user.    Use case1:  ##########  [Make sure Chrome is not your default browser]  -Launch Chrome  -Make IE/FF as your default browser  -Launch 2nd instance of Chrome from any shortcut.    Expected: I guess we should not show the Default info bar ??.  Result: It does.    Use case2:  ##########  In above steps:  Step3:  Create a New window (Ctrl+N)/ New Incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N).    Expected: ???    Result:  It does not show the Info bar.         </pre>
