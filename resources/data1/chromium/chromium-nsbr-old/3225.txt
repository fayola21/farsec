<title>Issue 3225 -   chromium -    Chrome should respond to taskbar clicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome with --magic_browzR flag  2. Right click and click (left click) on taskbar.     (Repeat step2 for couple of times)  3. now click (left) on taskbar.  What is the expected output?   Chrome should be minimized and restored alternatively for clicks.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens. Chrome does not respond to clicks on taskbar.    I can reproduce this consistently.     </pre>
