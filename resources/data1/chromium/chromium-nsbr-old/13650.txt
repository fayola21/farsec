<title>Issue 13650 -   chromium -    A hidden download bar appears as background of the toolstrip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.185.0 (17931) (the bug exist since version   3.0.183 at least)  URLs (if applicable) : none           Safari 4: NA    Firefox 3.x: NA           IE 7: NA           IE 8: NA      1. Start chrome with a toolstrip extension (GMAIL checker for example)  2. Download a file  3. Hide the download bar by clicking on the cross  4. Resize the window so that the toolstrip is now at the same position that   was the download bar. (I hope i am clear ... : reduce the height of the   window and you should see the download bar appears in the toolstrip)      The download bar should stay hidden.      The download bar now appears as the background of the toolstrip. And you   can click the button of the download bar    See attached screenshot </pre>
