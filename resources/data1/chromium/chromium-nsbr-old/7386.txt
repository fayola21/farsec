<title>Issue 7386 -   chromium -    GURL-related layout test failure: http/security/postMessage/invalid-origin-throws-exception.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout test fails because GURL treats the targetOrigin  &quot;http:&quot; differently than KURL:    LayoutTests/http/security/postMessage/invalid-origin-throws-exception.html    In DOMWindow::postMessage  the call to  SecurityOrigin::createFromString(targetOrigin) where targetOrigin is  &quot;http:&quot;  returns an empty security origin which is not expected by the  test.  This boils down to differences in the treatment of &quot;http:&quot; by GURL/KURL.    This does not seem like a big issue since the postMessage fails in any  case.  Maybe we just need to rebaseline the test? </pre>
