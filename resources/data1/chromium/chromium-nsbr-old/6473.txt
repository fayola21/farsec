<title>Issue 6473 -   chromium -    Can't see if inactive tab is waiting on prompt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter a URL or click on a link that will require a prompt to load  such   as one using HTTP Authentication  2. Go to another tab before it starts loading and brings the prompt up  3. You won't know the other tab is waiting on your response  and may think   its loading the page in the background. When you return  you'll just the   see the prompt and still have to wait.        I would like to see some way for a tab to indicate a page needs something   from you. Maybe that tab could rise up a bit from the rest? I would not   like it to flash.    This is particularly a problem when restoring the session  and multiple   tabs may be waiting on such prompts.          Please provide
