<title>Issue 3226 -   chromium -    Lots of unnecessary ViewHostMsg_SetTooltipText messages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Every time you move the mouse  the renderer sends ViewHostMsg_SetTooltipText to the browser. This is a lot of extra messages   making the round trip through the I/O thread to the UI thread.    We should have the renderer keep track of the last update sent to the   browser  and not resend if it hasn't changed. It's possible we'll have to   do the same thing on the browser side so that any tooltip is properly   updated on tab switch. </pre>
