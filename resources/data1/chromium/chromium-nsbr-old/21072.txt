<title>Issue 21072 -   chromium -    More format (png) and quality flexibility for chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Should be relabeled as enhancement request.    chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab currently grabs a fixed-quality JPEG  it  would be nice to be able to get a PNG (to support pixel-by-pixel lossless  analysis)  and to be able to set quality of JPEGs.
