Prefill the username and password fields with the stored data.            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. register an account with <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com">http://www.trenitalia.com</a>  2. login with username and password  3. save the data  4. visit the home page again    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  No  in Firefox there is the same problem  but maybe we can fix it for   Chrome  as this is one of the most used website in Italy.
