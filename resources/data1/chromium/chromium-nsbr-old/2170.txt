<title>Issue 2170 -   chromium -    Add AddTrust External CA Root to net/base/ev_root_ca_metadata.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://secure.comodo.com">https://secure.comodo.com</a>   <a href="https://addtrustexternalcaroot-ev.comodoca.com">https://addtrustexternalcaroot-ev.comodoca.com</a>           Safari 3: n/a      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Install <a href="http://crt.comodoca.com/AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt">http://crt.comodoca.com/AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt</a> into the  Windows Trusted Root Certificate Store.  2. Browse to <a href="https://addtrustexternalcaroot-ev.comodoca.com">https://addtrustexternalcaroot-ev.comodoca.com</a>      Chrome should display its EV UI (i.e. the company name in green text).      The company name is not displayed.    Additional Information:  The AddTrust External CA Root certificate is included by default in the  trusted root certificate lists of most software (including Mozilla NSS)   with the notable exception of the Windows Trusted Root Certificate store.  Comodo use the AddTrust External CA Root certificate in EV SSL Certificate  chains.  This isn't a problem for IE7 on Windows  since we also  cross-certify with other Root certificates that are trusted by Windows.  Now  for various reasons  a significant number of our customers need to  manually install the AddTrust External CA Root certificate into their local  Windows Trusted Root Certificate store.  This still isn't a problem for IE7  on Windows - it still successfully chains up to Root(s) that it does trust.  However...  Although Chrome on Windows uses the Windows Trusted Root Certificate store   it doesn't behave in quite the same way as IE7 (in several ways  for which  I'll probably submit some more bug reports soon).  When the AddTrust  External CA Root certificate has been manually installed in the local  Windows Trusted Root Certificate store  Chrome often seems to use it and  *not* show its EV UI when it otherwise would.    Suggested fix:  Since the AddTrust External CA Root is trusted-for-EV by Mozilla  and since  Chrome's list of trusted-for-EV Roots is not reliant on which Root  Certificates are included in the Microsoft Root Certificate Program...    Please accept the attached patch for net/base/ev_root_ca_metadata.cc.    Thank you. </pre>
