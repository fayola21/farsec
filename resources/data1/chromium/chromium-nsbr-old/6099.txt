<title>Issue 6099 -   chromium -    bad display of multi-line English message in pop-ups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1178727&gt;      1) open chrome  Hebrew UI.  2) go to a web page that triggers an alert() in English (with line wrap and   punctuation)  like when deleting a note in Google reader.        Actual Result:  the alert is RTL and right aligned  leading to bad display    Expected result:  we should be smarter with latin-only alerts      Alerts with no line wrapping are ok.  However  when there is a line wrap we break.  See screenshots </pre>
