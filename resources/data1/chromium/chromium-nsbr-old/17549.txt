<title>Issue 17549 -   chromium -    Multiple sessions on NFS homedir leads to bus error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In a scenario where your home directory is shared over NFS:    1. rm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome  2. nx to a remote machine  3. run google-chrome on that  4. open your gmail account in chrome  5. run google-chrome on local machine  6. open your gmail account in chrome (on local machine)  7. start reading email on local machine  8. after aprox 10 mins chrome via nx crashes with a message:       Bus error (core dumped)    For some reason  our locking of ~/.config/google-chrome isn't working   right  probably related to NFS.  This affects Googlers in particular.    CC'ing some people who touched this code recently. </pre>
