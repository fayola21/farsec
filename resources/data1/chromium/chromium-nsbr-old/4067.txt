<title>Issue 4067 -   chromium -    AutomationProvider::WindowSimulateDrag is full of fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. AutomationProvider::WindowSimulateDrag sends WM_LBUTTONDOWN etc _client_   messages to a window regardless of whether or not the points specified in   |drag_path| are over client areas of the window.    2. The function calls SetCursorPos assuming the points in |drag_path| are   in screen coordinates  but actually they're in client coordinates.    These two issues turn out to be a major source of tab UI test flakiness. </pre>
