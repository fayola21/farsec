<title>Issue 13884 -   chromium -    toolbar is one pixel too low compared to tabs on Linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chrome Version : 3.0.187.0      OS + version : Linux  CPU architecture : 64-bit    Window manager : xfwm4    Look at the attached screenshots:   - The first is the current state.   - The second is how it should look (created by nudging the main browser   pane one pixel up in The Gimp).   - Third is magnified view highlighting the issue.    Note the jagged pixel at the bottom of the selected tab and the odd blue   line under each unselected tab. Everything just needs shifting up by one   pixel.    You need good eyes to care  I guess. I do. </pre>
