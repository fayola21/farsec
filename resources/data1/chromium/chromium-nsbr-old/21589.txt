<title>Issue 21589 -   chromium -    Implement &lt;a ping&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a better mechanism for sites to be able to asynchronously track events on   navigation/page unload.  The reason is quite simple: without alternatives that don't block   the user  sites are using hacks which are _harming_ the user.  Some of these include:  -many sites start a network fetch and then simulate sleep() in JavaScript by doing tight   loops waiting for Date.getTime() to change    -this is really bad since the delay is always the same  even if the request finishes   early    -it's also bad on smartphones/laptops since it wastes battery  -sync XHRs    -which have no timeout!  -redirects    -slows down navigation    Sites are able to reliably do this in IE  since it doesn't cancel pending image requests on   navigation.  This trick is used by some sites.  What it means is that in all other   browsers  tracking slows down the user.    To make it very clear: we should do this for the _user_  not for sites.  Sites now are able   to do it anyways in hacks that harm the user.  Implementing &lt;a ping&gt; won't have any effect   on privacy  since whatever tracking it'll be used for is already being done.  It will allow   it to be done in ways that don't delay the user  i.e. speeds up web browsing.    This should ideally be done in WebKit  so that other WebKit based browsers can take   advantage of this.  Let's also work with Firefox folks to renable this feature. </pre>
