<title>Issue 17855 -   chromium -    Chrome is incorrectly storing and sending duplicate cookies sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Unknown.        We expect that the browser will only store one cookie with a given name    domain  path  and flags.  In this case  we set the SID cookie on   .google.com/ every time a user logs into Google and consistently use the   same settings for the cookie - we expect only one copy of the cookie to   come back to the server.        For most users everything is fine  but for some users multiple cookies are   occasionally stored by the browser and sent to the server.  We first   assumed this might be our bug but further log analysis showed the problem   only happening in Chrome.    The net result is that some of the cookies sent back are correct and some   of them are incorrect.  Because only one cookie is expected  our web apps   only look at the first cookie if more than one is sent  which causes   erratic behavior for users since the first cookie is not always the correct   current value.    <b>Please provide
