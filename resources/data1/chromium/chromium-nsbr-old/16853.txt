<title>Issue 16853 -   chromium -    ExtensionDOMUI can have ProcessDOMUIMessage called without having RenderViewCreated() called - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. --load-extension=&quot;.../chrome/test/data/extensions/samples/tabs&quot;  2. navigate to chrome-  extension://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/tabs_api.html  2. click on &quot;update tab&quot;  3. crash.    What's happening here is that the update tab is causing a navigation to   occur (to the same url) and RVHM doesn't think that it's a cross-site   navigation  so it's creating a new dom_ui_  but not a new RenderView  so   RenderViewCreated never gets called on the ExtensionDOMUI and thus it never   creates it's ExtensionFunctionDispatcher.     </pre>
