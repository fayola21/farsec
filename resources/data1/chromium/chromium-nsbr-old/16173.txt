Go to chromium.org  2. Select some text from the page (which is not a valid URL)  3. Drag that text to the tab bar      Should show a mouse cursor indicating that (a) you are dragging text or (b)   you can't drop that here      Shows a mouse cursor indicating that if you drop the text here  something   will happen (it has an arrow in the tab bar and a + next to the hand)    Also cool would be a search for the text upon drop  which is what happens   if you drag it to the omnibox.   </pre>
