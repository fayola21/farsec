<title>Issue 18961 -   chromium -    autocomplete forced longer username entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. logged into dreammerger.com with 'user' (changed to protect username) and   it got remembered for autofill  2. logged into google.com account with e.g.  'usera' (changed to protect   username)  which got remembered for autofill  3. later tried to log into dreammerger.com with 'user' but 'usera' appeared.   Even though I deleted the last letter  when I tabbed to the password field    the username switched to 'usera'.    What is the expected result? 'user' should not change to 'usera' when I tab   to the password field      What happens instead? 'user' got changed to 'usera' when I tabbed to   password field. If I used the trackpad to click on the password field  the   username did not change.      <b>Please provide
