<title>Issue 14136 -   chromium -    crashes on restore session with several https tabs with sites became-unavailable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1    Chrome crashes upon restore session at restart  when session contains 7+  tabs  each of them with a different URL on a https: site that is not  available at the moment of restart. Reducing number of tabs to less stops  Chrome from crashing; adding any number of tabs doesn't affect situation.  Having any number of tabs with sites that are all available (and no  not-responding sites) doesn't lead to crash. </pre>
