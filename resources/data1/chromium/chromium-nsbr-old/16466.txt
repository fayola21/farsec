<title>Issue 16466 -   chromium -    stray tab strip in popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac build: 3.0.193.0      1.log into gmail (corp for me)  2.open an email message  3.it Shift-R for a new reply window        I get a window without a tab strip  but it has the nav area and bookmark   bar  and then over mail body area is a tab strip.  the close and new tab   bottoms react to mouse overs  and the new tab button creates a new tab in   the window that holds the rest of gmail.  the close button in the tab closes   the compose window.    The attached screen shot shows the lower part of the window  i had to edit   out the url bar and bookmarks bar since I didn't think that should be   public.   </pre>
