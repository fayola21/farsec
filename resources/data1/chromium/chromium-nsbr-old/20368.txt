<title>Issue 20368 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: When lose focus  tabstrip color shows light-blue instead of lighter theme color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24493">r24493</a>      1. Install any theme with Chrome <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24493">r24493</a>  2. Notice the color of the empty tabstrip area applied by the theme  3. Switch focus to another application      When the Chrome window loses focus  the tabstrip should change to lighter   version of theme color.      The tabstrip changes to lost-focus light-blue color of the classic theme.    See attached screenshot with Grass theme applied  where focus is on the   Calculator application in the foreground.    This worked fine in Chrome 4.0.202.0.   </pre>
