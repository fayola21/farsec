<title>Issue 21300 -   chromium -    Notifications aren't sent or received with the pre-released syncapi.dll binary - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start two instances of Chrome with two different --user-data-dirs  2. Enable sync on both instances with the same user name.  3. Add/edit/delete a bookmark on one client.    What is the expected output?    The change made on one client should be propagated to the second client in   a matter of seconds.    What do you see instead?    The change doesn't propagate to the second client until the second client   edits/adds/delete a bookmark.    This problem is likely related to   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21094">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21094</a>    Note that when visiting about:sync  I see the following (on both clients):    Notifications Enabled: true  Notifications Received: 0  Notifications Sent: 0    Clearly something is broken because changes were made on both clients and   the sent/received counts should be non-zero. </pre>
