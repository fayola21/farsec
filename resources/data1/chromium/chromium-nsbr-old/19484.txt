<title>Issue 19484 -   chromium -    Facebook Conversations Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. from this morning Facebook is unable to display conversations within the  main window.   Instead it leads to open up a popup windows <a href="http://www.facebook.com/presence/popout.php">http://www.facebook.com/presence/popout.php</a>   saying my browser is not compatible and I must use Firefox instead !!!!  2. it was working last night with the same version (aka 3.0.197.11) so it sounds to be a   facebook issue. Something changed their end maybe.  3. This is just to let you know  but it's a problem for me now  it might be worth that google talks to Facebook reporting this                <b>Please provide
