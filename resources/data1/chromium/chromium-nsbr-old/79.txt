<title>Issue 79 -   chromium -    Chrome gets language-version from IP-Address - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Chrome-download page  click on &quot;Download&quot;  2. Select different language for browser (in my case EN-US)  3. Install browser    What is the expected result?

I'm guessing it gives me the German one because I'm   logging in from a German country.      Please provide
