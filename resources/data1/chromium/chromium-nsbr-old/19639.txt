<title>Issue 19639 -   chromium -    Flickering Close button (Red cross) in App View - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (Vista 32 bit)  URLs (if applicable) : Google chrome app view (I was looking at gmail)  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Open a google app  2. Double click the title bar to restore (not the maximise button)  then   again to maximise  3. Mouse over the red cross in the top right corner  after a second it   starts to flicker irregularly.  4. Repeat step two if it doesn't        Red check box (and maximise button) shouldn't flicker  should remain   constant. See the screenshot for the two states that the button (I think)   flickers between. </pre>
