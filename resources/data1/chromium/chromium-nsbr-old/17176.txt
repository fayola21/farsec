<title>Issue 17176 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Tooltips (links/images title attribute) aren't displayed anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21056">r21056</a>)      Hover over links/images with title attribute      Chromium should display the tooltip.      Nothing.    I can't remember since when the problem exists  but it was working in my last   installed version (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19907">r19907</a>). </pre>
