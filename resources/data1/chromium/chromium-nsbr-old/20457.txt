<title>Issue 20457 -   chromium -    Some content from SDCH enabled server may be unnecessarily meta-refreshed (when back key is pressed) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chrome (with no tab referencing the SDCH capable server)  2. Fetch content from the SDCH capable server (note: without a dictionary    only gzip will be used)  3. Allow chrome to background download the dictionary (happens   automatically)  4) Click on a link in the content from step (2).  5) Press back.    What is the expected output?     The content in (2) should be fetched from the cache.    What do you see instead?    The back operation generates a new GET  which this time includes an Avail-  Dict header.  That in turn tells chrome that a viable SDCH request was   made  and when the non-sdch content from (2) is fetched from cache  it   causes error recover code to do a meta-refresh (because SDCH encoded   content was requested  but not delivered).    A new copy of the content is acquired  with SDCH disabled temporarily for   this site (for at least this transaction).        We need to either be less aggressive about disabling SDCH and doing a meta-  refresh  or perchance  we need to store in our cache info about the fact   that a full-blown-sdch-capable request was responded to.  Currently we   judge based on the current request  and not based on the request that   caused the cache to be populated.      This bug was originally reported by Ken Mixter. </pre>
