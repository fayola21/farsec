<title>Issue 21316 -   chromium -    Restoring a window shouldn't leave an orphan window containing nothing but one tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a few tabs  2. Exit Chrome  3. Reopen Chrome  4. On NTP  click the &quot;N tabs&quot; item in Recently closed      I expected that the current window containing only one tab with the NTP in   it would be replaced by the three tabs I chose to restore.    Instead  I get a second window with the three tabs and the window with the   open NTP is orphaned.  If there's nothing open other than a NTP  we should   reuse that window rather than create a new one.     </pre>
