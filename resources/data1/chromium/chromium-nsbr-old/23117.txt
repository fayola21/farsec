<title>Issue 23117 -   chromium -    Startup should take &lt; 250ms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Start Chrome on a lower-end machine (1GB RAM) or with a mature profile  2.  The browser/tab does not appear for &gt; 250ms (sometimes  it doesn't show   for seconds)    There may be numerous causes of this  but this seems to have regressed since   launch  and the startup tests haven't picked it up.    This may be related to <a title="Create startup tests for mature profiles"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22150">issue 22150</a>  and regression tests for this should   likely be run on the &quot;jank bot&quot; of <a title="add consume to a step in the tab-switching tests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21929">bug 21929</a>       </pre>
