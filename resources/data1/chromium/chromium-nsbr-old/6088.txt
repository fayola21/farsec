<title>Issue 6088 -   chromium -    many tabs with Flash slow down overall performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42    I use Chrome with really many tabs open (a list in the Chrome's Task   Manager has 12 screens listing open tabs)  and keep them open for weeks and   sometimes months: unread-yet blog entries  news articles etc. Many of those   tabs have some Flash content (small banners with advertising in most   cases).    The problem is that all that Flash content seriously slows down overall   performance of Chrome: its responsiveness is really bad even when I type   this bug report (making the Flash-plugin process run in Low priority   doesn't help).    Some ideas  if that can help:  = allow Flash content to be run only in active/visible tabs--and not take   process power otherwise  = run Flash content in its parent tab's process  so that user can turn   heavy-CPU Flash content pieces to Low Priority until user needs them.   </pre>
