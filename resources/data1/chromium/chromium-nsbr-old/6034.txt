<title>Issue 6034 -   chromium -    Installer get stuck when trying to import settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  OS Version : Windows XP SP2  Confirmed on two different machines.  Gets stuck at the 2nd phase of the import (search settings). Exits only by  brute-force shutdown through windows task manager.  This is really annoying because it happens during an install. Uninstall +  new fresh install does not solve the problem    Happens on my home pc  and on my T60 laptop.    List of search-engines I have (in App-Data/mozilla/yada/yada) is attached.  And a screen capture of addons.     </pre>
