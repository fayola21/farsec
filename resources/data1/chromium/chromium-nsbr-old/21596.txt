<title>Issue 21596 -   chromium -    Sync status on an opened NNTP is not updated in certain cases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Open a New Tab  2. Open the bookmark sync wizard by going to Wrench -&gt; Sync my bookmarks...  3. After the dialog is opened and the NNTP message at the bottom changes to   &quot;Account details not yet entered&quot;  dismiss the wizard.    What is the expected output?    The sync message should be removed from the NNTP when the wizard is   dismissed.    What do you see instead?    The message &quot;Account details not yet entered&quot; remains on the NNTP.    Note that the same behavior repros when you dismiss the dialog in the Merge   and Sync step (after entering user name and password) and it also repros   when you choose &quot;Stop syncing this account&quot; from the options dialog.     In addition  it seems that this problem doesn't repro when the promotion   appear on the NNTP initially; that is  if you log in to gmail and open a   new tab page after that  a promotion will show up on the NNTP. If you then   follow the steps above  the state will correctly go back to the promotion   after dismissing the wizard.   </pre>
