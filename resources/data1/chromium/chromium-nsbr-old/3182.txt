<title>Issue 3182 -   chromium -    Flash consumes CPU even if audio or video is not playing  possibly due to SetUnhandledExceptionFilter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open up a web page with 3/4 flash videos  2. Play then and then stop them all  3. Flash keeps consuming about 40% CPU.      CPU usage should be less than 5% ideally 0. It is less in other Firefox and   Safari    During debugging this symptom  flash is often caught stuck in kernel32!   SetUnhandledExceptionFilter (which was calling kernel32!VirtualQuery   repeatedly) during the processing of WM_TIMERs.    cpu pointed out that: flash calls SetUnhandledExceptionFilter in our thread   constantly (looks like basically in every call). It never seems to set the   previous handler back (which we set to catch crashes by generating   minidumps and sending them to us). So what we do is wrap the entire thread   function in a SEH handler and in the _except block we reset the unhandled  exception filter back to us and re-throw the exception.    This could be a reason for SetUnhandledExceptionFilter taking longer than   usual.    Apparently  in flash 10  it doesn't call SetUnhandledExceptionFilter   anymore (needs to be verified). In that case we won't need to wrap the   exception filter.  </pre>
