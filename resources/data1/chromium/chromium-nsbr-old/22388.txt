Highlight text in another application by using the mouse or shift and   right or left arrow to highlight text.  2. Place the cursor in Chromium's URL text box. This results in the   existing text in the URL box to be highlighted.  3. Click the mouse middle button.      Highlighting  placing cursor and then middle button clicking is important   in Linux/Unix because many applications (eg. text applications) support   only this mode of copy and paste. This means that you can't copy and paste   into a Google URL text box from many Linux/Unix applications. In   Linux/Unix  there are two current clipboard entries  one for the last   copied text  and one for the last highlighted text  so most applications   support both this and the &quot;highlight  right click  edit paste/right click   paste method used in Windows.       When you place the cursor in the URL box  the text in the URL box is   highlighted  and so becomes the last highlighted text in the clipboard for   the Linux/Unix middle click method of copy and paste  so replacing any   previously highlighted text in the clipboard  making it impossible to use   this method.    <b>Please provide
