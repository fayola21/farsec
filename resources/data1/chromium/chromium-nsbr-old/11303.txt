<title>Issue 11303 -   chromium -    UI glitch: &quot;Remove all&quot; buttons in Password dialog misplaced - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1                         2.0.178.0 (14981)��_��_��_      1. Google Chrome Options-&gt;Minor Tweaks-&gt;Show saved passwords  2. You will see it more clearly if both tabs (Saved passwords &amp; Exceptions)   are empty (or when both are full i guess).  3. Now toggle between the two tabs while looking at the (grayed out)   &quot;Remove All&quot; button      The &quot;Remove all&quot; button should be at the same place in both tabs      It moves up and down while switching tabs   </pre>
