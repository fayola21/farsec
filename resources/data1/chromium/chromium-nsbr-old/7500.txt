<title>Issue 7500 -   chromium -    Chrome bites into old versions of Flash content and doesn't let go! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48           Safari 3: OK      1. Post a SWF file on a website and embed it in an HTML document.  2. Surf to the HTML document.  3. Update the SWF.  4. Shift-reload the page.  5. When that doesn't work  go to the SWF's address manually and shift-  reload that.  6. If it still doesn't work  come back the next day and try again.      Steps 4  5  and 6 should all result in the new SWF content being displayed   on the HTML page.      The old version is still rendered in the HTML page  even after you've   manually surfed to the SWF and reloaded it.   </pre>
