<title>Issue 9874 -   chromium -    Thin border between tabstrip and toolbar on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Developer Build 13347)    Hi everybody!    First of all  thanks for available linux builds. It's getting nicer and  nicer! I know that lot of things are not working  but it's fine  it will :)  But there is a little annoying thing which is hopefully can be solved  quickly  but I couldn't find it in the code:    There is a thin (2px: 1px grey and a 1px darkgray line) border between  tabstrip and toolbar. Can you remove this? Because it ruins the fancy  chromium :)    Thanks for reading! </pre>
