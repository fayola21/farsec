<title>Issue 7182 -   chromium -    After a crash there should be an option to open startup tabs OR previous tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;          Firefox 3: OK        1. Open few tabs  2. Windows freezes  3. Kill Chrome by Task manager.      Open Chrome with tabs opened before crash like Firefox does.      Open Chrome with empty tabs or confugured tabs.       </pre>
