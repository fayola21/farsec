<title>Issue 9290 -   chromium -    Tab hides on tabstrip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12445">r12445</a>).    This is tricky to reproduce.    -Have two tabs opened.  -Drag a tab out of tab strip once  hold the transparent image and move to  after &quot;+&quot; button (New Tab) and still hold the transparent image.  -Now  hit Alt+Space bar to show up the windows context menu.    Window's context menu shows up  but the (transparent image) tab does not  show up on tabstrip until the window's context menu is closed.    Screenshot attached.   </pre>
