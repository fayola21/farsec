<title>Issue 3806 -   chromium -    First Run UI doesn't get focus after installation completes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open FF and login into gmail account  2. Open another tab and go to www.google.com/chrome and start installing   Chrome  3. Once the install starts  go to gmail tab  open a chat window and try   typing some text     What is the expected output?   Once the installation completes  First Run UI should get focus. Atleast the   taskbar entry should have a change in color to get user's attention       What do you see instead?  Neither focussed nor change in color will be seen          </pre>
