<title>Issue 9845 -   chromium -    Redesign download shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1  This isn't a defect  it's a feature request :)    So I was wondering if it would be too much to ask  but I think that the   download shelf can be greatly improved upon what we have now.  There are multiple issues related to this one  such as i9025  i9023  i8966    i8542  i4823  i60  and probably others.    So here's the suggestion:  Instead of opening a new downloads info bar at the bottom of the html page    we'd just show downloaded files as tabs at the bottom of the window. So each   time a user downloads a file  it shows as a new tab; clicking that tab opens   an about:-style window which shows:    - for a generic file: its filename  size  location  downloaded%/estimated   download time/options to pause/resume download  options to save file to a   different location or to delete it  good old &quot;show in folder&quot;  big button   &quot;RUN&quot; if it's an executable  list of Windows actions associated with this   file type (Open With)    - for certain file types (such as html/jpeg/gif/png/ etc.): it opens that   file directly in browser window; whereas the options to   save/rename/delete/etc are retained via the context menu on the tab itself.    Most importantly: each file-tab features a nice shiny &quot;x&quot; button which   deletes the file forever (or at least puts it into the Recycle Bin).   Similarly  middle-mouse-click would also trash the file.   This way downloaded files will behave similarly to other web content:   whenever you close the file  it's &quot;gone&quot;  it's deleted (perhaps after some   time). If you'd rather keep that file then you need to take specific action   to preserve it  not the other way round (and keeping all files in a single   Downloads directory is a bad idea anyways --- it becomes cluttered way too   fast).
