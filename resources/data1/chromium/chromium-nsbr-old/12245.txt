<title>Issue 12245 -   chromium -    Importing search engines fails from FF ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've been experiencing this problem since quite a long time  but finally  decided to go for it.    I can reproduce this issue on my XP (x32)  Win-7 (x64) and few other's  machines also.    -Import settings (thr FRUI or import settings) from FireFox 3.x    I don't see the FF's search engines imported to Chrome.    I believe  we are not regressed here (as on Mitch's machine  it can't be  reproduced)  but I'm sure some race condition is missing here  as it  reproduces on most of the machines VERY consistenly.   </pre>
