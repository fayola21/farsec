<title>Issue 18048 -   chromium -    Back button not available sometimes when navigating inside a frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open the following URL <a href="http://tinyurl.com/m65xrp">http://tinyurl.com/m65xrp</a>  as you can see we have  A. a small frame at the top which belong to some news.fresh.co.il news site  B. the main fame showing an Israeli news site (News1)    2. In the page  click one of the links i marked (with purple arrows) here:  <a href="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/6313/chromebackq.jpg">http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/6313/chromebackq.jpg</a>  (the text will change but the position/color of those links should stay the   same)  3. try to go back        according to <a title="History page not updated when navigating inside a frame" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17215"> Issue 17215 </a>  the navigated links should not appear in the   History page but they should appear for the back button as they do in the   link posted in <a title="History page not updated when navigating inside a frame" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17215"> Issue 17215 </a>... i don't know what makes this page act differently    not all the links in that page will have that problem (although i didn't   mark all of them) and i saw this problem when other news sites populate   that frame too </pre>
