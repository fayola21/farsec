<title>Issue 11285 -   chromium -    Vista Aero: Checkboxes should be middle aligned with labels - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the Options dialog on Vista with Aero enabled.     Notice that checkboxes (Show home button on toolbar  for example) are aligned   with the baseline of the label. They should be center aligned.    View the Internet Properties control panel to see that checkboxes are   typically middle aligned with their labels. </pre>
