<title>Issue 9675 -   chromium -    Drop-down box with non-ascii chars selects the item from the list for any keyinput. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is chrome specific and not a regression.    -Go to a drop-down box with non-ascii character (for eg: drop-down in  google.com/chrome webapge)  -Click on drop-down box to expand the list and highlight any item in the  list and press any key (except letter 's').    Notice: after pressing a key  the highlighted item gets selected for the  drop-down box though the list is expanded.    With other browsers: this use case is ignored.          </pre>
