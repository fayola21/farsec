<title>Issue 139 -   chromium -    Youtube showing &quot;video no longer available&quot; in ALL videos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg</a> and every   video in YouTube           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Enter YouTube.com  2. Try to see any video  3. Profit! Er... error  I mean.      To be able to watch the video.      Error &quot;We're sorry  this video is no longer available&quot; appears. It appears   in *every* video  even in the YouTube classic &quot;Evolution of dance&quot; (URL   above).    I guess this is not happening to other people  since I couldn't locate any   related bug. Anyway I found out that some people is having problems with   YouTube  but performance problems  so they are not getting this kind of   error. So I don't know exactly what could be happening.  </pre>
