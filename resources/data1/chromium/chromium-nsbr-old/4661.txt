<title>Issue 4661 -   chromium -    Download manager changes default behaviour to windows users. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.23      1. Download any file and look at the bottom bar with downloaded button   file.      When I click on that button  it should be only selected. Because it looks   exactly like a file in an windows explorer and in windows explorer it gets   just selected. If you want to open that file with one click  then the name   of file should be underlined. Beside this I should have ability to popup   context menu on clicking with right mouse button on any part of that   button. Not just on triangle on the right.  Treat UI not like new system to learn  but like another Tool in a native to    user system.      Not intuitive to Windows Users behaviour after clicking on that button.   Because button doesn't look like a button but like an extracted position in    Windows Explorer.  Getting the context popup menu is only posible on clicking on the right.         </pre>
