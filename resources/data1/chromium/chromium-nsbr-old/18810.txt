<title>Issue 18810 -   chromium -    Middle-click should remove item from download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Recently  a feature was added to remove items from the download bar (Not   remove them from the filesystem). To maintain consistency with tabs  I   request that middle-clicking an item on the download bar should be the same   as clicking the &quot;Remove from list&quot; option. </pre>
