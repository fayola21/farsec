I believe this bug may highlight a glitch in webkit  since IE and FF both agree on a much different rendering from safari and  chrome.    On chrome/safari the content on the following webpage is right aligned  but  with IE/FF it is left aligned.  We believe it may be related to wrapping of  the really long &quot;Quote&quot; field.    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?user=rrkgroups5%40gmail.com&amp;qt_a=Look+up+author">http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?user=rrkgroups5%40gmail.com&amp;qt_a=Look+up+author</a>    jonc on October 23 2008 17:46 (Accepted)  Assignee:  jonc  Hotlist:   Chrome  file_in_chromium    Need to file this in Chromium and WebKit.
