<title>Issue 7206 -   chromium -    Regression: WMP doesn't load on mako.co.il - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Navigate to:   <a href="http://www.mako.co.il/news/politics-news/israel/Articles/itemId=e56dbe8efa32f110VgnVCM100000290c10acRCRD">http://www.mako.co.il/news/politics-news/israel/Articles/itemId=e56dbe8efa32f110VgnVCM100000290c10acRCRD</a>    On the release branch:  The video player works fine.    On tip of trunk:  A message is displayed on a gray background offering to install Windows  Media Player.    This site is really popular in Israel so releasing a version of Chrome that  breaks it would be unfortunate. </pre>
