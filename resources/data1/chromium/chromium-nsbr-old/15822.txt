<title>Issue 15822 -   chromium -    Restore crashes if non-existent files are restored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to some file: URL that does not exist  2. Kill Chrome  3. Restart Chrome  4. Choose to restore the previous session        Not sure what is expected - presumably a tab with an error in it.    What I get: a crash  with this assertion:    [9589:9589:510404888452:FATAL:chrome/browser/tab_contents/navigation_controller.cc(533)]  Check failed: !GetActiveEntry(). Got an invalid page ID but we seem to be   navigated to a valid page. This should be impossible.    This may be related to this issue:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14136">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14136</a>.    Only tested on Linux. Only tested with file: URLs.   </pre>
