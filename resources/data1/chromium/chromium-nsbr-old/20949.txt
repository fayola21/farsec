<title>Issue 20949 -   chromium -    Tab won't load and cause 100% CPU usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes  when working with many tabs  a random tab will not load   correctly and just display a white screen. Not only this  but it will take   up 100% of the CPU until closed. Reopening the tab with ctrl+shift+T will   make the tab work properly.    Chrome Version       : Google Chrome latest testing DEB  OS + version : Xubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Xfce 4  URLs (if applicable): doesn't matter  seems to happen randomly  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): tabs open normally      1. Keep browsing sites for a while  open several tabs in a short while  2. Check the new tabs.  3. They will usually open up fine  but occasionally a tab will just display   whiteness  no matter whether the actual page was supposed to be loaded or   not. CPU will spike to the maximum on the CPU.  4. To restore  close and reopen tab. Trying to refresh the tab won't work   (I believe).      The tab should load normally.      See above.      Other important information:  I'm running the AdSweep extension from adsweep.org and the Flash blocker   extension from that same site. I also run Chrome with --enable-plugins and   --enable-extensions.    The bug seems to be triggered more quickly when it's still loading  or when   there's a Flash applet on the page. </pre>
