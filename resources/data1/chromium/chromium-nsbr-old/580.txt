<title>Issue 580 -   chromium -    Java Applet to JavaScript communication (liveconnect) is not working. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : -           Safari 3: DK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Embed simple java applet with a string setter function in an html page.  2. Write a JS script that tries to set that filed.  3. Run it.      Success in setting the String inside the java code.      Error in JS  claiming the applet does not have the given setter method.    ------------  I'm adding a small example of a java file and html file. Works in FF3 and   IE6  not in   Google Chrome.  (Compile with any version you'd like  I tried with java 1.5)    The files should be in the same folder (the .class and .html). </pre>
