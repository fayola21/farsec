<title>Issue 3835 -   chromium -    Pages that take too long to load won't have their content indexed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   The reported test case was this page:  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/04/brangelina.photos/index.ht">http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/04/brangelina.photos/index.ht</a>  ml  and then searching for &quot;Brad&quot;. There will sometimes be no match  and if you   search for something in the title like &quot;images&quot;  there will be a match but   with no content snippet.    The problem here is that we don't get the full text of the page in less   than 20 seconds after the navigation happened. This can happen if parts of   the page are very slow to load. This also explains why it sometimes works   and sometimes not on this slow page.    We should have some fallback  if we get full text for a page that isn't in   the recent data list in TextDatabaseManager  we should go look up the last   visit and associate the new content with it.
