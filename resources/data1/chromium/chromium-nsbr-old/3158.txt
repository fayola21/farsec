<title>Issue 3158 -   chromium -    Raw Punycode is displayed though it should not be - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;b/1373310&gt;    We received a feedback from Japanese beta users regarding IDN support.    Though IDN is supported by Chrome  sometimes IDN is displayed as raw   Punycode (xn-xxxxxx) in the address bar.    If IDN contains any of Kanji characters that are defined as &quot;Ordinal   purpose&quot;  it is displayed as raw Punycode.  If IDN contains Cho-on &quot;��_��__&quot;    Chuten &quot;��_�_&quot;  repeat symbol &quot;��_��_��_&quot;  etc. it's also displayed as raw punycode.    Following sites are affected:  &lt;http://__��__��_��___��_.jp/  &lt;http://��___��_��_��___��_.jp/  &lt;http://_��_��___��_��_��__��_��_��___��_.jp/  &lt;http://_��_��_��___��_.jp/  &lt;http://��_��__��___��__��__��___��_.jp/    Environment:  Chrome 0.2.149.29  Accept-language: ja  us_en  UI language: Japanese    Suspicious function:  In UnicodeSet::containsAll()  following code exist (from Chromium.org   source tree):       for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {         if (!contains(c.getRangeStart(i)  c.getRangeEnd(i))) {             return FALSE;         }    !contains(c.getRangeStart(i)  c.getRangeEnd(i)) fails for IDNs listed   above.  As I didn't dig in  I'm not sure if this icu38 function has a   problem  but I commented out this section  it worked fine.  Of course  it   might cause some other issue (security issue by mixed scripts?).    Other examples are:  http://��_�_/  http://_��_��_/  http://��_��_��_/  http://��_��_��_/  http://��_��_��_/  http://��_��__/    These sites don't exist  but you can see they are displayed as raw   punycode in the status bar at the bottom of Chrome. </pre>
