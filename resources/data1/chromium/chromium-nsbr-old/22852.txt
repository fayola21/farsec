<title>Issue 22852 -   chromium -    parse errors aren't logged to the console on refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load the attach page in Chrome. Notice that a parse error is logged to the   console. Hit refresh. The page just spins for ever  never logging an error.    For reference  Safari logs and error each time and completes loading the page.    This is driving me crazy. :) </pre>
