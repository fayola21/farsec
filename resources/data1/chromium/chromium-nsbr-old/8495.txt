<title>Issue 8495 -   chromium -    Gmail: Click focuses email instead of opening - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Report from Linus:    When he switches to a label in Gmail  sometimes the first click on a   message just focuses the subject instead of opening the message. (Ie  there   is a focus ring around the Subject.) A second click opens the message.    This does not happen 100% of the time. </pre>
