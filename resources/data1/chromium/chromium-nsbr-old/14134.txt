<title>Issue 14134 -   chromium -    javascript printing not working anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Chrome 2.0  you could use javascript to print  like so:      &lt;body&gt;    &lt;script&gt;window.print();&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;    In tip of tree  this seems to be broken. Also  if you try this from the Omnibox:      javascript:window.print();    You'll see Visual Studio says:      The thread 'Printing_Worker' (0x307c) has exited with code 0 (0x0).    But no print dialog is seen.  </pre>
