<title>Issue 8611 -   chromium -    automation_provider.cc should not use URLRequestMockHttpJob - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/browser/automation/automation_provider.cc is using  URLRequestMockHttpJob directly  which requires building  url_request_mock_http_job.cc into libbrowser.a.    We're trying to move all mocks into a separate libtest_support.a library so  they don't have to ship in the production code.    This will require some change to have the unit tests push the mocker in  instead of relying on its availability at build time. When this happens   browser/automation/url_request_mock_http_job.cc should be moved from the  'browser' target to the 'test_support' target in chrome.gyp.  (Comments in  chrome.gyp already identify where this should take place.)   </pre>
