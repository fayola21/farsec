<title>Issue 1673 -   chromium -    Color profile is unloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : .2.149.29 (1798)    Chromium unloads the color profiles for my monitor that my Spyder software  has loaded. The effect of this affects the whole system  not only chromium.        Calibrate monitor with Spyder express.  Start chromium.      Colors stay the same after chromium start.      All color return to uncalibrated state. Wrong colors in all applications.   </pre>
