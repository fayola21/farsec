<title>Issue 20096 -   chromium -    Should be able to drag tabs to docked (miniaturized) windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 203.0 (Developer Build 24091)  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): nope  but it should (it sure feels like it should)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): haha  fat chance (it looks like it will  but it doesn't)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Minimize/miniaturize a browser window (yellow button)  so that it (well  an icon of it) appears   in the Dock.  2. Create a new window  possibly a bunch of tabs as well.  3. Drag the tab over the icon of the window from 1. in the dock  and release.    What is the &quot;expected&quot; result?  It should move the tab to that window from 1. (Probably there should be some   animation/transformation to indicate when you're &quot;over&quot; the icon in the Dock.)      Nothing. (Well  you end up with a window with a single tab in an awkward place.) </pre>
