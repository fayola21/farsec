<title>Issue 18835 -   chromium -    GTK+ theme fails to show navigation icons on toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Opening the browser  2. Navigating to another window  3. Navigating to another web page      That with the GTK+ theme  I should be able to see my icons in the toolbar.      It looks as if gray is covering the back/forward  reload  home  and   bookmark icons. I know they are there because I can see the very bottom of   each icon even when they're not fully visible. Moving the mouse cursor over   them makes them fully visible until a new page is loaded or another window   on the desktop is selected  in which case they mostly disappear again and I   must mouse over the buttons once again in order to see them. This issue is   eliminated when the theme is switched back to the default Chrome theme.    <b>Please provide
