<title>Issue 17726 -   chromium -    Feature Request - Spell-check suggestion and other word recognition suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : N/A             Safari 4: NOT TESTED    Firefox 3.5: FAIL           IE 8: UBER FAIL (spell checking not working on the site)           IE 7: UBER FAIL (same as above)    LOL  it took me 5 mins to find a site to test this on other browsers :P  This is the site I used for reference:- <a href="http://www.editpad.org/">http://www.editpad.org/</a>      Feature Requested:-  Spell check should auto fix common mistakes like beleive (to believe) and google (to Google)   instead of just underlining it with red...    and also words with only one suggestion should be auto-changed and in this case doing ctrl+z   would undo to change...?    Heck it can also be taken to the next level by checking common grammar mistakes?(like tenses   should match and the likes) or is that to complicated? (BTW this isn't really required)    another nice addition would be known acronyms should be auto-capitalized... and if the mouse is   brought over one of these the full form would be displayed in a small pop-up box (like the   hover-on text box  don't know what it is called)?    and how about simile integration right into chromium? (like it is gTalk?)  so &quot;:)&quot; would appear like it does in gTalk? (another low-priority add-on  but it will surely   make things look better and the code can be taken from gTalk itself? if Google approves that   is...) </pre>
