<title>Issue 14498 -   chromium -    Search field on US Apple store doesn't look right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.189.0 (Official Build 18569)  URL: <a href="http://store.apple.com/us">http://store.apple.com/us</a>      Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.5 RC: OK        1. Go to the US Apple store web site.        The search field should look the same way it does on Apple's home page   (www.apple.com)  which looks the same as it does in Safari 4.        It looks like the search field is shown on top of another  larger search field. (See   screenshot -- it's hard to describe.) </pre>
