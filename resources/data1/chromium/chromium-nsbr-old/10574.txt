<title>Issue 10574 -   chromium -    Flash should install without requiring a browser restart or admin rights - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  Flash requires Chrome to close so that it can install.  This is   for several reasons: Flash may need to replace its DLL (which may be   locked)  and Chrome doesn't know to re-load its plugin list.     In theory  Chrome could look for Flash to install  and then know to refresh   its plugin list.  This would require a change to Flash's installer to not   require Chrome to close  however.    We should work with Adobe to create integration between Chrome and Flash   that doesn't require a restart of Chrome.       </pre>
