<title>Issue 6143 -   chromium -    Chrome getting updated for a user even when chrome.exe is active in another user session. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ***Vista with UAC On***    1. Install system level Chrome 1.0.154.42 and launch Chrome.  2. Change your settings so that you have an update to 2.0.156.1  3. Log into NonAdmin  launch Chrome and go to Wrench &gt; About Google Chrome  4. Update Chrome by clicking Update Now button and elevating privileges.      Closing Chrome and opening it again should give the updated version.   Instead we see the old version as it isn't closed in Admin account.     </pre>
