<title>Issue 18063 -   chromium -    When an update is pending install (need to restart)  turning/logging off Windows makes a mess - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. when chrome is waiting for you to close it so it can update to the already   downloaded new version... Log off windows instead      An error popup saying setup cannot start because windows is shutting down   (setup? what setup? the user doesn't even know he was updated unless he accidentally opened the about box and even that not clear)    afterwards  another error will pop up saying chrome is not responding to   windows closing it and needs to be closed more brutally </pre>
