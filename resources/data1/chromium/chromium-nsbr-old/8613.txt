<title>Issue 8613 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/transitions/transition-end-event-* are flakey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> They used to be flaky for a long while. Then they weren't for a while.  Today they all started being flaky again after a buildbot master restart   not a code change.    Marking as a P2 since we don't want to block the next release on  transitions tests. </pre>
