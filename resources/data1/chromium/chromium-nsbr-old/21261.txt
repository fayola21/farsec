<title>Issue 21261 -   chromium -    Run mac slaves as non-admin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many tests leaks a lot of files on the system  this includes prefs* files in   the root checkout directory (all platforms)  %USERPROFILE%Local   SettingsApplication DataChromium* files (win); files left in %TEMP% (all   platforms).    It'd be better to have the tests fail when a test tries to write to places it   isn't supposed to. This can be achieved by using different credentials.    Implementation:  On Vista we could use Low-IL.  On both XP and Vista  we could use a lower-privilege user with 'runas'.  On linux/mac we could use a lower-privilege user with 'sudo -i -u guest'     or something else (?) </pre>
