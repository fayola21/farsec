<title>Issue 7581 -   chromium -    personal.vanguard.com fails with WebKit 530.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Chrome 160.0 or later (UA string includes Safari/530.0)    Visit <a href="http://personal.vanguard.com/">http://personal.vanguard.com/</a>  Click Go to the site &gt;&gt;    EXPECTED:  Site loads.    ACTUAL:  &quot;Your browser is not supported&quot; message.    NOTE:  Change AppleWebKit/ and Safari/ to 528.11 (prior WebKit ver #) in your UA   string  and the site works.    It looks like they're sniffing both values. This probably breaks with   WebKit nightlies also.    I'm marking this as a Regression since the fallout is caused by the change   we made to the User-Agent header.   </pre>
