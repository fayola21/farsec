<title>Issue 22277 -   chromium -    Config mistakenly stored in ~ on error case - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="Passwords saved plaintext and world-readable" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22241"> issue 22241 </a>  they wrote:  [...] apparently if Chrome can't write to ~/.config  it puts the profile   directory under ~ instead.    This is probably some helpful fallback in the PathService code.  We need to   kill it with fire. </pre>
