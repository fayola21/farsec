<title>Issue 11926 -   chromium -    Middle-click inside extension leaves paint artifact - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Middle-click inside of the buildbot-extension -- be sure not to click one of   the green/red boxes  but rather the space above it.    This places the auto-scroll cursor and you are able to autoscroll that view.    Now  if you click outside of the buildbot view  the autoscroll icon remains.        The attached image shows the cursor icon artifact that remains. </pre>
