<title>Issue 338 -   chromium -    Feature request: Open from location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    In other browsers  there is the ability to not download files to a stored   folder on the user's hard drive  but instead to open the file type from   location.  This is disabled for certain file types in Firefox (.exe for   example)  but in general  allows for quick execution of certain files   without going through the extra steps of downloading the file  running it    and then deleting the file afterwards.    With Chrome  this option is unavailable.  Torrent files (which are   generally not useful as stand-alone files) are downloaded and kept in the   download folder  .zip and .rar files are sometimes only downloaded for the   contents (with no interest in compressed storage).    The option to automatically open files after downloading exists  but it   still places the file in the download folder. </pre>
