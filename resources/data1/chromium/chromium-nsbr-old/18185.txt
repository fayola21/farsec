<title>Issue 18185 -   chromium -    Need option to disable any first run bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the only options are big bubble vs. little bubble.  Can we have an   option for no bubble?  We want to experiment in our UX studies with first run   pages that include education about the omnibox and currently the bubble sits   on top of those pages.    Thanks   Jason </pre>
