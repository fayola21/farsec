<title>Issue 3682 -   chromium -    Drag and Drop from Maximized window always gets the default window size instead of unmaximized size. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:0.3.154.6 (Official Build 3810)  Sorry  if it is dupe.    The drag and drop from a maximized window always get the default window   size  instead of its un-maximized size.      1. Open two browser windows say W1 and W2.  2. Maximize W1 and make W2 as small window.  3. Drag and drop a tab from W1 (maximized ) to a new window.    Notice the new window gets the default window size instead of the size of   W2's.           </pre>
