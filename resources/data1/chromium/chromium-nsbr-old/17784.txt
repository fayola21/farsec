<title>Issue 17784 -   chromium -    Windows do not have titles like other apps (Expose  Witch) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	196.0 (Developer Build 21634)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.196 Safari/532.0      1.  Install Witch (<a href="http://www.manytricks.com/witch/">http://www.manytricks.com/witch/</a>)  2.  Notice that Chromium windows do not show up under Witch's window list      Chromium Windows would show up in Witch's window list.    This issue is specific to a freeware mac utility  but I believe that it's representative of a larger   problem.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Chromium windows also don't work properly with   accessibility.   </pre>
