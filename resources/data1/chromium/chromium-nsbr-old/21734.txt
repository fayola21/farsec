<title>Issue 21734 -   chromium -    Centralized extension error console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  extension errors can get reported a number of places -- the   developer console for a web page (content scripts)  the console for an   extension view  or to the command line (on linux/mac) or an alert box   (windows) for manifest errors.    It would be nice to have a centralized extension error console.    We used to have this in chrome://extensions/ but it didn't work very well  so   we removed it. We should bring it back but make it work well. </pre>
