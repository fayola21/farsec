Launch Chrome  2. Look at the resulting page.  3. Notice most text rendered as either an 'A' in a box or a crossed 'A' in a   box.  4. Go to any other URL (for example   <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/mac-known-">http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/mac-known-</a>  issues).  5. Look at the resulting page.      - Page text characters rendered properly.      - Lot's of little boxed A's.   </pre>
