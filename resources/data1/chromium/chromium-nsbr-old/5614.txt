<title>Issue 5614 -   chromium -    Download time and speed is incorrect if I click about a few seconds (minutes) on Save button in &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    I have configured a prompting where I can save the download.    If I want to download a file  which size is for example 100MB  and I click   on &quot;Save&quot; button in Save dialog about 8 minutes and my download speed is   100kBps  download is 50% completed. So time to finishing download is   approximately 8 minutes. But Chrome show download speed few Mbps and   completion time few seconds and this is incorrect.  I think the Chrome calculate the speed from a downloaded piece of entire   download size  and the starting time in calculations is a time when I click   on Save button and not a time when the &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog is opened.      Time to end of downloading must be calculated from real speed and not from   downloaded piece size and time of downloading these piece.      I know  I know... my english is so bad... sorry </pre>
