<title>Issue 10279 -   chromium -    window.top shadowing differs between JSC and V8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   The v8 bindings allow shadowing of all properties on the global  object.  If you use 'var prop = value' you will get a new variable  named prop that shadows builtin properties on the global object.  This behavior is consistent and I'm reluctant to make the massive  change that would be needed to implement the inconsistent handling  of this that KJS has (some properties can be shadowed and others  can't).  This should have low priority.  We currently match IE and the plan was to convince KJS to change  post-beta  but the bug is here:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16644">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16644</a>   and it's unclear  what the resolution was.  window-property-shadowing-name.html has also been affected by  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=8532">r8532</a> and now fails.
