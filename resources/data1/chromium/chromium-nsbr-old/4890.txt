<title>Issue 4890 -   chromium -    Move Bookmark Manager to Tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: NOT TESTED      1. Open the Bookmark manager.      Open it in new tab.      It opens in the new window.    What happened to &quot;One box for everything&quot; ?  I think it's not hard to move the Bookmark manager to the tab.  If possible  find a way to put the web inspector inside the same active   window.    That way  Chrome will be the real &quot;One box for everything&quot;.   </pre>
