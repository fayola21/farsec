<title>Issue 863 -   chromium -    Cannot jump to an arbitrary point on the scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Chrome Beta            Firefox 3: Can shift-click on windows platforms. I believe the gesture  on unix platforms is middle-click (control-click as alternative) as of Fx  2  have not tested Fx 3. Do not recall exact gesture on Mac.           IE 7: Can shift-click or right-click to menu.      1. Shift-click or right-click on the scrollbar      Expected that either shift-click will jump to the point where the mouse  pointer is or a &quot;scroll to here&quot; entry or similar will appear in the  right-click menu.      Shift-click acts as normal click  right-click yields same menu as for  document body. </pre>
