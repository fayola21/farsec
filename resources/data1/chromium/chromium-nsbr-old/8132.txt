<title>Issue 8132 -   chromium -    about:version shows JSC version  not V8 version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FileVersionInfo does two things that are similar on Windows but very   distinct on Linux.  1) get version info about the current binary  2) get version info about plugins and other processes (used in   about:memory)    For 1:  We canonically store the version of Chromium in chrome/VERSION.  On Windows  the build system translates that into a .rc file and it   eventually gets packaged up into the binary.  Then at runtime we query that   info out of the binary using FileVersionInformation.    Linux doesn't have per-file version info.  I believe we should change the   build so that chrome/VERSION is compiled into a header file and implement   the Linux-specific CreateFileVersionInfoForCurrentModule to return values   out of that header file.    For 2:  Remove all usage of CreateFileVersionInfo that tries to ask for info from   an arbitrary file  instead writing an abstraction layer around it. </pre>
