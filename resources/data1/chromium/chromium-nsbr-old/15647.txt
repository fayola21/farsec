<title>Issue 15647 -   chromium -    Renavigation of the tab does not remove workers queued for start - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Save attached files to disk.  2. Load refresh_me.html. This page creates 32 workers. Each worker which is  actually started prints a message 'ping'. So you should see 16 'pings'. The  other 16 workers are placed into the queue.  3. Refresh the page (F5). You should see exactly the same result as before  - all 32 workers created by the page should disappear  and when page loades  second time it should create new 32 workers  and then get 16 'pings'.  Instead  the 16 workers left from the first page start and all 32 new  workers get into the queue.     </pre>
