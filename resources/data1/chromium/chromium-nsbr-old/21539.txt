<title>Issue 21539 -   chromium -    Bring out a simple Language selection dropdown to Under-the-hood for quick language setting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a simple way to set a &quot;Language&quot; for Chrome  which would    in a broad sense  mean the main language that the user uses while using   Chrome. This language is associated with Chrome UI language  spell check   languages and the accept languages.    Similarly  there should a simple way of setting font &quot;zoom level&quot; or &quot;font   size&quot;  by which the user just sets the size to the comfort level  without   bothering about the details about the font families for serif  sans serif   or fixed width fonts  since these details are not often understood by most   users.    These options should be in a simple section in the under-the-hood tab. If   the user wants to make more detailed settings  a button click should take   them to the existing fonts and language dialog. </pre>
