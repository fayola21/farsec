<title>Issue 7235 -   chromium -    Chrome: provide way to limit high memory/CPU usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0    I recently reached limits of Chrome (and of my PC) in terms of memory  usage: saved session makes Chrome use ~3G of RAM (while PC has only 2G :-) ).  (And no  I did not push it to the limits intentionally :-) )    With that session in hand  Chrome entirely freezes my PC with Core Duo  1.8GHz in a matter of minutes after restart of Chrome--and there's no  (obvious) way to manage it  except killing the entire session and starting  over with an empty set of tabs (thus loosing all the unread news and blog  entries).    Not sure what can be the best solution--self-diagnostics of total memory  used (and suggestion to load part of session later  when user switches to  the tabs that did not fit into the memory available); command-line switch  to run in Low priority (although it has nothing to do with RAM); something  else. </pre>
