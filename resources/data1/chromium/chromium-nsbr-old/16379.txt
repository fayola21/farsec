<title>Issue 16379 -   chromium -    omnibar fails to search by partial URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit a URL so that it is in your history. In my case I went to   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/source/browse/trunk/python/t">http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/source/browse/trunk/python/t</a>  ransitfeed.py  2. open a new tab and type transitfeed.py into the omnibar  3. the only suggestion is transitfeed.py - Google Search      Because transitfeed.py is part of a URL in my history it should be   suggested. I can only get the omnibar to show this url by typing   code.google.com.      Please provide
