<title>Issue 2731 -   chromium -    JIRA Link doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a friend:    From the JIRA bug tracking system  (<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a>).   I just noticed  that although  everything seems to render fine  the resolve (read ��_��_��_now it��_��_��_s fixed  damn  it��_��_��_) link doesn��_��_��_t work in Chrome.  IE and Firefox do work.   I��_��_��_ve attached  a screenshot of the failing link.     The JIRA bug database is public:  <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-16797">http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-16797</a>.   I don��_��_��_t think you��_��_��_ll be able  to see links like ��_��_��_resolve��_��_��_ though  since you wouldn��_��_��_t have an account.   </pre>
