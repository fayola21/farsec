Open a new chrome window  2. Go to options &gt; about chrome or (you can go to a site that opens a popup  window  i.e. <a href="http://echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm">http://echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm</a> and click on &quot;go to yahoo&quot;      What is the expected output?     What do you see instead?  The top of the chrome window ha a thick gray border and the controls on top  right (for minimize  maximize and close) are truncated. See attached  screenshot.      This seems to happen only on Vista and not on XP.   Enviromment (Vista VMWare)  (tested against 2 vmware images)       </pre>
