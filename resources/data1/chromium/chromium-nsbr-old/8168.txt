<title>Issue 8168 -   chromium -    onbeforeunload handlers cause tabs to not close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's possible to end up with tabs you can't close because their   onbeforeunload handlers result in the browser trying to contact them  but   they're gone for any number of reasons. This is very bad from a UX point of   view. There are some TODOs in the browser code to implement a timeout   before shooting the renderer. These should be implemented. </pre>
