<title>Issue 3819 -   chromium -    Errant &quot;domain not found&quot; cached when DNS Prefetching is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This problem was reported by a blogger on:    <a href="http://www.xxeo.com/archives/2008/10/27/problems-with-google-chrome-try-">http://www.xxeo.com/archives/2008/10/27/problems-with-google-chrome-try-</a>  this.html    The poster indicated that he was getting a lot of &quot;name not found&quot; DNS   resolutions (incorrectly)  and caching them.  Once they were cached  he   then went 5-15 minutes before he could visit these (effectively) black   listed sites.    He reported that he was able to resolve the problem by a) disabling the DNS   Prefetch feature; b) flushing his OS cache via &quot;ipconfig /flushdns&quot;.  He   didn't indicate if he also restarted Chromium.    I'm going to post to the blog and ask that he add some details to this   report.    He mentioned he was ussing ATT DSL  and Windows XP OS.    I'd like to hear what router he's using  as there is a chance that the   router is &quot;overloaded&quot; by the series of DNS resolutions done by Chrome  and   begins to (errantly) return &quot;no such name&quot; responses.  Once XP gets such a   resolution  I *think* it only caches those negative resolutions for less   than a minute...but... the network stack (inside Chromium) that we're using   may cache it for closer to 30 minutes!  That secondary application cache is   possibly the reason why IE (which uses the same network stack library) has   the &quot;feature&quot; of ignoring TTL (Time To Live) data in a DNS resolution.    [Side note: Chromium in currently replacing the network stack  and will   eventually have different features and response... so this bug may be   closed once we've completed     There is also a possibility that the user's ISP is returning errant &quot;name   not found&quot; results.  However  I would have expected that such errant   results would result in a lot of bug reports on this... which I have yet to   see.    The post also tangentially mentioned wikipedia  which usually has a LOT of   domain names on each page (commonly one for each country served).  I just   visited their home page  and saw that Chromium prefetches about 19 domain   names as a consequence of a visit :-/.  Users can go to &quot;about:dns&quot; to see   the counts before and after (you have to do a page refresh after to update   the stats).  It is possible that the visit to wikipedia tickles some sort   of overload bug in the user's LAN's DNS resolver (commonly internal to the   router).    Bottom line: I'd like to get more info from the poster  or others that   encounter this class of problem.     </pre>
