<title>Issue 9233 -   chromium -    Need new  alternative first-run bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  Chrome has a &quot;bubble&quot; that appears on first run  and points to   the omnibox with instructions on how to search  and a method for changing   the default (or imported) search provider.    This bubble works fine now  but doesn't work in some distribution   circumstances.  For instance   * The bubble may cover a partner's landing page  * The search may be preset to Google (and shouldn't be changed)  * Chrome may launch behind a partner's application  which means the bubble   disappears as soon as Chrome gains focus    These issues reflect the need for an improved  streamlined bubble that has   less text and slightly different behavior than it does now.    Specifically:    1.  The new bubble should have much less text  here:  &quot;New!  You can search right from the address bar:&quot;  &quot;Try it out - type &lt;b&gt;orchids&lt;/b&gt; and press enter.&quot;    2.  The bubble should have a close &quot;[X]&quot; so users can manually close it if   they so choose.    3.  The bubble should only vanish if the user closes via the &quot;[X]&quot; or the   user types something in the omnibox.    4.  The bubble should be driven by a configuration option in the   master_preferences file  which in turn is driven by the installerdata   passed by Omaha; only those Chrome installations that have a &quot;mini_bubble&quot;   : true configuration option should show this alternative bubble on startup.    See the mock for more information. </pre>
