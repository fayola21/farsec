<title>Issue 3161 -   chromium -    Create application shortcuts: Dialog title &quot;Google Gears&quot; is confusing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;b/1393643&gt;    Steps to Repro:  1. Open a web site which is not Gears-aware.  2. Menu ��_��_��_ [Create application shortcuts].  3. Dialog pops up.    ### PROBLEM ###  Although the current web site is not Gears-aware  the dialog title   is ��_��_��_Google Gears��_��_��_.  This title leads tech-savvy users to expect any web site to work offline.  In case of novice users  they have no idea what this dialog title means.    ### EXPECTED ###  Something less confusing. (maybe ��_��_��_Google Chrome��_��_��_ or ��_��_��_Create application   shortcuts��_��_��_)    Note:  This problem was reported by a Japanese tech magazine editor.    Chrome 0.2.149.30. (Still repro on 0.3.154.0) </pre>
