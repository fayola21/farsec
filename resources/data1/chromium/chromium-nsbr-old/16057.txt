<title>Issue 16057 -   chromium -    Hovering the links in image map doesn't show the status bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3 (Build oficial 19935)  URL: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit_view.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit_view.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Load the reference URL (warning  it could be split in two lines)  2. Take the mouse over a clickable zone of the image map (in the example there are three   zones: the Sun and two planets).      The status bar should appear with the URL of the link.      The status bar doesn't appear.    This only seems to happen with image maps. Tried with 3.0.190.4 (Build oficial 19293)  same   result. </pre>
