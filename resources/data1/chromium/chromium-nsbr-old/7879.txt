<title>Issue 7879 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Dragging with single tab is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested on trunk builds 9943 and 9956.    This is a regression  which happened between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9943">r9943</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9956">r9956</a>.  This was  probably a side-effect of the changes in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9953">r9953</a>  where a change to  hit-testing on single tabs is mentioned.        1. Have a browser window open with just one tab in it.   2. Try to drag the tab to another browser window or to docking icon.    What is the expected output?    Tab should go into drag mode.    What do you see instead?    Tab does not go into drag mode  and can't be dropped onto another browser  window or onto docking icon.   </pre>
