<title>Issue 20894 -   chromium -    Chrome should respect explicitly set Accept-Language and not append defaults - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set the Accept-Language to a specific language  aka    xhr.setRequestHeader(&quot;Accept-Language&quot;  &quot;ru&quot;)  2. Send the request and read back the response (xhr.send()    alert(xhr.responseText ))    What is the expected output?  Accept-Language: ru (result from IE 8  FF 3.5  Safari 4)    What do you see instead?  Accept-Language: ru  en-us en    Causes   WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/access-control-basic-  whitelist-request-headers.html to fail since the Accept-Language in the   response does not match. </pre>
