<title>Issue 11514 -   chromium -    'Clear all' in Normal window's Downloads page should empty the page in InCognito window and vice-versa. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   This is exactly same use-case as <a title="Delete history from Incognito mode should refersh the history page " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9984"> issue 9984 </a>  but this is with the downloads  page. Since the previous one is closed and verified  filing this as a new  issue.    -Download a file in Normal window.  -Once the download is finished  open the downloads page in incognito window.  -Click on 'Clear All' link from Normal window's downloads page.    Expected:  The downloads page in Incognito mode should be empty. But it does not.    PS: It should work vice-versa also.   ie. Step3: Click on 'Clear All' link from Incognito window's downloads page.    Expected: Normal window's downloads page should be made empty.    After step3: If I restart Chrome  then downloads page is empty in both  window modes.           </pre>
