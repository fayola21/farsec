<title>Issue 19636 -   chromium -    Omnibox drop-down list should be closed while moving a window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT( r 23628)    -Type foo in Omnibox  -While drop-down list shows up  click and hold on the title bar and move  the browser window.    Result:  Window is moved  but the drop-down list sticks to its original location.    Expected:  We should close the drop-down list  if user clicks on the title bar or any  area as we do in case of windows.    Mac behavior:  The omnibox drop-down list moves along with the window. That looks good  than the Linux version. </pre>
