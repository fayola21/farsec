<title>Issue 7558 -   chromium -    If process priority set by user  Chrome shouldn't change it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0            Firefox 3:OK    I noticed that process priority for chrome.exe processes are changed   automatically  i.e. without user's direct intervention.  As I deal with extremely high CPU and memory usage by Chrome (see <a title="Chrome: provide way to limit high memory/CPU usage"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7235">issue   #7235</a>)  I set up all processes to Low Priority -- and some time later I   find some of the processes to appear as Normal Priority  even though I   don't open new tabs/windows  nor even refresh content of tabs--only switch   between different open tabs.    I believe that process priority  once set by a user  should not be changed   by Chrome itself at any point. </pre>
