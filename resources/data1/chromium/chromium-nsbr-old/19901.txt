<title>Issue 19901 -   chromium -    index of dirty metahandles in syncable directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We now iterate over every metahandle every time a WriteTransaction closes and   every time SaveChanges occurs instead of just the recent &quot;working set&quot; of   handles as before. This has negative perf implications. We might want to keep   an index of dirty metahandles and compute a transitive set of &quot;related&quot;   entries for use in the WriteTransaction  case. </pre>
