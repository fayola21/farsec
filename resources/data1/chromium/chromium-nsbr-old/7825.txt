<title>Issue 7825 -   chromium -    Gainward.com does not draw its menu correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Chrome 1.0.154.48     1. Go to <a href="http://www.gainward.com/main/index.php?lang=en">http://www.gainward.com/main/index.php?lang=en</a>  2. The menu is messed up.    However  using Chrome 2.0.157.0  and masquerading as Firefox  the menu   rendered correctly.  I suspect this is just the site not detecting Chrome's   user-agent correctly.       </pre>
