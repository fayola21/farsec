<title>Issue 12586 -   chromium -    Try to extract alpha channel data from windowless plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try to extra alpha channel data from windowless plugins    It may be possible to extract the alpha channel data from windowless   plugins if we paint once into a white surface and again into a black   surface.    This works provided windowless plugins use the standard method of alpha   compositing their pixels  which seems very likely.    Here's the formula:      C = A * F + (1 - A) * B    where A is the alpha value (from 0-1)  B is the input background pixel  F   is the input foreground pixel  and C is the resultant pixels.  The   windowless plugin knows A and F  and we supply B and can observe C.    If we do two paints  once with B = 0 and again with B = K (some constant)    then we can deduce A as such:    For B = 0  C0 = A * F  For B = K  CK = A * F + (1 - A) * K    Then  CK = C0 + (1 - A) * K  and finally A = 1 - (CK - C0)/K.    The key assumptions here are:  1- That the plugin uses this standard compositing algorithm  2- That the plugin will not vary A and F each time we call into it    The second assumption seems reasonable given the single threaded nature of   NPAPI.  However  it is possible for it to cause problems with some plugins.    If this works  then it means that we could reduce the memory used to   support windowless plugins. </pre>
