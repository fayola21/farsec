<title>Issue 6881 -   chromium -    Ominibox should respect 'shift' key in &lt;Keyword&gt; search UI mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1277731&gt;    While user is in &lt;Keyword&gt; search UI mode  Ominibox should respect shift  key  while it has keyboard focus.    Eg: In such a use case  Shift + Esc to Task Manager that means you are also  exiting from &lt;keyword&gt; search mode along with Task Manager.    PS: Still reproduces on Stable build:  1.0.154.43 (Official Build 7746)   </pre>
