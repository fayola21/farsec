<title>Issue 18981 -   chromium -    Flip4Mac plugin not supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a fairly common plugin  so at some point we'll want to make sure it's   working. I haven't looked into what event and drawing models it uses.    It was crashing before the whitelist went in though  and from the crash log it   looks like it's still QD-based. </pre>
