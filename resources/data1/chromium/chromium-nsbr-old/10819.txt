<title>Issue 10819 -   chromium -    buildbot URL for getting simple list of bot statuses - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be really useful to have an URL on buildbot that you could call to   get status for all of the bots in an easily parseable format (JSON  XML    simple ASCII  whatever).  This would allow us have simple gadgets    extensions  tools  etc. that could display builder status.    Ideally  it would include these features:  - current status of all bots  - status for last revision for a given user (like grid view) (should include   the revision number as well)   </pre>
