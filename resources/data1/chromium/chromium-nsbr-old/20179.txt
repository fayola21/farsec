<title>Issue 20179 -   chromium -    build instructions in chromium site wrong again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The windows build instructions now point people to the windows 7 sdk. They   used to point to the 6.1 sdk.    In other words the order of SDK and SP1 is dependent on what sdk is being   installed. The current instructions read as if 6.1 and 7 are interchangeable.     </pre>
