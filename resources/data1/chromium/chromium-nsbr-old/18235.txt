<title>Issue 18235 -   chromium -    Can't remove cancelled downloads from the download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> using 3.0.197.0 (Developer Build 22243)    a new &quot;Remove from list&quot; feature was added to the download bar and tab.    a small glitch about it is that remove from list is grayed out for cancelled   downloads.    also  you can't remove ongoing downloads from the downloads-bar (which makes   sense) but you CAN remove them from the downloads tab. is that intentional?  btw  removing an ongoing download form the downloads tab also cancels the   download. </pre>
