<title>Issue 21918 -   chromium -    Mac about box is a floater - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Look at the about box.  You know  the one that you can open from the   application menu.      It's a floater.  It shouldn't be a floater.  About boxes don't float above other   windows on the Mac.  Who the hell do we think we are?    It seems that about boxes should be floaters on Windows and GTK  which is   fine for them  but the floater on the Mac feels very non-native to me.      4.0.207.0 official release (207 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25617">r25617</a>) </pre>
