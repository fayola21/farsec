<title>Issue 9498 -   chromium -    Flash crashing when loading gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.0 (12752)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com">http://mail.google.com</a>  Other browsers tested: IE8 (Win7 7057  7068)  Firefox 3.1 b3      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Load gmail.  It doesn't crash every time.  It seems fairly random.  2. After the 'Loading' screen  the gmail tab locks up      This seems like a fairly random failure  but I'm getting it on a regular   basis.  Sometimes I load gmail just fine  and others times I get different   results.  Sometimes the entire browser locks up  and sometimes just the   gmail tab locks up.  If I wait for a little while  Chrome finally tells me   that Flash is unresponsive and tells me that it crashed.  And it's not just   gmail  but that's where it's reproduceable most easily.    This is on a brand new  clean install of Windows 7 x64  build 7057 or build   7068.  Happens on both builds. </pre>
