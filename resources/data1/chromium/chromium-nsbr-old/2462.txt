<title>Issue 2462 -   chromium -    Move Chrome Update COM component (and possibly other things) off of the File thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are currently using the File thread to create a COM component that   receives messages from Google Update as the update/the update check   progresses.     For the COM communication to work  this requires the File thread to have a type of message loop that dispatches Windows MSGs  which it doesn't   otherwise require. Furthermore  usage of the File thread is not ideal as   its tubes might be clogged with expensive file operation - and it is not   designed to be responsive  as Darin points out.    There are potentially other things on the File thread that need to move off   of it as well.   </pre>
