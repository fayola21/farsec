<title>Issue 9863 -   chromium -    Date selection calendar doesn't work on AAA web site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate to the URL given above  2. Click the calendar icon for &quot;Check-in Date:&quot; or &quot;Check-out Date:&quot;  3. A date selection calendar display pops up (correct)  4. Clicking any of the dates or items in the date selection pop up does not   do anything (not correct). On Firefox and IE 7  the date boxes highlight   when the mouse hovers over them  and clicking a date will close the pop up   and enter the date in the corresponding field. None of this happens in   Chrome.        As mentioned in step 4 above  Chrome should highlight the date the mouse   pointer is over and clicking a date should insert the selected date in the   corresponding field on the form. Also  the month should change when the   appropriate buttons on the pop up are clicked. As it is now  they don't.      The date selection calendar widget seems not to get any input from the   mouse. Even the &quot;close&quot; link in the corner of the calendar widget does not   work. The only way to close the pop up for a Chrome user is to click the   web page behind the widget.    <b>Please provide
