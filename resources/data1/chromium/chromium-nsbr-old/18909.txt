<title>Issue 18909 -   chromium -    Find on page: Switching tab loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open google.com (or any other page with text fields) and another page  2. Focus the text field on google.com  3. Switch to the other tab  4. Search for something on the page (do not close the find bar)  5. Switch back to google.com. Focus is lost  and typing goes into the   (hidden) find bar.    This is particularly annoying with gmail chat.    Not tested on Windows. </pre>
