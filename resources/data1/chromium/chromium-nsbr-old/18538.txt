<title>Issue 18538 -   chromium -    Chrome exits during startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I try to open Chrome.app  it exits immediately   - no error message / dialog   - nothing logged to Console.app   - nothing logged to chrome_debug.log    Needless to say this is a pretty poor user experience.    I have managed to get it launching again by moving aside the chrome user   data dir:    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Google   % mv Chrome Chrome.bak    Can someone help me investigate this?  (Profile available upon request).    This is on Mac OS X 10.5.7  Chrome version: 3.0.196.0 (Official Build 22005)    Chrome.app was running fine yesterday  but stopped working today   (AFAICT I didn't change anything). </pre>
