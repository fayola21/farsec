<title>Issue 8024 -   chromium -    Disallow maximize/size of fullscreen window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is tricky to repro.    -Maximize the Chrome browser window.  -Press F11 and then immediately click on Un-maximize button (the 2nd button  in window��_��_��_s management controls) (the click on un-maximize button should  take place immediately before the screen turns into full screen mode.    You will get Chrome in un-maximized mode  with out any border and Title bar  and toolbar. Strictly speaking it is kind of Fullscreen mode for  un-maximized window.  (To notice that make sure you have Chrome of smaller size in un-maximized  mode)     Screen shot attached.   </pre>
