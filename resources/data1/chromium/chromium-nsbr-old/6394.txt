Go to any website that is longer than one page. Say    <a href="http://news.google.com/">http://news.google.com/</a>.   2. Try hitting the spacebar.   3. In previous versions  the spacebar would do a page-down  similar to how   it works in other browsers. Not anymore.        Page down.        Nothing.     </pre>
