<title>Issue 2154 -   chromium -    web inspector pegs the CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open any web page (even a blank page)  2. open the web inspector    What is the expected output?   no noticeable extra CPU usage.     What do you see instead?  100% CPU (or 50% on two cores)    eroman went back to build <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30">r30</a>  so this isn't a recent regression.  If you   close the page being inspected  the CPU spin remains  so perhaps it's in   the inspector HTML code itself. </pre>
