<title>Issue 21528 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: DEP exception on exit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Set your system to enable DEP on all programs.  Open the browser and visit   paypal.com.  Then hit the window close box.  In nearly all cases  I get an   exception from inside NPP_Destroy() where Flash 10 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32">r32</a> is trying to access   some chunk of memory.    This seems to have regressed some time within the last month or two (although   perhaps the regression is in Flash itself?) </pre>
