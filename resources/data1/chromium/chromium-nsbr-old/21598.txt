<title>Issue 21598 -   chromium -    Path in chromium-browser manpage wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       --user-data-dir=DIR                Specifies  the directory that user data (your &quot;profile&quot;) is   kept                in.  Defaults to  ~/.config/chromium-browser/Default.     Separate                instances  of  Chromium must use separate user data   directories;                repeated invocations of chromium-browser will reuse an    existing                process for a given user data directory.    I think I used the wrong variable in the gyp file  should be easy to fix. </pre>
