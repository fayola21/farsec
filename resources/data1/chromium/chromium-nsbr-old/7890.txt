<title>Issue 7890 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Scrollbar hot-tracking drawn incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a page with a vertical scrollbar.  Place your mouse cursor over the   track such that when you click  the bottom half of the scroll thumb will be   under the mouse.  Click.  Note that half the thumb is drawn highlighted.    This may be related to the size of the scroll thumb (perhaps only the part   that wasn't previously thumb is being invalidated?). </pre>
