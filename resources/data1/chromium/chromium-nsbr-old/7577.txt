<title>Issue 7577 -   chromium -    Provide catching/configuration of long-running scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> IE  Firefox  and Safari all have protections in place so that  long-running/runaway scripts will be stopped and the user is informed that  a script is making the page run slowly. Chrome will eventually crash if  script goes on running for too long. It would be good to have a way to  catch these long-running scripts  as well as a way to optionally turn off  the catch.    IE let's you modify this setting via a registry entry; Firefox allows you  to modify it in about:config; Safari allows you to turn off long-running  script catching via the Develop menu.    Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      Opera 9.6: FAIL - also doesn't stop long-running scripts      1. Add this code to a page:    window.onload = function(){      for (var i=0; i &lt; 10000000000000; i++){      }      alert(&quot;Done&quot;);  };    2. Load the page.        That the script will stop executing after a period of time and verify if  the user wants to continue with the script or not.        Nothing - it continues to run for minutes  locking the page's UI in the  process. </pre>
