<title>Issue 5005 -   chromium -    Collect url data in crash dumps reported back to Google - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issue: Currently Chrome does not collect the url information related to   crashes  which  in certain cases  makes finding reproducible test cases   difficult.  This in turn likely causes crash related bugs to have longer   lives than might otherwise be necessary if we had this data.    Looking at the behavior of other web browsers when they crash  I've seen   both Safari and Firefox prompt the user if they wanted to send the url with   the report.    Feature request:  1.) During a crash  capture the http url from the crashing tab  and pass   that information along with the crash report    2.) For https  sanitize the url (remove all parameters except for the base   url or simply the domain) prior to passing that in the crash report.    3.) For other protocols pass the full url     </pre>
