<title>Issue 8588 -   chromium -    Zooming in shifts the page upwards neglecting to set the part of the page that the user was viewing as point for zoomed text to be viewed. Zooming out shifts the page downwards with reference to what was being viewed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Web Page should have enough content for scroll bars to be present(If you   zoom enough this applies to almost all pages except blank pages or the   pages having very little content i suppose).    2. Zooming in this page with zooming the part of the page you have scrolled   up to being the focus of your attention (Zomming In any way - clicking   option in menu or using crtl^+ key combo).              The page gets Zoomed with the particular part that was being viewed on the   page being displayed on your screen zoomed (The content that was at the   start of the screen display area before zooming in is at the start of the   display area after zooming in).           Zoom shifts the view to upper parts of the page (with reference to what was   being viewed in the page when stated zooming and for which it was being   zoomed). Now the viewer has to scroll down to the part intended to be   viewed again (and possibly check if further zooming is required by that   part of page which the viewer intended zoomed and the same thing all over   again...)    Please provide
