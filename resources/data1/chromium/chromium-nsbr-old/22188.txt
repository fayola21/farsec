<title>Issue 22188 -   chromium -    Close button on download and info bars doesn't have hover state and can get stuck in the mouse-down state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download something to get a download bar  or do something   informational to get an info bar.  2. Hover over the close button    Expect: hover state (even if you think our hover states are ugly  I think that   these close boxes should match what we do with our tab close boxes.)  Observe: no hover state.    3. Mouse down  then move the mouse off of the close button and mouse   up  so that the button is not triggered.    Expect: The hover-pressed state initially  and then hover-not-pressed   state as the mouse leaves the close box.  The hover-not-pressed state   should remain until mouse up and then the button should return to its   normal state  not hover or pressed.  Observe: Looks like on mouse down  we go to the hover (not pressed)   state  and then when the mouse moves off the button  we go to the   pressed state.  When the mouse goes up  the pressed state remains.      4.0.207.0 official release  and  trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26488">r26488</a> </pre>
