<title>Issue 3841 -   chromium -    Add option to remove triangle by address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Sorry  I don't have that info here  URLs (if applicable) : United Airlines    Aaarghh!  I just lost a page showing an airline receipt before I could  print or save it.  The back button doesn't work  because the page has forms.    I had just purchased airline tickets  and was trying to go to the  drop-down menu to print or save the page.  But that triangle is right  next to the triangle at the right of the address field (the one that  is equivalent to hitting return after typing an address).  I was a  little distracted by my wife and cat  and hit the wrong triangle.  The  page is lost!  I can't go back to the page because it contains forms;  I would have to start all over and enter the data - which would mean  buying another plane ticket.    My suggestion is to add an option to remove the triangle at the right  of the address field.  I never use it  I hit return instead.  Removing that would make it harder to make this mistake.    (I have a second suggestion  which I'll add under another message  for tracking purposes - add a capability to re-render a previous page   without reloading the information.)     </pre>
