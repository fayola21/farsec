<title>Issue 20396 -   chromium -    Images larger than window frame do not get scroll bars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24584">revision 24584</a>)  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : fluxbox    <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_of_web_browsers">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_of_web_browsers</a>  .svg  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Visit   <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_of_web_browsers">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_of_web_browsers</a>  .svg      The browser should provide scroll bars on the bottom and left to allow for   panning across the entire image.      The upper-left part of the image is displayed  but there is no way to move   the image around to see the rest of it.    This has some similarities to <a title="Chrome as an image viewer"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19144">Issue 19144</a> (features to improve Chrome's   usability as an image viewer)  but looks only at one common problem; if you   want to mark it as a dupe  that may be reasonable. </pre>
