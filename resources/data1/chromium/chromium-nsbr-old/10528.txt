<title>Issue 10528 -   chromium -    Tab backing store paged to disk hurts performance. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The backing store for a tab may often be paged to disk  particularly when   lots of tabs are open and memory is tight (after all  each one could come in   at ~6MB).    Often when paged to disk the time to get it back into ram may be many seconds   (for some reason windows doesn't seem to put it contiguously on disk).    Investigate if there is an API available to determine if a particular memory   allocation on the heap is in ram or has been paged to disk (eg. maybe by   accessing it and checking the page fault counters if no better API is   available)  and if it has been paged  discard the buffer and re-allocate a   new one and re-paint into it  since that will probably be quicker than   loading the backing store from disk. </pre>
