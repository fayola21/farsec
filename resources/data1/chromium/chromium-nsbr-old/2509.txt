<title>Issue 2509 -   chromium -    Duplicate tab should not create a new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Right-click a tab and select Duplicate Tab    What happens is that a new window is created showing the duplicated tab.   This is never what I want; I always intend to create a new tab in my   current window.    I've asked around and people seem to either agree with me or not care  so   I'd like to change this. </pre>
