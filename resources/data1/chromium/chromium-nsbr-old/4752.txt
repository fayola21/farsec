<title>Issue 4752 -   chromium -    RTL: Correct Context menu should be displayed for Bookmarks manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.25 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5918">r5918</a>)      1. Run Chrome for any RTL LANG (Arabic is fine)  2. Bring up Bookmarks Manager (Ctrl+shift+b)  3. Make sure  you will notice scroll bar is enabled in the ListView (right  hand side pan) -- This is IMP  4. Right click on any Bookmarks's favicon   [Please note  your mouse pointer should be positioned on Top-right corner  of the favicon ]    If you right click continuously on the favicon  you will alternatively get  Scrollbar's context menu and Download manager's context menu. (Screenshot  attached)    Happy to show up any demo  if required.     </pre>
