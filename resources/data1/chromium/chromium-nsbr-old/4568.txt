<title>Issue 4568 -   chromium -    Tabs extend beyond window frame when browser is maximized on secondary (rotated) monitor. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 5669)      1. Have many tabs open  2. Maximize chrome on my second (rotated) monitor      All the tabs orient themselves within the window.      Tabs extend beyond the edge of the window  making them unreachable.    I have two monitors. Left (primary) is 1440x900. Right is 1280x1024 rotated   to the left (effectively making it 1024x1280). I am running Windows Vista   and set the rotation and what not through my nVidia control panel.    Screenshot is attached. The top is what the tab bar looks like when it is   maximized on the second monitor (buggy layout). The bottom is what the bar   looks like when not maximized (correct functionality). </pre>
