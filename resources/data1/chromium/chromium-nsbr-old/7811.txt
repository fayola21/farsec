<title>Issue 7811 -   chromium -    spell checker language is not changed back to English - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. change your language via &quot;minor tweaks&quot; (I changed to spanish)  2. restart chrome (note that the spell checker language is now spanish too)  3. change your language back (to English)      The spell checker language should now be english but it's still stuck in   Spanish. No bueno!    2.0.162.0 on Vista </pre>
