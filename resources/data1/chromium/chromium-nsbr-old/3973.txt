<title>Issue 3973 -   chromium -    Informing the date when Chrome automatically updates  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My firewall (ZoneAlarm) detected Google Chrome has been changed  but I was  not informed of any automatic update. Now before I grant it internet access  safely  it would be nice to at least be able to check the date of the last  update (e.g. at the &quot;About Google Chorme&quot; menu option). </pre>
