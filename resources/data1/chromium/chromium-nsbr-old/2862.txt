<title>Issue 2862 -   chromium -    Regression: Navigation Back and Forth problems from History page  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     Precondition: have about:version in History.    1. Click on about:version History entry.  2. Observe navigation to about:version in current tab.  3. Click on Back button on toolbar to return to History page.  4. Again  click on about:version History entry.    What is the expected output?     As before  browser should navigate to about:version in current tab.    What do you see instead?    Browser navigates to about:version for a fraction of a second  but then  returns to History page by itself.  Oddly (or evenly  I should say)  this  happens every &quot;other&quot; time you try  i.e. the 2nd  4th  6th time  etc.    The same also applies to about:plugins and about:memory.  About:blank and about:network history entries don't seem to navigate at all  (or it's too fast to see).        </pre>
