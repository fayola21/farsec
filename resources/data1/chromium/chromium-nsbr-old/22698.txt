<title>Issue 22698 -   chromium -    Alsa delay query happens too fast causing warning. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. On linux  open a page with a video that has sound.  2. Play it.        You shouldn't see anything  but we spit out this warning.    [14557:14590:1549836088360:ERROR:media/audio/linux/alsa_output.cc(401)]   Failed querying delay: Input/output error    What is likely happening is that since we open the device asynchronously    we query this function too fast on the first run (before the device has   even started playing).    We should find a way to avoid spitting out this warning -- either by   finding a way to know when the device is ready  or something simple like   not logging such a warning until the first packets has been writei-ed. </pre>
