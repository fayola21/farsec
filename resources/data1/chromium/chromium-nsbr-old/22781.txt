<title>Issue 22781 -   chromium -    Min  Max  and Close Button's Location Are Not Consistent With Other Apps (XP) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In Windows XP with standard theme enabled  have one or more typical   windows on top of a Chrome window (i.e. A Windows Explorer Window  an MS   Word Window  FireFox  etc...)  2. Start minimizing all windows using the minimize in the top right corner   of each window.  3. When you get to the Chrome window  your mouse is no longer over the   minimize button.  Instead  it is on the max/restore button leading you to   maximize or restore the window rather than minimize it.        You should be able to click through all of the windows (including Chrome   window) and minimize them without having to move your mouse.  I would   expect the Chrome buttons to at least be in the same location even if they   are not the same height.  For instance  the close button is much larger   than the min/max buttons and it is not aligned to the right of the window.    Instead  it is offset from the edge.      You have to move your mouse to the correct button since Chrome's   min/max/close buttons do not line up with the typical Windows buttons in   size and location.    <b>Please provide
