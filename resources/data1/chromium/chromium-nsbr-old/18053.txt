<title>Issue 18053 -   chromium -    NNTP : auto pinning bug  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.4    - look at the NNTP and make sure you have a pinned thumbnail    and a non pinned one    - drag the non-pinned so it gets swapped with the pinned one    Expected: the non pinned is still non pinned  Happens : the non pinned is &quot;upgraded&quot; to being pinned   </pre>
