<title>Issue 6135 -   chromium -    RTL: Hebrew text with diacritical marks rendered with extra spaces in Chrome/Windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hebrew text has extra white spaces during selection    <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0101.htm">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0101.htm</a>    Select the text to see what I mean.  I don't think those white spaces are  supposed to be there.    We have a Webkit bug for it  however  I cannot reproduce it on latest  Webkit nightly build and Safari 3.2.1.    <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18523">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18523</a> </pre>
