<title>Issue 5551 -   chromium -    1-2% page cycler regression with link coloring code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I re-hooked-up link coloring and we see a 1-2% layout test regression.  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-</a>  core/intl1/report.html?history=70    We should look into this to make sure it's working properly and there are   no more areas for optimization. There will inevitably be some regression   since this is additional work we weren't doing before. </pre>
