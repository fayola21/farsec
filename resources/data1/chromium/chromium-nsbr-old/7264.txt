<title>Issue 7264 -   chromium -    Open button in Download shelf needs visual feedback for pressed state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/972503&gt;    As open button does not maintain any state after clicking on it   User may  confuse whether the event is taking place or not.    User may be confused if he clicked on OPEN button  incase if 'OPEN' even  takes long time to occur.    Comments from mal  #################  Well  the Open button can't wait for the open to complete since we don't  know what that means. The cursor does change to an hourglass until the open  has started (presumably until ShellExec returns).    It might help if the button had visual feedback on press (it does not  currently)  so at least it behaves like other buttons and I get informed  that yes  I did in fact click it. </pre>
