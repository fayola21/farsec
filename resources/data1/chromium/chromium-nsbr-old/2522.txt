<title>Issue 2522 -   chromium -    MetricsServiceTest.CloseRenderersNormally assumes metrics recording is on - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MetricsServiceTest.CloseRenderersNormally assumes that the browser's  instance of MetricsService records into prefs::kStabilityPageLoadCount and  prefs::kStabilityRendererCrashCount even if the user preference  prefs::kMetricsReportingEnabled is false.  MetricsService recording should  not happen if the user forbids reporting with the check box  and the test  ignores that possibility.   </pre>
