<title>Issue 9835 -   chromium -    Implement IP/CIDR matching for ProxyService::ShouldBypassProxyForURL() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac and Linux expect to be able to specify IP addresses and CIDR  patterns (as in &quot;127.0.0.0/8&quot;) in the proxy bypass list.  Matching of  IP addresses and CIDR patterns for the proxy bypass list is a TODO in  proxy_service.cc. Both IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported.    Parsing out IP/CIDR should probably move to ProxyConfig  or at any  rate be done in such a way to not repeat the work for each URL going  through the ProxyService. On Linux we also support an IP with specific  port (in an upcoming CL) and that also ought to be parsed once rather  than for every URL.   </pre>
