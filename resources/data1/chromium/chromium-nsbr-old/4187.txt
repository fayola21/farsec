<title>Issue 4187 -   chromium -    Built in &quot;bug reporter&quot; does not forward issues to this issues list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3      1. Click the page menu in the upper-right corner  2. Click &quot;report bug or broken website&quot;  3. Type a report  and click &quot;send report&quot;    I have submitted several bugs and broken websites using this feature  but  none of them have shown up on this issues forum.  Perhaps this is intented   but it seems to me that logging the issues on here would be useful  and I  wanted to make sure the built-in reporting feature is even working and that  the issues submitted through it are being addressed.  Would it be better to  submit my bug reports using one of these forms on this site?   </pre>
