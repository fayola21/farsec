<title>Issue 11256 -   chromium -    Malware redirects caused by HTTP/30X should be blocked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current logic in our handling of HTTP responses has a flaw where a site   that is blacklisted by SafeBrowsing is allowed to redirect to a non-  blacklisted site.    In safe_browsing_resource_handler.cc  if a request is redirected via an HTTP   30x response code  we cancel any SafeBrowsing check and proceed to the   redirect URL.    We do perform a SafeBrowsing check on the new URL  but according to Ian  we   should not proceed if the initial page was blacklisted. </pre>
