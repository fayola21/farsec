<title>Issue 17248 -   chromium -    Middle-click on scrollbar thumb should center thumb at mouse position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.194.3-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20926">r20926</a>  OS: Ubuntu Hardy Heron    In (at least some) GTK+ apps  middle-mouse-down on a scrollbar thumb makes   the thumb get centered under the pointer and dragging moves the thumb along   with the pointer.  The fix for <a title="Scrollbar doesn't implement middle-click as GTK+ does" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11976"> issue 11976 </a> makes the thumb's position get   updated correctly on middle-mouse-down on an empty part of the scrollbar    but middle-clicking on the thumb itself is the same as left-clicking -- the   position gets updated as you drag  but nothing happens on mouse-down.    In Firefox 3.0.10  this works as described at the top of the previous   paragraph.  gedit 2.22.3 has behavior that seems unintuitive to me.  As   best as I can figure out  middle-mouse-down on the thumb makes the thumb   jump either up or down  depending on whether the mouse-down is above or   below the position of the previous mouse-down on the thumb.    I suggest that Firefox's behavior be implemented. </pre>
