<title>Issue 7648 -   chromium -    Support resuming interrupted downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 1.0.154.48  All other browsers: OK    Download a chromium build or any file.  Download the same file again.  Chrome does not tell you the file exists and does not ask if you would like to replace it  it just   automatically puts a &quot;1&quot; at the end of it and downloads it again.    It should ask if you want replace the file or create a new download with a different name  or just   adding 1 to the end of it.     </pre>
