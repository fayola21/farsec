<title>Issue 19604 -   chromium -    RenderThemeChromiumMac needs updating to match the latest WebKit ToT RenderThemeMac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> RenderThemeChromiumMac is in some desperate need of some TLC.    It seems to be a massively-hacked-up version of RenderThemeMac. It has  issues drawing on SL (see <a title="hotmail on 10.6 : to  cc and bcc buttons have layout issue" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12931"> issue 12931 </a>) and it looks like it has various  hackeries in it to run at all (see line 995  in the middle of  setButtonCellState).    Both RenderThemeMac and RenderThemeSafari are using Cocoa to draw their  controls. We probably want the HITheme painting (or whatever successor API  there is). But as it is today  RenderThemeChromiumMac is unmaintainable. </pre>
