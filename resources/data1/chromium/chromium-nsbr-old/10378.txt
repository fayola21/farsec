<title>Issue 10378 -   chromium -    2 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   These two have a different object type in the dom dump. Plugin-related.  Ignored on Win/Linux because they rely on QT to provide a TIFF decoder.   MAC : LayoutTests/fast/images/embed-image.html = FAIL MAC : LayoutTests/fast/images/object-image.html = FAIL   (Automatically generated from line 1532 to line 1537 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
