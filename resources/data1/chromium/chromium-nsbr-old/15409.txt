<title>Issue 15409 -   chromium -    New NTP: Need less agressive hiding for the titlebar of thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the New 'New tab' page.  2. Hover over a thumbnail and wait for it to grow a titlebar    Now  if I want to interact with the title bar (ie. click the close button)   but my mouse ventures even just 1px outside the title bar area the whole   title bar disappears.     The hiding should be less aggressive (longer delay before hiding it or extend   the area that the mouse can move and still keep it open) so that there is   less of a chance of it disappearing by accident because my mouse movements   aren't accurate enough. </pre>
