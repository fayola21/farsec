<title>Issue 13280 -   chromium -    Chrome runs slowly (even in opening new tabs) after being running for a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome.  2. Use my browser 'normally'. Open a bunch of tabs (say   30 or so) and   leave them open over night. There are some flash videos in those windows.   (not sure if this is a requirement)      The browser runs within some level of performance as it did when first   starting.      Browser is incredibly slow. The UI functions fine  but anything in the   browse pane is delayed - opening a new tab takes about 10 seconds for the   Most visited page to show up. In addition  browsing to a new URL takes   much much longer - it's not a CPU limitation  the active process isn't   maxxing out the CPU  the CPU has significant spare capacity and other   browsers work fine.      Closing Chrome and restarting it (btw  when you have multiple windows    there's no good way to close Chrome and preseve your tabs) causes the   slowdown to be fixed  until Chrome is active for a while.
