<title>Issue 8192 -   chromium -    Implement plug-in methods in RenderWidgetHostViewMac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lots of pages seem to trigger RenderWidgetHostViewMac::MovePluginWindows()  getting called. Something needs to be done about it.     Bug filed to remove NOTIMPLEMENTED() which was choking the console output. </pre>
