<title>Issue 7597 -   chromium -    Top links on perf summary page don't change graphs below - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Clicking  e.g.  &quot;vm_peak_renderer&quot; on the top link of the perf summary page  doesn't make the graphs below show the right trace: they stay on page-load  time. Might just be that they need to change to the right trace names  (&quot;vm_peak_r&quot; etc.). </pre>
