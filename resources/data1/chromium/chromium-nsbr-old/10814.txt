<title>Issue 10814 -   chromium -    Selecting a pre-typed Hangul syllable and pressing 'Hanja' key/button does not bring up a candidate list (Hanja list) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install and add Korean IME  2. Switch to the Korean input mode  3. Type 'rydbr'.  They'll show up as '��_��_��_��_'  4. Type some other characters  5. Move the mouse focus over '��_��_��_' and select it  6. Press 'Hanja' button (or Hanja key on the Korean KBD)      What is the expected output?   A candidate list of Hanjas (Chinese characters) whose pronunciation is '��_��_��_'   with their meaning show up.    Actual:   Nothing pops up.     It's reported in the Chrome Korean U2U. I thought I had reported this  before internally  but I couldn't find it.        </pre>
