<title>Issue 4563 -   chromium -    It's easy to get Untitled in history page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.22(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5545">r5545</a>)  OS: XP and Vista.      [To better notice the issue  please try on clean profile]  1. Open two or more tabs and navigate to different webpages in all of them.   2. Ctrl+h for History page.  3. Click on the link &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; and say &quot;ok&quot; on the  confirmation pop-up.  4. Click on refresh button in all of the above tabs.  5. Refresh the history page (I believe we have bug for this  for history  tab is not getting auto refreshed)    Notice the history shows untitled for all of the refreshed webpages.  (Screenshot attached)    Not sure  when it is broken  BUT works fine in 0.2.149.30 (2200)   </pre>
