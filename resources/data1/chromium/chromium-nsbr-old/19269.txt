<title>Issue 19269 -   chromium -    Back menu is way too sensitive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Click on the back button  2. Accidentally move your mouse a pixel or two while you do    I get the menu coming up a pretty good fraction of the time I just want to   press the back button; we need a delay and/or a movement threshold before   the menu comes up. </pre>
