And on the forms by logging in it should store the cookie for an   hour and bring you to the administration  page.          You can refresh 100's of times per minute and it will increment the counter   because the cookie isn't getting accepted  and when filling in the forms   and pressing &quot;G��__ Inn!&quot; you get brought to the Form page again or sometimes   not because i make it check if a cookie is stored otherwise go back to the   form page.
