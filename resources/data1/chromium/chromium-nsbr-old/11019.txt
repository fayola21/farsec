<title>Issue 11019 -   chromium -    http://moviestelugu.tk/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. <a href="http://moviestelugu.tk/">http://moviestelugu.tk/</a>  2. Select Senadhipathi movie   3. Choose Megavideo option and click on the link   4. You can see that there is snapshot of movie with play button.      Movie should play.        5. But when you click on the Play (&gt;) button) nothing will happen. I mean   movie doesn't show in the player.   6. My doubt this is some thing related to plugin issue. But the works in   IE7 very well  without any issues.      <b>Please provide
