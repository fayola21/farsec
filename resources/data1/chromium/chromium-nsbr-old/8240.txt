<title>Issue 8240 -   chromium -    Try to delay tooltip window creation on startup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Creating new win32 windows (CreateWindow) can be expensive.  We create the   backing tooltip windows right away  even if they are not displayed.  It   could help startup performance a bit if we delayed the tooltip window   creation.
