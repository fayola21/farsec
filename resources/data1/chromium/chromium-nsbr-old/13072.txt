<title>Issue 13072 -   chromium -    Crash on navigating to deleted file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to a local file:// URL.  2. Exit Chrome.  3. Delete the file.  4. Restart Chrome.  5. Select the deleted file from the NTP.  6. See &quot;missing page&quot; page (this is normal).  7. Go back.  8. Go forward.    What is the expected output?     Should show same &quot;missing page&quot; page.    What do you see instead?    Chrome crashes with Kr0m error.    [8992:15940:1099005406:FATAL:navigation_controller.cc(510)] Check failed:   !GetActiveEntry(). Got an invalid page ID but we seem to be navigated to a   valid page. This should be impossible.    (Backtrace is unresolved; will try to get symbols).    This may be related to <a href="http://crbug.com/6737">http://crbug.com/6737</a>.   </pre>
