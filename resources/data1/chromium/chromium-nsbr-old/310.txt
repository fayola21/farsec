<title>Issue 310 -   chromium -    import from ff 3.0.1 causes severe breakage under xp pro x64 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install chrome  2. Drop down wrench menu and click on options  3. Options dialog box is momentarily rendered (at least its outline) and   then whole browser crashes.    Clicking on the star to the left of the location bar also causes crashes.    At install time  selecting &quot;customize these settings&quot; also causes crashes    I've uninstalled and reinstalled chrome a couple of times. These behaviors   are all repeatable.        Should be obvious          Please provide
