<title>Issue 3779 -   chromium -    ViewVC display under a perf plot doesn't show all relevant revisions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to the buildbot  click &quot;results&quot; under one of the page-cycler tests    then click the plot so it shows a ViewVC page in the frame below.  The page   displayed only shows the revision you clicked  not all of them since the   last data point in the plot.    Unfortunately  ViewVC doesn't have a &quot;show all changes in this directory   between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=123">r123</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=456">r456</a>&quot;  but we can at least show a full log up to the   revision clicked. </pre>
