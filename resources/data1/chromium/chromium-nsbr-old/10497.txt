<title>Issue 10497 -   chromium -    Gmail thread list entries too tall -- font metrics wrong? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The list of subjects in gmail is spaced out too wide.  It looks like the font metrics are wrong.  :(    Probably the right place to start is reducing it to a layout test.    It'd be good to get someone else knowledgeable about this font metrics  business.  Adam  maybe you could nominate someone?  </pre>
