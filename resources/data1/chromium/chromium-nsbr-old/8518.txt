<title>Issue 8518 -   chromium -    Fix TBR hacks generated when fixing red tree - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After landing webkit merge  I ran into problem because WebKitClient.h had   changed in our tree (<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=11178)    Rather than rollback and fall behind with merge monday  I opted to do some   TBRs to get things limping along. nsylvain was patient enough to allow me   to do this (thanks!).    There are now several things that need to be fixed:    (1) v8_proxy.cpp -- I commented out ChromiumBridge::initV8CounterFunction()  since the new implementation of   initV8CounterFunction() now crashes.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/40279">http://codereview.chromium.org/40279</a>    (2) webKitClient() is NULL  causing crash in plugin UI tests. I reckon    initialize() is never getting called  and the proper fix is to make sure we   do.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/39316">http://codereview.chromium.org/39316</a>     </pre>
