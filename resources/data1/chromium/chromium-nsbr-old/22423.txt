<title>Issue 22423 -   chromium -    DNS: RFC 2782 not supported (SRV records) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium doesn't support RFC 2782: A DNS RR for specifying the   location of services (DNS SRV) (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/">http://tools.ietf.org/html/</a>  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=fc2782">rfc2782</a>).    I think it's a important feature which should be supported by   Chromium. </pre>
