<title>Issue 18458 -   chromium -    Install and uninstalling theme doesn't reset Chrome to default theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install any theme  2. Go to chrome://extensions  3. Uninstall the theme that's installed  4. Exit Chrome  5. Launch Chrome    What is the expected output?   Chrome should be seen in default theme    What do you see instead?  It still has some traces of the previous theme that's installed. Also   when the tab is in focus the title of the webpage isn't visible.    Please see the attached image. In this case I used Baseball theme.   </pre>
