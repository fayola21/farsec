<title>Issue 17852 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar has &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of the bar even when there are no bookmarks. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 3.0.196 SNV Revision: 21633  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Delete all your bookmarks.  2. Open the bookmark bar (cmd + b).      Expected:  The bookmark bar should be completely blank and there should be no &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of   the bar.    Actual:  The bookmark bar has &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of the bar even when there are no bookmarks.      This is similar to Safari  but Safari gets the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; symbol only when there are more bookmarks to   show.     </pre>
