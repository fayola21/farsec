<title>Issue 18542 -   chromium -    Unstable Flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22494)  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIzJj8esh3U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIzJj8esh3U</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Open Browser  2. Go to a youtube video  3. Try to use the players controls      Player functioning like other browsers      Controls are unstable    I noticed that while Flash is working fine  and playing the videos/audio  the   controls are almost impossible to click. It as if the browser doesn't know   what to do with them. Every 10th click or so a control will register  but this   is not always the case.   </pre>
