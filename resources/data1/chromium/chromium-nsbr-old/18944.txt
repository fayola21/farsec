<title>Issue 18944 -   chromium -    Arrow keys do not scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.12    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works      1. Open any page longer than the current window so you get a vertical   scroll bar.  2. Click on the window to make sure it has focus.  3. Press the down arrow key.      Window scrolls down.      Nada.    I've only recently started using the Google Chrome for Mac  so I don't know   whether this is a regression. </pre>
