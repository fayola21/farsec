<title>Issue 3322 -   chromium -    ssl certificate bug with certificate chain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see 0.3.154.0&gt;             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    I have created root certification authority (and installed it's certificate   on my computer - so it's truest) and issued web server certificate by it    CN: ip address of webserver  I've created chain file. Next https://&lt;ip   address of webserver&gt;/ gives me an error:    net::ERR_FAILED    It works in firefox  ie7  ie8  safari  opera9.5 and so on  so I am sure   it's chrome bug.      Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.     </pre>
