<title>Issue 10862 -   chromium -    OS X: Can't use command-key shortcuts with foreign keyboard layouts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Focus an input element and type in some text.  2. Switch to a hebrew keyboard layout.  3. Type Command+a    Expected results:  All text should be selected.    What actually happens:  No action is taken.    Discussion:  My understanding is that on OS X  the keyboard mapping is such that when you press the   command key in a foreign keyboard layout then the letters flip back to being English QWERTY   regardless of the keyboard layout you're using.    My guess is that we're not looking in the right place in the event structure when mapping   keyboard shortcuts in WebKit. </pre>
