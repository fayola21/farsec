<title>Issue 18393 -   chromium -    AutocompleteEditViewGtk should not access private members of GtkTextView - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In autocomplete_edit_view_gtk.cc  AutocompleteEditViewGtk::HandleKeyPress()  method accesses private members of GtkTextView  such as im_context and  need_im_reset. This is not good because these members may eventually be  hidden or removed in future gtk release.    I have no better way to deal with this issue  so just file it in case we  forget it. </pre>
