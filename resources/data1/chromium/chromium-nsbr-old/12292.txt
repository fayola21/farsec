<title>Issue 12292 -   chromium -    The tab titles do not refresh till the user moves from one tab to the other - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.6 (Build 9G55)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 181.1  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open news.google.com in a new tab.  2. Open any news link in Google News in a new tab.      Expected:  The current page title should change from &quot;New Tab&quot; to &quot;Google News&quot;  A new tab should open and the title of the tab should change from &quot;Untitled&quot; to whatever the   title of the page is.    Actual:  The title of the current tab remains as &quot;New Tab&quot; and the new tab we opened remains as   &quot;Untitled&quot; till the user moves to any other tab.      One other scenario is - users do not get any chat notice in the tab title of GMail until they change   tabs.     </pre>
