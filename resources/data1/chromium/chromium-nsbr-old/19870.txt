<title>Issue 19870 -   chromium -    Checking hot journal in history preload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When browser process starts  it preloads the sqlite database for better   performance. The preload reads the database file in one contiguous   operation   rather than bringing it in organically. See src/third_party/sqlite/preload-  cache.patch.    Our concern is: if there is an abnormal exit in previous browser session   and   the database transactions are not all committed  preload might load   corrupted   data from file since it bypasses journal.    I will see whether I can construct some database file as test case.         </pre>
