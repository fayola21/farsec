<title>Issue 5589 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager Should Allow Keyword / Shortcut URL editing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3        1. Import QuickSearches from Firefox or any other browser.  2. Try editing them using the bookmark editor  you don't have access to  their search keyword.  You have to use the &quot;Edit Search Engines...&quot; which  is not intuitive.        Opera  Firefox and IE all allow you to edit the search keyword directly  from the bookmark editors.  Personally I think you should add the keyword  box to the bookmark manager and get rid of the &quot;Edit Search Engines&quot;  dialog.  I spent over 15 minutes trying to figure out how to modify the  keyword for a bookmark...I ended up modifying the exported bookmark.html  file and re-importing it.    - PS: I'm a google engineer working on gmail.  This is also bug #9430099. </pre>
