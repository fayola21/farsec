<title>Issue 10825 -   chromium -    First Run UI is confusing with the buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install Chrome  2. First Run UI is launched and has 2 buttons &quot;Start Chrome&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;    Issue: Clicking Start Chrome starts Chrome but clicking on Cancel button also   launches Chrome.    I think we should name the buttons appropriately so that the user doesn't get   confused.    From b/1205759 </pre>
