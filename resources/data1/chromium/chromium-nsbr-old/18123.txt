<title>Issue 18123 -   chromium -    need to force JS dialogs to the front when user tries to interact with other browser windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Open two browser windows  2) Run javascript:alert('hi') in one window.  3) Click on the other browser window to bring it to the front.    At step 3  we should force the browser window with the alert to the front   (windows does this  see the calls to ActivateAppModalDialog in   browser_frame_win.cc).    Would be nice to have since it's confusing that you can't interact with   windows while the alert is showing. </pre>
