<title>Issue 17866 -   chromium -    Tab title font size cannot be changed with the desktop settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to <a href="http://www.udn.tw">http://www.udn.tw</a> (a Taiwanese newspaper site that uses  traditional Chinese characters) in Chrome and Firefox    2. Open another tab    3. Compare the font size of the tab title in two browsers     4. In Chrome  it's rather hard to read Chinese characters with a lot of  (horizontal) strokes. (see the screenshot attached)    Adjusting the UI font size per locale doesn't work because English Chrome  users can visit Chinese pages.     It seems that the font size for the tab title on Linux is smaller than that  on Windows.     Changing the size for all categories in the Gnome appearance | fonts  doesn't make any difference as if it's hard-coded.  The UI font size of  Firefox 3 gets larger when I increase the font size in Gnome apperaance |  fonts.     If there's a bug filed on Chrome's UI fonts not dependent on the desktop  setting (I'm aware of the one about anti-aliasing)  this should be made  dependent on that bug.        </pre>
