<title>Issue 11745 -   chromium -    Implement the password manager on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a Keychain-backed implementation of the password manager. The   goal is to be as compatible as possible with other browsers using the   keychain to store internet passwords.    See also <a title="Implement the password manager" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8205"> bug 8205 </a> (the Linux equivalent)  where password storage is being   restructured in a way that will help here as well. </pre>
