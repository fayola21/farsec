<title>Issue 10944 -   chromium -    Implement tab-to-search on Omnibox Mac. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Chrome for Windows  you can type &quot;google&lt;tab&gt;&quot; and you get a little &quot;Search Google:&quot; UI   element and you can now enter a query.  This is done with a little read-only element that slides in   from the left and doesn't accept events (or passes them over to the omnibox field). </pre>
