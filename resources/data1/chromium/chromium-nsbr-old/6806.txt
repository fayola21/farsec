<title>Issue 6806 -   chromium -    Text not rendered correctly in RTL Chrome on English Windows XP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b/1206120&gt;    When running the Hebrew or Arabic version of Chrome on a Windows XP   English  some of the Chrome text is displayed with boxes.    This problem occurs because the English version of Windows XP does not   install right-to-left languages by default and therefore any directional   Unicode formatting characters are displayed as boxes. This problem goes   away if the right-to-left languages are installed by going to Control   Pannel -&gt; Regional and Language Options.    The priority of this bug is pretty low because the vast majority of   Hebrew/Arabic Chrome users will either use a localized version of Windows   or they will have the right-to-left languages already installed.    What we can do is let the user know that the right-to-left fonts need to be   installed (rather than simply launch Chrome with gibberish text).     </pre>
