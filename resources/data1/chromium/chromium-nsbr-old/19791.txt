<title>Issue 19791 -   chromium -    Fullscreen transition could look better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.198.1  OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Hit cmd-shift-f        Something nice-looking          The fullscreen &quot;transition&quot; looks pretty bad and jumpy.      One usual way to do this is to fade the screen to black  do the transition    and fade back. See enterFullscreen: in <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/MacVim.git?">http://repo.or.cz/w/MacVim.git?</a>  a=blob;f=src/MacVim/MMFullscreenWindow.m;hb=HEAD for one possible   way to do this. </pre>
