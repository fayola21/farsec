<title>Issue 1480 -   chromium -    Basic Options Dialog: Restore pages and open pages are exclusive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I do understand that the options &quot;Open the home page&quot; and &quot;Open the following pages:&quot; are   exclusive. Selecting whether to &quot;Restore the opened pages that were opened last&quot; should be an   additional option for these two modes instead of another exclusive option.     </pre>
