<title>Issue 11527 -   chromium -    Omnibox / address bar turns completely black - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1      I still haven't found the exact steps to reproduce the problem  but it seems to happen when   I have LOTS of tabs open for a long time.      The omnibox would then suddenly turn completely black.    I can quite regularly (but not always) replicate the problem by having lots of tabs open   for a long and then doing a screenshot with my screen capture software (SnagIt! v8).  As   soon as I press Print Screen  the omnibox turns black.    See attached screenshot. </pre>
