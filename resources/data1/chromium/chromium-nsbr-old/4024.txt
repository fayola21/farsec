<title>Issue 4024 -   chromium -    ctrl+click fails to go to background tab in Google Reader - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Google Reader; you must have set up some feeds  so that items   appear.  2. Hold down ctrl and left-click on the title of an item [the bold first   text in the item]  3. Notice that it opens in a new foreground tab instead of a new background   tab.    While this is the same manifestation as a bug that's been causing problems   in GMail for months  I believe it to be a separate bug.  The GMail bug's   been around for as long as I can remember  but this just started happening   in Reader recently.  It started hitting me as of my latest update a week or   so ago  but I think I hadn't updated for a while before that  so I can't   pin it down.                Please provide
