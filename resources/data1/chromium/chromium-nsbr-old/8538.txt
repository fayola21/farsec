<title>Issue 8538 -   chromium -    need open source page_cycler data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Current page_cycler data isn't open source  so it's impossible for people   outside of Google to get page_cycler data.  As far as I know  the issue is   copyright ownership of the underlying content  so the fix for this is   primarily legal: talk to a variety of site owners and get a permission to   distribute a snapshot of one of their web pages in a benchmark.  Ideally    we should have multiple sets of data:  - mostly static pages  - international pages with a variety of character sets  - more dynamic pages    see also <a title="need an open source tool to generate page_cycler data"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8537">issue 8537</a> </pre>
