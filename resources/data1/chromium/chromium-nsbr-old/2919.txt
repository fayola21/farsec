<title>Issue 2919 -   chromium -    Minimum size of ChromeFont (currently 5) needs to be locale-dependent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1180778&gt;    In common/gfx/chrome_font.cc   the minimum size is set to 5   but that's  too small for Chinese  Japanese  Korean and Arabic (and perhaps Hindi and  Thai as well). Actually  there's only DCHECK. Perhaps  it's better to  enforce this size restriction and make the min size locale-dependent.    It's a bit tricky if this ChromeFont is also used for places like tab titles.    </pre>
