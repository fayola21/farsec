<title>Issue 15907 -   chromium -    Windowless mouse event offset is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/plugins/mouse-events.html fails because the mouse coordinates   are wrong.    It tries to move the mouse to (20 20) but the plugin gets the event at   (12 12).  Somewhere the event for this windowless plugin is getting   constructed wrong.    -CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 17: PLUGIN: mouseDown at (20  20)  -CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 18: PLUGIN: mouseUp at (20  20)  +CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 17: PLUGIN: mouseDown at (12  12)  +CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 18: PLUGIN: mouseUp at (12  12)   </pre>
