<title>Issue 2829 -   chromium -    Font used for invalid fonts in textareas should be monospace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1195074&gt;    &lt;textarea style='font-family:myfontthatdoesnotexist'&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;    Should use monospace as the font. IE and Opera do this. Firefox does not.  Safari always uses serif for textareas. Not a huge issue  but I am sure  there are Chinese sites out there that use fonts that don't exist on most  people computers and using serif instead of monospace causes the textarea  size differently.    Test case attached.    </pre>
