<title>Issue 5495 -   chromium -    Chrome Disconnects my PC from the Internet sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Whenever I visit some websites  like www.microcenter.com and try to click   on a few links  sometimes Chrome gets stuck on &quot;connecting......&quot; for a   long time and then eventually I see that my entire PC has disconnected   from my Wired router. This used to happen even in the Beta. No such thing   ever happened in IE7 or FF3.        The entire system is momentarily &quot;disconnected&quot; from the router. It   eventually connects again after 2 mins.    Please provide
