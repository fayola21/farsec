<title>Issue 9714 -   chromium -    view-source over an unverified https  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open an HTTPS page where certificate is not trusted (cannot be   verified). The page's url will be displayed with &quot;https&quot; being red and stricken-through.  2. View page source      The url of the page source will be &quot;view-source:https://*** The word   &quot;https&quot; should still be red and stricken-through.      Instead &quot;view-source&quot; is displayed in red; which kinda makes no sense...   </pre>
