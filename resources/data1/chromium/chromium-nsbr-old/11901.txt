<title>Issue 11901 -   chromium -    Clicking an extension toolstrip selects the first tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.180.0      1. Create a simple extension  with the following contents: let   manifest.json be   {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;x&quot; &quot;id&quot;:&quot;08D046AE205C31446B24A9F0F28E291A10248340&quot; &quot;description&quot;:&quot;  y&quot; &quot;toolstrips&quot;:[&quot;test.html&quot;] &quot;version&quot;:&quot;0.1&quot;}   and let test.html be &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot;&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;   and put   it in the default extensions directory.  2. Run Chrome with --enable-extensions. A button with X should appear on   the extensions bar.  3. Open several empty tabs and select any of them (not the leftmost one).  4. Click the X on the extensions bar.      Nothing should happen.      Chrome switches to the leftmost tab. The leftmost tab gets selected.    Additional info:  This seems to happen only when Chrome is maximised.  Sometimes more than one click on the X is needed to get this effect.  I'm under Windows XP SP3.   </pre>
