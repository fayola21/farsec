<title>Issue 16624 -   chromium -    mac word select doesn't act like mac applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are multiple steps and results in this bug because the system is busted  and splitting it into different bugs   seemed like it meant we could lose some of the subtle behaviors Mac users expect.  This way they are all listed   together to be handled in one shot.    Part 1: Simple Case      1.load a web page with a text compose area (like a bug report)  2.type some sample text: &quot;this is a test of the text&quot;  3.double click 'test'    The word 'test' should be selected.  Instead 'test ' is selected.    Part 2: Delete Case      1.load a web page with a text compose area (like a bug report)  2.type some sample text: &quot;this is a test of the text&quot;  3.double click 'test'  4.hit the delete key        The word 'test' is deleted along with one of the surrounding spaces and the insertion point it right after &quot;a&quot; in &quot;this is   a test&quot;.  Instead the insertion point is after the &quot;a &quot; (and space  ie-before 'of').    Part 3: Replace with Typing Case      1.load a web page with a text compose area (like a bug report)  2.type some sample text: &quot;this is a test of the text&quot;  3.double click 'test'  4.type 'abc' (don't hit delete  etc.)        The text should now have &quot;this is a abc of text&quot;  ie-the word test is replaced with 'abc' without removing either of   the surrounding spaces.  Instead 'abcof' is there because the space was eaten.    Part 4: Replace with Clipboard Case      1.put the word 'xyz' on the clipboard  2.load a web page with a text compose area (like a bug report)  3.type some sample text: &quot;this is a test of the text&quot;  4.double click 'test'  5.hit cmd-v to paste the clipboard        The text should now have &quot;this is a xyz of text&quot;  ie-the word test is replaced with 'xyz' without removing either of   the surrounding spaces.  Instead 'xyzof' is there because the space was eaten.     </pre>
