<title>Issue 23118 -   chromium -    Shutdown should take &lt; 250ms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open Chrome and lots of tabs.  Get some of the renderers to swap out.  2.  Close Chrome via the &quot;close X&quot;  3.  Chrome takes more than 250ms (sometimes seconds  sometimes minutes) to   close.    Chrome should be closing immediately.  We should also be measuring shutdown   times in these cases (especially on the &quot;jank bot&quot; of <a title="add consume to a step in the tab-switching tests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21929">bug 21929</a>).
