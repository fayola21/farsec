<title>Issue 14791 -   chromium -    Provide an option for Ctrl-W on last tab to keep the browser open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31  URLs (if applicable) : N/A          Firefox 3.x: OK (not by default  but after toggling the setting in the   preferences)          1. Open multiple tabs and navigate to whatever websites you want.  2. Keep pressing Ctrl-W when you're done with the current tab. This is a   habit for me  without looking at the screen (which is the whole point of   keyboard shortcuts).  3. When you're on the last tab  and press Ctrl-W  the browser closes. Which   means that when I reopen the browser  I have to login again to SSO for the   corporate intranet. For security reasons  they refuse to let the cookie be   written to disk. All the redirects involved for SSO login (7 when I counted   last) adds several seconds to the process.      One of these two:  1. The current tab closes  but a new tab opens. FF provides an option for   this.  2. The window closes  but the Chrome process continues running  and keeps   the cookie.    I'm not advocating for either of these two as the default behavior  but   just for an option to enable one of these. If the concern is that the UI   will be cluttered because of too many options  it can even be hidden  like   Firefox's about:config. </pre>
