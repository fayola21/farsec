<title>Issue 16330 -   chromium -    Valid address permanently redirected to a wong URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. On a hotel network before paying for daily use  clicked my most often   visited link (<a href="http://mail.mydomain.com">http://mail.mydomain.com</a>  which redirects to   <a href="http://mail.google.com/a/mydomain.com/">http://mail.google.com/a/mydomain.com/</a>). This redirected me to the hotel   payment page instead.  2. Closed Chrome and used IE8 to pay for network use.  3. Since that time  when I click the <a href="http://mail.mydomain.com">http://mail.mydomain.com</a> OR ENTER IT   MANUALLY in the address box  it takes me to a now invalid outside the hotel   page (<a href="http://soln-sro474.solutionip.com/register/">http://soln-sro474.solutionip.com/register/</a>). There is no way around   it. I even went to Options - Under the Hood  unchecked &quot;Use DNS pre-  fetching...&quot;  closed and re-started Chrome. Still can't go directly to   mail.mydomain.com address. All other browsers on the same machine work   fine.      When I enter the <a href="http://mail.mydomain.com">http://mail.mydomain.com</a>  expect to be redirected to   <a href="http://mail.google.com/a/mydomain.com/">http://mail.google.com/a/mydomain.com/</a>      The address in URL box changes to http://soln-  sro474.solutionip.com/register/  and &quot;Oops! This link appears to be broken&quot;   page appears (as it was valid only on that hotel network)      <b>Please provide
