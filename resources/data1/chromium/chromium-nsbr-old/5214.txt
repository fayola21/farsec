<title>Issue 5214 -   chromium -    Vulnerable gears version is still being bundled with the buildbot builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you download the compiled build from chromium-rel-xp you still get gears   0.5.4.0 which we replaced with 0.5.4.2 to fix a security vulnerability for   the release builds.    Mark  I'm not sure who handles this. Can you reassign as appropriate?    Somebody also reported that 0.5.4.0 is still on gears.google.com too. </pre>
