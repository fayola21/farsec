<title>Issue 10837 -   chromium -    RenderThread::current() is improperly named - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> RenderThread::current() is improperly named    We used to call the getter current() because it would read from TLS.  There   was support for multiple such threads.  However  now there is only ever one    and we don't even use TLS anymore.  So  it is possible that current() can be   called on a background thread and still return a non-NULL result.    We should probably switch to something like &quot;RenderThread::get()&quot; </pre>
