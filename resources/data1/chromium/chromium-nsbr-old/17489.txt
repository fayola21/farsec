<title>Issue 17489 -   chromium -    pop-out in gmail puts the tab in the middle of the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> pop out a thread or email compose in gmail into it's own window. The tab   gets rendered near the bottom of the window and doesn't move on resize.    This is driving me crazy as it's in the middle of the email I'm trying to   compose. :)    Marking as a P1 due to degree of jankyness. Feel free to make it a P2 if you   disagree. </pre>
