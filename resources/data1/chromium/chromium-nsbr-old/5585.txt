<title>Issue 5585 -   chromium -    Repeatable browser crash/DCHECK while loading page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Paste the following URL into the address bar and hit enter:    <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?">http://news.google.com/news/url?</a>  sa=t&amp;ct2=us%2F0_0_s_15_0_t&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFmvm488Tuba_G0KQrilVUuKRc8w&amp;cid=12806  78230&amp;ei=Ef1HSZDBLoHyggPfhvvSAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%  2FinnovationNewsConsumerGoodsAndRetail%2FidUSTRE4BF4ER20081216    On 1.0.154.36  this crashes the whole browser.    On my trunk debug build  I hit the DCHECK in   NavigationController::RendererDidNavigateInPage() (but if I continue on  I   seem to be able to load the page).    I'm assigning to brettw merely for triage purposes since I don't know who   else knows the Navigation Controller code.  CCing mal in case we want to   try and solve this and merge back a fix to the release branch. </pre>
