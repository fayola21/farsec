<title>Issue 4903 -   chromium -    Critical UI Scaling Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> :: Chrome Version       : 0.5.155.0 (11/28/08 Chromium Trunk Build Win32)  :: URLs (if applicable) : ALL  :: Other browsers tested:        Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    :: What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Turn on Chromium    :: What is the expected result?  Chromium should draw itself as advertised.    :: What happens instead?  When maximized  the window bar is halfway cropped off the screen.  New windows  and un-maximized windows will often lag (extremely) when I try   to maximize or minimize them.    The browser is otherwise entirely usable.  Attaching screenshot...    I am using a Toshiba Laptop  Win32 XP SP3.  The monitor is 1280x800.  This was NOT an issue with the Google-branded Chrome (.3) version!  Something has broken.    </pre>
