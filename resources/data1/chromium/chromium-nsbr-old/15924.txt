<title>Issue 15924 -   chromium -    All GYP generated files should be in a separate directory on the buildbot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a pain to manage the svn:ignore and we are generally reluctant to   have anything modified in the src directory when building anyway.    So the GYP files should be generated either in a new separate directory or in   the output directory (I don't mind either way).    To reduce the complexity of the change  the .xcodeproj/.sln/SConstruct files   could be kept in src/ in the meantime to keep the buildbot happy. </pre>
