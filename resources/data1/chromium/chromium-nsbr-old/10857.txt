<title>Issue 10857 -   chromium -    got lost in ebay  using the refine search area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Selected books from ebay categories  2. In listing of sub-categories selected &quot;NonFiction Books&quot;  3. In the left hand column  the refine search column  check marked   &quot;history&quot;  4. In the &quot;refine search&quot; column under &quot;Sub-Category&quot; I clicked on &quot;Choose   More&quot;     What is the expected result? expected ebay to present window with all the   sub-categories from which I can select as many as I wish to have included   in my refined search      What happens instead? the window greyed out and the cursor indicated work   in progress and it hung in that condition.      <b>Please provide
