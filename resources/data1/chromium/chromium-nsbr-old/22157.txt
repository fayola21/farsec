<title>Issue 22157 -   chromium -    Extension with empty permissions array in manifest crashes utility process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install attached extension.  2. Install fails with &quot;utility process crashed&quot;.    This is caused by a call to ExtensionErrorReporter inside extension.cc that   was left over from a very long time ago (before we had the sandboxed unpacker   process).    ExtensionErrorReporter is a singleton that must be initialized manually. This   is never done in the utility process  so we crash. </pre>
