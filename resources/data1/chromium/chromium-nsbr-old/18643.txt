<title>Issue 18643 -   chromium -    No way to 'unclear' the address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22005">r22005</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu    I happen to edit the URL of a page quite often  e.g. during web   development. It happens that when I do that  sometimes I mark the entire   URL and erase it  or I erase/edit some part of it which is not what I   originally wanted.    In Firefox I can just hit Escape; the URL will then go back to the original   value.    In Chrome  this does not work. Not even reloading the page will bring back   the original URL. The only way I found is hitting back and forward  which   is kind of a pain.      1. Go to website  2. Start editing the URL  3. Decide that what you did to the URL was not a good idea  and that you   want the old URL back  4. Hit Escape  5. Nothing happens        When I hit escape  the URL should be reset to the original value.        Nothing. </pre>
