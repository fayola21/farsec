<title>Issue 6077 -   chromium -    Find In Page box not positioned accurately on RTL UIs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1210355&gt;    The code that positions the Find In Page box assumes that the web page's   scroll bar is always positioned on the right hand side of the page.   Currently  this causes the Find In Page box to be positioned slightly   differently on RTL and LTR locales.    This is currently not a problem because WebKit always positions the web   page's scroll bars on the right hand side  but this is a WebKit bug. Once   this WebKit bug is fixed  the Find In Page box is going to be positioned   very close to or even on top of the left hand side scroll bar on RTL UIs.    In order to fix this problem  the Find In Page box positioning code should   find out the location of the page's scroll bars and use this information in   order to accurately position the Find In Page box. </pre>
