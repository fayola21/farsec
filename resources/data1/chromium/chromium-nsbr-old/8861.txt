<title>Issue 8861 -   chromium -    Make a constant for &quot;null&quot; security origin string literal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's confusing to have the string &quot;null&quot; appear in various places.  We   should use a constant instead.  Wan-Teh  do you have a suggestion were we   should put this?  Maybe somewhere in webkit/glue?  net/base?   </pre>
