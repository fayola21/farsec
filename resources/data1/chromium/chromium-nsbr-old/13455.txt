<title>Issue 13455 -   chromium -    Extension unpacker process has errors sporadically on Themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Run Chrome  2. Drag the attached test theme onto it    &gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    The theme should apply  instead  it only applies about half of the time. A   quick breakpoint check shows the unpacker starting up  then getting an   OnChannelError (with crash = false).    This is only reproducable when using a separate process for the unpacker.   Generally it fails the first few attempts within a session  but once it   starts working  it works consistently for the rest of that browser session. </pre>
