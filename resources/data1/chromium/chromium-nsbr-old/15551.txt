<title>Issue 15551 -   chromium -    Missing basic features in the Downloads page (Delete from disk  Remove from list  Locate on disk...) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These features are currently missing    it was written in <a title="Correct context menu should be displayed for downloads page." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8826"> Issue 8826 </a> that it is not planned to do this using a   context menu  but also written that we should implement those somehow...    i am opening this issue because merging such requests to a &quot;wontfix&quot; issue   (while the suggestions are valid) is confusing    please note that this issue doesn't duplicate <a title="Add &quot;Remove&quot; to the menu on items in the download bar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60"> Issue 60 </a> as <a title="Add &quot;Remove&quot; to the menu on items in the download bar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60"> issue 60 </a> is about   the download shelf only </pre>
