<title>Issue 6301 -   chromium -    Images disappear after some use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using a page for a while (sometimes several hours like Gmail)  all the   images on the page will suddenly disappear. This happened sometime in the   past week  since I wasn't noticing it with the previous nightly build I was   using. </pre>
