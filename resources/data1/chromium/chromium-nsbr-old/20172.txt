<title>Issue 20172 -   chromium -    Heavy site (flash) doesn't load when opening in a group of 10-12 sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 4.0.203.0 SVN Revision: 24101  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open 10-12 heavy weight sites with speed in different tabs.  cnn.com  apple.com  lg.com  engadget.com  finance.yahoo.com  hyundai.com  ...  ...    2. Wait for 15-20 seconds  when they are all loading  open other 2-3 heavy  sites in different tabs (same window)  - ford.com  - gm.com  - sony.com    3. Verify the sites opened in step 2.    Expected result:  3.1 Chrome loads all the sites including opened in the step 2.    Actual result:  3.2 Sites doesn't load (opened from step 2)  even after refreshing the tab  5-10 times.    Note:  - I think when I say heavy weight sites  site is having the flash plugin.  It appears that Chrome doesn't listen to step-2 sites at all and they are  blocked somewhere. </pre>
