<title>Issue 568 -   chromium -    Spanish: We mis-translated &quot;Allow all cookies&quot; to &quot;Show all cookies&quot; in Spanish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    translation &quot;5657156137487675418&quot; ('Allow all cookies') is translated into  Spanish as 'Mostrar todas las cookies' ('Show all cookies'). The right  translation should be 'Permitir todas las cookies'.    I'm attaching a patch to change it on generated_resources_es and  generated_resources_es-419. I'm afraid I didn't find the files which  generated them.     </pre>
