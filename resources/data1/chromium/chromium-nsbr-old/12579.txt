<title>Issue 12579 -   chromium -    Google chrome wrong time zone in history for Warsaw  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28    Hello!    I use Google Chrome 2.0.172.28 and in history in listed wrong time.  I'm current in the Karlovac Croatia time zone (GMT+2)  however  Chrome   history thinks my time zone is +1  but Firefox still reads it as +2.   When I type:   javascript:new%20Date().toString()   in Chrome Omnibar  I get:   Sat May 23 2009 15:34:49 GMT+0200 (Central European Daylight Time)   Which is Correct.   However  when I type that line into Firefox  I get:   Sat May 23 2009 15:35:10 GMT+0200 (Central European Daylight Time) which is   correct.   But Google chrome history shows GMT+1 time.  How to fix that? </pre>
