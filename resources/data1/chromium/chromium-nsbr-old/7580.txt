<title>Issue 7580 -   chromium -    Autocomplete popup remains stationary while browser window moves - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.162.0 (Developer Build 9503)  URL = <a href="http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/fsboSearch.php">http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/fsboSearch.php</a>    IE7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari 3: OK        Preconditions: Have some values previously entered into the &quot;Price&quot; field  in the above web page in order to trigger the autocomplete popup. (Enter a  value  hit the &quot;Submit&quot; button; repeat a couple of times).    1. Navigate to <a href="http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/fsboSearch.php">http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/fsboSearch.php</a>  2. With keyboard focus on the &quot;Price&quot; field  hit the Down Arrow key to  trigger the autocomplete popup.  3. Click and drag on the title bar to move the browser window.    What is the expected output?     The autocomplete popup should either disappear when trying to move the  window  or else move with the window. (In IE7  FF3  and Safari 3  it  disappears).    What do you see instead?    The autocomplete popup remains stationary on the screen while the window moves.    See attached picture.     </pre>
