<title>Issue 4224 -   chromium -    Window Management controls don't work with maximized RTL Chrome windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm sorry  if it dupe. Just noticed this.  Reproduces in 154.8 (Official build)  live and ToT.    1. Launch Chrome with any RTL (Eg: he  ar)  2. Maximize the browser window.  3. Hover over window management controls (min max close)  notice they won't  get highlighted at all and they won't react to user events too.    BUT you are lucky to close the window (by clicking x button)  by keeping  your mouse pointer on very top-left corner of the 'x' button [almost of  your desktop too].    Works fine with old-frames. </pre>
