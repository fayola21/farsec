<title>Issue 18991 -   chromium -    While navigating from a website to another within a tab  a new instance of SiteInstance isn't being created - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   (Add break points in appropriate places...)  1. Open a website that has links to pages within the same website  and   links to pages outside.   2. Open a link leading to a page within the same site in a new tab. It   shares the site instance with its parent tab  which is fine.   3. Click on a link to another website in the first tab (i.e. navigate to   another website in the same tab). No new instance of SiteInstance is   created. This tab still points to a SiteInstance created for the previous   website. [This happens irrespective of whether you follow step 2 or not -   its just if you do you can see 2 tabs with content from different websites   sharing the same site instance] .                  <b>Please provide
