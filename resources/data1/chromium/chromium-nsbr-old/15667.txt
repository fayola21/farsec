<title>Issue 15667 -   chromium -    new tab button spacing isn't consistent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open a new window add a second tab to it.  2. click on the second tab and start to drag it down      The new tab button should stay in place  instead it jumps to the left by a   larger gap and snaps back when done or when you drag the tab left of the   first  causing it to be properly spaced from the last tab again.     </pre>
