<title>Issue 2599 -   chromium -    Would like more than nine items on the Most Visited - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open New Tab  2. The new tab displays the nine most recently visited sites as thumbnails        I would like a configuration option  where I can set how many recently   visited sites are displayed. I'm using a perhaps higher than average   resolution  as such seeing more thumbnails will most efficiently use my   screen space.     </pre>
