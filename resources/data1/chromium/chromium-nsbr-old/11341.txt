<title>Issue 11341 -   chromium -    Performance regression on page load/navigation from Chrome 1 to Chrome 2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From unofficial &quot;stopwatch&quot; testing  I've found that Chrome 2.0.X tends to   load some pages slightly slower than Chrome 1.0.154.X.    Loading a particular blogger blog in repeated tests when clearing the cache   inbetween trials shows ~300ms difference  and ~200ms when not clearing the   cache.  I suspect that this is the result of rare but periodic outliers   where Chrome 2 will whiteout for a few seconds while the throbber spins.  I   haven't seen this behavior on Chrome 1.    I'm marking this as unconfirmed until we have better/more reliable   information.  Jim  did your object-counting testing find anything   interesting on this? </pre>
