<title>Issue 14394 -   chromium -    Feature request: Forward-slash to search document (/) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The most-used feature for me in Firefox is using forward-slash to start   searching a document. While I realise I can use CTRL-F instead  forward-  slash is much more intuitive for me  and I imagine lots of others coming   from a Firefox background.    The key is not being used for anything else currently  so this should be a   very easy implementation :)    Affects all platforms  all versions so far. </pre>
