<title>Issue 17682 -   chromium -    NNTP thumbnail sometimes drags behind other thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1      1. Open new tab  2. Drag a thumbnail over the thumbnails in front of it and behind it        The selected thumbnail remains in the foreground as it's dragged over other   thumbnails.      The selected thumbnail remains in the foreground as it's dragged over the   thumbnails in front of it  but when it's dragged over the thumbnails behind   it  it hovers in the background.      Note: I haven't been able to reproduce this since the first time it   happened.   </pre>
