While trying to write Hebrew words with Niqqud (punctuation) the words are   not recognized  2. Typing Hebrew words with Hebrew Maqaf   (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maqaf#Hyphen_and_maqaf">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maqaf#Hyphen_and_maqaf</a>) the word is marked as   invalid  3. In acronyms (usually written with Quotation Mark or Gershayim) I get to red   marks - one for the part before the Quotation Mark and one after it while the   quotation mark is left unmarked    Some simple examples:  ___��_&quot;_��_ (Hebrew for IDF)  _��__��_&quot;_��_ (Yehuda  Shomron and Gaza)  ___��___&quot;_��_ (CEO)  ___��_&quot;__ (VAT)  _��__��_&quot;__ (by heart)  ___��_&quot;__ (National Roads Company of Israel)  _��__��_&quot;_��_ (Besiyata Dishmaya)  And so on...        Red Marks for each of the situations      The text is not recognized     </pre>
