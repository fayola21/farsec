<title>Issue 18879 -   chromium -    Window closing consistency - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was writing this as a comment on my patch at   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/165220">http://codereview.chromium.org/165220</a> and realised the issue was a bit   confusing:      - Firefox acepts ctrl+w but not esc for it's bookmark manager  but both   close the options dialog.     - Chrome closes it's options on esc but not ctrl+w  and the bookmarks   manager will only close with alt+F4.     - Chrome's task manager closes with esc and ctrl+w. </pre>
