<title>Issue 22970 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Frame: Meta tag in Conditional Comment doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome Frame  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-">http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-</a>  frame/browse_thread/thread/c962e44abe4c925    Alex Russell asked me to to file this as a bug:    Adding  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;chrome=1&quot; /&gt;  to a page works  but it doesn't work anymore after adding conditional   comments around it  &lt;!--[if IE]&gt;  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;chrome=1&quot; /&gt;  &lt;![endif]--&gt;  while IE does read what's inside.  Can you make Google Chrome Frame read inside conditional comments too  so   that Google Chrome Frame can also be activated when the meta tag is in an   IE-only block?      The page gets rendered by Google Chrome Frame.      The page gets rendered by IE. </pre>
