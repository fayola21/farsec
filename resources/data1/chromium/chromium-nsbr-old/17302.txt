<title>Issue 17302 -   chromium -    Download meter progresses counterclockwise in RTL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Download a file  while using a Hebrew UI.        Normal (&quot;cyclic&quot;) progress meter.        Progress meter moves counterclockwise!    I've just installed Chrome on my son's new machine -- he doesn't speak   English yet  so I've used the Hebrew UI. I was very surprised to see that   the download &quot;clocks&quot; move counterclockwise. Listen  guys  we might write   in an odd direction  but our clocks still progress normally. This might   sound trivial but in fact it's very disturbing. </pre>
