<title>Issue 5517 -   chromium -    'End' and 'Home' key do not take focus in collapsed 'select' lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : Example: <a href="http://www.ups.com">http://www.ups.com</a>            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        Activate a 'select' list (such as the language list on ups.com splash page)    ---    What is the expected result?  What happens instead?    When the 'select' list is collapsed (such as when navigating a page/form   using the keyboard only)  use of the 'home' or 'end' keys scrolls the page    not the select list.  If the 'select' list is activate with the mouse  the   'home' and 'end' keys will select the first and last options of the list   respectively.   </pre>
