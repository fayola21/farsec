<title>Issue 22495 -   chromium -    Chrome does not remember user name and password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4 (Official Build 26653)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Fire up Chrome.   2. Set Chrome to remember passwords.  3. Set proxy settings to &quot;use automatic configuration script&quot;.       First time you open a page  it will ask for user name and password since   you are behind a proxy. Select &quot;Save Password&quot; when asked and Chrome should   remember the password when you close the browser and open up later again.      Chrome does not remember saved passwords when you open a new session. </pre>
