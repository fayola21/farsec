<title>Issue 12888 -   chromium -    Still have multiple prompts for form resubmission - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Am I smoking crack?  I thought we fixed this.    (1) Go to <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/up/">http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/up/</a>  (2) Fill in a zip code at the GET TICKETS: widget at top and hit Find.  (3) Hit back.  Hit forward.  Get a &quot;requires reload&quot; message.  Hit reload.    Get an annoying confirmation prompt. </pre>
