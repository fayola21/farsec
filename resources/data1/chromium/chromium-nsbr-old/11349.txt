<title>Issue 11349 -   chromium -    [Feature] Change Tabs in windows 7 using the Jump Lists just like IE 8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;2.0.177.1&gt;                IE 8: OK              A Feature that should be made available to windows 7 users! In Windows 7    by opening multiple tabs in internet explorer 8  we will be able to change   tabs by using the jump list and preview feature. So if you could add this   feature for google chrome  it would certainly make it rock!  Check the attached file to understand what i'm saying. </pre>
