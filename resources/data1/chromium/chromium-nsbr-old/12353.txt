<title>Issue 12353 -   chromium -    Extensions: Race between toolstrip and bookmark system startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1: Create an extension with a toolstrip as the attached file.  2: Start chrome  3: Observe that a bookmark either was not created or was created in the root   of &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot;  4: Delete any bookmarks that were created  5: New window  6: Observe that a bookmark is created in a child folder of &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot;    The problem seems to be that the bookmarks system is starting up around the   time that the toolstrip is spawning. Maybe we can queue messages into the   bookmark module until the bookmark manager starts up? Or maybe delay   toolstrip startup until after the bookmark system? </pre>
