<title>Issue 5353 -   chromium -    History back button causes input fields to lose values if and only if the url hash has changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.adventuresupport.com/bugs/chrome_bug.html">http://www.adventuresupport.com/bugs/chrome_bug.html</a>          Safari 4 (528.1.1): OK       Firefox 3 (3.04): OK       Firefox 2 (2.0.0.18): OK       IE 7 (7.0.5730.11): OK      IE 6 (6.0.2900.2180): OK       Opera 9 (9.62): OK       Chrome (0.4.154.33): FAIL       See <a href="http://www.adventuresupport.com/bugs/chrome_bug.html">http://www.adventuresupport.com/bugs/chrome_bug.html</a> for a simple test   case. To summarize the steps on that page:  1. Change the url hash  2. Change the value of an input element  3. Browse to another site  4. Use the history back button      When pressing the back button  the text input should maintain the value you   typed.      You lose your input values. This problem makes history generally unusable   with url hashes and breaks AJAX history managers that depend on hidden   inputs.    Other info:  The closest bug I could find to this is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=151">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=151</a>. If this is indeed   the root cause of that bug  then it appears that there was a lot of   confusion in that thread. </pre>
