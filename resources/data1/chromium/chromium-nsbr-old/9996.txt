<title>Issue 9996 -   chromium -    Windowless plugin (e.g.  some Flash) mouse input broken/offset when page is zoomed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.myspace.com/freakedfrequency">http://www.myspace.com/freakedfrequency</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to above URL (or any myspace page with an embedded music player)  2. Zoom page to more than 100%  3. Try clicking on the player controls or hover the mouse over songs      If you use 100% zoom hovering the mouse over individual songs highlights   them. Pressing player/stop buttons or moving the slider also works as it   should.      If zoom != 100% neither the buttons nor the song highlight work. It appears   as if the player is picking up offset input.     Notice that the player doesn't scale with the zoom  it just moves to the   zoomed position. This might be what's causing the problem - feeding flash   with input as if it were scaled whereas it actually isn't?   </pre>
