<title>Issue 16953 -   chromium -    Slashdot's slug-Bottom strange select behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open a story on Slashdot  2.  Scroll to the bottom of the inane comments  3.  Try to select text from the last line of the comment.  You will want to   select something on the right side of the screen.  Be sure to find a   comment that is close to the bottom.    Other browsers:     Safari 4:  Same bug     FF 3.0  :  Does not repro    What is the expected output?     The couple of words are selected.      What do you see instead?    Select covers most of the bottom of the page.  Selection area seems to   magically cover things you are not selecting.    Analysis:     There is an overlapping div positioned at the bottom of the page.  It is   overlapping the text.  When we select across the div the selection is   changing to include a large amount of content.     Look for &lt;div id=&quot;slug-Bottom&quot; class=&quot;slug&quot;...&gt;     It is unclear why this div is as tall as it is.  However  it appears   they are making efforts to make it unselectable.      We need to report this to WebKit. </pre>
