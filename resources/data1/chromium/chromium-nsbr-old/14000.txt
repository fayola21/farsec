<title>Issue 14000 -   chromium -    Extensions using Tab API crash browser on Restore after a crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable extensions with --enable-extensions  2. Launch Chromium  3. Install an extension like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vince-s-clock/">http://code.google.com/p/vince-s-clock/</a>  4. Kill the browser processes using Task Manager to simulate a crash  5. Launch Chromium  6. Attempt to restore the session    What is the expected output?     Session should be restored with all the original tags opening    What do you see instead?    Crash! 100% of the time.    Workaround:    Removing the --enable-extensions command line flag will allow you to   restore the crashed session.    This is not a mistake in the clock extension  it just happens to be a   convenient example for the problem.    Erik believes that the crash is due to a race condition.  When restoring   from a crash we tear down the current window and create a new one. </pre>
