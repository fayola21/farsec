<title>Issue 1544 -   chromium -    Alert when closing browser with downloads in progress - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi All   when we are downloading some thing   the download page is hidden at the   bottom of the browser which is good  but if we forget about the in-  progress/on going  downloads and suddenly close the browser  all the   downloads are lost and we have to start from begining  There is no option   to resume from where it was stopped.  It would be better if we can resume from the point the browser closed OR    if the browser can alert the user when closing the browser saying some   thing like &quot; downloads are active and they will be terminated if we close   the browser&quot; and ask for confirmation to close the browser it will be very   helpful.    Thanks.    </pre>
