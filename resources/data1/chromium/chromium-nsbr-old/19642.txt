<title>Issue 19642 -   chromium -    Should support context menu key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT ( <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23643">r23643</a>)    -While focus is on rendered page (for eg: search box on Google home page)   pressing context menu key should bring up the appropriate context menu.    Result:  The key event is ignored.    PS: We honor this event  when focus is on Omnibox.    I believe this bug does not applicable to Mac ??   </pre>
