<title>Issue 22163 -   chromium -    It's possible to run two browsers from the same profile and that seems bad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch once from the command line.  For example    /path/to/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium  2. Launch again from the command line using the same command.  Do it   from a different terminal window or something  because the first one will   be occupied by the instance you started in step 1.      Expect: the second attempt should fail.  There should be some pretty   message about not being able to start up again because the program is   already running.  Or  maybe  bonus points if the second Chrome found the   instance running out of the same profile  brought the first one to the front   if the second was in the foreground  and then exited cleanly.  Observe: two Chromes one cup.  One profile  I mean.      4.0.207.0    Also  when you tried this in the past  the second Chrome would crash in   sqlite.  That doesn't seem to happen any longer. </pre>
