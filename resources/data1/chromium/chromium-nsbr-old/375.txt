<title>Issue 375 -   chromium -    gmail checkbox disappears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox">http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox</a>            Firefox 3: OK          After leaving the gmail inbox open for some time without viewing the tab I   came back to find the checkboxes to the left of each message had disappeared.  Both clicking on the gmail icon and using f5 to refresh had   no effect.  Moving the mouse over the area the checkbox should have drawn   did reveal the outline of a checkbox but it could not be selected.  Opening   a new tab to gmail resolved the issue.  I was able to open messages   normally.     </pre>
