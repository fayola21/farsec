<title>Issue 3257 -   chromium -    evaluate the WebKit font cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Up merge to webkit@<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36102">r36102</a> pulled in a new font cache   (WebCore/platform/graphics/FontCache.*) that removes inactive fonts and   deletes them.  We should evaluate this.  There are two issues:    1) Determine a good size for the font cache.  Mike bumped the size of the   cache from 120 to 256 because there were performance issues on the intl2   page cycler at 120.    2) Figure out how the FontCache impacts memory.  In addition to better   performance with a cache size of 256  there was also a drop in peak-vm-  renderer usage from the change.  This doesn't make sense.  Someone should   investigate why (perhaps we're leaking or perhaps it's causing lots of   memory fragmentation).     </pre>
