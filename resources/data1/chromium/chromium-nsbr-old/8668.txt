<title>Issue 8668 -   chromium -    Support tab-to-search on every site by falling back to &quot;site:&quot; restrict - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. type a random website   2. hit tab      &quot;Search website&quot; token appears      Focus moves out of the omnibox    I suggest we fall back to google site search if there is no form info available for this site:  &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%1$s&amp;as_sitesearch=%2$s">http://www.google.com/search?q=%1$s&amp;as_sitesearch=%2$s</a>&quot;  (first arg is query  second is hostname)    Ideally  we should allow this string to honor the preferred search provider:  &quot;<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%1$s&amp;vs=%2$s">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%1$s&amp;vs=%2$s</a>&quot;   </pre>
