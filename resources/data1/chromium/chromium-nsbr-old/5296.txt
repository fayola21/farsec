<title>Issue 5296 -   chromium -    Color for canvas demo is incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The lower left square of this canvas demo:  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-">https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-</a>  tutorial/4_3_canvas_globalalpha.html    comes out a different color than in Firefox and Safari (should be blue). I   see green in 0.5.155.0 (Developer Build 6576) and white in 0.4.154.33   (Official Build 6493). </pre>
