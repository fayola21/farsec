<title>Issue 8543 -   chromium -    gmail conversation list scrolls back to top - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 2.0.168.0    steps to reproduce:  1. Go to a conversation list that has enough conversations to require a   scroll bar.  2. Scroll down  click on a conversation near the bottom of the list.  3. Click the back button.    At this point the conversation list will snap back to the top and the   conversation you came from will be scrolled off the bottom. This used to   work. Not sure when it broke. </pre>
