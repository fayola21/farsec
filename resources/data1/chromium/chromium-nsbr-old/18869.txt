<title>Issue 18869 -   chromium -    Downloads file after request to download has been cancelled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37 (Official Build )             Safari 4: Can't test    Firefox 3.x: Can't test           IE 7: Can't test           IE 8: Can't test      What steps will reproduce the problem? (Not sure because I can't try again     this issue caused me to go way over my internet quota)  1. Click on a download link (in my case: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/8/4/E846AE70-0D24-4ADC-A126-">http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/8/4/E846AE70-0D24-4ADC-A126-</a>  173183960FC9/WindowsXPMode_en-us.exe  2. When it asks you where to store the file  press cancel  3. Leave the window open      Nothing is downloaded      According to my network administrator  that file did get downloaded by me   (however  it is not anywhere on my PC  so it seems Chrome downloaded it    and then deleted it since I had not saved it anywhere)         </pre>
