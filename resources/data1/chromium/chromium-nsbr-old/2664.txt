<title>Issue 2664 -   chromium -    Consider a lock-less painting strategy for windowless plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Consider a lock-less painting strategy for windowless plugins    On my T60 dual core laptop  performance is still pretty bad for windowless   plugins while scrolling a page if the plugin is animating.    Sample sites:  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/?iref=videoglobal">http://www.cnn.com/video/?iref=videoglobal</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/</a> &lt;-- click past the roadblock ad if any    These sites run heavy animation loops  which appear to completely dominate   the plugin thread.  As a result  the lock used to protect the plugin buffer   is almost always held  and the renderer gets stuck waiting on that lock a   lot.    Instead  I think we should employ the same rendering model used to render   webkit.  That model involves no locks.  Instead  the buffer is copied.    Moreover  it only paints when the previous paint is acknowledged.  That   way  the painting is adaptively rate-limited.    I believe this approach will result in much better performance. </pre>
