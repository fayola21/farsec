<title>Issue 158 -   chromium -    Incognito window  not so 'incognito' with Flash content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/">http://flex.org/showcase/</a> and most of Flash sites  Other browsers tested: not applicable      1. Open an Incognito window  2. Visit a Flash site  for example  <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/">http://flex.org/showcase/</a>  3. Go to C:Documents and Settings[user]Application DataMacromediaFlash   Player#SharedObjects[random number]  4. See a folder called flex.org      An Incognito window should be *really* anonymous  and as advertised  read-  only. Nobody should be able to know what pages we have been visiting.      Visiting Flash sites leaves remnants in the folder above mentioned.    I know it's very difficult to control external plugins  but if it is not   possible to control this  at least user should be warned about this   behavior  and not told to browser like if nobody could tell what pages he   has been visiting. </pre>
