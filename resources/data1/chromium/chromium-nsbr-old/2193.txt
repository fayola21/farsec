<title>Issue 2193 -   chromium -    Be able to launch chrome task manager while an alert() is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Should be able to open the chrome task manager  while an alert() is in the   foreground.    ---------------  Background:  ---------------    If the chrome task manager is already open  and a page triggers an   alert/confirm/prompt (modal dialog)  you are able to click on the task   manager window and use it --- GOOD. (this allows you to kill the offending   page)    However  if the chrome task manager is NOT already open  there is no way to   open once the modal is showing -- BAD.  At this point you have no choice but to hope the 'suppress further alerts'   option will show up eventually  and keep clicking things.       </pre>
