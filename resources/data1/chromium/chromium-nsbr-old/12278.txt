<title>Issue 12278 -   chromium -    &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog nonfunctional (missing components  100% CPU) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This appears to only happen on 32-bit Chrome (?).  Right click on an image and click &quot;save as&quot;.    Contrast the Chrome screenshot versus the Firefox one.    It appears the message loop is going crazy -- repeatedly rerunning our   dispatch  despite us properly telling it to call back later.    Vague guess  but it could be related to code in the dialog initialization   running a nested message loop?    Not sure of the proper priority for this.  It's pretty broken.  I'm not sure   how many others are encountering it. </pre>
