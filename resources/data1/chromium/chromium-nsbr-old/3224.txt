<title>Issue 3224 -   chromium -    dropping referrer on cntl+click and shift+click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ncl=1252704008&amp;hl=en&amp;topic=b">http://news.google.com/news?ncl=1252704008&amp;hl=en&amp;topic=b</a>  2. Click on the first article from Financial Times.    Observe that you can see the full article.    3. Now  go back to the news page  4. ctrl+click on the same FT article. (shift+click also works)    Observe that you get a login screen instead.    Note: FT gives 4 article views without subscription so you'll have to burn   those before you can repro this bug.    It seems that we're dropping the referrer on ctrl+click and shift+click   which FT uses to decide whether to require login (free pass for Google   News).         </pre>
