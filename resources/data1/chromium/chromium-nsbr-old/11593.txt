<title>Issue 11593 -   chromium -    Feature request: there should be an option to let the cache be deleted when you close a page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [FEATURE REQUEST]  Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1             IE 8: OK (but only when you completely close the browser)      1. Visit a page that changes every for example 20 minutes   2. Visit an other page (in a new tab and close the current tab)  3. Revisit the first page (when you are sure it has changed)    Chrome does display the 'old' page instead of the 'changed' page. This is   (I think) because it displays the page in the cache. I think there should   be an option (in the general options) to automatically delete the cache   when you move to an other page (or easier: to not create a cache).     The reason I wish this will be implemented is that I just visited my Hotmail account and it said that I had 5 unread messages. But I did have   read them already. After I pressed F5 (refresh) it displayed it correct.  An other example: if I update my personal site and I visit it  I regularly   see the 'not changed' page. I have to hit F5 to see the changes...
