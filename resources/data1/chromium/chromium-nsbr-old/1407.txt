<title>Issue 1407 -   chromium -    FEATURE: New tabpage while opening new URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   A very useful feature is on typing a URL in the address box (or opening a   bookmark etc.)  it opens in a new tabpage rather than the current tabpage   (which might have a URL already open).  Might add this as an option.  This   feature is available in Avant Browser (<a href="http://www.avantbrowser.com/">http://www.avantbrowser.com/</a>) and I   find it very useful.      Open the URL in new tabpage.      Opens in the current tabpage.    Please provide
