<title>Issue 9700 -   chromium -    Populate the NTP quicker by including lower ranking pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  the unpopulated new tab page shows six gray boxes and some text explaining that they will be populated in the future.  However  it   isn't clear to users how and when the NTP populates.  In fact  the NTP doesn't have much use when it has no thumbnails populated.  We should   have something here so the user can take some action.    The NTP as it is now  or as it will be in the future  should have something like:  1.  Pre-populated sites and thumbnails of popular or 'cool' sites  so users can get some value out of this page.  2.  Much more sensitive detection of the user's actions -- if I go to a site immediately  I should see it in the NTP immediately.  3.  Some animation that illustrates new NTP additions replacing old ones  so users know their actions caused the NTP to change.       </pre>
