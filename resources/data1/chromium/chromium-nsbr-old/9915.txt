<title>Issue 9915 -   chromium -    Regression: Dragging an HTML file onto a Chrome window broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Take any HTML file and try to drag and drop it onto a Chrome window   (content area/tab strip).    All I see is a &quot;Not possible&quot; icon (circle with the strikethrough).     This used to work. I'm on Vista 64  although I'm not sure if that makes any   difference. </pre>
