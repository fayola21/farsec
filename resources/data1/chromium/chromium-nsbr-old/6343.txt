<title>Issue 6343 -   chromium -    Configuring search for UK - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is awkward changing the search provider from www.google.com to  www.google.co.uk.   In fact  if I set my home page to www.google.co.uk ages  ago  but I didn't realise I was still getting US results when searching  from the browser chrome until shopping results came up with prices in $.    Suggestion 1:  If the user sets their home page to www.google.xx   automatically ask it they want to change their search engine to  www.google.xx too.      Also  if I search for Chrome from www.google.co.uk in say Firefox  I get  pointed at www.google.com/chrome.   If I explicitly select UK sites only  for the search then I get www.google.co.uk/chrome.  I downloaded Chrome  from .com  but would I have got a UK configuration if I had downloaded from  co.uk?    Suggestion 2: Make sure that users get a correct local configuration for  home page and search provider.   Either point the user to a preconfigured  local download or detect the local settings from user's computer or ask the  user to select their local settings in an initial set up stage. </pre>
