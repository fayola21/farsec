<title>Issue 5925 -   chromium -    Shadow on most visited intro box goes the wrong way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version 1.0.156.0 (Developer build 7503)    When you start with a clean profile  the drop shadow on the &quot;The 'most   visited' area shows the websites...&quot; box goes the wrong way. Actually  it   seems to go a random direction when I open the new tab page different   times. </pre>
