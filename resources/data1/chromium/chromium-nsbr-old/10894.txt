<title>Issue 10894 -   chromium -    shell_dialogs_mac.mm need unit tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> shell_dialogs_mac.mm need a unit test.    This should probably be done by integrating the 3rd-party OCMock into our  tree and using that to mock out NSSavePanel/NSOpenPanel. It has an Xcode  project in it  but we should write our own gyp file (per discussion with  mmentovai). </pre>
