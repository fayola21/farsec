What is the expected result?   password is shown to all     What happens instead?       hi   well i would like to suggest one thing for chrome  i think its   serious issue if chrome is used in internet center's  it is easy to hack   others email account using the show saved password utility   it is only   useful to some extent for standalone internet user  i think this tool needs   to be removed from chrome for better safety in using it or enhance the same   utility with some more security levels to see the password.       putting a captcha image wont help at all in this issue instead who are   all using the chrome  we can send them a 4 letter pin to their email id or   cellphone. if they want c the saved password just they type (and not copy   paste allowed) the pin from their alter email id. i think this solution   will help to solve the issue    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.     </pre>
