<title>Issue 5103 -   chromium -    Request for Smooth Page Scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please add smooth scrolling on page-up/down.  It doesn't need to be too fancy or very smooth  but only enough so that we   don't loose track of what we were reading!  Current page-up/down transition is instantaneous and very counter   intuitive  as forces us to re-find the spot where we were  because the page   flashes instantaneously out of scene when we press the page key.  Chrome is simply TOO fast...     </pre>
