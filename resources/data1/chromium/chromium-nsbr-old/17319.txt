Use the top-right drop down menu to apply some custom segments        The graphs should refresh almost instantly      The graphs refresh very slowly  sometimes showing the spinning ball for up   to 10-15 seconds.     The top graph  the Flash one  sometimes never refreshes. It is just blank   white. Sometimes it is just taking a long time to refresh  but there is no   spinning ball to indicate it's still working. And sometimes it just stalls   and remains white.    <b>Please provide
