<title>Issue 4971 -   chromium -    Installing Chrome at system level shows First Run dialog on every launch for non-admin accounts until it's run by Admin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome at system level using Admin  2. Log into a Non-Admin account and launch Chrome from Start &gt; All Programs   &gt; Google Chrome  3. First Run dialog will be seen.   4. Close chrome and launch it again    What is the expected output?   Chrome window should be seen    What do you see instead?  First Run dialog. As the NonAdmin users can't write to Program Files  First   Run file doesn't get created and shows FRUI always. Once Chrome is run by   admin  First Run file gets created and works as expected with other users.     </pre>
