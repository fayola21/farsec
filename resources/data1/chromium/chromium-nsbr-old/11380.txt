<title>Issue 11380 -   chromium -    Network never comes back after lost wifi connection or suspend - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Before my laptop has associated with wifi  Chromium (obviously) fails to   load pages.  But after the connection comes through  it still fails to load   pages until I restart Chromium.    (This is a terrible bug report -- I don't even have error messages -- but it   is hard to remember to take notes when it fails.  I'll hopefully update this   later.) </pre>
