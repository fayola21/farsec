<title>Issue 17010 -   chromium -    about box &quot;restart needed&quot; message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you auto-update but don't restart  the about box will show the old version  and the &quot;Update Now&quot;   button says &quot;no updates needed&quot;.  There needs to be a message saying something like &quot;restart for   the new version which is already installed&quot;.    (Dup I think but I can't find the original).    To mark since he's working on auto-update at the moment; knowledge of the new mechanism   needed to implement this. </pre>
