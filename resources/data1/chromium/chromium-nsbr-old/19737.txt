<title>Issue 19737 -   chromium -    Pushing 6K Bookmarks to sync server (bootstrap scenario) can make browser temporarily unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1955769    Repro Steps:  1) Client B is connected to sync (empty state)  2)  Client A has 6K bookmarks (flat hierarchy) under 'other bookmarks' and   came online    Actual:  Both clients become significantly less usable for long time (more than 15   mins).    Expected:  Both client should be usable all the time. Sync should happen behind the   scene in background and should not make whole chrome not responsive.  Also it should not this much long just to sync 6K bookmarks    This wouldn't be as high a priority (6K bookmarks is kind of an edge case)    but the symptom is one that really should never occur.  We should figure   out if some part of our architecture is actually at fault here.   </pre>
