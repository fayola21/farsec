<title>Issue 15687 -   chromium -    can't close tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I frequently get empty tabs that I can't close  either by clicking on the close   button or via the keyboard. They do close if I close the window.    The current instance that I hit was a link to a PDF from gmail. I cmd+clicked   the link and it both downloaded the file and opened an empty tab. I can't   close the empty tab.    I tested this a second time and it happened again.    Not sure that this is a mac-only problem. Others can comment if they've seen   in ton Windows/Linux. </pre>
