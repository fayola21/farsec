<title>Issue 6827 -   chromium -    Add support for style=&quot;page-break-before: always; and al. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FF3 and IE7 supports this feature.    This is not supported in WebKit yet. The webkit bug is very old:   <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5097">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5097</a>    This will definitely help webpages designed to be printed  especially   Google Docs.      The person who grab this bug will have all my gratitude. </pre>
