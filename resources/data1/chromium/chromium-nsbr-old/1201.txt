<title>Issue 1201 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Change Spell Check language without restarting browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Other browsers tested: Firefox          Firefox 3: OK        1. Right-click inside a form text box or similar text entry space          I was expecting a context menu tu appear that allowed me to change the   spell-checking language to use. Many people  like me  write in at least two   languages and  for example  might be writing a blog entry in Spanish in one   tab  and two seconds later change to another tab to post a comment in an   English blog.      You have to click the configuration icon  select Options from the context   menu  then click on the middle tab  go to Fonts and Languages  click on the   change the configuration of fonts and languages button  choose the   Languages tab from the new window  and choose from the bottom the language   of the ortographic corrector the language you want for the current entry   you're about to write. Then  do that allover again if you need to write in   another language. Too many steps!    </pre>
