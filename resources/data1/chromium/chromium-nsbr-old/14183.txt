<title>Issue 14183 -   chromium -    Zoom button disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: cannot reproduce (no system)      1.  On a large display plugged into a MacBook Pro  open Chrome  2.  Expand its length to greater than the MBP screen size  3.  Switch to the smaller  built-in display    What is the expected result?  Maximize button and View-&gt;Full Screen menu  item should both be enabled  so that screen can be maximized so that the  resize corner is accessible.    What happens instead?  Maximize button/View-&gt;Full Screen both disabled  so  page cannot be maximized to get access to the resize corner.  Restarting  Chrome brings up the same condition  so it can't be used until the large  display is used again.    This appears to be a high-priority  since many web pages have essential  links (such as &quot;next page&quot;) near their bottom. </pre>
