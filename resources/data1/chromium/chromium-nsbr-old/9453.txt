<title>Issue 9453 -   chromium -    weird new tab -&gt; view source behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chromium (tested with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12631">r12631</a>)  2. From a New Tab  Press ctrl + U to view source        It opens up a new tab  rather than view source. On this new tab  ctrl + U  is disabled.    Should view source always be disabled for the new tab page? I can perform  view source either with ctrl + U  or via page icon -&gt; developer -&gt; view source.   </pre>
