<title>Issue 22261 -   chromium -    Load plugins from ~/.config/$PRODUCT_NAME/plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> gimpscape was asking about it on IRC.  He wanted to be able to install a   plugin in a user writable location.  I mentioned .mozilla/plugins  but   that's not as obvious and could cause problems with Firefox.    I'm a little reluctant to add more directories because it'll slow down   plugin loading  but we should probably at least have a bug about it. </pre>
