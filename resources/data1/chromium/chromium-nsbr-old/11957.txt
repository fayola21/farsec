<title>Issue 11957 -   chromium -    copying non-ASCII characters and pasting into TextEdit garbles characters. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181 (181.0)&lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               :  10.5.7&lt;from About This Mac&gt;        This is an encoding problem  or something related to keyboard layouts different from English (in   my case - it's russian keyboard layout). When i'm copying some piece of text from browser to the   clipboard  and then paste it into TextEdit or other word processor  i can't read anything - it's   displayed in ureadable encoding.    Please fix it. Thanks. </pre>
