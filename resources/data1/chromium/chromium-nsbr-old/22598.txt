<title>Issue 22598 -   chromium -    After browsing for a while  some pages don't load stylesheets / external resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 212.0 (Developer Build 26735)  URLs (if applicable) : twitter.com  google.com/reader  imeem.com  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):works as expected  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):untested  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:works as expected in limited testing    I have noticed  in roughly the last 5 days' builds or so  that  after browsing   for some amount of time  certain websites will fail to load certain external   resources. For example  once the issue is triggered  twitter.com and   support.apple.com will load without a stylesheet  the google reader   screenshot on its login page will be broken (and stylesheet will be missing   on login)  and imeem.com will fail to load its flash player widget on song or   playlist pages.     Once the issue has been triggered  attempting to view (for example) the   stylesheet for twitter.com directly via view source results in a Not Found   error with &quot;Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown error.&quot; as the description.   Copy &amp; pasting the same URL into Safari loads the stylesheet without issue.    Relaunching Chromium fixes the issue temporarily. Unfortunately I have   not been able to track down specific STR  other than the patterns noted   above. The only Console information that may (or may not) be pertinent   are messages like the following from system.log:    sandboxd[1730]: Chromium Helper(1733) deny mach-lookup   com.apple.windowserver.session    However I see many of these messages  they may not correspond directly to   resources failing to load.      1. [browsing for some period of time  typically repeated visits to the same   site]          All pages load all expected external media  stylesheets  etc. as long as   URLs are valid.      Certain pages load without stylesheets or certain other external resources   after some period of time. </pre>
