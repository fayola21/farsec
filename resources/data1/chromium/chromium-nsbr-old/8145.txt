<title>Issue 8145 -   chromium -    Handle allocation failure in TransparencyWin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The patch I'm going to soon submit to <a title="Cleartype text not rendered correctly with opacity applied" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=559"> issue 559 </a> will create layers for   drawing semitransparent text. We need to handle the failure case here  I   think we will currently crash instead. This is bad because it shouldn't be   too hard to force us to create a large layer. </pre>
