<title>Issue 230 -   chromium -    Usability: Double-clicking title bar doesn't create new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Generally  double-clicking the location you would like a new tab to appear   will create a new tab.  Since Chrome's tabs are in the menubar  it instead   maximizes the window.  Any double-click within one tabs-length of the other   tabs should add a new tab.  Otherwise  the Add tab widget needs to be   wider/easier to click quickly.  See also Fitts' Law. </pre>
