Click &quot;Multi-PopUp Test #2&quot;  3. In the lower-right of the Chrome window  open one of the blocked popups.        On Windows  the popup has only an omnibox and no back/fwd  refresh  star  or go buttons.  The   omnibox is read-only.  On OSX  the omnibox is live and the omnibox popup looks janky.   </pre>
