<title>Issue 20934 -   chromium -    Omnibox keyboard behavior wrong for &quot;See recent pages in history&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type something into the Omnibox until you see &quot;See N recent pages in  history containing foo&quot; as the last Omnibox dropdown entry.  2. Use the keyboard down arrow to highlight that entry.  3. Press Enter.        It should take me to chrome://history/#q=foo  as it does on Windows/Mac  or  when you click it with the mouse.    Instead  it does a search engine query.   </pre>
