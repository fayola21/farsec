<title>Issue 14643 -   chromium -    ThumbnailStore should check past redirect lists. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In ThumbnailStore::GetPageThumbnail only the most recent redirects list from   the history service is checked for available thumbnails for the given URL.   If no thumbnails on this redirect list are available  past redirect lists   should be fetched from the HistoryService and checked for available   thumbnails.   </pre>
