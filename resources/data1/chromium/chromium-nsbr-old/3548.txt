<title>Issue 3548 -   chromium -    javascript:alert() does not display when entered in URL bar in a view-source tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to any webpage  2. Right click on page and choose &quot;view source&quot;  3. In the page source tab  in the omnibox  type       javascript:alert(&quot;testing&quot;);      (altenatively  you can copy the javascript code above and do a right   click  paste and go in the omnibox)    What is the expected output?   Alert box should show. (If you do a &quot;paste and go&quot; with a regular url in   the view-source tab  it works fine)    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.           </pre>
