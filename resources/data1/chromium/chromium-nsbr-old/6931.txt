Launch Chrome  2. Login to Sites (<a href="http://sites.google.com/">http://sites.google.com/</a>)  3. Create or open an existing site  4. From Home page  click on 'More actions' &gt; 'Page settings'  5. Move focus to 'Page URL' text box  6. Korean IME &gt; change 'Han/Eng Toggle' to Korean mode [toggle.JPG]  7. Type Korean. For example  to type ��_��_��_��_��__ keystroke is rkskek     What is the expected output?  Chrome does not crash.    What do you see instead?  Chrome crashes.        This crash is caued by my IME code which updates a DOM node having deleted   by JavaScript. I'm writing a fix for this issue.   </pre>
