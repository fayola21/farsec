<title>Issue 21062 -   chromium -    NNTP triangle button should stay pressed-looking while its drop-down is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new tab  2. Click on the triangle button.  That's the rightmost button at the top   right group of three buttons.  3. A drop-down menu appears.      Expect: the triangle button to still look like it's pressed while the drop-  down is open.  Observe: the button only looks pressed while the mouse button is down.    As soon as the mouse button goes up or the mouse moves off of the   triangle button  it gets the un-pressed appearance.  It's not terribly   ergonomic or whatever.      4.0.207.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25381">r25381</a> Mac  whatever the current dev build is on Windows </pre>
