<title>Issue 19656 -   chromium -    links with anchors/fragments don't work correctly when opened in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.198.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23116">r23116</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  Window manager: ion3 20080207-2  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: works  according to brettw and sky      1. Go to <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml</a>  2. Middle-click one of the links in the table of contents at the     top of the page to open it in a new tab.      The new tab should be scrolled to the anchor/fragment from the link.      The new tab is scrolled to the bottom of the page.  Clicking in the omnibox and   hitting Enter makes it reload and scroll to the correct position.    I've been seeing this for a long time.  Brett says that there may be a webkit-  related change that's going in soon (or maybe just went in) that fixes it  but if   not  I want to make sure that this doesn't fall through the cracks. </pre>
