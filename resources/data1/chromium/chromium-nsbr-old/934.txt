<title>Issue 934 -   chromium -    favicon cause 'application shortcut' problems in Vista and XP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: Vista Home basic  Product Version      : Chrome 0.2.149.27    I built a simple webapp without a favicon or gears-style icon. I create the  shortcut using chrome and it works fine  with the default icon(white page).  I delete this shortcut then revise my webapp to include a favicon.ico. I  restart Chrome and visit the address again  noting that the favicon is now  working in the titlebar(traditional &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; .../&gt;). Creating a new  shortcut results in the old 'default' icon for the shortcut(desktop).    That was with Vista  I did a similar thing later with XP and got the  expected result for the small icon. Then I tried with a larger png:    I attempted to provide an icon using the Gears-api-style  now providing a  32x32 png file and the additional sizes=&quot;32x32&quot; attribute. I delete the  desktop shortcut. Upon restarting Chrome and calling up the shortcut  creation dialog I take notice that the dialog has the correct icon preview   a fairly crisp 32x32 image. Press OK and it creates a new shortcut with a  16x16 version of the image  rather than a larger version.        *Related to issues: 933  642  556  548  386 </pre>
