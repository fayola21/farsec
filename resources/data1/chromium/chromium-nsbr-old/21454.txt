<title>Issue 21454 -   chromium -    crash in net::x509Certficate::Verify / GetCertChainInfo on recent Linux builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using a recent Linux build and browsing to verisign.com  or sometimes just   after starting the browser and not going anywhere  leads to a crash in   net::x509Certificate::Verify / GetCertChainInfo.    This is probably the same crash I see in the recently updated Linux reference   build  though the stack trace in the core dump differs slightly from what I   see in a recent debug build.  Due to release (reference) vs debug (local) is   my guess.    I've attached a debug log from the crash I saw today using <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25802">r25802</a>.  In my   tests the crash goes back to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24015">r24015</a> at least.  My system is available if you   need to take a look. </pre>
