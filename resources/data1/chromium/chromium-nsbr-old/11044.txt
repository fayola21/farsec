<title>Issue 11044 -   chromium -    Omnibar search UI and Paste and search doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0      1. Type any non-default search engine keyword/URL into Omnibox (that Chrome   knows about)  2. Press &lt;Tab&gt; to go into search UI mode  3. (Optional) type something to search for  4. Right click -&gt; &quot;Paste and search&quot; doesn't work as expected      The selected search engine is used to search for my typed+pasted text.      default search engine is used to search for only my pasted text.    Additional info  I can understand why (though this is still questionable whether this is the   desired functionality) if i've copied an URL  instead of &quot;Paste and search&quot;   I see &quot;Paste and go&quot; option and instead of searching for pasted URL with   selected search engine  the URL itsself is opened... </pre>
