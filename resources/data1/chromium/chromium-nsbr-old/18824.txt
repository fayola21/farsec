<title>Issue 18824 -   chromium -    Load testing for viewvc solution for extension docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Investigate what kind of load viewvc can stand for hosting the extension   docs. If insufficient  come up with a plan for putting a cache in front of   it.    Note that a simple frontend might make sense anyway  as we could put the   canonical home of the docs on  eg  chrome.google.com. </pre>
