<title>Issue 22845 -   chromium -    Change our portable NTLM implementation to request username and password early - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our portable NTLM implementation in http_auth_handler_ntlm_portable.cc  asks the user for the username and password in the middle of the  authentication sequence  rather than at the beginning.  This breaks  Privoxy because Privoxy gives the browser only one second to respond  with the second request in the authentication sequence.  One second  is not enough time for the user to type his username and password.    We should change http_auth_handler_ntlm_portable.cc to request the  username and password at the beginning of the authentication sequence.    I deliberately wrote the code to request the username and password  late (right before they're needed) for two reasons:  - to stress our HTTP authentication handling code  making sure it    is general enough to handle this behavior;  - to prepare for the possibility of a future authentication scheme    that forces us to request the username and password in the middle    of the authentication sequence.    Neither of these reasons is mandatory. </pre>
