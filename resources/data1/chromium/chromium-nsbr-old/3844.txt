<title>Issue 3844 -   chromium -    Autofill popup should hide when the page loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Navigate to a form with an input field for which you have autofill data  2. Type in so the autofill popup is opened  3. Focus another window    Expected: the autofill popup is hidden  Actual: the autofill popup is still shown. It hides when you focus back the  page.      More context:  The code in webview_impl.cc should hide the autofill popup when the page  loses focus (setFocus(false)). It does not do that  as this breaks  selecting an entry in the popup with a click.  Autofill popups are shown without their window being activated (so the user  can still type in the input field). When you click on the popup  this first  kill the focus from the page  which would trigger the popup to close before  the click has been sent.  We would probably need to add to the set focus message sent to the render  widget info about which render widget is going to be focused (if any).  On Windows  the WM_KILLFOCUS message indicates which window is getting  focused  so that should be doable. </pre>
