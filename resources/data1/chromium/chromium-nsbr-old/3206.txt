<title>Issue 3206 -   chromium -    Bookmarks menu for toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enhancement request.    The problem.  * Accessing bookmarks with the mouse needs the bookmark bar turning on.  * Going to the smart homepage without opening a new tab needs turning on   the hidden Home option and adding to the visible UI.    The suggestion.  Create a Navigation menu.    Benefits.  * It would be easier to live without the bookmark bar visible giving many   people a cleaner screen.  * Hidden Home button and option would be readily available and could go.  * Would be a more sensible place to find things like History  Downloads    Bookmarks  Cookies  Passwords &amp; Search sites management.  * Would be a good place to access and control a better passcard or form   filling system  or other not yet implemented features.    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.    See attached jpg. </pre>
