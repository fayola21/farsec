<title>Issue 6693 -   chromium -    Possible for tabs not to expand to fill space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   0. Create a number of tabs  with gmail as your first tab.  1. Click on a link in gmail  such that it opens the tab as the second tab.  2. Press control-w to close the newly opened tab.        Notice the tab widths don't expand at this point  instead they behave as   though the mouse is still over the tab strip. Resize the window and notice   the tab widths snap to what they should be.     </pre>
