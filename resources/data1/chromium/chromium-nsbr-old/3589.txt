<title>Issue 3589 -   chromium -    onUnload event doesn't fire for either a refresh or a postback - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have tried both &lt;body onUnload=&quot;onUnloadFN()&quot;&gt; and   window.onunload=onUnloadFN;  both  as expected  function identically.    Both IE and Firefox do fire the event in both of these cases (refresh and   postback) and also if the page is navigated away from or the browser is   closed.  Chrome fires the event only for the latter two cases.  It is my   preference that Chrome would behave like the other browsers.  I need to   save state to the server so it can be restored when the user revisits the   page. </pre>
