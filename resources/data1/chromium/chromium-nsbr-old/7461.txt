<title>Issue 7461 -   chromium -    Cancelling pending PAC requests should avoid executing them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is broken out from <a title="Too many resource requests by renderer can cause memory exhaustion and eventual browser crash." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5688"> issue 5688 </a>.    ProxyService::CancelPacRequest() does not actually cancel the resolve request -- it simply prevents   the result being sent to the callback.    This means if there were hundreds of pending PAC requests and they are then all cancelled  network   performance remain slow until each of the cancelled requests actually complete. </pre>
