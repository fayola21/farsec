<title>Issue 1843 -   chromium -    No dropdown on address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. No drop down icon or button            One should be available.    It seems that the combo-box approach to the address bar is falling out of  favour since safari  but its really annoying. Basically to reach the last  visited pages  I always go for the dropdown box  and even in IE I am  presented with where I have just been. Firefox is even better these days   as the Awesome bar works out something relevant to me. Both Chrome and  Safari are missing this very basic functionality  leaving an unbookmarked  browser keyboard only. Yes I know a new tab has a list of 8 recent pages   but no  I don't think its as good. Netscape 1 had this functionality. Its a  backwards step to remove it.      Please provide
