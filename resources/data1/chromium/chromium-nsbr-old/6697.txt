<title>Issue 6697 -   chromium -    Better message when waiting for ssl interstitial page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) : any https with SSL errors  Other browsers tested:  Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to a website with SSL errors.  2. Do not proceed to the site.  3. Open a new tab with the same website.    What is the expected result?  The SSL interstitial will be shown.    What happens instead?  There is a &quot;Waiting for cache&quot; message in the 'status bar' and nothing is   being loaded  until you decide what to do with the other interstitial is   answered.    This was reported as <a title="&quot;Waiting for cache&quot; message" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4769"> bug 4769 </a>  but that one got hijacked by a bug on the   http cache.    This issue is that the second request is waiting for the first one to   relinquish exclusive use of the cache entry  and the first one is paused   waiting for the user. We can give the user a better message in this case. </pre>
