<title>Issue 15312 -   chromium -    If there are more icons in favicon.ico container  Chrome always loads the one with less colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33       <a href="http://www.imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com</a>      <a href="http://games.tiscali.cz">http://games.tiscali.cz</a>       Firefox 3.x: OK            IE 7: OK            IE 8: OK      1. Try to go to these two sites  2. Look on favicon icon in panel (or in bookmark if you made one)      I expect to see full color icon.        I see icon with less colors than in other browsers.    If I download imdb favicon and open it in Image viewer  I see  that it   consists of two images. Full color one and low color one. Firefox always   choose the nicer one  and Chrome the other one. There is sparkest contrast   in games.tiscali icon.    Screenshot with comparison of Firefox and Chrome for both sites is   attached. </pre>
