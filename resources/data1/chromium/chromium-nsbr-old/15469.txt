<title>Issue 15469 -   chromium -    No sound in flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.1 (Officiell version 19007)  URLs (if applicable) : Any flash video/whatever        Firefox 3.5: OK      1. Start a video  2. Listen for sound.  3. Fail.      Sound going into default output device.      Sound disappears to /dev/null or some other place    I have Windows 7 and can &quot;see&quot; the sound on chrome but nothing happening on   the same bar for my output device. Same video on Firefox makes the   firefoxbar AND output bar device jump up and down. See pictures.   </pre>
