<title>Issue 12476 -   chromium -    Tests spew SQL warnings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> All kinds of tests (e.g. interactive UI tests) spit out this warning on every   test case:    [2876:2180:0521/201235:205056703:ERROR:sqlite_utils.cc(204)]   SQLStatement.prepare_v2 failed: no such table: meta    This is caused by the history preload code trying to prime the cache and   failing.  I don't know whether we should just make this case not warn  or do   something to add a meta table to whatever it is the tests are trying to open    or what  but the warning spew seriously decreases test output readability. </pre>
