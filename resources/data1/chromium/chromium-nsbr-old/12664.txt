<title>Issue 12664 -   chromium -    Google SSL sites will not open. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>           Safari 3: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Trying to open any SSL Google page (i.e. https:///mail.google.com   <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount?hl=en">https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount?hl=en</a>  etc...) results   in &quot;Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): Unknown error.&quot;  It was working fine before I upgraded to version 2 (I was using 1.0.154.65   previously).    Other non-Google https sites seem to work fine  and everything works fine   in Firefox and IE.  I had the same problem several months ago when I first   tried upgrading to version 2 when it was still in beta.  I have tried   uninstalling Chrome and completely removing the C:Documents and   SettingsusernameLocal SettingsApplication DataGoogleChrome folder    but that didn't help.    I assume there is some issue with this particular computer  because I have   installed version 2 on another computer and it works fine.  But what could   cause only Google sites to not work?  And what happened between version 1   and 2 to cause it? </pre>
