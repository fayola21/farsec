<title>Issue 297 -   chromium -    Can't login to WRT54G management I/F - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : 192.168.1.1 (WRT54G management interface (I/F))        IE 6: OK       Firefox 3: OK      1. Attempt HTTP or HTTPS login to WRT54G management I/F with &quot;blank&quot; user   name and correct password.      Enter Management I/F      unable to login after 3 attempts (401 Unauthorized)    NOTES:  The Linksys WRT54G wireless router (a very popular model i believe)   requires a blank username and a non-black password.  Could this be   confusing Chrome?  I have no problems with IE6 and Firefox 3.        </pre>
