<title>Issue 13322 -   chromium -    Remove dependency on gconf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : run gclient 4 june 2009                    1.just run gclient update   2.watch        just the updatecscript to finish        error:  ________ running '/usr/bin/python src/tools/gyp/gyp_dogfood  src/build/all.gyp' in '/mnt/sd/sda/5/chromium'  Package gconf-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.    This is again a errroreport. I've never managed to build it.  Is there anybody who has build it on a Linux system? If after this has been  fixed  I'll try it one more time  then I'll forget about Chrome. I've been  building a lot of software but never found anyone so buggy.    Here the gconf tool is required. This should not happen  it's a GNOME tool   not a general requirement!     Stef Bon      LinuxFromScratch 6.2   </pre>
