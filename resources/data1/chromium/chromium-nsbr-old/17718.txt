<title>Issue 17718 -   chromium -    Feature request - Auto-resize page when no visible change will happen in doing so - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : N/A  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.iiit.net/admissions/undergraduate">http://www.iiit.net/admissions/undergraduate</a>  Other URLs may also apply             Safari 4: Not Tested    Firefox 3.5: PASS           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: Partial Pass (horizontal scroll bar still there)        When the whole page fits into the screen there is no need for the   horizontal scroll bar      The horizontal scroll bar is there and it scrolls to show absolutely   nothing new        I do hope this is a feature and not a bug :D </pre>
