<title>Issue 9388 -   chromium -    app-starting cursor doesn't show when mouse is over the in-page bookmarks bar of the NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: app-starting cursor doesn't show when mouse is over the in-page   bookmarks bar of the NTP    2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12555)    Steps:  1- open the new tab page  2- click a link that is slow to load (or type in a slow URL)  3- move the mouse over the bookmarks UI at the top of the NTP    Observation:  The mouse cursor doesn't render as an app-starting cursor like it should.    This may be another regression caused by recent DOMUIHost changes. </pre>
