<title>Issue 9455 -   chromium -     Store map movements and implement (back) and (next) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi  as Google Maps is a product from Google  I think will be great  have an option to store map movements and implement on Google Chrome  (back) and (next) for map movements. This shoudn't work only with Google  Maps  but with all maps like: Openlayers  Flash Maps  Yahoo and Microsoft...  Don't know if this needs to be implemented by extension or in the  core  or I'm completly wrong and this shouldn't be a Browser function but a  Google Maps feature. (please tell me).    Wait answers  Thanks. </pre>
