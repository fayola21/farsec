<title>Issue 14710 -   chromium -    Developer Tools: caret moves past prompt in javascript console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open javascript console  2. Start typing &quot;document&quot; until auto-complete shows up  but don't finish   the word  3. Hold backspace      The caret should stop at the prompt character &quot;&gt;&quot;    I'm seeing the caret jump past the prompt character.    If you start typing it goes back to normal  but it's a little strange!    Tested on build rev 18807 on Windows.  Does not happen in Safari 4. </pre>
