<title>Issue 15996 -   chromium -    Regression: Animated GIFs no longer animate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.190.2  OS + version : 2.6.24-gg24-generic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64 GNU/Linux  window manager : xfwm4    Animated GIFs only show one frame  no animation. Fairly sure this was   working in the previous release.    Go to <a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/">http://www.ajaxload.info/</a> and create a spinner. It doesn't spin. See   attached file  for example. </pre>
