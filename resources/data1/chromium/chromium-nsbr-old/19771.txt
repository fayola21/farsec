<title>Issue 19771 -   chromium -    Conflict resolution for delete+rename conflicts is not ideal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1953663    Chromium        3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19432)    Repro Steps:    1) Client A and B are in sync and connected with same account  2) Client A adds bookmark folder 'Foo' and some children underneath that   folder. Ensure these changes get synced.  3) Now client A deletes bookmark folder - 'Foo'. At the same time Client B   tries to rename 'Foo' to 'Foo-New'. Remember these changes are happening   pretty much at the same time    Actual:  Clients ends with Empty Folder 'Foo New'.    Expected:  Either of the client change should overwrite the other one. Instead these   changes got mixed and ended up with Empty Folder with name 'Foo-New'. IMO    either folder should be delete on both clients or Folder should be kept   intact and just renamed to 'Foo-New' on both clients.    [/copy]    I'm not sure it's that bad of a behavior frankly; especially since it's   difficult to determine just what &quot;at the same time&quot; expands to. </pre>
