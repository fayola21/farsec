<title>Issue 12808 -   chromium -    GMail - RTE Link dialog broken  web address field disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.2           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a> (and login)  2. Create a new mail  3. Put the cursor to the body field of the email. In the rich text editor   (RTE) to compose a mail  click the Link icon / button (the one to mark text   as a web URL).  4. Try to enter a web URL into the &quot;web address&quot; field of the edit link   dialog    Expected result:  I can enter a URL / some text into the &quot;web address&quot; field.    Actual result:  No text can be entered in the &quot;web address&quot; field. If you try to put the   cursor into the field  nothing happens.    Notes:  - This is a regression. It worked fine with previous Chrome versions.  - If you switch to the email address option  the field works. But switching   back to &quot;web address&quot; doesn't help either.  - Tested with public and google.com corporate gmail. Same results. </pre>
