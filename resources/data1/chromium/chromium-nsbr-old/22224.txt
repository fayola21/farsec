<title>Issue 22224 -   chromium -    Exit Button doesnt kill Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21            Firefox 3.x:PASS           IE 7:PASS      Well it doesnt happen every time  but it does happen. While i am watching   some video on a tab and reading some stuff over the other  and I accidently    close the chrome.    The chrome closes down  then when i restart the chrome i could see two   processes in the Task Manager  It sometimes creates a zombie process which   i need to kill   else the newly opened chrome wont funtion properly.    I tried to reproduce the error today  after few attempts i could  I also   did that on a friends machine ..    It happens when you have 4-5 tabs open and each having some data.. and   while accidently closing 'all' I beleive it doesnt acutally kill every tab   properly.   </pre>
