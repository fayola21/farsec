<title>Issue 19982 -   chromium -    WAI-ARIA roles needs to be exposed through MSAA - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   WAI-ARIA describes how to add semantics and other metadata to HTML content  in order to make user interface controls and dynamic content more  accessible. For example  with WAI-ARIA it is possible to identify a list of  links as a navigation menu and to state whether it is expanded or collapsed.      See <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/aria-tests/ARIA-SafariaOperaIEFF.html">http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/aria-tests/ARIA-SafariaOperaIEFF.html</a>  for a comparison on how the browsers stack up. Ideally  Chrome would expose  the right role in every case.   </pre>
