<title>Issue 21119 -   chromium -    regression: UI language menu lists languages Chrome is not localized to. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a regression due to my ICU data update to fix <a title="rebuild ICU data file to include a minimum set of locale data for locales chrome is not localized to " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2078"> bug 2078 </a> (and related   bugs). In the change  I added minimally populated locale data for 30+   locales to which Chrome is NOT localized.     In the Chrome's UI language switch menu  those languages (Hawaian    Belarusian  etc) are listed because GetAvailableLocale() does not   distinguish  the fully populated locale data from partially populated   locale data.     I made up a hack to do that distinction. There's a more elegant way  but it   requires modifying the ICU data and rebuilding it. I've already done that    but decided to go this simpler path at least for the branch partly because   the elegant way might pull in more ICU code (related to resource bundle   handling) increasing Chrome binary size.             </pre>
