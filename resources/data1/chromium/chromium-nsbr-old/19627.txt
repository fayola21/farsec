<title>Issue 19627 -   chromium -    Decide whether or not to have a drop down list in the import dialog on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open Import Bookmarks and Settings in Linux and Windows    What is the expected output?     Dialogs should match cross platform.    What do you see instead?  1.  Linux buttons have icons  2.  Button ordering is different  3.  Linux has the platform dropdown as the default control  4.  Windows as import as the default control (probably correct)  5.  Linux has a dropdown with the only option being Firefox.    Mac has not yet implemented this feature.   </pre>
