<title>Issue 3516 -   chromium -    Regression: Mouse hover over tab strip context menu blinks all other tabs too quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought  we have a bug for this  But could not able to trace it.    -To better notice the issue  open 4 or 5 tabs navigate to google.com page   in all of them.  -Right click on 1st tab strip and mouse hover over the context menu.  -If you repeat step2 for few seconds  you will notice all other tabs   blinks slightly.    I can reproduce this consistently. </pre>
