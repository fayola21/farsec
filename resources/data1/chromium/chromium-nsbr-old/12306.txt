<title>Issue 12306 -   chromium -    Extensions: various issues around NPAPI loading and unloading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> a) Extension startup races with renderer startup and plugins inside   extensions may not be available when the renderer starts.    b) Renderers cache a list of known plugins  so if an extension is installed   while a renderer is running  the renderer doesn't know about it.    c) We're not handling unload of extensions at all wrt plugins. We need to   update all the existing renderers list of known plugins and also unload the   plugin itself. </pre>
