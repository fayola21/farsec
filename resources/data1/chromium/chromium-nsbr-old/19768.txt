<title>Issue 19768 -   chromium -    syncing with 5K bookmarks is slow (&gt;20 min) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1958888    Repro Steps:    1) Client A is clean and came online  2) Server has 2 folders and 1 bookmark existing  3) Client B came online and has more than 5K bookmarks  4) Wait for few mins    Expected:  Both client and server should be in sync    Actual:  Client A gets into OFFLINE_UNSYNCED State and still behind the scene I can   see that bookmark model is still getting updates.  It takes really long time (more than 20 mins) for client A to get these   changes. Client B is still syncing (as per about:sync). It should not take   this much long for 5K bookmarks. Remember even after 20 min  Client A has   not finished getting updates and Client B has not finished sending updates   (at least looks like from Client B's SYNCING State)    [/copy]    I wonder how fast adding 5K bookmarks to the bookmark model on it's own   really is... </pre>
