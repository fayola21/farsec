<title>Issue 9591 -   chromium -    &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; should be a button and not a link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12861)        1. Open History page.  2. Right-click on &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; &gt; &quot;Open link in new window&quot;      What is the expected output?    Either delete the day's history or disable the command.  I'm not sure the  command makes total sense in this context  so I would lean towards  disabling it.    What do you see instead?    Another History tab opens in a new window  but the given day's history is  not deleted.      This issue also applies to &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; and &quot;Open link in  incognito window&quot;.   </pre>
