<title>Issue 10624 -   chromium -    Black bar is shown at the bottom of the window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on Bata:2.0.172.6  DEV: 2.0.174.0 and Trunk(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13847">r13847</a>) and NO repro   steps on Stable:1.0.154.53.    This is tricky to reproduce and had tough time to get consistent repro   steps :).    -Have two tabs opened and make sure bookmarks bar is turned ON (enabled).  -Ctrl+B and immediately drag and hold a tab below the tabstrip.  (the two above two events [ctrl-B  drag and hold] should occur almost at   the same time )  -[while holding the tab] Ctrl+B again to disable to bookmarks bar.  -Drop the holding tab back to its original window/position.    Notice the black tab is visible at the bottom of the window. Screenshot   attached. </pre>
