<title>Issue 20813 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar offTheSideButton_ does not respond to -setMouseInside:animate: - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Mouse over the chevron button at the RHS of the bookmark bar.        I don't know what should be expected  but I get:  2009-09-01 11:13:19.525 Chromium[65388:813] *** -[NSButtonCell setMouseInside:animate:]:   unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x170330    msgs.  I added an NSButtonCell category with that method so I could set a breakpoint to verify that   it's that button.  That button is coming from IB  so I'm guessing making it a GradientButtonCell or   BookmarkButtonCell would fix the problem?   </pre>
