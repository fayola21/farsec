<title>Issue 550 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Google Chrome 0.2.149.27    I want to install but 'ChromeSetup.exe' started downloading install files  and it takes a lot of time to download.It is not good idea because during  download process internet connection may get disconnected several times and  installer every time starts from zero.I can download myself the setup  program with download managers faster and also after reconnection it is not  starting from zero.        </pre>
