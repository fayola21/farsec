<title>Issue 21318 -   chromium -    Query FFmpeg libraries for codec support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of hard coding the values for canPlayType()  it would be great if we   could dynamically query FFmpeg for container/codec support.    This would also fix compatibility issues on systems where regular Chromium   builds are distributed with non-free builds of FFmpeg. </pre>
