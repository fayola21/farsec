<title>Issue 7872 -   chromium -    collect JS and HTML errors from Chrome-bot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As we start to look more and more at site compatibility  we should start to   look at more automated ways to detect compatibility errors.  While many   compatibility errors require a human to detect  often the presence of JS   and HTML errors are enough to indicate that there's a problem that should   be looked at.    We should collect JS and HTML errors from Chrome-bot runs and track the   presence on pages as a compatibility metric that we're trying to drive down   similar to the stability metric we get out of Chrome-bot.  These errors in   Chrome-bot are particularly useful because we can associate specific URLs   with specific error messages.   </pre>
