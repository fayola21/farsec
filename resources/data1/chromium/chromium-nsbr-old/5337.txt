<title>Issue 5337 -   chromium -    Chrome Stuck on &quot;Report Bug&quot; Dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At times  when I open the browser  I get this error screen and at this   point trying to close the &quot;Report Bug or Broken Web site&quot; just leads to   more such windows being opened. I then have to use the Task Manager to   shut down chrome but then when I restart I see the issue again.     Even restarting the m/c doesn't help. Then when I keep closing and opening   the browser  on the nth iteration  the problem goes away.    My chrome version is the latest but I don't remember the version.    -Madhavan </pre>
