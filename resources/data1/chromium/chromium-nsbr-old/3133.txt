<title>Issue 3133 -   chromium -    Malware page flashes briefly over the malware interstitial page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. I navigated to a page that apparently is hosting malware (URL is below).   Malware interstitial page appears.  2. I immediately notice that the malware page flashes briefly but   repeatedly over the malware interstitial page  as if they are fighting   which one gets displayed.  3. After a few seconds this settles down and only the interstitial page is   visible.  4. I thought  maybe I can repro this if I refresh. I press F5.  5. Malware page loads and no interstitial (!).  6. I close the tab and paste the URL into the address bar  and now the   interstitial page doesn't even show... I go straight to the malware page.    Malware URL: http://alltolls_blogspot_com/2008/10/google-chrome-021531-  chromium-031540.html (I have replaced the three dots in the URL with   underscores).     </pre>
