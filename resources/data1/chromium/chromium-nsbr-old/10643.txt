<title>Issue 10643 -   chromium -    &quot;Reopen closed tab&quot; item is always enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Start Chrome with a fresh profile.  2.Right click on the title bar.        The &quot;reopen closed tab&quot; item is enabled. It should be disabled if there   aren't any items to reopen. The first time I clicked it  it opened a new   window  though since then it's just opened new tabs.    P1 since this shouldn't have gone in this way.  If this change isn't on the 2.0 branch  it's not a Mstone-2.0 but please fix   quickly. </pre>
