<title>Issue 16246 -   chromium -    Quick back/forward navigations close the tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just noticed this on ToT  but it also exists in 3.0.191.3.    If you do very fast back forward navigations  the current tab will close.   Since this is a timing issue  it is easier to reproduce on slow pages or on   slow builds (i.e. Debug). To reproduce  click the back/forward buttons on   the mouse very quickly (or even at the same time). The current tab will   close. I tracked the page closing down to this:    void ResourceDispatcherHost::OnClosePageACK(int new_render_process_host_id                                              int new_request_id) {    GlobalRequestID global_id(new_render_process_host_id  new_request_id);    PendingRequestList::iterator i = pending_requests_.find(global_id);    if (i == pending_requests_.end()) {      // If there are no matching pending requests  then this is not a      // cross-site navigation and we are just closing the tab/browser.      ui_loop_-&gt;PostTask(FROM_HERE  NewRunnableFunction(          &amp;RenderViewHost::ClosePageIgnoringUnloadEvents           new_render_process_host_id           new_request_id));      return;    }      ExtraRequestInfo* info = ExtraInfoForRequest(i-&gt;second);    if (info-&gt;cross_site_handler) {      info-&gt;cross_site_handler-&gt;ResumeResponse();    }  }    (I couldn't repro the tab-closing in windows  but I did get the browser to   become unresponsive. I used the backspace key and the forward button on the   toolbar there  where apparently we don't support mouse button navigation.) </pre>
