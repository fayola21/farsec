<title>Issue 3715 -   chromium -    Underline is  too close to CJK characters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   CJK fonts and fonts for Latin/Greek/Cyrilic have different baseline   conventions. (Indic scripts have yet another convention).  When positioning   underlines  we have to take that into account. It's a tricky business.      I'm not sure what Firefox3 does  but in case of Firefox2 and earlier  some   tweaking was done to position underlines for CJK fonts.        </pre>
