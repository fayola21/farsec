<title>Issue 7786 -   chromium -    Enable expire_history_backend_unittest on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> src/chrome/browser/history/expire_history_backend_unittest.cc compiles but  fails unit test DeleteURLAndFavicon at line 418      EXPECT_FALSE(IsStringInFile(fts_filename  &quot;goats&quot;));    I can't tell from the surrounding output if this is due to our stubs in  other areas (localized bundles  bookmarks  etc) or if it's really a failure  that only happens on Mac. We need to figure this out and turn this file  back on. </pre>
