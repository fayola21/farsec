<title>Issue 19957 -   chromium -    Can't resolve .local hosts (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On <a title="Chromium for Mac can't open .local hosts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11747"> issue 11747 </a> people report they can't load .local hostnames.    I wonder if it's just because we don't know .local is a domain suffix?  If   you type in a .local  what happens?    CC'ing DNS masters. </pre>
