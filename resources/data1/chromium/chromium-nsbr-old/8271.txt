<title>Issue 8271 -   chromium -    Downloads/History pages should grab keyboard focus as soon as they opened. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10704)    -Make sure keyboard focus is not set to Omnibox in current tab.  -Hit [Ctrl+j/Ctrl+h] to [Downloads/History] tabs.    Expected:  #########  Keyboard focus should be set to respective search input boxes.    Result:  #######  Focus is nightmare.     As a result  no keyboard shortcuts work on those page  until and unless you  click on them.   </pre>
