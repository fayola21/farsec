<title>Issue 20322 -   chromium -    64-bit flash plugin situation is screwed in presence of nspluginwrapper - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some users who currently have a 64-bit Firefox installed have the 32-bit   Flash via nspluginwrapper.  That is  in the plugin directory there's a 64-  bit wrapper and it refers to a 32-bit Flash in some other directory.    32-bit Chrome: doesn't find the 32-bit plugin  as it's not in a standard   location  64-bit Chrome: (aside from being not yet released) nspluginwrapper seems to   not work right for us anyway; it's redundant to have two layers of   processes for plugins    To make 32-bit work  we need people to install the 32-bit flash.  To make 64-bit work  we need people to install the 64-bit flash.    This bug is for thinking about how we can communicate this info to users   who reasonably say &quot;it works in Firefox  why not in chrome?&quot;. </pre>
