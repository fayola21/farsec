<title>Issue 18272 -   chromium -    Waste space in NNTP  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2 (Official Build 22142)    I suggest that the space created by Google chrome logo and the page layout   buttons be reduced or those buttons be brought on line with the logo. Its now   a waste of space.  Also i use 1024 X 768 resolution and there is scroll bar. So if you reduce   the space up there  the scroll bar will also be removed. BTW the scroll bar doesn't look good on NNTP. </pre>
