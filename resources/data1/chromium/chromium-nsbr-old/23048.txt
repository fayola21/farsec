Go to any page with a select drop down (ironically  this bug entry page   exhibits same behaviour)  2. Click on the drop down to select a different item (ie at the bottom)  3. The first result is still visible  there was no visible selection change  4. Try clicking on the drop-down again - you get no drop-down  it does   not open up again.  5. Reloading the page shows your selected option  and &quot;enables&quot; the drop-  down to be clicked again      drop downs should open up  show new selection.       Initial selection is visible  and drop-down is no longer &quot;openable&quot; again </pre>
