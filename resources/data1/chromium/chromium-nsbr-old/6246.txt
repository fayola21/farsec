<title>Issue 6246 -   chromium -    Dragging tab into window  tab may not be under mouse cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-</a>  5455474671695494187&amp;hl=en      1. Open a lot of tabs in a window  2. Tear one of the tabs off into a new window  3. Drag the new window back into the other window (with many tabs)  4. Pay attention to where the tab is in relation to the mouse cursor  5. Back to step 2. Now try initiating the drag by clicking a different   point (closer to the 'x' of the tab) of the tab 'titlebar'.      The tab should be under the cursor when dragging  regardless of where you   click on the tab to begin dragging it.      The tab could be far from the cursor when dragging.    It's a little hard to describe  please view the video  it should make the   problem clear.  Sorry for the poor summary. </pre>
