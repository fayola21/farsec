<title>Issue 1100 -   chromium -    Unicode normalization in 'Find in a Page' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. load a page with canonically decomposable characters like <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org">http://fr.wikipedia.org</a> with ��_��_ U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE   2. search for ��_��_ U+00E9  matches are found  3. search for its decomposed form  i.e. ��_��_ U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E  U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT  no match is found      ��_��_ U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE and ��_��_ U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E    U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT are defined as canonically equivalent in   Unicode and should be treated as such in searches. Both forms are   representing the same thing (e acute) and should be treated as the same   string.    Looking for one for should match the other. Text should be normalized to   either NFC or NFD before it is compared in searches.        One form is only found when that specific form is searched  i.e. looking   for ��_��_ won't match ��_��_.    Please provide
