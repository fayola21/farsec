<title>Issue 11001 -   chromium -    history.back() seems to be not working correctly in test_shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebKit change <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42785">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42785</a>  added a test which submits a form and then uses history.back()  to go back. in test_shell history.back() does not go back  so the test   timeouts.      LayoutTests/http/tests/history/back-to-post.php = TIMEOUT     </pre>
