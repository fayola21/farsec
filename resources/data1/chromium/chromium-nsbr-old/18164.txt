<title>Issue 18164 -   chromium -    Consider not stripping x01-x08 from URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Erik wrote me and said:  &quot;&quot;&quot;  There is one area where I think I can make a recommendation: In the  path part  it is probably better not to delete x01-x08 and  x0B-x0C  sending their %-escapes instead (like MSIE).    MSIE appears to delete x00 from the entire HTML file (not just the URL).  &quot;&quot;&quot;    I think this is probably a good idea. </pre>
