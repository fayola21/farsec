<title>Issue 4285 -   chromium -    Error &quot;alias ISO-8859-8-I maps to ISO-8859-8-I already...&quot; in TextEncodingRegistry.cpp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When ERROR_DISABLED in   WebKitWebCoreplatformtextTextEncodingRegistry.cpp is undefined   (generally speaking  in a Debug build)  the first layout test to run (as   well as the first one to run after the test_shell crashes or hangs and is   restarted) produces the error    &quot;alias ISO-8859-8-I maps to ISO-8859-8-I already  but someone is trying to   make it map to ISO-8859-8&quot;    It's not clear whether this is a WebKit problem or a problem in how we're   calling the methods.    The nondeterministic error interferes with consistent results in the layout   tests now that we're including stderr output after stdout. In order to   continue running the tests  we've excluded that one message from the stderr   output in test_shell_thread.py for now. </pre>
