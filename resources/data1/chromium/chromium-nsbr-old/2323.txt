<title>Issue 2323 -   chromium -    A server of our company is dangerous? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When users access '<a href="http://cafe.daum.net/ensol'">http://cafe.daum.net/ensol'</a> with chrome   They meet security alert messages like that below  'What is the current listing status for cafecj.hanmail.net/cafeon/?  Site is listed as suspicious - visiting this web site may harm your   computer~~~~.'    But  the server(cafecj.hanmail.net) is managed by Daum Communications   directly. Daum is the biggest internet service provider in South Korea   and I'm a employee of the company.   Can we fix this problem? How could we except our normal server from   suspicious list?      </pre>
