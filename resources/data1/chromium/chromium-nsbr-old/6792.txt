<title>Issue 6792 -   chromium -    Give better feedback when AddSearchProvider fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> window.external.AddSearchProvider can fail for various reasons.  Most   common are a bad configuration (missing or wrong OSDD) or that provider   already being installed.  We should give some sort of feedback to users so   they know what's going on when they click on a button and nothing happens. </pre>
