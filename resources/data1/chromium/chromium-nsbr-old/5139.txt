<title>Issue 5139 -   chromium -    some plane-1 characters are not displayed correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The WebCore::FillNonBMPGlyphs() function (in   &quot;src/webkit/port/platform/graphics/GlyphPageTreeNodeWin.cpp&quot;) creates a   mapping from non-bmp characters to its glyphs and it tries to retrieve the   glyph of its i-th character with the   WebCore::UniscribeHelper::FirstGlyphForCharacter() calls. Unfortunately    because of a mistake in its first argument  the function returns invalid   glyphs for non-BMP characters.       1. Retrieve a copy of the code2001 font from <a href="http://www.code2000.net/">http://www.code2000.net/</a> and   install it;  2. Display the attached HTML file with Chrome.     What is the expected output?  No duplicate entries in the table.    What do you see instead?  Chrome uses the same glyph for both '&amp;#x10000;' and '&amp;#x10001;'  for both    '&amp;#x10002;' and '&amp;#x10003;'  etc.         </pre>
