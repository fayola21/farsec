<title>Issue 169 -   chromium -    feature request: del.icio.us bookmarks or support for del.ici.ous add-ons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Try to bookmark pages in a way that stays in one repository with my   existing treasure-trove of del.icio.us bookmarks  rather than forking a new   repository.      There is a way to do this.      There is no easy way to have the bookmarks I create in Chrome integrate   with my del.icio.us tags.    If this one feature were added  I would immediately start using Chrome as   my default browser.  Without it  I am loath to give up Firefox.  I'm sure heavy users of Digg  etc. probably would say the same thing about   their favorite services.      Please provide
