<title>Issue 21427 -   chromium -    Chrome gets in really bad state when cmd-tabbing to another app while file chooser is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    OS version               : 10.5.8      1. In gmail  write a mail and click &quot;Attach a file&quot;  2. Dialog pops up  3. cmd-tab to another app  cmd-tab back to chrome        Dialog should be visible        Dialog is not visible and doesn't become active by hiting cmd-` either.   Clicking &quot;Attach a file&quot; another time does nothing. Saving the file as a draft    opening another mail and then going back to the original mail and clicking   &quot;Attach a file&quot; pops up _two_ file open dialogs  neither of them reacting to   inputs. At this point  quitting chrome is the only option. </pre>
