<title>Issue 3385 -   chromium -    Password manager autofill does not kick in when replacing existing autofilled name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit a site you're not currently logged in to  which has multiple saved   logins.  For me  any Google Account-based site (e.g. Google Reader) works.    On visiting  one of your accounts should be autofilled.    Select the whole username and type the first character of a different saved   account.  Note that the password manager does not autofill the rest of the   username.  Type yet another character and it will.    This does not occur if  instead of typing a character to replace the   existing username  you delete the existing username  then type.    I suspect this is due to an insufficient heuristic in the browser-side   autocomplete code to detect whether the user has just deleted a character    based on whether the new text is shorter than the old text.  Instead we   should be using code like that in autocomplete_edit.cc  which looks at   things like &quot;was all the old text selected&quot;. </pre>
