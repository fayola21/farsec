<title>Issue 785 -   chromium -    New window (Ctrl+N) opens &quot;speed dial&quot; even though I disabled it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Reproduced using latest version at time of posting bug here -- can you  make the version number copy-able in the About dialog?)      1. In the options  set the homepage to &quot;about:blank&quot;.  2. Set the &quot;On startup&quot; page to &quot;about:blank&quot; as well  3. Now  hit Ctrl+N in one browser window to open a new one         The new window should show &quot;about:blank&quot;  i.e. be empty.         The new window shows the 9-thumbnails &quot;speed dial&quot; homepage instead.  (Also  it would be truly nice if it could open as full-screen window if the  old window was that size too.)   </pre>
