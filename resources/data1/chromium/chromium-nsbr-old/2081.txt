<title>Issue 2081 -   chromium -    navigator.vendor returns &quot;Google Inc.&quot; instead of &quot;Apple Computer  Inc.&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : www.bladam.com  Other browsers tested: FF3  IE7        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    TO REPRODUCE:  1. Load any page on www.bladam.com    EXPECTED RESULT:  Should show a horizontal javascript-based menu with options cascading /   dropping down upon mouse-over.    ACTUAL RESULT (what happens instead)  The horizontal javascript-based menu is seemingly unexecuted and --   contrary to other browsers -- the menus options are rendered in a flat list   that obscures the main body text.    NOTES:  - Prior versions of Chrome handled these pages appropriately.  - This is DISSIMILAR to other javascript-menu reported bugs I've seen   filed  which deal with either menus that do not expand on mouseover or   menus in which focus is lost. </pre>
