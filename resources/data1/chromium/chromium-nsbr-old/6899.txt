<title>Issue 6899 -   chromium -    DLL/EXE download directory  Show in folder not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2      1. Click any (plain) EXE/DLL download link  2. Click Save (if needed)  3. Click 'Show in folder' on the download      The folder should be opened  and the file selected in the folder.      Nothing. The folder is not opened  the file is not selected.    This only happens for executables it seems (EXEs/DLLs is what I tested).  First  I don't think these should be downloaded to:  Local SettingsApplication DataGoogleChromeApplication2.0.157.2    That is a very annoying directory to navigate to if you actually need to   FIND the downloaded file (and not just run it).  Why should executable files be downloaded to a directory other than the   standard download directory?  What's the difference between a zipped EXE and a plain EXE?    I don't mind it for installers and the like.  For installers  I usually just want to click the download in the download   bar and install the software.  But I don't want to RUN the DLL  I want to DO something with it  move it    etc.  I downloaded a DLL twice before I realized it just wasn't where I expected   it to be. (Remember  Show in folder wasn't working) </pre>
