<title>Issue 1801 -   chromium -    change log? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have been all over looking for where i can see a change log  and see what   bugs / changes have been made with each version. there seems to be a new   version of chrome every couple hours  but how can i find out exactly what   was changed in each of those versions?    link to build list:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/</a>    also yes  i know theres a change log file in each folder  but it appears   blank for me.  </pre>
