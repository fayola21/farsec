Go to <a href="http://newmedia.funnyjunk.com/pictures/murderturtle.gif">http://newmedia.funnyjunk.com/pictures/murderturtle.gif</a>        Violence.        Gif loops after about 2s  before the violence happens.    Works on linux  so I'm filing this as OS-Mac. Haven't checked on windows    though. </pre>
