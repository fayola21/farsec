<title>Issue 8700 -   chromium -    Online banking ActiveX compatibility - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0 Build 11517             IE 6/7: OK    Online banking in China all require an ActiveX text input control to   prevent keyloggers. I see Chromium support ActiveX and should be working   with these ActiveX plugins    Take CMB and ICBC as examples  which are the most popular online   banking/payment service in China.    I tried them by launching chromuim with --allow-all-activex option    Their login pages are:    <a href="https://mybank.icbc.com.cn/icbc/newperbank/bankbook/bankbook_index.jsp">https://mybank.icbc.com.cn/icbc/newperbank/bankbook/bankbook_index.jsp</a>    The form can not be submited    <a href="https://pbsz.ebank.cmbchina.com/CmbBank_GenShell/UI/GenShellPC/Login/Login">https://pbsz.ebank.cmbchina.com/CmbBank_GenShell/UI/GenShellPC/Login/Login</a>.  aspx?logintype=C    Chrome freeze when submit    see screenshot in attachments    Is it possible to fix these and make Chrome ActiveX compatible?    If Chrome support these ActiveX plugins well  then it means a lot for IE   users in China  one of the main reason that people still use Windows+IE is   for these online banking sites. </pre>
