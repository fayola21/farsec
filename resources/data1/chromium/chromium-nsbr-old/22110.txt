<title>Issue 22110 -   chromium -    All content scripts for a given extension should execute in the same isolated world - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It doesn't make sense to use a separate isolated world for each content   script.    And it would be nice to be able to do things like:    chrome.tabs.executeScript({&quot;code&quot;: &quot;var foo = 'foo';&quot;});  chrome.tabs.executeScript({&quot;file&quot;: &quot;file_that_uses_foo_variable.js&quot;});     </pre>
