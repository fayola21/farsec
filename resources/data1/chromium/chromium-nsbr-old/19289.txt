<title>Issue 19289 -   chromium -    Chrome's &quot;Save image as...&quot; is confused by site serving incorrect mime type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/comics">http://news.yahoo.com/comics</a>        1. right click the comic and save the image as  2. the image is formatted as a .gif file.  chrome wishes to save it with the   filename.gif but then under the file type  jpeg image is selected.    i believe this is a regression since i have saved .gifs in the past and do   not remember this problem.   </pre>
