<title>Issue 1602 -   chromium -    Look and feel of Chrome Browser - alignment of the tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start the chrome browser  2. Open as many tabs as you can  say 10 tabs  3. Load all the 10 tabs with different websites  4. Close two or three websites i.e. close two or theree tabs  5. Now you can very clearly see that at the right hand corner  near the add   new tab icon  there is a huge space left. i.e.       if you close two or three tabs it should automatically get aligned   properly.      The alignment is taking little longer. There should be a code which should   check for this alignment.    Please provide
