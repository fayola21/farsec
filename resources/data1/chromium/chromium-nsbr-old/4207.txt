<title>Issue 4207 -   chromium -    Clean up the mess that is our layout test results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's unnecessarily difficult to re-baseline layout test results or to tell   which results are coming from where.  We should do the following:    * Delete layout_test_results/kjs/.  No automated scripts are using it  so   it's not being kept up to date and is therefore not useful.  We will   continue to maintain the JSC build  just not its layout test results.    * Remove all KJS markings from tests_fixable and tests_ignored files.    * Combine v8/ and common/ results and move them into   LayoutTests/platform/chromium-win/.    * Stop looking in LayoutTests/platform/mac* for any results. Copy any we'd   been getting from there into the applicable platform/chromium-* directory.    * Fix the script to deal with all that.    We should also move the tests_fixable and tests_ignored files into the   platform/chromium-foo/ directories  but that's Stage N+1 and a topic for   another bug. </pre>
