<title>Issue 14954 -   chromium -    Keyboard focus is flaky on a tab  if it is refreshed from crashed process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18905">r18905</a>)  but works fine on Stable (172.33)    The keyboard focus on a webpage is totally in-consistent  if the page is   refreshed from killed/crashed process.    This can be reproduced in two different ways  but I believe  both refer to   the same.    use case1:  ##########  -Navigate to a webpage (eg: google home page) - Notice the keyboard focus   is in search box.  -Kill  the tab thr task manager.  -Refresh the tab (using F5 or ctrl+f5).    Issue: after step3  google search box is not regaining keyboard focus. Now   try to execute any keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F  Ctrl+t  Ctrl+D  you name it   you execute it)-nothing works out  you need to click on render area for ONE   time for each short cut  if you would like to execute.    Use case2  #########  -Reproduce the step3 by hitting return key on Omnibox.    Issue: Keyboard focus is not transfered to renderer process (in this case   google search box)  but it is still on Omnibox.    Bonus:  ######  In both of the above use cases:    Step4:  Ctrl+f to Find-in bar and Esc to dismiss the find-in bar.    Now the <a title="Esc flashes find-in bar continuously" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12729"> issue 12729 </a> is BACK  if you keep on hitting Esc key :) </pre>
