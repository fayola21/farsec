<title>Issue 19720 -   chromium -    Entering the wrong password on re-login causes the wizard to get stuck  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the login credentials expire (currently once a week  but that's going   to change to a year very soon)  we require the user to re-login. When the   user enters the wrong password  the wizard gets stuck in the   'Authenticating...' state (with the throbber spinning) and it never gets   out of it.    The easiest way to repro this without waiting a week is to build a Chrome   Sync Server locally and change line 61 in http://s/?  fileprint=//depot/google3/java/com/google/personalization/chrome/cosmosync/  server/auth/Authenticator.java to 'return 60;'. This will expire the cookie   after 60 seconds. Once you do that  perform the following:    1. Start Chrome and point it at your local server.  2. Enable sync.  3. Wait a few minutes.  4. Restart Chrome - go to the Options dialog and verify that it says &quot;Login   details are out of date. Login again&quot;.  5. Click the &quot;Login again&quot; link - this will bring up the wizard.  6. Enter the wrong password.    Expected:    Wizard should display the error: &quot;User name and password don't match&quot;    Actual:    Wizard gets stuck in the &quot;Authenticating...&quot; state </pre>
