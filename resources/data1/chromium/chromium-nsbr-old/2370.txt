<title>Issue 2370 -   chromium -    Assertion when using the alternate URL tracker twice in a row - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a one-word search to get the alternate URL tracker to check whether   that search is a valid domain name. On that page  then do another search of   the same type. There will be an assertion that there shouldn't already be a   tracker on the navigation controller when the second one comes in.   Apparently  the first one never gets cleared. </pre>
