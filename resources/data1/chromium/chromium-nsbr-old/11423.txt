<title>Issue 11423 -   chromium -    Move WebRequest::ExtraData to WebDataSource - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Move WebRequest::ExtraData to WebDataSource    Given that WebRequest is a transient object  I think it would be much better   to have ExtraData associated with WebDataSource instead.  This is mostly   compatible with how we use it and it is compatible with the idea that the   FrameLoaderClient is responsible for allocating the DocumentLoader (which   WebDataSource subclasses). </pre>
