<title>Issue 9671 -   chromium -    ExtensionErrorReporter needs to be a Singleton - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ExtensionErrorReporter hand-rolls singletonness. It should use Singleton   (base/singleton.h) since it caches a MessageLoop* and this is incompatible   with the restarting done by in process browser tests  which want to use   AtExitManager to destroy singletons between runs. </pre>
