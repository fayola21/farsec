<title>Issue 7417 -   chromium -    provide a way to set &quot;minimum font size&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently there seems to be no way of doing blanket minimum font size  setting in chrome (firefox has it). That is causes eye strain in certain  high resolution screens with certain websites.    Google Help forum on chrome also has users complaining about this:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=389f306a52817110&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=389f306a52817110&amp;hl=en</a>  (and other blogs have also mentioned this problem)    If there is a solution available  it would be nice of the help forum is  also updated. Thanks! </pre>
