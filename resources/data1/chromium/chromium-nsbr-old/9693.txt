<title>Issue 9693 -   chromium -    Chromium 2 opens new connection for each POST - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0             Safari 4: PASS    Firefox 3.0.8: PASS           IE 7: PASS           IE 8: PASS      1. Do an XHR POST or a form POST on any page.  2. On a webserver  observe a new connection being made for the POST        Chromium reuses an open connection.        Chromium makes a new connection.        Chromium 2 (not 1) makes a new connection for each POST  even when made  through the XHR object. This matches the behavior of Opera 9+  but no other  browser. This could significantly slow down any POSTing to HTTPS sites.    If this new-connection behavior increases reliability  web developers  should have some way to opt out  if their application can handle a  more-likely-to-fail POST.     </pre>
