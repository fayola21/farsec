<title>Issue 18296 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: QuickTime plugin fails to load to render .mpg URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: QuickTime plugin fails to load to render .mpg URLs    Observed in 3.0.195.0 (Developer Build 21086).  Works fine in 2.0.172.39.    I don't know if this is a side effect of changes to plugins code or if it is related to   our HTML5 video code supporting some forms of MPEG.    The Chrome task manager doesn't even show the QuickTime plugin being loaded  so I   suspect this may be related to mime handling.    Sample URL:  <a href="http://hubblesource.stsci.edu/sources/video/clips/details/images/centaur_1.mpg">http://hubblesource.stsci.edu/sources/video/clips/details/images/centaur_1.mpg</a>    That URL also loads properly in Safari 4 and Firefox 3.5. </pre>
