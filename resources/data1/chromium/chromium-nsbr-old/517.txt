<title>Issue 517 -   chromium -    news.sina.com.cn causes high CPU usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                  1. When I open the news.sina.com.cn  the CPU's usage was about 16~20%  and   when I open the same web with IE6  the usage just was 2%.     And i opened only one page  but the process management had two chromes.    My notebook has a Intel Core2 Duo T8300 @2.4GHz  and its memory is 3GB  so   I think it's terrible! My OS is WinXP SP2.   </pre>
