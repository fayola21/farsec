<title>Issue 14825 -   chromium -    Text field shortcuts don't behave natively on WinXP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.189.0 (Offizieller Build 18569)    Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Backspace don't stop at interpunctuation (e.g. putting   the cursor in front of the 3 in this post's first line and hitting Ctrl+Bksp   should only delete up to the color) and Ctrl+Left/Right don't stop at the   same places  leading to a different number of Left/Right keypresses to get   e.g. to the start of the line and back.    Also: Up/Down shouldn't move to the start/end of the line.    All of these might be upstream issues (Webkit following OS X guidelines here   and not adapting to the OS it's compiled for). </pre>
