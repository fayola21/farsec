<title>Issue 22369 -   chromium -    ICU assembly does not compile on ARM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ICU does not compile on arm      CC src/out/Release/obj/third_party/icu/linux/icudt42l_dat.o  third_party/icu/linux/icudt42l_dat.s: Assembler messages:  third_party/icu/linux/icudt42l_dat.s:5: Error: unrecognized symbol type &quot;&quot;  make: *** [src/out/Release/obj/third_party/icu/linux/icudt42l_dat.o] Error 1    The problem is the assembly syntax that is used is not portable to ARM    where the '@' symbol is a comment:    &gt; Note on targets where the @ character is the start of a comment  &gt; (eg ARM) then another character is used instead. For example the   &gt; ARM port uses the % character.    Using @ instead appears to work on both ARM and x64.  Will submit a patch. </pre>
