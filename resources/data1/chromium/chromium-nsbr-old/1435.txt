<title>Issue 1435 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes with FATAL: bitmap_platform_device.cc(298) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Not sure  but having a lot of tabs open  and running flash videos appears   to do the trick.      Browser crash. Sometimes it restarts and can reopen the tabs  sometimes   not.    The error message I see points to     bitmap_platform_device.cc(298)    I searched on the internet but was not able to find a mention of this  so I   thought I should report this.          Please provide
