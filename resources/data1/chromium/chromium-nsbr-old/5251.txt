<title>Issue 5251 -   chromium -    fr-CA and en-AU in Accept-Language do not match fr-FR and en-{GB US} when spell-checker context menu is generated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Add fr-CA to the Accept-Language list but NOT fr or fr-FR.   2. Go to any web page with a textarea.  3. See if 'fr-FR' is listed in the list of spell-check languages in the   context menu.     A patch is coming up.      </pre>
