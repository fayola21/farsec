<title>Issue 7605 -   chromium -    Chrome downloads of file from Local Machine to Local Machine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Mistakenly drag-n-drop a large file from My Computer onto a chrome   window  2. Watch it download the file...      To do nothing  or warn me!      I did not understand where the did chrome find a 1.4 Gb file to download   without me telling it. Then I realized I dropped the file on chrome insteam   on a explorer window.  Why would I want to download a large file  or any file  from   D:DownloadsMovies to D:DownloadsChrome ??    It is actually kind of funny...    Please provide
