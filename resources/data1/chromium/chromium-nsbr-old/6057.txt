<title>Issue 6057 -   chromium -    Copy / Paste are &quot;not&quot; functioning in Windows XP if Chromium is running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	2.0.156.0 (Developer Build 7603)         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Try to do many copy / paste routines inside chromium browser and outside   chromium browser in any application. You will notice this isn't working. Sometimes it will work (after numerous tries)  most of the times it just   wont.    If you copy a text  and paste it anywhere else and it doesn't get pasted    after you close Chromium  it will work fine.    If you close Chromium  and do many copy/paste it works fine. It only   happens when Chromium is running.   </pre>
