<title>Issue 10511 -   chromium -    Redirect Popups Into Tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a website which has a user-requested popup.  2. Click on the link which causes the popup to appear.        It would be great if we could (optionally) have the popup be redirected to a   new tab  instead of appearing as a stand-alone window.        Having the stand-alone window is hard to manage and causes a lot of clutter    particularly that the popup window cannot be dragged into a tab without first   using the context-menu to turn it into a tab.    Not having multiple windows is one of the great attractions of a tabbed-  browser  so this is essential for completeness. The main trick is keep things   sized properly because a popup which takes up an entire tab may not be   rendered correctly  so we should have a way to constrain the popup area   within the tab itself  with a way to resize the said area for completeness   because often popups do need to be resized.     </pre>
