<title>Issue 11298 -   chromium -    Feature request: allow copy+paste in kr0m error dialogs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When Chromium crashes  I am often presented with a &quot;kr0m&quot; dialog containing   information about the issue. I'd like to be able to copy+paste the text   into a new bug  rather than have to make a screen grab and attach that or   manually copy the text (which is more prone to errors). </pre>
