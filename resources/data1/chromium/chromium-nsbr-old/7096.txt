<title>Issue 7096 -   chromium -    Tab sizes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  URLs (if applicable) : Gmail  Hotmail           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      The problem seems to occur when clicking a link that pops open within the   window in a new tab.  The size of all the tabs on top shrink down and does   not recover until closing enough tabs and then maximizing/minimizing the   window.  I'm not sure how this has started.  But seems to occur regularly   from links.  Am I the only person with this problem? </pre>
