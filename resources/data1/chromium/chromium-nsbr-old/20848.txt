<title>Issue 20848 -   chromium -    Sync account email address shows up with lower case letter until Chrome is restarted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Chrome with --enable-sync  2. Log in with an email address which contains upper case and lower case   letters (e.g. JohnSmith@gmail.com).  3. Look at the email name in the New Tab Page or in the Options dialog.        The expected result is to see the string: &quot;Sync to JohnSmith@gmail.com&quot; but   instead the UI shows &quot;Synced to johnsmith@gmail.com&quot;.    Once Chrome is restarted  the name appears in the UI with the right casing. </pre>
