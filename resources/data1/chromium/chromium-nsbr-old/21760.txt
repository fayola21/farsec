<title>Issue 21760 -   chromium -    duplo.lego.com blocks Chrome/Safari from playing game - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  go to <a href="http://duplo.lego.com/en-us/Games/TrainDriver.aspx">http://duplo.lego.com/en-us/Games/TrainDriver.aspx</a>  2.  Page will load  Flash starts loading  3.  An alert that says &quot;ddd&quot; will appear.  Game never finishes loading.      No alert should show and the game should load.    Lego.com was contacted about the issue and asked to allow other browsers.    They say to just &quot;use IE&quot;.    Spoofing the user agent as IE does not help  so it's likely not a UA string   block.  We should try to convince them to allow other browsers. </pre>
