<title>Issue 4091 -   chromium -    Regression: Crash with App print command - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4614)      1. Navigate to any webpage (eg: cnn.com) and create a shortcut for this page.  2. Click App's drop down list (by clicking on App's favicon) and select the  Print from the list.  3. The Application shortcut crashes with sad face.    To avoid the leaking of confidential internal paths  I'm not pasting the  call stack over here.  The dump can be found @ http://go/dumps/AppPrint_Crash.dmp  What is the expected output?   Should print the contents.    What do you see instead?  Should not crash.      Does not reproduce on Live build.   </pre>
