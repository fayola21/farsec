<title>Issue 19480 -   chromium -    Div align=&quot;center&quot; last line of text shifted to the right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553) and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23540">r23540</a>         Safari 4: FAIL       Opera 10: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. The attached HTML file displays many lines of text all inside a       &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;      All the text should line up the same vertically.      The last line of text is shifted a little to the right (see attached screenshot).    Problem only for Safari and Chrome.  WebKit bug?   </pre>
