<title>Issue 5073 -   chromium -    Duplicate desktop icon is created using First Run UI even if it's present  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install system level chrome with param create-all-shortcuts(creates all   the shortcuts even before First Run dialog is seen)  2. Once the installation completes  try to launch Chrome and you should see   First Run dialog  3. Click on Start Google Chrome      We expect not to see duplicate icons. A duplicate desktop icon gets   created. Quick launch has only one which is fine. Also  on uninstall one of   the desktop icons remain.    Google Chrome	0.4.154.31 (Official Build 6264)   </pre>
