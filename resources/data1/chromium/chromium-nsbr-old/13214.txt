<title>Issue 13214 -   chromium -    Occasional display corruption on google.com after using browser Back button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3 (Official Build 17055)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/search?">http://www.google.com/search?</a>  q=chromium+issue+tracker  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Paste the URL into the address bar and use Alt-Enter to open URL in a   new tab. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chromium+issue+tracker">http://www.google.com/search?q=chromium+issue+tracker</a>  2. Click on the first link in the search results to follow it.  3. Use the browser's Back button.      The search page appears.      The page content appears looking corrupted or rendered with an incorrect   encoding. See attached.    I have only witnessed this problem intermittently. Sometimes it will occur   on the first attempt of following the steps to reproduce. Other times it   will take several attempts (repeating steps 2-3 can reproduce it). I have   seen it happen on various google.com search URLs. I have never seen the   problem on any page other than google.com web search results pages. </pre>
