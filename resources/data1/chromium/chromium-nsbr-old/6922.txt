<title>Issue 6922 -   chromium -    Apps launch links in default browser usability issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=8523">r8523</a> introduces serious usability problems with sites in app mode.    Now  when I click a link in Gmail as an app  I get a Chromium protocol   handler dialog. That has to be bypassed.    I've had other usability problems that are too confusing and numerous to   enumerate completely.    1. I have Chromium set to re-open the pages I visited last. If I just have   a Chromuim app window open and click a link  it apparently launches a new   Chromium browser window. That means it wants to open all of the (usually   15+) tabs I had open before. I get a protocol handler for each tab that I   previously had open in a Chromium browser window.    2. If Google Chrome is my default browser and I use Chromium in app mode    for some reason after I click a link in a Chromium app mode window  all   navigations in Chromium browser tab result in (a) a protocol handler dialog   followed quickly by (b) closing the tab and the dialog.   </pre>
