<title>Issue 14399 -   chromium -    Convenient switching between tabs (like in Windows) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  Google Chrome	2.0.172.31 (__��_��__�ܕ�__��__��__��_��_��____�܏ ��_��__��___��_��____��_ )  WebKit	530.5  V8	1.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5    (sorry for my english)    Sorry if duplicate...  I think that current algorithm of switching between tabs is not so convenient. It would be more convenient to store order of tabs activation   and when someone press Ctrl+Tab direct him to previous active (!) tab. Like   it made in Windows.    This feature is only one thing that prevents me to go from Opera to   Chrome... I hope that this feature will be implemented as soon as possible    because as I think  it is the most required feature for many people. </pre>
