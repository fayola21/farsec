<title>Issue 21222 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Download all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43    when you right click on a page there should be an option for &quot;download all&quot;   like &quot;print...&quot;. that should open a window containing all download links in   the page. from there user can choose the items he wants to download and after   choosing them they should be added to downloads.    i don't remember in which application i saw this feature probably it was some    download accelerator. </pre>
