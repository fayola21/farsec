<title>Issue 16862 -   chromium -    chrome shouldn't allow chrome lang and gtk lang to disagree - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I run chrome with LANG=he_IL.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=en  then chrome thinks it's   in RTL mode (since icu picks he as the language) and gtk thinks it's in LTR   mode (since gtk picks the language from LANGUAGE).  We should make this   agree on a single language.    We can either try to change gtk (via gtk_widget_set_default_direction) or we   can have chrome try to agree with gtk.  The latter sounds safer to me since   there may be other places that language matters that gtk_widget_set_default_direction misses. </pre>
