<title>Issue 4385 -   chromium -    Add COMODO ECC Certification Authority to net/base/ev_root_ca_metadata.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://comodoecccertificationauthority-ev.comodoca.com">https://comodoecccertificationauthority-ev.comodoca.com</a>            Firefox 3: OK (3.0.4)           IE 7: OK (Vista)      1. Browse to <a href="https://comodoecccertificationauthority-ev.comodoca.com">https://comodoecccertificationauthority-ev.comodoca.com</a> using  Chrome on Vista.      Chrome should display its EV UI (i.e. the company name in green text).      The company name is not displayed.    Additional Information:  This week  the COMODO ECC Certification Authority root certificate was  added by Microsoft to the Windows Vista Automatic Root Update facility and  added by Mozilla to Firefox (3.0.4).  (Please note that Comodo's ECC CA private keys are currently being held  off-line  so we are unable to issue CRLs or OCSP Responses at the moment.   IIRC  this may prevent Chrome from displaying its EV UI.  We do however  anticipate bringing our ECC CA private keys online soon).    Please accept the attached patch for net/base/ev_root_ca_metadata.cc. </pre>
