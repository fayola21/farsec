<title>Issue 3726 -   chromium -    Instances of search string not all highlighted when Find-in-page reopened.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.154.6 (Official Build 3810)        1. Open a page  e.g. <a href="http://news.google.com">http://news.google.com</a>  2. Ctrl+F to bring up Find-in-page dialog.  3. Type search string &quot;the&quot; into search box.  4. Click the 'x' to close search box.  5. Again  Ctrl+F to bring up Find-in-page dialog. The same search string  still displays in the search box.      What is the expected output?    All instances of search string should be highlighted in page.    What do you see instead?    Only one instance is highlighted (the one that was current before the  search dialog was closed). You must click the up or down arrow to redisplay  the highlighting.     </pre>
