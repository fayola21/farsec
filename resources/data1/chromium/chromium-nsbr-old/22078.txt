<title>Issue 22078 -   chromium -    Incorrect rendering momentarily when MoveToolstripAt is called - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Drag a toolstrip in the extension shelf by its handle. The moment you let go   the handle  the toolstrip renders briefly on the top left corner of the   browser  then settles to its normal position. This gives a slight flickering   action which can be annoying. </pre>
