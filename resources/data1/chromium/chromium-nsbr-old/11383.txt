<title>Issue 11383 -   chromium -    Tabs feature request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi  when a tab is opened and there's no information on it (empty  no page   opened) and the user try to open a new tab  I think Google Chrome shouldn't   open a new.   How should work: Instead open a new tab  Google Chrome should just redirect   to the last &quot;empty&quot; tab opened.  Why:   1- As Google Chrome is a innovate browser  I think can be interesting    probably not priority.  2- Sometimes users open a tab and forget and then open a new tab again.   </pre>
