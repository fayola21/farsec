<title>Issue 9771 -   chromium -    Fall back to top-level domain for tab-to-search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you write subdomain.domain.com/folder/file.htm and hit tab  it should  search domain.com (or subdomain.com). If we don't have a search for  domain.com  we should do a google site search restricted to that domain. </pre>
