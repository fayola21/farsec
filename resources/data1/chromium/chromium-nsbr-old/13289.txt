<title>Issue 13289 -   chromium -    Network connection / transaction refactoring - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a metabug tracking the work to refactor the binding of   connections/transactions in the network stack.    Currently HttpNetworkTransactions are tied to specific connections.  They   are tied to specific http streams  ssl connections  and tcp connections.    Loosening this binding will provide some opportunities for networking   optimizations.    This requires refactoring several layers of code  starting with the   ClientSocketPool. </pre>
