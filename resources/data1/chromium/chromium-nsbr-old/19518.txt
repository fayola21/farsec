<title>Issue 19518 -   chromium -    Compare safebrowsing in Firefox and Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An external report from NSS shows Chrome catching far fewer phishing pages  (~half?) compared with Firefox. Given that we're using the same data  this  seems either to be a bug in the test or a bug in Chrome code. We should do  a test of our own and make sure. The phishing and malware lists are checked  in as badurls_phishing and badurls_malware  just search for them and you  will find it. </pre>
