<title>Issue 4715 -   chromium -    Need a progress indicator for uploads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure if this is something to implement in the browser front end or   WebKit.    From email:    With Chrome  there's no progress indicator for uploads. For example  when   uploading a PowerPoint to Presently over a normal (i.e. not the office)   connection  you have no idea if anything is really happening  or how long   it's going to take.   </pre>
