<title>Issue 5022 -   chromium -    remove ATL dependencies from test_shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to remove ATL dependencies from Chromium so that people  can build it with Visual C++ Express.    There are a few small ATL dependencies in the test_shell app itself:  drag_delegate.cc - trivial use of CPoint  front_helper.h - implemented with CWindowImpl  test_shell_win.cc - AtlGetStringResourceImage   </pre>
