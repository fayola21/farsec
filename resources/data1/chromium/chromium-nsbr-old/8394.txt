<title>Issue 8394 -   chromium -    Different titles for different visits seems to be broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use Gmail for a while  clicking on a bunch of different messages.  2. Open the history view.  3. Note that you have a lot of the most recent message's page title over   and over  even though you only visited that message once... it ends up   being used for every visit of that page.        Not sure what the right solution is - either saving the unique title per   visit or collapsing adjacent visits would make the appearance look less   bad.     </pre>
