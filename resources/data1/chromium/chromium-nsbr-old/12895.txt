<title>Issue 12895 -   chromium -    AJAX response fails. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   We have a login screen in our application [in gwt]   The same code is called for user pressing Enter key as well as user   clicking the &quot;Login&quot; button [The function makes a ajax call on the server].      The AJAX call should succeed.      The AJAX call fails when user presses Enter while entering password.   However  it does not fail when user clicks on the login button  I have checked a thousand times  the code for the two events are SAME.  There are no differences in them. Still the call fails for no apparent   reason.    Suprisingly the AJAX call is still made at the server end.    <b>Please provide
