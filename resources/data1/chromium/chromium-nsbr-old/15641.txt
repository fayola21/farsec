<title>Issue 15641 -   chromium -    Only show smart tooltips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Evan: ��_��_ It would be cool if Chromium observed how you were using the   browser and then only pointed out features you don't use. �_    Rough design idea:  - Associate tooltips with their corresponding UMA signal.  - Reusing the UMA infrastructure (e.g. MetricsService)  save all the executed   command types in a small database.  - After both &quot;X hours of usage&quot; and &quot;X days since installation&quot; expired    start presenting tooltips for UMA-related features that *haven't been   executed* by the user.    Advantage:  Don't show tooltips the user knows about. </pre>
