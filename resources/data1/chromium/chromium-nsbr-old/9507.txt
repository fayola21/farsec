<title>Issue 9507 -   chromium -    build script for dependencies doesn't install some packages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In build/install-build-deps.sh there is defined a list of packages needed  for compiling chromium:   # Packages need for development  dev_list=&quot;subversion pkg-config python perl g++ g++-multilib bison flex gperf            libnss3-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnspr4-dev libsqlite3-dev            wdiff lighttpd php5-cgi msttcorefonts sun-java6-fonts&quot;    However  this list is never again used in the script  I believe that the  script should install these packages.     I think the following change might fix the issue  but I have not tested it  thoroughly:    --- install-build-deps.sh       (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12762">revision 12762</a>)  +++ install-build-deps.sh       (working copy)  @@ -102 7 +102 7 @@   echo &quot;Finding missing packages...&quot;   new_list=&quot;$(yes n |               sudo apt-get install --reinstall   -                         ${pkg_list} ${lib_list} ${dbg_list}   +                         ${pkg_list} ${lib_list} ${dbg_list} ${dev_list}                             $([ &quot;$(uname -m)&quot; = x86_64 ] &amp;&amp; echo ${cmp_list})                             2&gt;/dev/null |               sed -e 's/^  //;t;d')&quot;   </pre>
