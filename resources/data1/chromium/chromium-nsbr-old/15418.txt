<title>Issue 15418 -   chromium -    Support metrics upload in Mac/Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Metrics can't be uploaded with a GUID... and that needs to be implemented for   non-windows client.    Chris Masone has supplied a first patch.... and after we're happy with the   way it works with linux  we'll eventually converge on just using one GUID   generator.   </pre>
