<title>Issue 2795 -   chromium -    Do not wrap Size and Date Modified columns when displaying contents of local computer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  URLs (if applicable) : file:///C:/mydirectory  Other browsers tested: n/a    When displaying contents from the local computer eg. file:///C:/mydirectory   the display looks ugly when there is a long filename and the contents of   the Size and Date Modified table columns are wrapped to multiple lines.    See attachment.    The table cells need to be created with &quot;nowrap&quot;  or &amp;nbsp; instead of   spaces  or some other method so that Size and Date Modified always displays   on one single line. </pre>
