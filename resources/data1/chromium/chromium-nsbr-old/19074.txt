<title>Issue 19074 -   chromium -    Do not overwrite default home page during first run import - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've seen that users are happier with Chrome if we set their homepage to   www.google.com and set that to the start/home page.    There are already installerdata flags to allow us to set the homepage and   to enable a home button. The problem is that we blow away any default   homepage if the user goes through the first run import flow.     The solution is to simply stop importing homepage  at least in the case   where we've specified a default homepage.      I do not believe that we talk about the fact that homepage is currently   imported in any user documentation  so changing this behavior shouldn't   surprise anyone or require any changes to the help center    The end result should be a default first run experience for mstone3 that   does the following:  -shows first run UI  -sets the home page to google.com  -sets the start page to the home page (not the NTP)  -enables the home button </pre>
