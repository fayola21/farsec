<title>Issue 15567 -   chromium -    Download Shelf Overflows on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 191.0 (Developer Build 19331)    OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Download enough items for the download shelf to become almost full (about 5 items   for a 1300px wide window). See Picture3.png.  2. Download one more item. See Picture4.png.  3. The download items now overflow  covering up the &quot;Show All Downloads&quot; and the close    button controls.      Unsure  see what Windows does. Probably remove completed items.      The shelf controls are covered up by download items. It would be nice to have a &quot;clear   completed&quot; control in the shelf  too. </pre>
