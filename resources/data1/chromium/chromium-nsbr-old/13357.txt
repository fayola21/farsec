<title>Issue 13357 -   chromium -    Tabs do not consistently say &quot;Ray says...&quot; when you receive a new chat in Gmail. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.5    OS version               : 10.5.6    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): As soon as you receive a new chat    &quot;Ray says...&quot; appears in the tab for that window.         1. Start a chat with someone in Gmail  2. Change to a different tab  3. If the person replies in Gmail  you won't always be notified immediately.   I am seeing this happen about 75% of the time.      You should see &quot;Ray says...&quot; appear in the tab the instant a new chat   arrives.      You instead see the title of the page &quot;Gmail - Inbox&quot; </pre>
