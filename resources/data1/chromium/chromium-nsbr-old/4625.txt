<title>Issue 4625 -   chromium -    Tag editing does not work for Remember the Milk using Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create more than one task in Remember the Milk.  2. Add a different tag to each task.  3. Multi-edit the tasks (select each one and hit &quot;M&quot; for multi-edit mode)  4. The tags entry field on the right shows &lt;multiple&gt;.  5. Add a new tag for all the tasks  so the tag entry field looks like   &quot;&lt;multiple&gt;  mytag&quot;.  6. Click outside the entry field (hitting Enter works on other browsers but   not Chrome).      All tasks should have their original tags plus the new &quot;mytag&quot; that was   entered.      All tasks have a tag called &lt;multiple&gt; in addition to &quot;mytag&quot;  but their   original tags are gone.    Please provide
