<title>Issue 16709 -   chromium -    Obey proxy auth parameters from gconf or env vars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>                   ProxyConfig currently does not support proxy authentication parameters  (username and password). The gconf /system/http_proxy/*auth* settings are  therefore ignored  as well as equivalent parameters from env vars (in URL  form).    Chrome does support proxy authentication  but it wil need to prompt for the  proxy password (which it can remember).    Ideally  Chrome should use the password provided in settings without having  to prompt the user. </pre>
