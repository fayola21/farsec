<title>Issue 10955 -   chromium -    mini_installer needs a graphical interface - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The mini_installer application provided by the continuous integration   system for Chromium installs without presenting any visual progress   indicators to the user.    I believe the automated nature of the installer is a good thing  however to   have some sort of minimalistic progress bar to display the status of the   installation process would be an absolutely wonderful thing to have. Most   of the time I'm choosing an arbitrary amount of time to wait post-install   to make sure that I'm not running a Chromium process in the middle of the   install process. If there was some visual aid  I would not have to guess at   it.    The mini_installer as-is may have a different design goal in mind than the   one I'm currently understanding. If the mini_installer behaves correctly as   designed and would not be willing to change  then I propose a completely   separate installer that is still automated (i.e. no prompts  no user   interaction of any kind) but provides the additional user interface to make   the operation seem more synchronous. </pre>
