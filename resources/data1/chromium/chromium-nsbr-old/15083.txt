<title>Issue 15083 -   chromium -    No way to get URL from the current page if the address bar is empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.33 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.33 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?  There's no easy way to display the current page URL again.        What is the expected result?  Either using F5 should repopulate the URL in the awesome bar  And/or there should be a contextual menu to display &quot;page infos&quot;            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Open any webpage and   2. do a cut (Ctrl-X) of the URL (from the awesome bar)  3. then do other clipboard activities (cut something else)..  4. You won't find easily the URL of the current page (a tricky workaround :   back  forward should work)    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  Firefox has a &quot;page info&quot; menu    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
