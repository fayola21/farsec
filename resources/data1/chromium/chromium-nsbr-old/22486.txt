<title>Issue 22486 -   chromium -    Problem with target and popup button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Make a page with frames with frame name &quot;test&quot;  2. create a button to make a popup window   3. After submit he needs to reload the main frame and load the information   in frame test                The frame will not load the test frame. In place of that he load it in a   new window. Or load the whole site again.    The problem is only in chromium and not in IE and Firefox.      Thanks for your help   </pre>
