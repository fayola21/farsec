<title>Issue 12066 -   chromium -    Match Firefox's per-host connection limit of 15 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome limits the number of connections per &quot;group&quot; to 6.    This is particularly bad when using a proxy server  since there can be at   most 6 open connections across all tabs. This gets pretty ugly when you are   using sites like GMAIL  since they leave connections open (long running   xmlhttp)  and pretty soon you are running on empty and nothing loads.    Browsing through the mozilla documentation  it appears that Firefox 3 has   boosted the connections per host to 15 (which is more than twice our   limit):    <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.max-connections-per-server">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.max-connections-per-server</a>    We should at the very least consider this increase for proxy servers  and   preferably across the board.    Note that this user experience was reported by a gmail engineer  since they    keep multiple gmails open and run into this problem frequently. </pre>
