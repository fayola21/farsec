<title>Issue 2827 -   chromium -    [magic_browzR] Double clicking the new tab button maximizes window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  OS                   : WinXP SP3    Double-clicking the new tab button maximizes the Chrome window.  This is   incorrect.    Double clicking the title bar of a Windows application *should* maximize   the window  but *not* double clicking a control located within the title   bar.       </pre>
