<title>Issue 19717 -   chromium -    'chromium-browser URL' should launch prefer launching URL on current virtual desktop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open up a couple of chromium windows on different desktop spaces (I'm   using gnome with compiz  but I think this is true for any desktop with   virtual spaces)  2. click links from other applications (such as pidgin) and try to figure   out where they will open.      If there is an existing chromium window on the existing virtual desktop   space  open the link in a tab there.  If there isn't a window present on   that space  open a new window.      The link will be opened on one of the other desktop spaces randomly (or    I'm sure  according to some algorithm which is opaque to me).    <b>Please provide
