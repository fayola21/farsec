<title>Issue 11394 -   chromium -    Problem with depot-tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Can someone update the wiki page   <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/how-tos/get-the-code">http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/how-tos/get-the-code</a>    to reflect the fact that gclient will fail to install/run with various   errors unless gclient is in your PATH (at least on windows -- seems to   assume the current directory is the location of gclient.bat).    Tooks me ages to figure out why I couldn't get gclient to work properly.    Also <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-gclient">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-gclient</a> lists the   PATH change as being optional. </pre>
