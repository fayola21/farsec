<title>Issue 20629 -   chromium -    'Undo' resets to the default theme rather than GTK+ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.204.0 (Ubuntu build 24854)  OS + version: Linux  Ubuntu      0. Press 'Options' then 'Set to GTK+ theme'  1. Press 'Get themes'  2. Browse for a funky theme and press 'Apply theme'  3. When the theme is installed and the toolstrip appears  press 'Undo'      Revert to my GTK+ theme      Chromium reverts to it's default blue theme    I found this pretty frustrating.   </pre>
