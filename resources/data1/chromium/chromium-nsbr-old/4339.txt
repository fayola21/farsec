<title>Issue 4339 -   chromium -    Focus is not restored to Omnibox  after find-in bar is dismissed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0.4.154.18 (Official Build 5194)  This is one more bug related to <a title="&quot;Esc&quot; key does not work on Omnibox  if [New Tab] is set as  home page." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1333"> issue 1333 </a>. Filing this for tracking purpose.      1. Make sure you set [New Tab] as  your home page -- This is important.  2. Launch Chrome with Magic_BrowzR option.      (Observe Omnibox has keyboard focus)  3. Ctrl+f to find-in bar and dismiss it (Esc key)    Notice keyboard focus is not set back to Omnibox.    What is the expected output?  Keyboard focus should be set to Omnibox.    What do you see instead?  Here most of the time keyboard focus is set to [New Tab] renderer page or  some times the focus is at the same place only  where Find-in bar was  displayed (confirmed this with Inspect32 tool)    Again  MagicBrowzR only.       </pre>
