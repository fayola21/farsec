Click on link &quot;<a href="https://brainshark.com/filename">https://brainshark.com/filename</a>&quot; (no trailing slash or   file extension)  2. Link is set to open in &quot;New Window&quot;.

Once you confirm that the certificate is ok  move forward to the   presentation.      When using a link to access said webpage instead of typing the address   directly into the browser  the page goes white with &quot;about:blank&quot; in the   address bar as if it's loading but never successfully loads the page.    <b>Please provide
