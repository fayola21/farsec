<title>Issue 6398 -   chromium -    Even width dotted border antialiasing looks bad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In trunk  we must have picked up changes in Skia as to how dashed styles   are drawn.  If you have something that looks like:    &lt;div style=&quot;width: 80px; border-bottom: 1px dotted red&quot;&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;    You will see the line starts out dotted  and then gets more solid in the   middle  then goes dotted again.  The problem is:    PlatformContextSkia::setupPaintForStroking:      // Determine about how many dashes or dots we should have.    int numDashes = length / roundf(width);    if (!(numDashes &amp; 1))        numDashes++;    // Make it odd so we end on a dash/dot.    // Use the number of dashes to determine the length of a    // dash/dot  which will be approximately width    dashLength = SkScalarDiv(SkIntToScalar(length)    SkIntToScalar(numDashes));    So we try to end on a dot  probably so that the corners look better.    However  for the dotted case  where length = 0 and width = 80  we wend up   with a dashLength of ~0.987  which Skia is trying to antialias  spreading   the error to the next pixels  causing this sort of error interference   pattern.    Other browsers don't anti alias the line  they just double up on the final   corner  which also sort of looks bad.  Basically  if they want the last   pixel to be on  they draw the line  and then always turn the last pixel on    which means that in this case the last dot would be 2 pixels wide instead   of one.  This looks pretty bad in all browsers I tried (ie seems to draw   dashed when you ask for dotted  so I can't tell there).    I would personally just ignore the corner business  but maybe that makes   full borders look bad.  It seems like what we do in the stable release is   just keep up the error and eventually skip a pixel  in the middle of the   line  that also looks bad... </pre>
