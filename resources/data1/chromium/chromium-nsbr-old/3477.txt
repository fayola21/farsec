<title>Issue 3477 -   chromium -    Don't play plugin instances inside suppressed popups? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Had a report from a user who was very confused that he kept hearing audio;   it turned out he had a flash ad (with sound!) inside a constrained popup.    Perhaps we could not instantiate (or not start  or whatever) plugin   instances inside constrained popups (on unconstrain  start the instance   immediately).  It's not clear to me whether a better theoretical fix would   be &quot;muting&quot; constrained popups  but it's moot since that's technically   infeasible. </pre>
