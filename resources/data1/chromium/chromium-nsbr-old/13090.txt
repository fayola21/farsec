<title>Issue 13090 -   chromium -    not going back to the correct page in history when pressing back on navigation or mouse button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3 (Official Build 17055)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      Unfortunately this hasn't been something I have been fully able to grasp a   pattern of how it is occurring  but generally as I browse around (I have   spotted this predominantly in face book) pressing back will take me to a   page further back in my history that it should.    It is not an issue with the mouse and pressing it more times that should be accidentally  it just seems to forget certain pages as i browse.    That's all the information i have at the moment but will try to keep an eye   on it and update this ticket if i can.       </pre>
