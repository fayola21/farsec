<title>Issue 20570 -   chromium -    Query parameters are stripped when a GET form is submitted to about:* URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the test_expectations.txt comment:  This is deferred because it involves a scenario (submitting a form to   about:blank) that is unlikely to occur on real web pages.  That only explains   why this test sometimes times-out.    LayoutTests/http/tests/navigation/onload-navigation-iframe-timeout.html   = TIMEOUT  LayoutTests/http/tests/navigation/onload-navigation-iframe.html =   TIMEOUT  LayoutTests/http/tests/navigation/onload-navigation-iframe-2.html =   TIMEOUT </pre>
