<title>Issue 8811 -   chromium -    ProcessUtilTest.KillSlowChild is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I saw at least two tries to unflaky this test  but all of them just added a  Sleep somewhere  which reduces the flakiness  but does not fix the root cause.    I submitted <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/42224">http://codereview.chromium.org/42224</a> to fix the problem &quot;in a  better way&quot; and I'm going to commit it (there is more detailed description  in the review issue).    I'm adding all people I noticed in previous related reviews to CC. </pre>
