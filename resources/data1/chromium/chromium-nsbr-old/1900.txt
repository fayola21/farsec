<title>Issue 1900 -   chromium -    Should throw some light if imports fails in case of Master Password in FF. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm filing this based on the comments made for the <a title="Errors in importing from firefox " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7"> bug #7 </a>.    We are not importing Passwords from FF2.x/FF3.x  If FF is having master   password.  In such a use case  if user performs imports for passwords  then we should   throw some alert to the user why imports is not successful. It makes more   sense to the user.    -Venkat. </pre>
