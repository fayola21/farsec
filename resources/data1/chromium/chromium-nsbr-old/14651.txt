<title>Issue 14651 -   chromium -    Add missing strings (plural format) to grd and update ICU for plural formatting of 8 Indian languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I noticed that generated_resources.grd does not have entries for 'ZERO' cases   for some time formatting strings. It seems that I made a mistake.    While I'm at it  I'm gonna revise our copy of ICU to support plural   formatting in 8 Indian locales.   </pre>
