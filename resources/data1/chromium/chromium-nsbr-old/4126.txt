<title>Issue 4126 -   chromium -    Parsing errors in GraphingLogProcessor can halt testing runs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the event of a corrupted graphs.dat file or bad data from the test step    the GraphingLogProcessor can raise an exception  halting the test run.    Specific problems:  - An empty graphs.dat file  which I put into the directory manually to make   the empty plot look nicer  raised a simplejson error  - Hypothetically  a space in the middle of a data value would cause a   ValueError from float() (e.g. 'RESULT foo: bar= {1.2  0.34 5} gizmos') </pre>
