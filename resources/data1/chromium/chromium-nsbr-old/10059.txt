<title>Issue 10059 -   chromium -    [regression] test_shell spins when showing windowed plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load a page with a windowed plugin.  test_shell goes into a paint storm    continuously repainting the whole page.  I've been unable to track down where   it regressed  so here are some notes.     - using DiamondX (which doesn't animate / redraw repeatedly)  still happens   - turning off the call to PaintRect in webwidget_host_gtk.cc (which calls   into WebKit to paint) fixes it!  but at at the cost of disabling webkit   painting  so that call is somehow triggering it </pre>
