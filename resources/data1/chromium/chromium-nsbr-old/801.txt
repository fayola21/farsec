<title>Issue 801 -   chromium -    depot_tools/hammer.bat depends on existence of ../third_party - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There seems to be an implicit requirement for depot_tools to be checked out   underneath a chrome/ check out.  hammer.bat looks for python and scons in   &quot;%dp0../third_party&quot;.  I looked at the old hammer.bat  and it checks   &quot;%cd%../third_party&quot;.   </pre>
