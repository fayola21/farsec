<title>Issue 16045 -   chromium -    showModalDialog should be modal to the opener page (input events should be suppressed on the page that opened the dialog) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> showModalDialog should be modal to the opener page (input events should be   suppressed on the page that opened the dialog)    this is a web compat bug since it impacts sites that use showModalDialog.    the behavior of showModalDialog should be to lock out all tabs just like   alert  confirm and prompt.    this bug is windows only (or perhaps views only) since the corresponding work   for mac and linux is covered by <a title="Implement showModalDialog on mac &amp; linux" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15891"> issue 15891 </a>. </pre>
