<title>Issue 20967 -   chromium -    Chrome does not work properly with WebEx - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;3.0.195.10&gt;            Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK        I use WebEx regularly to hold web conferences. When you open the conference   with WebEx the browser launches a new (second) window in which the   presentation takes place. This does not work under chrome - the second   browser window does not get launched. I result to launching Mozilla for   WebEx.        </pre>
