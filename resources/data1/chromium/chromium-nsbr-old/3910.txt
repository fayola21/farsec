<title>Issue 3910 -   chromium -    we should help users get the most up-to-date plug-ins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great if we showed and infobar when a user visited a page that   activated an out-of-date plug-in. The infobar could help the user get the   more recent plug-in.    Use cases:    1. security - we don't disable the plug-in  but we strongly encourage users   to upgrade  2. compatibility - odds are users will get a better experience with more   recent plug-ins since it will be better tested    We would need a mechanism for maintaining a client-side list of out-of-date   plug-ins. </pre>
