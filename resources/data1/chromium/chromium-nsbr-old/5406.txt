<title>Issue 5406 -   chromium -    One login form - several stored logins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36             Safari 3: NOK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to a page with a login form  2. Login there and store login (e.g. username1 - any password)  3. Logout there  4. Login with another account and store login  too (e.g. username2 - any   password)  5. Load login form again          When I type the first charater (&quot;u&quot;) a drop down should be shown with the   suggestions for &quot;username1&quot; and &quot;username2&quot;.            &quot;username1&quot; or &quot;username2&quot; is autofilled. I have to type the hole opposite   username to login with the another account.     It is really strenuous when I always have to type the hole username. </pre>
