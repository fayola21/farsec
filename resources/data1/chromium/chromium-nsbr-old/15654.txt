<title>Issue 15654 -   chromium -    create fuzz extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (suggested by Darin)  We should create a fuzz extension that intentionally tries to just do a lot   of random API calls in random orders in an attempt to crash the browser /   extension process.  This then could run on ChromeBot along with the other   reliability tests. </pre>
