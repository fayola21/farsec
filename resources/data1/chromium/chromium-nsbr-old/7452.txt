<title>Issue 7452 -   chromium -    compatibility problems on managerzone.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> good morning!        I am not good in English  for that I am using a software for translation.    the one that I am telling is that I liked this navigator a lot  fast    practical and very simple. but the principal site that I use  that bug   happens. in the market of transfers when will buy some player the window in   the which the value is placed to buy doesn't appear  you click and nothing   doesn't simply happen.        it follows an example used in the firefox        hugs and I wait to have contributed in some thing.
