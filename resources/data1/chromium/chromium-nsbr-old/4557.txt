<title>Issue 4557 -   chromium -    Navigating to about:memory page from Task manager should bring up the minimized browser window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.22(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5545">r5545</a>) and ToT 0.3.155.0(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5635">r5635</a>)  I thought we have a bug for this  BUT could not find one.      1. Bring up Chrome Task manager.  2. Minimize all instances of Browser windows.  3. Click on the link &quot;Stats for nerds&quot; (visible at the bottom of the task  manager)    What is the expected output?   The minimized browser window should be *restored (should be displayed) and  user should be navigated to about:memory page.    What do you see instead?  The browser window keeps minimized  but navigated to about:memory page in  the current page.         </pre>
