<title>Issue 19668 -   chromium -    History: Delete individual items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (Official Build 23222)    Currently  if one wishes to remove items from the history  there are two   methods:    1) in chrome://history/   click &quot;Delete history for this day&quot;  2) Wrench -&gt; Clear browsing data    Neither allows fine-grained control.    I can think of a couple relevant improvements to chrome://history/ :  1) Add a small [x] or [delete] button next to each item in history  2) Allow all results for a search to be removed from history    Tangentially  it would be nice if the history search supported more Google-  style predicates-- inurl  intitle  etc. </pre>
