<title>Issue 96 -   chromium -    Resizing bottom of window doesn't trigger refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. navigate to mail.google.com  2. resize window by clicking and dragging on the bottom border  3. vertical scrollbar and window contents do not resize until the window is   resized in the horizontal direction    Checked some other pages (e.g. google calendar) and I don't see this   behavior  so it may be a gmail bug.                Please provide
