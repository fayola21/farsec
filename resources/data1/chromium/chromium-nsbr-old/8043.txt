<title>Issue 8043 -   chromium -    Zoom-out keyboard shortcut conflicts with 'select tab 6' shortcut with French keyboard in use. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The French keyboard in France (but not in Canada) has '-' (unshifted)  '6'   (shifted) and '|' (AltGR) where US  QWERTY has '6' and '^'.      As a result  Zoom Out (Ctrl + '-') and 'Select tab 6' (Ctrl + 6) conflict   with each other.     In Chrome  'Select tab 6' takes a precedence while in Firefox it's zoom-  out. IE does not respond to ctrl + '-' in fr-FR layout  either.     More specifically  what Firefox does is :    - ctrl + shift + 'US 6' : select tab 6  - ctrl + 'US 6' : zoom out     - ctrl + shift + 'US 1' and ctrl + 'US 1' (the same for 2 3 4...9 except   for 6) select tab 1.       It seems that there are a few other layouts with this issue. For instance    Slovak layout has '+' (unshifted)  '1' (shifted) and '~' (AltGr) where US   QWERTY has '1' and '!'. So  Zoom-in conflicts with 'select tab 1'.     We just have a single across-locale (in this case  it's actually keyboard   layout rather than locale) short-cuts and accelerators.  Even if we decide   to have different accelerators/short-cuts defined for different UI   language  it's not clear what to do about this.   Perhaps  without having separate sets of accelerators  we can do what   Firefox does.       BTW  there are two other ways to zoom (ctrl + mouse wheel and menu). And    obviously  tab 1 and tab 6 can be selected with mouse. Needless to say    this is not ideal from the accessibility point of view.     I just realized that numpad + and - work even with fr-FR and Slovak   layouts. So  it's not very critical.  </pre>
