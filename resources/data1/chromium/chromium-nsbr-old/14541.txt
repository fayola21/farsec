<title>Issue 14541 -   chromium -    Spell checker not smart enough - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a general issue to post words that chrome's spell checker isn't   reconizing or not suggesting the reasonable spelling to        To the team:  the idea is to assign it to sidchat and leave this open so users can post   problematic words in a comment (instead of making a new issue for an issue in   a scale of...a capital letter not suggested)  if you don't like my idea just invalid it </pre>
