<title>Issue 5795 -   chromium -    &quot;Show as tab&quot; disabled for popup within application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 1.0.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7355">r7355</a>). Issue is on trunk only.        Precondition: have <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/goodpopups.html">http://www.popuptest.com/goodpopups.html</a> installed as  application.    1. Launch application with Desktop shortcut.  2. Click on link  &quot;Good PopUp #1&quot;.  3. Right-click on title bar of popup to bring up context menu.    What is the expected output?    &quot;Show as tab&quot; menu item should be enabled.    What do you see instead?    &quot;Show as tab&quot; menu item is disabled. The menu item is enabled  however  if  accessed when not in an application.    If this is as intended  please close the issue.   </pre>
