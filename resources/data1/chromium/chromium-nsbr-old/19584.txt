<title>Issue 19584 -   chromium -    Interface trouble at netbooks and other small resolution monitors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (__��_��__�ܕ�__��__��__��_��_��____�܏ ��_��__��___��_��____��_ 23222)    At netbooks and other small resolution monitors with vertical 600px or   smaller we can't look at bottom button. See attached screenshots tr01.jpg and   tr02.jpg.    Maybe we need vertical scrollbar like at re01.jpg (at the third tab of   Preferences menu)?    Sorry for my english. </pre>
