<title>Issue 21778 -   chromium -    Truncated bookmarks names on bookmarks bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0    OS version               : 10.6      1.Created a few bookmarks in the bookmarks bar.      Two letters bookmarks not to be truncated.        As the attached screenshot clearly shows  some of them are truncated  and so are two of the   symbols I've used.        Thanks.     </pre>
