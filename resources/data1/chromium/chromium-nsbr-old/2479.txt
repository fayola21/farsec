<title>Issue 2479 -   chromium -    Balance of UI in about box is off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that some of the contents of the about box has moved to about:version    the about box looks wrong  visually. It looked better when the bottom   (grey) section was a little taller. I'm not sure what the best thing to do   is here to increase the height - maybe add a link to the full details page   (about:version) and bump up the height of the about box? </pre>
