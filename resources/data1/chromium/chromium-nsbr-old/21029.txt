<title>Issue 21029 -   chromium -    Plugin name in crashed plug-in info bar has .plugin appended.  Ugly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Crash Flash.  This shouldn't be too hard  but if you're having a hard   time  ps -ef | grep plugin and then send it a signal.    What is the expected output?  Observe:  The following plug-in has crashed : Flash Player.plugin    Expect:  The following plug-in has crashed : Flash Player    <a title="IDS_PLUGIN_CRASHED_PROMPT is ugly" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21026"> Bug 21026 </a> for the ugly space to the left of the colon.    I don't actually know if there's anything we want to do about this.  The   stupid plugin declares this name with the .plugin in its CFBundleName.  So   does the QuickTime plugin.  I might not have filed this bug if I had checked   on that first  but now that I've gotten all of this typed  it seems like a waste   of a rant.    Anyway.    We should use the CFBundleName if we're not doing so already.  If we are    this report is probably just invalid. </pre>
