<title>Issue 10277 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   It looks like the upstream test is incorrectly using font-family: Times  instead of font-family: times new roman.  This broke when we recently moved  more of our font default settings to 'times new roman' from 'Times'.  This  should be fixed upstream.  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16348">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16348</a>   LINUX : LayoutTests/fast/css/font-face-default-font.html = FAIL   (Automatically generated from line 603 to line 609 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
