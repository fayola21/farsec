<title>Issue 4674 -   chromium -    Chrome JavaScript Debugger shouldn't un-escape HTML special characters  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome's JavaScript debugger (but not the JavaScript Console) un-escapes   HTML sequences like %3C before displaying them. This is confusing and   unhelpful.    For instance:  $ print '%3A'  &lt;  $ print '%3A'[0]  %    Or consider this example:  JavaScript debugger:  $ escape(':')  :  ^--- This seems to show that escape doesn't work properly  when in fact it   *has* turned ':' into '%3A'  it's just not displaying it as such.    JavaScript Console:  &gt; escape(':')  &quot;%3A&quot;  ^--- This is what you'd expect. </pre>
