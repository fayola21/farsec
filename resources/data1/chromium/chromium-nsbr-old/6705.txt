<title>Issue 6705 -   chromium -    Single field autofill enter eating behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Glen:    &quot;When I am in a single field form (such as a search field)  and the  autofill bubble comes up - the first 'return' keypress is eaten by  autofill (regardless of whether I have anything selected)  so to  submit  I have to press return twice. Because I often ignore autofill   it takes me some seconds after my first 'enter' keypress before I  realize that something went wrong.    Enter should always act as enter on a field  regardless of whether  autofill is doing something (mouse or keyboard selection of an item  from the list should automatically add its content to the field   negating the need for 'enter' selection).&quot;   </pre>
