<title>Issue 16665 -   chromium -    Browser window flashes  if a theme is applied on Win 7/ Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces on DEV and ToT (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20499">r20499</a>).  OS: Vista/Win 7.    When a theme is applied  the window flashes - it goes to background and comes   to foreground after the theme is applied.    PS: Notice  when a theme is applied in XP  it is very smooth  no flash at   all.         </pre>
