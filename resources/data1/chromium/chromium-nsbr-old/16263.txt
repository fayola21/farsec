<title>Issue 16263 -   chromium -    Make jankometer gauge message queue wait - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Jankometer wants three time points:   - time the messages was created   - time we started processing the message   - time we finished processing the message    On Linux we don't have the first.  Actually  we mostly have the first   in that some X messages include a timestamp  but that timestamp is  intended to be opaque.    However!  Some prodding around revealed it's using clock_gettime  which  I think it's ok to rely on since this is only a debugging tool. </pre>
