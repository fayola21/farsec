<title>Issue 6739 -   chromium -    Cannot open emails in hotmail or open attachments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello     I have been using chrome on an older laptop for a few weeks and i am   impressed with it.     However  when using hotmail  you cannot click on the emails to open them    nor can you download the attachments.     For this task i am using opera or mozilla  but neither are quite a quick   and slick as chrome  but are sometimes easier to use.    my email is mdroberts007@hotmail.com   Regards    Michael Roberts </pre>
