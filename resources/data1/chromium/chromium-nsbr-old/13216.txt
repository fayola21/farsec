<title>Issue 13216 -   chromium -    downloaded file info is a bit messy in RTL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.0 (17405        download a file (preferably a big one to see it in action)    look at the download tab (Ctrl+J)      the file name should appear on the right i think      the file name is stuck in the middle of the line    More info :  this bug appears in hebrew enabled vista  but maybe using an English vista   with chrome and a UI in hebrew will reproduce it too </pre>
