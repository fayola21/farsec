<title>Issue 9629 -   chromium -    spike.com: Flash player controls are not working in fullscreen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.spike.com/video/full-test/3138001">http://www.spike.com/video/full-test/3138001</a>  2. Click on fullscreen mode icon(beside menu)  3. Once you are into fullscreen mode  click on the same icon again to exit   fullscreen mode    What is the expected output?   To leave fullscreen mode    What do you see instead?  None of the icons works. Chrome doesn't respond and the user has to wait   till it exits fullscreen on its own    FF3 works fine but not Chrome2.0.169.1_11427 and Chromium_12968    *** This works fine in XP but not in Win 7 *** </pre>
