<title>Issue 11058 -   chromium -    Text in the address bar changes color while after the '/' character. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.59 (Oficjalna wersja )             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Open Chrome  2. Start entering some text  3. Enter the '/' character and insert some more text      I expect the text to remain black. Imho the text after '/' should only be   colored after a page load not during url/search entry.      The text changes color instantly. Sometimes a space and more characters   will revert the color back to black. This is misleading for users   suggesting that they triggered some functionality.     </pre>
