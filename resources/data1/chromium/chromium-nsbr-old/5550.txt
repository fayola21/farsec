Install the drivers for either laptop or desktop  2. Once done  in the mouse suite go to &quot;Movement&quot; tab and select the scroll   size as Screen   3. Save the changes by saying Apply and OK  4. Navigate to a page where you need more than two scrolls to reach the end   of the page  5. Scroll using the scroll wheel    Issues  -------  * Chrome's scrolling size is less than screen size. This works fine in FF3   and IE7  * The back and forward buttons are not working.
