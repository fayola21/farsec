<title>Issue 4088 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behavior with bookmarking SSL interstitial page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may be related to <a title="SSL interstitial page is auto starred(bookmarked)  if navigated through a bookmarked page."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4086">issue 4086</a>.    1. Ctrl+t to create a new tab and navigate to any SSL interstitial webpage  (Eg: <a href="https://www.sourceforge.net">https://www.sourceforge.net</a>)  2. Bookmark the SSL interstitial page on bookmark bar. (up to here  it is  fine i.e the page is starred.)  3. Close the tab and open another [New Tab]  4. Navigate to the same SSL interstitial webpage.    What is the expected output?   The page should be starred.    What do you see instead?  The page is not starred.    If we decide  not to allow the user to bookmark any SSL interstitial page   then we better disable the star button.   </pre>
