<title>Issue 4065 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager doesn't search on URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4462)    Precondition: have a test page bookmarked in the Bookmark Manager  such as:    Name: Alaska  URL:  <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~mberkowitz/test/search_test.htm">http://www.corp.google.com/~mberkowitz/test/search_test.htm</a>        1. Enter search string  &quot;Alaska&quot;. Search matches this string (the title).   2. Enter search string  &quot;search_test&quot;. No match found on URL or any part of  URL.     What is the expected output?     Should be able to search on Bookmark title.  Should be able to search on URL or substring of URL.    What do you see instead?    Can search on Bookmark title  but not URL.      Firefox &quot;Organize Bookmarks&quot; feature does search on URL. </pre>
