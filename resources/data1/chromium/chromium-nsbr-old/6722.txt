<title>Issue 6722 -   chromium -    UI test SecondLaunch is consistently failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like this started failing with build   <a href="http://hae14.jail.google.com:8010/builders/XP%20Tests%20(dbg)/builds/2560">http://hae14.jail.google.com:8010/builders/XP%20Tests%20(dbg)/builds/2560</a> .   A number of changes went into this build (everyone cc'd on bug landed a   patch in this change)  but stoyan's looks the most relevant.    I can't seem to assign this to stoyan though  will send email. </pre>
