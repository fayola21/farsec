<title>Issue 2835 -   chromium -    &quot;Restart Chrome&quot; messagebox when changing language can be unnecessarily annoying - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1214225&gt;    Last night I clicked the &quot;change chrome language&quot; dropdown in my options  menu.  To close it  I simply picked my current language (US English) again.   To my surprise Chrome popped up a box about restarting Chrome for my  change to take effect.    After closing it  forgetting focus was still on the box  I tried to roll my  mousewheel.  I instantly got another dialog  because the box had changed my  language.  Dismissing this box and ticking my wheel again meant I got  another dialog.  I think by this time I was well and truly aware that I  needed to restart Chrome for the language change to happen.    Suggested fixes:  * Never show a dialog when the language has not actually changed.  * After showing a dialog once in a session  don't show it again for further  changes.  * Consider a &quot;Don't show this again&quot; checkbox on the dialog. </pre>
