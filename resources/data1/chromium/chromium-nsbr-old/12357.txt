<title>Issue 12357 -   chromium -    Need new page cycler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The page cycler  as it exists now  doesn't test all the areas that we want   to verify.  For instance  it won't catch some regressions in gc() because   of its behavior in doing a gc() between loads.  There are many other   regressions that may happen elsewhere  but are hidden by the special   conditions of the original page cyclers.    Ideally  we would create a second type of page cycler  very similar to the   original  that runs a test without special behavior flags for Chrome or V8.    This page cycler would run intentionally Javascript-heavy pages (heavier   than the original page cycler).  The tests used in this new page cycler   should be hermetic and as &quot;real world&quot; as possible.    Once this is created  we should add a graph of its results to the   performance dash at <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html</a>    This page cycler should be run in addition to  but not in place of  the   existing page cyclers.    Assigning to myself  since I have a set of tests that could work for this   that need to be cleaned up. </pre>
