<title>Issue 20257 -   chromium -    The cancel button on the usually accidentally clicked when prematurely letting go of mouse button. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.6 (Official Build 22526)  URLs (if applicable) : Random download link      1. Download a file  2. Try to open the folder containing the file  3. Accidentally let go of the mouse and cancel the download.    The problem:    The problem I encounter quite frequently has to do with the download bar   showing running downloads below the webpage.     Whenever I try to open folder containing the file I'm currently downloading   and  by accident  let go of the mouse button slightly too short I click the   cancel button 9 times out of 10. I've accidentally cancelled loads of   almost-finished downloads this way.     This leads me to believe the cancel button isn't in the optimal position   for usability. </pre>
