<title>Issue 3928 -   chromium -    Restricted  websites list? URLs black list? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i don't know what are your thoughts about such a feature and i would like   to know :)    Programs like SpywareBlaster can update it (like they do for IE/FF) and add dangerous URLs... seems like a necessity to me.    same thing goes for <a title="Add option to white-list domains that are allowed to get/set cookies" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2413"> issue 2413 </a> </pre>
