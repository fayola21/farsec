Click Chrome icon in dock or direct from Applications.      1. Chrome launches and stays open.      1. Chrome icon appears in doc for milliseconds  then closes.  No window opens.    Extra info:  I have tried removing Chrome  emptying trash  reinstalling from fresh .dmg   rebooting  etc.  The last thing I remember doing in a working instance of  the app was tearing off a tab to form a new window.  The new window  appeared without any browser chrome at all.  I quit Chrome from the dock   and it has not reopened ever since. </pre>
