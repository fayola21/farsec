<title>Issue 16192 -   chromium -    summaries at the top of waterfalls doesn't match  use categories instead? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the master waterfall and master.fyi waterfall summaries don't match.  Rather   then keeping the two sets of html in sync  does it make sense to support on   the waterfall pages an url arg of category=modules|chromium|webkit that can   use the categories from the master.cfg files?  That way they are always up to   date with the data within the configs and we don't have to keep updating two   sets as we add/remove bots? </pre>
