<title>Issue 4239 -   chromium -    Cannot interact with flash player when in full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cannot interact with flash player when in full screen mode    0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4871)    This site:  <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=209416">http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=209416</a>    Click the &quot;full screen&quot; button in the lower right hand corner of the flash   player widget.    I should be able to get out of full screen mode by hitting the ESC key  but   it appears to go ignored.  I should also be able to interact with the   controls at the bottom of the full screen mode flash player  but mouse   clicks go ignored.    It seems that something is stealing all of the input events. </pre>
