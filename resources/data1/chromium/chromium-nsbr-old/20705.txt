<title>Issue 20705 -   chromium -    Regression -- tabs do not move into tab list  only spawn as new window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2  OS + version :  Goobuntu (gHardy)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome  URLs (if applicable) : N/A (all that I've tried it with)          1. Open one or more tabs  2. Try to move a tab from its current position        Tab can move within the tab list (or into an existing tab list).        The tab spawns a new chrome browser window immediately.  Attempts to move   this window back into the tab list fail.  Tab does not successfully follow   mouse  either; it seems to drop as soon as I move the mouse from its   current position.     </pre>
