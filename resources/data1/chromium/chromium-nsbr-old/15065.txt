Nothing happens when you press the button to play the video.        What is the expected result?      Video playback or an error message.        What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Press &quot;FILM STARTEN&quot; button. A window pops up.  2. In the popup window  press &quot;Weiter&quot; button. Nothing happens    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  In Firefox  I see a message that tells me that I need some plugin.  In IE I get an error message that a technical problem occurred. Not sure   why it is not working from inside Google  there is lots of TV advertisement   for it so I'd assume it is working for other users.    Please provide any additional information below.     </pre>
