<title>Issue 727 -   chromium -    New window size problem with maximized windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Maximize Window  2. Drag tab to create new window      When working with a maximized window and creating a new window from a   existing tab  it would be better if the tab dragged out of the main window   to the size of an un-maximized window.      Instead  the new window is the same size as the maximized window but not   centered on the screen  so half the window is off the edge of the screen.      </pre>
