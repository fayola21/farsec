<title>Issue 2055 -   chromium -    Page with pdf file fails to re-draw horizontal scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome and go to www.renderx.com/PDF/tests.pdf  2. Click on the + sign to zoom in (until vertical and horizontal scrollbars   appear on page)  3. Launch Chrome's task manager and kill the Acrobat plugin  4. Reload the page  5. Click on the + sign again for a few times to zoom in.    *The key to reproducing the issue is that when you reload the page  the   size should be the same as the former setting in step 2 before the plugin   crash.    What is the expected output?   The horizontal scrollbar on bottom of page does not appear sometimes   (sometimes  immediately after step 4). Just a black section appears. (issue   happening intermittently)    What do you see instead?  The horizontal scrollbar should be seen to be able to scroll through the   page.        </pre>
