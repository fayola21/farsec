<title>Issue 15437 -   chromium -    3.0.190.1 crashes every few minutes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.1    After update to 3.0.190.1  my Chrome crashes every few minutes. I don't   remember any browser session longer than 5 minutes that was uninterrupted by   a crash. It crashes completely (with all tabs and windows).    Is there a way I can find out more what type of crash it is  and may be there   is a bug already about it? </pre>
