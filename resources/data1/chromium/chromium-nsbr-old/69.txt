<title>Issue 69 -   chromium -    So-called &quot;open source web browser&quot; has non-free artwork - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Okay  I think for those who are a bit too trigger-happy about copyright and   all that  I think you do what Firefox does and kinda have a 2nd &quot;open-  source&quot; version of this browser branded as just Chromium with no Google   logos or any reference to it except for the search boxes  and actually   MENTION the BSD license on it.    Firefox has done this  they got some switch for compiling that can   generically brand it as the version's codename... </pre>
