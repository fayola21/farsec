<title>Issue 6180 -   chromium -    Crash on startup when reading Local State - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42  URLs (if applicable) : None  Other browsers tested: N/A              1. Close Chrome  2. Use attached Local State file  3. Startup Chrome      Chrome starts as normal.      Window appears then immediately disappears again.    From my experimentation  if you remove any key from the file the problem   goes away. Perhaps an upper limit on the site of Local State? I didn't try   every key  but removing a key in &quot;protocol_handler&quot;/&quot;excluded_schemes&quot;   fixes it  as does removing &quot;safe_browsing&quot; or &quot;task_manager&quot;.     </pre>
