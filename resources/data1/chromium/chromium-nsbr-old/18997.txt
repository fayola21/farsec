<title>Issue 18997 -   chromium -    Save debugging symbols for plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I made some changes to build/mac/dump_app_syms to allow symbols from   multiple images to be saved for Breakpad and have dSYMs archived.  Right   now  it only supports wrapper bundles.  I will make it work with raw dylibs   too  and add plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib to the list of images whose   symbols get saved. </pre>
