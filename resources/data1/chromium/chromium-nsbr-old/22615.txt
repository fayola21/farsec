<title>Issue 22615 -   chromium -    If a dialog authorization box (e.g. login/password requierered by a corporate proxy) is displayed for one tab  one can't use the enter/return key in an other tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Build officiel 26042)  URLs (if applicable) : None  LAN dependent.  Other browsers tested: Sorry  I didn't do the test as this authorization   box is not displayed by other browsers (it's an an other defect).      1. Browse a site which asks for a login/pwd through HTTP.  2. Open a text document on Google Docs in an other tab.  3. press the return/enter key in the text field.        The enter key inserts a line break in the targeted text field.        Nothing happens. Looks like the keypress event is catched by the dialog box   in the other tab. The strangest thing is that other key works as expected.     </pre>
