<title>Issue 1102 -   chromium -    Google doc launched by shortcut opens documents in other window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. navigate to <a href="http://docs.google.com">http://docs.google.com</a>  2. create shortcut for an application  3. open chrome broser window with any other site  4. select any of the documents in the google docs.        I'm expecting to use Google Documents application without interference with   other windows. And without the need to seek the window where document   happened to open in.        It opens not in an 'application' window  but in the 'regular' chrome   window.      Please provide
