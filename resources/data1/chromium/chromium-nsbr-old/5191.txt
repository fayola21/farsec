<title>Issue 5191 -   chromium -    Add AddedToWidget and RemovedFromWidget functions to View - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> View should have these two functions:    virtual void AddedToWidget() {}  virtual void RemovedFromWidget() {}    These functions will be called by the default ViewHierarchyChanged   implementation whenever a View is added or removed from a View hierachy   that is parented in a widget. This means people won't need to implement   ViewHierarchyChanged so often. </pre>
