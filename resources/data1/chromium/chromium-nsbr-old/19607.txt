<title>Issue 19607 -   chromium -    important_file_writer fails for UNC paths with &quot;could not create temporary file&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (Offizieller Build 23222)      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Run Chrome from a UNC path and close it  2. Observe the timestamp from e.g. &quot;Local State&quot;      The file was updated.      The file wasn't touched  instead a 0 byte temporary file remains (at least   one per start). The debug log contains the following line:    [4084:1436:34767562:WARNING:important_file_writer.cc(73)] failed to write   hostunc$pathtoGoogle ChromeUser DataDefaultPreferences: could not   create temporary file    Note that running the very same Chrome instance with the same command line   from a mapped path (Z:pathtoGoogle Chrome...) works as expected.    The 0 byte temp file is related to <a title="replace file_util::CreateTemporaryFileName with file_util::CreateTemporaryFile"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3078">issue 3078</a> (see comments #3 and #5). </pre>
