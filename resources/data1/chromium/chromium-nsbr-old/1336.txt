<title>Issue 1336 -   chromium -    Scroll in omnibar suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It should be possible to scroll through the suggestions in the omnibar  as   sometimes there aren't enough. Maybe also add a scrollbar on the side.    Also see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=367">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=367</a>   this   feature is mentioned. </pre>
