<title>Issue 10942 -   chromium -    Toolbar button hottracking broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit SHIFT+ALT+T to set keyboard focus to the toolbar.        Toolbar button should have a slight bevel (aka hottracking)  same look as  when hovered over with the mouse. Currently  no effect is shown. This must  be a regression  as it used to work in previous versions.   </pre>
