<title>Issue 5236 -   chromium -    proxy username and password - must reinput on each chrome start - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29  URLs (if applicable) : n/a          Firefox 2-3: OK           IE 5-7: OK      1. Run Chrome  2. Open web page through proxy (input username and apssword)  3. Close Chrome  4. Repeat - you'll have to input name/pass again      Browser should ask &quot;Would you like me to remember name and password?&quot;  ot   show a checkbox with this question. Remembering them silently is acceptable   too. Then  it should ask again only if using saved settings fails.      On start of each &quot;session&quot; user has to input name and password for proxy.   </pre>
