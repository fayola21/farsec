<title>Issue 17735 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data window should have cancel button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 21615)  Linux; but probably affects windows as well      1. go to &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; window      There should be a cancel button      There is a close button. This does not feel right. In GNOME at least    cancel buttons are used for dialogs with instant-apply behavior. In this   case  you open the dialog to do something (clear the browsing data) but   decide not to do it  which means canceling the action.   </pre>
