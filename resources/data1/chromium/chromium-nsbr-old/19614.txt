<title>Issue 19614 -   chromium -    Font picker sample text is too large - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (Official Build 23222)           Safari 4: ?    Firefox 3.x: OK (uses pixels everywhere  does not use native font picker)           IE 7: N/A (does not let the user choose the default font size)           IE 8: N/A (does not let the user choose the default font size)      1. Go to Options/Under the hood/Change fonts and language settings  2. Click one of the &quot;Change&quot; buttons      The &quot;Sample&quot; box should match the font preview area in the &quot;Fonts and Languages&quot; dialog box.      The text in the &quot;Sample&quot; box is too large  as if the size was interpreted in points instead of pixels   (see fonts-chooser.png attached). The font preview areas in the &quot;Fonts and Languages&quot; dialog box (see   fonts-options.png attached) is rendered correctly.      The problem is that the font picker assumes that the font size is in points  while Chrome uses pixels   as font size unit. Personally  I think that font size in points is more familiar to users (most word   processors use points  at least by default)  but I can understand that Chrome prefers using pixels as   default unit.    Nevertheless  the font picker UI is very confusing and should be fixed: not only the &quot;Sample&quot; box   displays the text larger than Chrome will  but the default sizes in the list are meant to be in points   (hence it is difficult to select standard sizes: for instance  11pt = 13px; 11 is in the list  but not   13 making it difficult to select the pixel size corresponding to 11pt).    I can see two solutions to this problem:  - convert the pixel size into points before giving it to the font picker; drawback: the font size   displayed by the font picker does not match numerically the font size displayed in the options dialog   box; it is also confusing for users used to sizes in points  - use points everywhere in the UI: do the above + display the font size in points in the options   dialog box; drawback: it changes the current Chrome convention    Related bug: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7806">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7806</a> </pre>
