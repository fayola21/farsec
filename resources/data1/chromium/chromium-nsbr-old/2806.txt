<title>Issue 2806 -   chromium -    Suggest  servers that return non-UTF-8 JSON are disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  there are 3 suggest services that are disabled because they emit   JSON in a non-UTF-8 encoding. There are other suggest services that are   disabled because they respond in a non-standard format (different from   fxjson). This bug is only about the former issue.     Taken from Google's internal bug : b1293145       </pre>
