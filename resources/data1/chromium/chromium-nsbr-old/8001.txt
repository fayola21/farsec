<title>Issue 8001 -   chromium -    Error -6 when loading url test-shell-resource://inspector/inspector.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : trunk    While trying to find the cause of the crash reported as <a title="Starting inspector from GTK test_shell crashes the shell" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7938"> Issue 7938 </a>  I was  told on #chromium to delete my Hammer/ dir. I did this and rebuilt. The  test-shell runs find but now trying to start the inspector opens a window with:    Error -6 when loading url test-shell-resource://inspector/inspector.html    Looks like the inspector's ressources are not &quot;installed&quot; correctly during  build? </pre>
