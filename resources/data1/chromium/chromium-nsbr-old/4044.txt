<title>Issue 4044 -   chromium -    &quot;Show in folder&quot; of Bookmark manager  should be disabled whereever applicable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Bring up Bookmark manager [Ctrl+shift+b]  2. Right click on any URL in any folder except in Recently Added/Search folder.  2. You notice &quot;Show in folder&quot; option in the interstitial context menu.      I got the meaning of the &quot;Show in Folder&quot;  only after talking to Scott that  this is meaningful only with URLs in Recently Added/Search folder.     So we should disable this option  for the behavior in question.   </pre>
