<title>Issue 5215 -   chromium -    Chrome knocks out Speedtouch ST 510 routers !  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all tested             Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Type the Speedtouch 510 v.4 HTTP interface address in address bar  2. Wait        The router's HTTP server should display its browsable interface  allowing   user to view and modify router settings.      Chrome cannot display the router's welcome page. Instead router's web   server locks up and is thereafter no more accessible  even from another   browser !!! Built-in FTP server becomes blocked  too !!!    The modem/router itself continues to work although its local servers are   stalled. The stalled condition clears out by itself after several minutes.    Comment : this is very strange  Chrome must be generating some very unusual   HTTP requests. Seen only with this model but problem might exist with   others.       </pre>
