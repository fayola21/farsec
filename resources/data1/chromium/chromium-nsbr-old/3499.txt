<title>Issue 3499 -   chromium -    require username/password to load cached http pages which were sent with http-auth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (marked NewHTTP but this applies to winhttp as well)    should probably persist some hash of the identity that was sent with the request in the disk cache   entry.     as things are currently  the page requiring http auth can be cached like a normal page  and doesn't   require the original username/password to be present to access it.    this feature wouldn't really improve security (since disk cache would still be unencrypted)  but it   would prevent glitches when different username/passwords trigger different content.    should investigate what mozilla does. </pre>
