<title>Issue 19965 -   chromium -    common.gypi contains a path that does not use DEPTH - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/build/common.gypi?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/build/common.gypi?</a>  view=markup    contains:            'msvs_cygwin_dirs': ['../third_party/cygwin']     which makes msvs_cygwin_dirs relative to the location of common.gypi in the   build tree. but third_party is a top-level directory  and so this should be   relative to the depth of common.gypi in the build tree.    There are no other relative paths in common.gypi. All other similar entries   use DEPTH.    In my open source project  we pull the chromium build directory in at a   different depth than in the chromium tree. So this causes builds to fail in   my open source project.    This line should be changed to:            'msvs_cygwin_dirs': ['&lt;(DEPTH)/third_party/cygwin']     I will submit a patch to bradnelson shortly that fixes this issue. I'm just   creating this bug entry to track the issue and the fix. </pre>
