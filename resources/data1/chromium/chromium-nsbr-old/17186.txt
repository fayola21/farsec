<title>Issue 17186 -   chromium -    Back page button doesn't always work as expected. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37        1. click the back page button on pages from Huffingtonpost.com  or almost   anywhere on the internet.      I expect that the last page I was on will come up.      Usually I end up at the top of the current page  if I'm already at the top   then it will go to the previous page.       </pre>
