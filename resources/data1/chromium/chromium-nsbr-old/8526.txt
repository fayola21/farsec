<title>Issue 8526 -   chromium -    Glass screwed up when returning from other resolution - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Launch in Aero glass and maximize.  Start an app that runs in another resolution (I used Starcraft)  alt-tab out of that app.  Note the glass is invisible and if you restore   the window the glass area is drawn as all black.    This is almost certainly due to my don't-hide-taskbars fix. </pre>
