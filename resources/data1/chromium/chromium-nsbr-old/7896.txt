<title>Issue 7896 -   chromium -    Should have more report-a-bug options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  the report-a-bug options don't adequately cover the scenario   where the website is actively blocking Chrome because it is not a supported    browser.  The user could use &quot;Other issue&quot; or &quot;Page looks odd&quot;  but this   won't help narrow down the list of incompatible sites.    We should add at least one more option to this drop-down list:  &quot;Website says browser is not supported&quot;  or something like that. </pre>
