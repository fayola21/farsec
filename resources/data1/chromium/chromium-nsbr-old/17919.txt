<title>Issue 17919 -   chromium -    Cookie manager dialog polish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some suggestions from Michael Monreal:    - the clear button should be part of the entry field  using  gtk_entry_set_icon() or something like that. Also helps to associate the  clear action with the entry field.    - the cookie content string is too  it should be ellipsized    - maybe make the dialog a little bit wider?    - the cookie icon (site column) is neat but does it really serve a  purpose? showing the same icon on every line looks strange   </pre>
