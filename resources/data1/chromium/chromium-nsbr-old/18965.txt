<title>Issue 18965 -   chromium -    Control tints not changed immediately to reflect system preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22917)  OS version               : 10.5.  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works (but is broken in other ways)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Open a Chromium window with a scrollbar; notice it's blue/grey when active.  2. Go to System Preferences/Appearance and change from Blue to Graphite (or vice versa).  3. Go back to the Chromium window.      Colour of active scrollbar should immediately reflect current tint.      It doesn't. It doesn't even on reload. It does if you navigate back and forward though. </pre>
