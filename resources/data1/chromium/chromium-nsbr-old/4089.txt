<title>Issue 4089 -   chromium -    All bookmarks on the bar have hover state in perticular use case - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is my long pending bug. So finally got chance to file it :) AND tricky  to reproduce it.   Happens in every where builds.      1. Have 4 or 5 URLs bookmarked on bookmarks bar  2. Ctrl+b to Always show Bookmarks bar to ON  3. Right click on 1st URL on the Bar (Pls don't dismiss the context menu)  4. Right click on 2nd URL (Here the mouse pointer should be positioned such  that its interstitial context menu should overlap with previous context menu).  5. Repeat step 4  for remaining bookmarks on bookmarks bar.    Finally  you end up with all bookmarks having hover state. See the attached  screenshot.    What is the expected output?   Only the active URL should have hover state.    What do you see instead?  All bookmarks have hover state.    I know this is not critical bug.    </pre>
