<title>Issue 2824 -   chromium -    Switch default font from MS Shell Dlg to MS Shell Dlg 2? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1193028&gt; filed by ojan:    I don't think we can do this for the form controls in web pages as it has  compat concerns  but the following MSDN page seems to imply we shouldn't be  using MS Shell Dlg as our font for UI. In fact  it seems to imply that we  can just use Tahoma.    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366904(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366904(VS.85).aspx</a>    And it looks like there are a number of places where we use it currently:  http://gsearch/?gsearch=MS+Shell&amp;file_regexp=&amp;corpus=chrome&amp;gsearch_flags=    I have no idea whether this actually breaks things in Japanese  Chinese  etc.    </pre>
