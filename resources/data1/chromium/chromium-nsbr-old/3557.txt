<title>Issue 3557 -   chromium -    Re-do show command handling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we wire the initial show command of the browser window from   WinMain all the way through to Browser. This clutters up our APIs with   Windows-specific dreck. We can get this information from GetStartupInfo. We   should just do that instead. </pre>
