<title>Issue 311 -   chromium -    Brief strong and blinding white flash when switching between tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open tabs - preferably with dark backgrounds  its more frequent on tabs   you dont switch back and forth too often.  2. Switch between the dark backgrounded tabs - you may notice once a while   there is strong  eye blinding flash of white light for split sec before the   other tab shows up.  3. --      Smooth switch between the graphics of each tab  without blink of unrelated   white color.      The whole screen turns white for like 1/8 a second  causing severe pain in   the eyes.    Please provide
