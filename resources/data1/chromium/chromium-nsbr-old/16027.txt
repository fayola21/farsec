<title>Issue 16027 -   chromium -    Pages not redrawn when closing tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192 (192.0) / Developer Build 19947  URLs (if applicable) : Any  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OK      1. Open some tabs with content  2. Close the tab  3. Sometimes  parts of the previous page will still be on the screen      When a tab is closed  the tab that it switches to should be displayed in full   with nothing left over from the previous page      A &quot;box&quot; of the previous page is left in the corner while the rest of the page   is display outside of it.    You can scroll up and down the page  or mouseover certain content  to   have the page show up or redraw correctly.    In the first screenshot  you can see that only part of the page is displayed.    In the second screenshot  I moved the mouse over some of the issues  and   the page would just redraw with those things.  If I were to scroll the page    it would fully update once the box is scrolled off of the screen. </pre>
