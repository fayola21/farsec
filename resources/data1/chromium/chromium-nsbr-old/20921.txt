<title>Issue 20921 -   chromium -    Add suppression for ThrobberTimer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25238">r25238</a> (<a title="One shared timer for all throbbers" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20907"> bug 20907 </a>) added ThrobberTimer  which is scoped to the app's   lifetime and leaks.  We'll need a Valgrind suppression for it.  I don't know what   the suppression will look like until Valgrind has a chance to look at the new   code. </pre>
