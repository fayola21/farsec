Any site that requires authorization will pop up a window requesting   username/password. Once password is filled automatically it will be there   masked with *.  2. Double click on password field to the right of all stars.   3. Not the whole password field will be selected  but a chain (see attached   picture).     Examples:  if password is abc*123  then three stars for &quot;123&quot; will be selected.  if password is 123%qwert then &quot;qwert&quot; will be selected.    This discovers the password structure and can make a hack easier.        When double clicking to the password field the whole passowrd is selected          A part of password is selected. This discovers the password structure in   some cases      Please provide
