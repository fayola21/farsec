<title>Issue 8841 -   chromium -    right-click should not select the word on windows/linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you right click on text in a focused  editable region (textarea  input   contentEditable node)  we currently select the word. This is wrong on  win/linux. We should just move the caret.    This is somewhat related to <a title="EventSender::contextClick doesn't hit the same codepath as rightclick."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8840">issue 8840</a>. </pre>
