<title>Issue 14576 -   chromium -    Splash page is insulting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  Google Chrome	3.0.189.0 (Official Build 18569)  WebKit	531.0  V8	1.2.8  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)  AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.189.0 Safari/531.0    URLs (if applicable) : about:linux-splash    The linux splash page strongly suggests that your time is more valuable  than my time.  In fact  your time is so valuable that you think each of  your users should read through and understand thousands to millions of bug  reports  instead of you doing that reading.  You want your users to  collectively do millions to trillions of units of work so that you don't  have to do thousands to millions of units of work.    You should change the splash screen to say &quot;we aren't interested in your  feedback; go away; talk to the hand.&quot;   </pre>
