<title>Issue 18865 -   chromium -    Feature Suggestion: A way to Save/Use multiple logins for the same website. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. If i log into gmail and say Yes when Chrome asks to remember the   password. Then later my daughter goes to gmail to check her gmail  it opens   and auto logs into mine. Which I want  but would be nice to have a multiple   login manager that simply notices I have requested to save more than one   login for the same site  then anytime I goto Gmail for instance  it will   popup with a list so the user can select which login to use for that site.          A multiple login manager  When I login to a website with my username and password  and the yellow top   bar in chrome asks to save my password... and I tell Chrome to Save the   password (say gmail)  it should check if I already have a password saved   for that site  and if I do  open a Multiple Login Manager window asking me   to name this password. Then next time I open Gmail  a little windows pops   up listing the 'named' saved passwords. (Id say to not make me name the   first saved password  IE: nothing changes in the users eye on the first   saved password. but on the 2nd  make me name it. and in the list call the   first one [Default] or something.) For instance  I can click Dad  or   Annyssa. and itll log into Gmail respective to the 'Name' I clicked. (allow   me to edit these after the fact also)        I have to sign out of gmail and clear my browsing data (passwords) every   time I close chrome or else when my daughter wants to check her gmail  it   logs into mine and she has to log out and log back in manually.      <b>Please provide
