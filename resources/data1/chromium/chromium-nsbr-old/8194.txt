<title>Issue 8194 -   chromium -    graphics on chromium window (nee chromium chrome) messed up with latest builds. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0 (10605)  however has been affected since   about 3:00 MST yesterday on all builds. 10508 is unaffected  and last known   &quot;working&quot; to the best of my knowledge.      chromium/specific.      1. let the window sit for any amount of time.  2. ???  3. cry.        Chromium's UI stays intact.        the XP &quot;Classic&quot; titlebar is painted accross the top of the window.   Screenshot shows UI mongering. Re-Rendering the window appears to fix for   that render  however it comes back within 10-30 seconds of idle time.    Possibly caused by nVidia drivers  however its not clear as to how. older   builds work fine  however latest builds don't.   </pre>
