<title>Issue 16214 -   chromium -    about:performance - a personal view of chrome performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For most users  Chrome is really fast.  For some  it's slow.  It would be   cool if users could get a better view as to what's slow.    We have a lot of great performance metrics in the browser.    about:histograms is filled with lots of great (but very technical)   information.  We should provide a user-digestible version of this data that   gives a high level overview of how chrome is performing for them.  For   example  it could tell them for each page request  what percentage of the   media time was taken doing what operations:    DNS: 200ms (20%)  Latency: 300ms (30%)  Upload transfer: 100ms (10%)  Download transfer: 300ms (10%)  Page rendering: 70ms (7%)  Javascript execution: 30ms (3%)  Overall: 1000ms (100%)    Further imagine if they could compare their performance against other   Chrome users in some aggregate way (by chrome version  geography  OS  ISP    etc.).  For example  maybe all of my stats are in the 80th percentile   except for DNS which is in the 3rd percentile.  That would allow people to   quickly diagnose what was going on. </pre>
