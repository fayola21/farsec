<title>Issue 20819 -   chromium -    Handle NSS initialization failure gracefully - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  if NSS initialization fails  we hit a  NOTREACHED() assertion failure in debug build.  We  should handle NSS initialization failure gracefully.    If we can't initialize NSS with access to its databases   we should try to initialize NSS without databases  and  pop up an informational dialog to notify the user of the  problem.    If we can't initialize NSS without databases either  we  should make sure our SSL and crypto functions fail  gracefully rather than crashing. </pre>
