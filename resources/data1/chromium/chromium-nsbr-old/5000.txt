<title>Issue 5000 -   chromium -    Chrome hung for ~30seconds  before the OS eventually killed the bad tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi">http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi</a>  Other browsers tested:None            I was unable to reproduce the issue.  Here's what I did  just in case it's at all helpful.    I went to a tab which I hadn't used in ~24 hours  and did a refresh.  (this   tab made a POST request)    I got a message which said something like &quot;this is taking a long time    would you like to continue&quot;  but just as this appeared I had refreshed the   page again  and this time the &quot;Confirm Form Resubmission&quot; dialog appears.    I clicked Resubmit.    At this point the whole chrome browser was hung.  I hoped that I'd still be   able to switch to other tabs  but that didn't work.    After between 30s. to 1min. I got a windows &quot;this application has died   window&quot; and after clicking close the tab which I was viewing dissappeared   and I got the rest of chrome back.        I thought the benefit of tab being in it's own thread was that one thread   could die  while others remained ok.  While I was very happy that eventually the single TAB just went away and   didn't take all 20 other tabs down with it!! I couldn't use my browser for   a minute.       </pre>
