<title>Issue 3261 -   chromium -    Process/Job Priority mismatch causes &quot;Blocking Catch 22&quot; with Flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Most commonly coming out of full screen flash. But also loading flash heavy   pages and other flash cpu intensive tasks.      Even if intense cpu time is required  only for a brief period.      Flash plugin is loaded in the main process with priority &quot;Normal&quot; most tabs   are loaded in &quot;Below Normal&quot;. Flash hits 100% CPU in the main process   waiting for something  but the Tab process is in &quot;Below Normal&quot; so it never   gets the CPU time to &quot;respond&quot; to Flash and make it stop using all the CPU   cycles.      Please provide
