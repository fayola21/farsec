<title>Issue 13747 -   chromium -    Last character in URL is often cut off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17570">r17570</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Gnome  URLs (if applicable) : Numerous  see below  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Loads page normally        1. Try typing in a domain  in the address-bar  ending in co.za  that the   browser hasn't seen before. I've tried &quot;johnny.co.za&quot;  &quot;spiffy.co.za&quot; and   others to the same effect.  2. Press enter      Expected behaviour is to load the correct page -OR- to load google.com with   the URL entered as the search query.      The last character of the domain is cut off  leading you to erroneous   search results.    I can reproduce it every time. Doesn't seem to happen with .com or .co.uk   domains. Haven't tested others but  for now  it seems unique to the co.za   namespace. </pre>
