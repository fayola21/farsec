<title>Issue 15940 -   chromium -    Preferred/default applications properties dialog doesn't work on Ubuntu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As shown in this screenshot  Chromium can be selected as the default   browser in gnome  however  it doesn't work; clicking hyperlinks from other   applications (such as pidgin or the terminal) does not do anything visible   (no new tab or chromium window created).    The fact that it shows &quot;false&quot; in the custom command field can be a hint   that it's not working correctly. In the case of Epiphany  it shows   &quot;epiphany --new-tab %s&quot; instead.
