<title>Issue 22918 -   chromium -    Revisit the red strikethrough for insecure url schemes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Omnibox should draw red bar over &quot;https&quot; for bad certs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22558"> Issue 22558 </a> was the original bug for this.  Per Mike's comment  Cole okayed the simple red   strikethrough for beta  but Windows uses a diagonal strikethrough.  Revisit whether or not we want   to change this. </pre>
