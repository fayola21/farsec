<title>Issue 14715 -   chromium -    SVG symbols not dragable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0~svn20090618r18730  OS + version : Ubuntu Karmic    While working on a webapp using SVG  i found out that it's not possible to  drag (move) some SVG elements  like &lt;symbol&gt;/&lt;use&gt;.    To be sure it was not caused by my own code  I've created a simple test  file (attached) based on a public SVG page written long ago (the JS code is  not mine).    Using the attached test file  test 2 and 3 fail in Chromium.  In Firefox 3.0 &amp; trunk  all 3 tests pass.   </pre>
