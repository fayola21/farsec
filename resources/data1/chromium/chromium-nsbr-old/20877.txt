<title>Issue 20877 -   chromium -    Find on page shows incorrect occurrence number - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : GHardy default  OS + version : GHardy current  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): can't test      1. Open a page  2. Use find on page (Ctrl+F) to find something with multiple matches     The find field shows e.g. &quot;1 of 126&quot;  3. Select some text below several of the matches.  4. Hit F3 to find the next occurrence.     The find field shows e.g. &quot;2 of 126&quot;  even though the actual occurrence     highlighted in the page is not the second.      The find field should show the actual occurrence number e.g. &quot;33 of 126&quot;.      The find field just shows how many times the operation was performed    modulo the total match count.   </pre>
