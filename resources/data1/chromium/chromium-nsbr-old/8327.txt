<title>Issue 8327 -   chromium -    No icon for .exe files in Downloads page  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10796)  URL = <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/download/utility/sleep.exe">http://www.computerhope.com/download/utility/sleep.exe</a>        1. Download an .exe file (can use sample URL above).  2. Open Downloads page.     What is the expected output?     Should have some icon/favicon to display for exe files.    What do you see instead?    Default icon is shown (the icon that is displayed when a graphic is not found).    See attached picture.       </pre>
