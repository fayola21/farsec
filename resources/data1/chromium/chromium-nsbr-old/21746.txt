<title>Issue 21746 -   chromium -    autocheck the text after spellcheck language switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0~svn20090908r25615-0ubuntu1~ucd2  OS + version : Ubuntu Karmic   CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32bit  window manager : Gnome      1. write a text in one language (lets say French)  but with spellchecker in   english (because you forgot to change it to french)  2. change the spell-checker language to French (or the language you wrote   your text)        I expect the spellchecker to highlight only the wrong word.  In fact i wish it would recheck the textfield automaticaly      it highlight ALL words  because he doesn't update the textfield  i need to move the full text (from beginning to end) with the left key so   the spellchecker update the language for the words ... this is really not   needed :(       </pre>
