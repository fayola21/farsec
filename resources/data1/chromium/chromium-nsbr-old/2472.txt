<title>Issue 2472 -   chromium -    Need a clear definition of user-initiated for PopUps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/">http://mlb.mlb.com/</a>  2. On the upper left hand side of the site  there should be some baseball   games with scores.  Click the green baseball diamond here.  Note that this   is an Adobe Flash plugin.        This results in a blocked/constrained popup even though it was initiated by   a user click.  Firefox does not try to block this popup.    Is this working as planned  or can we improve the user experience here? </pre>
