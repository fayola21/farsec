<title>Issue 3325 -   chromium -    Loading freezes when &quot;Back&quot; button menu is opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.154.0  URLs (if applicable) : Anywhere you want           Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Browse several sites so you would have some back button history for the   menu.  2. Before the page finishes loading (it is more obvious when you do it   before the next page even starts to show)  click the back button and hold   the mouse down a little so the menu will appear.      Keep on loading and show results as they load.      Everything freezes until you make the menu disappear.     </pre>
