<title>Issue 720 -   chromium -    Ctrl-click doesn't work in &quot;Bookmarks&quot; bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Possibly not a bug  rather a feature request.    Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A    If you ctrl-click a link inside the browser  it opens in a new tab. It   would be awesome if this also happened to bookmarks and bookmarks-folders   in the bookmarks-bar. </pre>
