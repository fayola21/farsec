<title>Issue 18897 -   chromium -    Sanity Check required on paste - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have very long text string on the clipboard (I had 30 million chars)  2. put focus in address bar  3. press Ctrl+V      Chrome should either ignore the paste  limit the length of the pasted   string to something reasonable  or show an error.      Chrome tries to paste the data  consuming a gigabyte of memory and taking   30 mins.  This freezes the chrome UI and makes the system unusable (due to   paging).    Also  this URL appears to be saved into the history database  so even after   restarting Chrome it tries to re-load the string  so Chrome becomes   unusable until the profile is deleted.      <b>Please provide
