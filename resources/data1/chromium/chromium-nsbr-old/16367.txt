<title>Issue 16367 -   chromium -    some http requests take many seconds or minutes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have really good steps for this  but I want to get down what I was   seeing for the last two days on the hopes that folks who know the code   will get some ideas.    This might be valid for all oses  but I saw it on Mac so marking it as such.    Verizon has had nationwide issues the last two days for some of it's Fios   customers.  The issues have been 70+% packet loss but I think also some   DNS issues also.  From an experience pov  the result is some web pages   never load  some partially load  and some get lucky and work.    In Safari 4.0.1  I tended to see partial pages  with complete failures second   most common.    In Chrome  I just about only see the tab stuck on the reverse throbber (dns?  ) and it never really goes on from there.    If I close a tab that completely failed to load in Safari  then closing the tab   and opening a new to the same url usually would get me the partial page   or the full page.    But in Chrome  if I had something stuck  closing the tab and trying again   resulted in the same thing every time.  If I gave up was willing to dump all   my tabs  a quit and relaunch would almost always then let the page load.    So it's like something about our dns state was staying stuck  hosting all   urls to that host.   </pre>
