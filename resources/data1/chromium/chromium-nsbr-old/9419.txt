<title>Issue 9419 -   chromium -    Creating a new tab doesn't focus location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. create a new tab  2. start typing the url you want to go to    Expected:    - focus should be in the location bar and new text goes there    Actual:    - Beeps because nothing has focus.    I'm a little surprised the cross-platform code doesn't have a call already to set the focus. Maybe   something is stealing it afterwards. </pre>
