Complete the first page  then the second.      Advance to the third page.      The first page is displayed  then if you go through the the first two pages  the third   page is then displayed  but after that it is the first page again. So it is   1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4... instead of 1 2 3 4     It works fine with FF. Vista 64  Classic theme.    </pre>
