<title>Issue 20027 -   chromium -    Stop button keeps yellow https background too long - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.203.0 (Developer Build 24077)  OS + version : Linux      1. Login to google (or any other SSL page I guess)    While running on https  the location entry background turns yellow. After   redirecting to http  the entry turns white again  but the stop button keeps   the yellow background for a few more seconds. </pre>
