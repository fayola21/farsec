<title>Issue 9229 -   chromium -    Gmail: Crash in form control code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you sign into Gmail and surf around a little  you will get a sad tab.  Stack attached as a separate file  but it's certainly the checkbox drawing  code in RenderThemeChromiumMac. Commenting out line 711 of that file makes  Gmail *much* happier  even usuable for dogfood.    In addition  with the checkbox code in there  you get all sorts of drawing  cruft (diagonal lines of garbage). Again turned off line 711 makes that go  away.    I'm not sure what's wrong  things look ok in the debugger. Assigning to  someone more familiar with that area of code. </pre>
