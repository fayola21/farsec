<title>Issue 6811 -   chromium -    Need better OnDemand Update error message when computer set to disallow updates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported internally &lt;b/1444525&gt; by David Dorwin:    I have Group Policy on my computer set to disallow updates. This causes   Google Update to report error 0x80040813 when Chrome requests an OnDemand   update from its About dialog. The text in the About dialog is &quot;Update   server not available (error: 7)&quot;. This is misleading because the problem   has nothing to do with the update server. For this particular error  it may   be worth having specific text for &quot;updates are forbidden by your   administrator&quot;. In general  though  it would be nice if the error was   something like &quot;Update check failed&quot; for unknown errors.    The same error is displayed when the network is disabled. The &quot;update   server not available&quot; text seems incorrect in this case too because the   problem is actually with the network connection and not the server. Maybe   &quot;Unable to connect to update server&quot; would be more accurate.    The use of error 7 as the default error doesn't seem correct based on the   help provided for error 7 in that article. It says the download succeeded   and assumes that the problem is with the Chrome installer. Based on the   description of error #7  it should probably only be returned when Google   Update reports GOOPDATEINSTALL_E_INSTALLER_FAILED (0x80040902). Google   Update returns this error when it has launched the installer is run but   fails (non-zero exit code or error reported by the Installer Result API).    Today  error 7 will be reported during the update check (before the user   attempts to update) in most cases. There should be a different error number   and article description for errors other than 0x80040902.    It might be worth creating a new error # for the Group Policy blocking   error (0x80040813) and adding it to this article. This will avoid the user   creating and sending a log or debugging network issues when there is   nothing they can do.    Mark Larson replied:    Yes  let's do this.    It looks from the existing errors (1 3 7) that we'll be adding error 15? :)    Once we decide what number  to use  we just need to add some content to the   help center article. It's ok if the help center provides the data before   our changes are deployed.    Finnur's a little busy with some priority fixes for 1.0. I don't think 'GP   blocked my update' is common enough to interrupt that work  but someone   with hard data can correct me.   </pre>
