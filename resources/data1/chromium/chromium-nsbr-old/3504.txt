<title>Issue 3504 -   chromium -    Top of window clipped when maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Maximizing the window causes the top of the window to be slightly clipped.    This is most evident on the Minimize/Restore/Close buttons.    I'm using <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=3464">r3464</a>  but I see this in builds after <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=3385">r3385</a> (when magic browzr   was re-enabled). </pre>
