<title>Issue 17511 -   chromium -    Backward error too dark with new toolbar look - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Surf a bit  2. Hit back button  so that forward button is no longer disabled        For- and backward buttons should have the same shade of gray.        The back button is considerably darker. Seeing this contrast with the   forward button makes the forward button and the other toolbar buttons   (which to me have the same gray as the forward button) appear disabled.    ps: Apart from that  the new toolbar/titlebar look is really  really nice :-) </pre>
