<title>Issue 16511 -   chromium -    we need a CPP symbol for the GYP buildtype - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have CPP symbols for the two types of branding (GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD   and CHROMIUM_BUILD) from src/build/common.gypi  but the variable   'buildtype' isn't mapped to any cpp symbol  so code checks for the branding   instead of the official flag (or both).  We should add a symbol for that.    In <a href="http://crbug.com/149472">http://crbug.com/149472</a>  I tried using OFFICIAL_BUILD as a cpp symbol    since a bunch of scripts already use it as an environment variable  but there   are some other places that also try to define it.  My initial attempts to clean it   up resulted in pulling on too many connects.  We should revisit all the   environment variables from the older windows build scripts to get this just a   few consistent names.   </pre>
