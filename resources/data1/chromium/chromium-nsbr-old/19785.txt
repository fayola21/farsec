Use a computer with two monitors.  2. Maximize Chrome on the left screen.  3. Move the window to the right screen using the gesture: click on the   title bar and move with mouse to the top of the right screen.  Maximized   window should &quot;dock&quot; to the top of the right screen.        1. I end up with the same maximized window that I had on the left  now on   the right.        1. Chrome window maximizes on the new screen  but Chrome incorrectly enters   the full-screen mode (my tabs disappear  etc.).  Reproducible 100% of the   time. </pre>
