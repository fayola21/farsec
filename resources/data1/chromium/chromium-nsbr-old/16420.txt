<title>Issue 16420 -   chromium -    Crash - incognito new tab silently vanishes by quickly omnibox input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1 (Official Build 20012)      1. Open a new incognito window  2. Press Ctrl+T to open a new tab on the incognito window  3. Type quickly any letter to omnibox and press return key before      &quot;You've gone incognito. Pages you view...&quot; message is displayed.      Something should open on the new tab.       The new tab vanishes immediately and silently. No error dialog opens.     This frequently occurred on my poor Windows XP box (Celeron 2GHz).  But something opens rarely. </pre>
