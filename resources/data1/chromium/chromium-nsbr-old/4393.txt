<title>Issue 4393 -   chromium -    Any change in creating application shortcuts ?. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.18 (Official build)    Is there any design change  while creating application shortcuts ?    In Google Gears dialog  If I don't select any location to create shortcut   and press OK button on the dialog  still it creates the shortcut on Desktop.      Behavior with 0.2.149.30 (Official build)  If user doesn't select any location on Google Gears dialog  then OK button  is not enabled. That said  user can't create application shortcut at all.       </pre>
