<title>Issue 7644 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: &quot;Save page as...&quot; saves web page in wrong folder and wrong filename - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.163.0 (Developer Build 9655)  OS: Win XP  Vista    This appears to be a regression of a bug described in <a title="REGRESSION: Save webpage as Web Page  Complete destroys user-inputted filename" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6105"> issue 6105 </a>. It  appeared to be working as of Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9503">r9503</a>.        1. On a web page  select &quot;Save page as...&quot; from Page menu.   2. Hit &quot;Save&quot; button.    What is the expected output?     Web page should be saved with the name you assigned to it  in the folder  you selected. In addition  if you selected &quot;Web Page Complete&quot;  it should  be saved with all the dependent files/images.    What do you see instead?    On download shelf  you will see the filename displayed as &quot;.htm&quot;  no matter  what filename you used.      If you selected &quot;Web Page  Complete&quot;  the dependent files are not saved.    The file is saved to the Chromium home directory  as follows:    XP:  ---  file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/&lt;username&gt;/Local%20Settings/Application%20Data/Chromium/Application/2.0.163.0/.htm    Vista:  ------  file:///C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AppData/Local/Chromium/Application/2.0.163.0/.htm   </pre>
