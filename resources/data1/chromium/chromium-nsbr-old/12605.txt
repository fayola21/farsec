<title>Issue 12605 -   chromium -    Missing timer for Downloads tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28  URLs (if applicable) : whatever you like to download  Other browsers tested: Chrome-only issue      1. Start downloading what you want.  2. Take a look at the bottom bar. It will show file's name  KB downloaded   and total file size  and how much time it is left.  3. Take a look at the Downloads bar.      To see the very same information  plus the download speed. (like Chrome   1.x)      Putting aside the style of the page (it's ugly  and it was much nicer in   1.x) there's no timer anywhere.   </pre>
