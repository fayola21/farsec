<title>Issue 487 -   chromium -    No option to import bookmarks from Opera - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27        1. Can't - because there's no option.  Come on guys!  I know Opera isn't   the most popular browser but it does have a large fanbase.      To have my Opera bookmarks installed.      Nothing  because it doesn't have the option.  Yes - I know I could import   from Opera into Firefox and then from Firefox to Chrome - but don't like   that hack.   </pre>
