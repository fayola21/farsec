Go to docs.google.com  2. Click on the offline link and enable offline mode  3. Once the sync'ing is done  disable network connection  4. Reload docs (now docs should be running in offline mode)  5. Enable network connection  6. Reload docs    What is the expected output?   Docs should go online(Green tick mark should be seen)    What do you see instead?  Docs is still in offline mode(Gray icon will be seen)    Docs Build: @explorer/20090714-36-p1-RC11:@=11961553  Chromium 3.0.201.0 (Developer Build 23025)    This works fine with Google Chrome 2.0.172.39 </pre>
