<title>Issue 10808 -   chromium -    Regression: &quot;did you mean&quot; info bar no longer appears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> One way to test is by typing &quot;c&quot; into the omnibox. Regression testing has  narrowed this down to somewhere between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14053">r14053</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14056">r14056</a>  and I'm guessing  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14053">r14053</a> is to blame. This affects linux as well as windows (presumably mac  as well  but I don't think they have infobars yet anyway). </pre>
