<title>Issue 14205 -   chromium -    Highlighting of text in label.cc is incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Within the function Label::Paint()  we check to see if hightlighting is   enabled and then call canvas-&gt;DrawStringInt() to render the hightlight string   text. This call is incorrect for a multi-line label and produces an incorrect   highlight.     To fix  we should add 'flags' as the last param in the call to canvas-  &gt;DrawStringInt() (just as it's done for the regular call to render the text). </pre>
