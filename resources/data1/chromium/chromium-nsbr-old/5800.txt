<title>Issue 5800 -   chromium -    Chromium: SSL navigation busted on multiple retries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk: 1.0.155.0 (Developer Build 7359)      1. Navigate to any webpage (google home page is fine)  2. Navigate to any SSL error page (<a href="https://www.sourceforge.net">https://www.sourceforge.net</a>)  3. Click on &quot;Back to safety&quot; button on interstitial SSL error page.  4. Again repeat step2 (in the same tab)    What is the expected output?   User should be navigated to SSL error page.    What do you see instead?  The URL in the address bar changes to SSL  but the SSL error page is not  loaded and the throbber keeps on spinning and never ends.    PS: Works fine in latest Dev channel. </pre>
