<title>Issue 18184 -   chromium -    Add more spellcheck tests with languages other than en-US - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're about to land a CL to upgrade Hunspell to the latest. To make a upgrade   smoother next time (among other reasons)  we'd better add spellcheck tests   for languages other than en-US (they won't guarantee that no new problem is   introduced  but at least they can be a sanity check).      </pre>
