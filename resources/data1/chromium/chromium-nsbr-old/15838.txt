<title>Issue 15838 -   chromium -    Broken website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Opening email program on website  either SquirrelMail or Horde.        What is the expected result? Opening of email program with established   layout and ability to send email (receive and read seem unaffected).    What happens instead? Layout &quot;skewed&quot; with misaligned buttons for items   such as &quot;Send &quot; separate sidebar with links to various folders often messed   up with &quot;Inbox&quot; not showing (SquirrelMail). SquirrelMail version is:   1.4.13  HOrde version: Unknown    With Horde client (website has 3 client choices  SquirrelMail most often   used  Horde 2nd and the 3rd - Round Cube - never used) - first option   screen messes up language choice. Just now  because SquirrelMail would not   allow a message to be sent  I had to try Horde  and first option became   Arabic - only  no log in button; refresh brought up Hungarian and Arabic -   still no log in button  and required 3rd refresh to obtain English option   box along with Log In button.    Once open in Horde  inability to send.    Had to open Firefox to access webmail and send email.    <b>Please provide
