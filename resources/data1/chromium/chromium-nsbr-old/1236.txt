<title>Issue 1236 -   chromium -    Crash when keyboard is switched to secondary layout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Define another input language in the OS and assign a key sequence for  switching between the languages.  2. Start the browser.  3. Switch the keyboard layout to input language defined in step 1.      Should be able to type in the alternative input language in both address  bar and input text fields on the current web page.      The browser immediately unloads.    Switching languages in the language bar using the mouse works fine - the  browser does not crash and accepts input in whatever the current language.  Also  once the secondary language is selected via the mouse  it is possible  to switch back to the default input language using the key sequence. But   again  switching to the alternative keyboard layout kills the browser. </pre>
