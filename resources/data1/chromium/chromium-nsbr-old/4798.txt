<title>Issue 4798 -   chromium -    Restoring focus on page doesn't always work with tip of tree - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This doesn't happen consistently  it's usually something like:      1. Click on gmail page so that it has focus and keybindings work.  2. Create a new tab  type in some url  click on page  3. Close tab.  4. You should now be back at the gmail tab and focus should be on the page    try using keyboard accelerators. They don't always work.             </pre>
