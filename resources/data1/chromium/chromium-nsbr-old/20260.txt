<title>Issue 20260 -   chromium -    REGERSSION: Videos don't start automatically in nana10.co.il site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> might be a regression from the fix for <a title="Chrome doesn't support WMP's player.controls.playItem" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15991"> issue 15991 </a> (only a guess though)    using 4.0.204.0 (24269) when i try to play any of the videos in this page:  <a href="http://www.nana10.co.il/Section/?SectionID=10847&amp;sid=235">http://www.nana10.co.il/Section/?SectionID=10847&amp;sid=235</a>  (just click one of the thumbnails) the video starts playing and immediately   stops    a click on the play button is then needed.    this happens for all videos on the site    it's a regression at least compared to 4.0.202.0 (Official Build 23673)    with all other browsers  the video starts playing automatically </pre>
