<title>Issue 3149 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: LayoutTests/fast/loader/xmlhttprequest-missing-file-exception.html is failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: LayoutTests/fast/loader/xmlhttprequest-missing-file-exception.html is failing    This is post merge fallout.    I took a look at this test  and it appears that the failure is &quot;caused&quot; by the fact that our   implementation of ResourceHandle::loadResourceSynchronously does not set any fields of the   ResourceResponse out parameter when there is a load error.    XMLHttpRequest does a same origin check of the ResourceResponse::url() field after the call   to loadResourceSynchronously.  Because that field is empty for us  we fail the check.  As a   result  XMLHttpRequest's m_state never gets advanced beyond the UNSENT value (readyState ==   0).    I'm not sure what the correct behavior of loadResourceSynchronously should be since the   ResourceHandle method is undocumented. </pre>
