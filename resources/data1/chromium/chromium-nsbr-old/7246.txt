<title>Issue 7246 -   chromium -    Save As for unregistered extension should not set filter to All Files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User reports:    i am using 2.0.159.0  i went to   <a href="http://perso.load-serv.fr/torrent/films/">http://perso.load-serv.fr/torrent/films/</a>  right clicked one of the torent flies and clicked save link as changed the   file name from &quot;AAAAA.torrent&quot; to BBBBB and it was saved as BBBBB with no   extension thats beacuse &quot;save as type&quot; is set to all files in IE &quot;save as   type&quot; is set to torrent so even if i type BBBB it is saved as BBBB.torrent   and you can change it to all files if you want it in some other extension          We should set the default filter to *.torrent  which is what IE does  I   believe. </pre>
