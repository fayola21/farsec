<title>Issue 17425 -   chromium -    update gyp files to generate locale packs for all the locales we support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  chrome.gyp (and webkit.gyp) generate pack files for only 4  locales (en-US  da  he  zh-TW).     I can think of a couple of 'not-so-gyppy' ways of generating pack files for  all locales we support (1. hard-coding them all. ick ... 2. calling an  external script)  but there should be a better way.       My search didn't find any bug filed on this (other than the comments in  chrome.gyp)  but if I missed one  please dupe this away.     </pre>
