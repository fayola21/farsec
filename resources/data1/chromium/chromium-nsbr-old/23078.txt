<title>Issue 23078 -   chromium -    Remove &quot;Remove Item&quot; from download item context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The shelf now removes all completed and cancelled items on close  so   &quot;Remove Item&quot; is no longer necessary in the context menu. Also  it has been   confusing to some users because it removes from both the shelf and the   download manager.    We should remove the &quot;Remove item&quot; context menu item. I talked with the UI   team  they are fine with that.    I will do the linux and os x parts  mhm will do the windows part. </pre>
