<title>Issue 15952 -   chromium -    Custom frame min/max/close designed after Windows Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.192.0~svn20090703r19907-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version: Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager: Nautilus    I'm not sure if this is something that warrants fixing  but the   minimize/maximize/close buttons in the custom frame were very obviously   modeled on the buttons in Vista's Aero theme  and do not visually fit in   with either Gnome or KDE. I know that the custom frame is optional  and that   it would be impossible to appease everyone on this point  and I'm not sure   if themes can fix this  but I thought I would at least put it up to   discussion. </pre>
