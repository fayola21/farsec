<title>Issue 6626 -   chromium -    Cache files are subject to massive fragmentation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43        1. Cache files grow incrementally in small amounts  thus  the filesystem is   more than likely going to place small fragments of the file all over the   filesystem.  Since there are so many cache files  the badly fragmented   nature of them could cause slower startup performance.        Chrome's cache files could grow in increments of a nominal amount (32  64    or 128K) to reduce the effect of fragmentation during cache expansion. </pre>
