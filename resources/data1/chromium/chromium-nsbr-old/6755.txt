<title>Issue 6755 -   chromium -    Add back/forward performance test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should set up some automated performance tests that exercise   back/forward.  When run over HTTP  this will allow us to test our cache.    One idea is to use our current page-cycler framework.  But rather than   running straight through the pages in order  we insert extra back/forward   steps (e.g. 1 step forward  2 steps back  2 steps forward  rinse  repeat). </pre>
