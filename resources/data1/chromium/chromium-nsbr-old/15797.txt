<title>Issue 15797 -   chromium -    Plugin layout tests shouldn't depend on QuickTime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some layout tests depend on QuickTime.  These tests will never pass on Linux until they're changed.    I haven't filed this as a bug upstream because I need to analyze how much   they're actually dependent on QuickTime and how much of it is accidental.    It seems they're looking for particular attributes on the plugin  so maybe   we're doomed.
