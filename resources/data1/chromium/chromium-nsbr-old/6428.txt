<title>Issue 6428 -   chromium -    [REGRESSION] background border image is missing or not aligned problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I found this regression when I was working on a reduction. The issue http://b/issue?id=913066 is happening again now in build 2.0.156.1    The problem happens specifically when you trigger tiling on the background   image  see following case:    <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~ericroman/webkit/tiling/">http://www.corp.google.com/~ericroman/webkit/tiling/</a>        What we should see  is a series of vertical lines  64px tall.        Instead  the bottom 32px begins to drift as you move left-to-right  as this   region is drawn using tiling shader.    Please provide
