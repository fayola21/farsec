<title>Issue 22101 -   chromium -    Rendering Problem (broken HTML) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)  URLs (if applicable) : All over GameKrib.com           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Re-vising a page on GameKrib.com (without refresh button or F5)        Normal page        Rendering breaks HTML causing it to show on screen. (see screen shots)      This problem started directly after update to 3.0.195.21. Tested on 3   different computers  same problem. Cannot reproduce problem in any version   of IE or FF. I am the developer for the site. Best way to describe it is   that Chrome somehow breaks the HTML causing parts of it to show on screen.   Usually the problem is happening around line 330-340 in the source (view-  source:)  however it is never broken using Chromes view-source. F5 or   refresh always renders the page correctly (without the broken code). Best   way to reproduce is to go to GameKrib.com and click Home several times.   Very frustrating cannot figure out the problem. Thank you. </pre>
