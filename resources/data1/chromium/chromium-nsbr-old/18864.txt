<title>Issue 18864 -   chromium -    Windows 7 Jumplist Items do not open when clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Using Windows 7 Jumplists doesn't work.  2. I love the idea of how its now arranged  Most Visited  Most Recent    etc.. But when I click an item in the jumplist  it closes and nothing   happens.   3. I have tried this with Chrome running  and closed.      When I click an item in the jumplist  chrome should open (if not already)   and goto that page.      I Open the jumplist by left click and drag up  the new jumplist shows up. I    pinned an item  and tried clicking it. The jumplist closed but the Site I   clicked did not open. I tried sites pinned  unpinned. I also tried sites in   the Most Recent  Most visited. None seem to work for me. I also tried   clicking them when chrome was alrwady running  and by closing chrome and   trying it. either way nothing happens. I am on windows 7 rtm build 7600    Core 2 Duo 2.33 ghz  4 gb ram  18 in total using 4 flash drives with   Windows ReadyBoost  and ample storage. little over a TB.    <b>Please provide
