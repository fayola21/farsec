<title>Issue 9194 -   chromium -    WatchdogTest.AlarmTest hangs for five minutes  then is killed? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> base/watchdog.cc contains the statement   if (last_alarm_delay &gt; TimeDelta::FromMilliseconds(2)) {    This doesn't work properly under valgrind;   last_alarm_delay is often around ten ms there.  The result is that the test hangs for five minutes and then  fails.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/42147">http://codereview.chromium.org/42147</a> and  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/42266">http://codereview.chromium.org/42266</a>  were attempts to fix this.  The first was not accepted by  the author  the second didn't actually fix it.    I'm planning on disabling this test for now under valgrind   since the watchdog code is only used for debugging anyway. </pre>
