<title>Issue 22242 -   chromium -    Repeated entry of proxy info - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Update to new version with proxy fix (Issue: 12992)  2. Start browser and input proxy info when asked  3. No further proxy pop-ups while in the same session  4. Shut browser and restart  5. Chrome asks for proxy input again      user/pass input should not be asked for every new session.      Before this update  although the proxy info popped up in the same session    the password was stored and didnt need to be entered again. While this   update solves the issue of the pop up for every web page  it asks to re-  enter user/pass for every new session.    <b>Please provide
