<title>Issue 20689 -   chromium -    Should be able to prepopulate NTP with useful content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Install Chrome  don't import anything  2.  New tab page is blank  with no preset thumbnails      Understandably  this is the current intended behavior -- the new tab page   will populate over time as the user visits sites.  However  this means for   the first X minutes/hours of using Chrome  the NTP has zero value for the   user (possibly a negative effect.)      We should be able to offer something more useful to the user here  via   prepopulated links or otherwise.   </pre>
