<title>Issue 12494 -   chromium -    Shortcut keys for Script Debugger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1      1. Open Inspector Ctrl+Shift-J  2. Go to Scripts        The Pause and 3 step buttons should have shortcut keys assigned to them   (preferably same as Firebug's keys  F8  F10  F11 etc)      I have to use my mouse to step through the code. That slows me down. </pre>
