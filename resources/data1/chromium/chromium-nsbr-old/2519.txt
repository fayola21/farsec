<title>Issue 2519 -   chromium -    Accelerator override not sent on startup with Magic BrowzR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Open a trunk build in a debugger and set a breakpoint on   AutocompleteEditView::OverrideAccelerator().  * Start Chromium.  Don't click anything; the omnibox should have focus.    Type something  then hit esc.  Note that breakpoint is not hit.  * Click in the page  then back in the omnibox.  Type some more  and hit   esc.  Note that the breakpoint gets hit.  * Repeat entire process with --use-old-frames and note that the breakpoint   is hit both times.    This prevents users from cancelling their typing with esc until the focus   has changed at least once. </pre>
