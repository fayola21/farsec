<title>Issue 10948 -   chromium -    Find bar should hang over page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the find bar on Linux is a bar across the whole page.  On Windows   it is a narrow widget that hangs down off the toolbar.  We should match that.    The tricky part will be positioning and clipping the bar appropriately -- its   parent should probably be made into a GtkFixed  and it'll probably also use   slide_animator_gtk.h to do the animation. </pre>
