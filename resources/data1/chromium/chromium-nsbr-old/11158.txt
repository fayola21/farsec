<title>Issue 11158 -   chromium -    Aditya K Sood: document.write/throw exception OOM causes NULL ptr DoS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Proof of Concept:  <a href="http://www.secniche.org/gthr">http://www.secniche.org/gthr</a>    Quote: &quot;Google Chrome 1.0.154.59 &quot;throw exception&quot; Memory Corruption   Vulnerability Executing NOP Sled and Shellcode to create an Exception with   Script Tags&quot;    My quick analysis:  It's a NULL pointer DoS. The code uses document.write(...) to add sript   tags to the page that each throw an exception. At some point v8 runs low on   memory  an exception isn't properly thrown/caught and some pointer that was   initialized to NULL doesn't get set. This pointer is then used to read a   value  causing a NULL ptr read  which does crash the renderer.    I have no idea why Aditya is &quot;throwing&quot; a string containing shellcode as an   exception - it makes no sense because any exception should do the trick.   The only reason he probably put shellcode in the string is so the media   will think it's an EoP exploit  rather than a DoS.     </pre>
