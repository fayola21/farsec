<title>Issue 3768 -   chromium -    Searching for separate words in Ctrl+F bar  the google toolbar behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I wish there was a way to search for separate words in the Ctrl+F bar.    If i type  word1 ; word2 ; word3  or maybe... word1 OR word2 OR word3    Chrome should understand it as separate words so it will highlight the   three words (in 3 colors) without the need of all of them to appear or   appear in that order or next to each other...the arrows should just take me   to the next found word in the page  no matter if it's word1/2/3    Instead of assuming the user means &quot;word1 word2 word3&quot;  allow him to search   for all three words separately and even a combination of words and expressions as in: &quot;word1 word 2&quot; OR word 3    basically  what i am looking for is just like the good old google toolbar   way of in-page searching.  If there was a way to click a word as a &quot;find next&quot; button for that   specific word search it can be even better.  In the new Google toolbar where the words don't show anymore on the toobar   but in a submenu instead it's just a waste of clicks... i might be exaggerating here but the Ctrl+F bar can expand and allow for the words to   show on it in a clickable form  just like in the old Google toolbar (and   not the annoying submenu the new Google toolbar offers)...    what do you think? </pre>
