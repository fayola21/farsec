<title>Issue 1285 -   chromium -    Video Playback - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Watching *streaming* any video file    *possible fix: video buffer to fix starting a video  then lagging the video   out. Watched several shows  if u pause  and let the movie fully buffer    wasnt too much lag  but often would get a crash of the &quot;shockwave&quot; or like   plugin crashing.    Not sure if that helps  or if thats browser side. But  i think if video   streaming caught up on this browser  it would surpass as it is the fastest   at loading pages that ive noticed and seen to date.                Please provide
