<title>Issue 1080 -   chromium -    Youtube Flash Installation Problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tried many times to watch Youtube Videos  but  every time I did so it was written  that either Flash is not uptodate or   javascript disabled.  I followed the installation link and installed Flash (which was already   uptodate and working with Ms Internet-Explorer)  but I could not watch the   Youtube Videos.    It was only until I went to Google-Videos and installed Flash once again    that Youtube worked for me.    So why can't I install flash from Youtube itself? Missing Plugin was not   shown in Chrome as was shown in Google. </pre>
