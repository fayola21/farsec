<title>Issue 22733 -   chromium -    Offline Chrome Frame Installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please provide an offline installer for Google Chrome Frame.  Many organizations that restrict browser installations other than IE would  probably prevent downloading Chrome Frame too  so the users would need an  offline installer of it.  In order to test Chrome Frame in such organizations  an offline installer  would be required before a beta is released. </pre>
