<title>Issue 7325 -   chromium -    Block Oriya Chrome in Windows XP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have strings translated to Oriya  but Windows XP does not come with a   font for Oriya (even with complex script support enabled). Even when a 3rd   party Oriya font is installed   MFC/ATL apis we use in Chrome's UI do not   utilize it 'automagically' (especially  troublesome is RichTextEdit   control. [1]). As a result  when Chrome is run with '--lang=or'  we'll have   a bunch of empty boxes all over the place where Oriya strings should be.    There might be some tricks we can try  but until we figure out a reliable   way to support Oriya on Windows XP  we'd better block it on Win XP.
