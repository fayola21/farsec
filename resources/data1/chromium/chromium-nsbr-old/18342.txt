<title>Issue 18342 -   chromium -    Many file:/// URLs are downloaded instead of displayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome tries to download pretty much every file:/// URL you throw at it  including   READMEs like   file:///usr/share/doc/acl/README    It seems we somewhere have a hardcoded list of file extensions that we auto-assign   mime types to  so   foo.html  foo.htm =&gt; displayed as html   foo.ht  foo.h =&gt; downloaded    In the limit  I want Chrome to just display any text-like thing it can.    One proposal is that we should always sniffing &quot;safe&quot; types (that is  text/plain but   never html) from file:/// URLs.  Or just using text/plain always when we don't know   the mime type?  For the particular case of file:/// URLs  downloading is a sort of   strange behavior.    However  we probably *don't* want to display the file contents when it's a &quot;known&quot;   extension like zip. </pre>
