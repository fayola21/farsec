<title>Issue 20591 -   chromium -    Crash on startup unless run from strace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2      1. Install Chrome by unpacking amd64 deb package to root manually and  symlinking library files on my system (64bit PLD-Linux TH) that don't match  debians system.  2. Try to run executable from /usr/bin/google-chrome    Startup produces this error:    caleb@lemur:/$ /usr/bin/google-chrome   [6891:6903:4854673658:FATAL:/usr/local/google/home/chrome-eng/b.64/slave/chrome-official-linux-64/build/src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/async_resource_handler.cc(145)]  Check failed: read_buffer_-&gt;data().   zsh: trace trap  /usr/bin/google-chrome    Interestingly  i tried to strace for the problem  and when straced the  program starts up!    caleb@lemur:/$ strace -f /usr/bin/google-chrome 2&gt; /dev/null    I get a browser window. URL's will not load  but the basic interface is  functional and I can open dbx'es etc. Eventually it says the new tab window  is not responding.    I would be happy to provide more information but am not really sure what to  provide that is relevant here. </pre>
