<title>Issue 12195 -   chromium -    Allow GTK themes to override font sizes and colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should allow fixed font sizes to be overridden by .gtkrc.    We disabled a few font sizes in <a title="Override font sizes for UI elements where size matters" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11128"> issue 11128 </a>.  These are the ones that we   should provide overrides for. </pre>
