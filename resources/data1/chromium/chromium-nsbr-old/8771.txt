<title>Issue 8771 -   chromium -    NTLM authentication to Squid proxy fails for HTTPS sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After I checked in NTLM authentication in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10667">r10667</a>  aaronfraser  reported this bug in <a title="URL's fail to load if behind a proxy in 2.0.157.2" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6567"> issue 6567 </a> comment 33:      Using v2.0.166.1 I receive a cache access denied error.    Chrome never prompts me to enter authentication credentials    for the proxy server.       Using Build 11045 I am prompted for the authentication    settings. http sites work.  https sites fail to load  with    Error 115 (net::ERR_PROXY_AUTH_REQUESTED): Unknown error.      Proxy = Squid server 2.7  client OS = XP    aaronfraser: does the current build (11045 or later) prompt  you for the username/password when you visit an HTTPS site? </pre>
