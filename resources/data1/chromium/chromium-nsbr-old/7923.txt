<title>Issue 7923 -   chromium -    Dropdown selection looks out of synch when scrolling down with arrow key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.165.0 (Developer Build 10094)    URL = <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>  (select language)  URL = <a href="http://autos.yahoo.com/">http://autos.yahoo.com/</a>  (select make)  URL = <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">http://www.ebay.com/</a> (select category)    IE7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari 3: OK        1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a> or another URL above.  2. Open the language dropdown by clicking on its down-arrow button.  3. Scroll down using the down-arrow key on the keyboard.    What is the expected output?     The highlight should scroll down  and the text in the textbox part of the  dropdown should match that of the highlighted list item.    What do you see instead?    After you get to a certain point down the list  the listbox part starts  multiple-selecting (or appears to do so)  and the textbox part may get out  of synch with the selection.    It actually looks like a drawing/updating problem.     </pre>
