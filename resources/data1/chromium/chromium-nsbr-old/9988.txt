<title>Issue 9988 -   chromium -    [linux] resource bundle should own gdkpixbufs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Calling ResourceBundle::LoadPixbuf returns a pixbuf that the caller is  responsible for cleaning up (by calling g_object_unref when done).  This is  unlike ResourceBundle::LoadBitmap which returns a SkBitmap that the  resource bundle owns.  We should probably do the same with LoadPixbuf so we  don't leak pixbufs and subsequent loads are faster. </pre>
