<title>Issue 13431 -   chromium -    linux build (32b) + proxy configuration - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1    There is some way to edit a file or something  to enable a proxy? I know  this is a really early release. I cant configure the global proxy for the  gnome enviroment  I have some other stuff going on  so I depend on the  particular proxy configuration of the apps.    Thanks a lot  </pre>
