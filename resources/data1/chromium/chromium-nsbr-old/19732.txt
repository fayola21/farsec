<title>Issue 19732 -   chromium -    Content script running on page with errors will disable the rest of the application for extended length of time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an extension that contains a) a content script that will show   some obvious change on every page  such as some text at the bottom  and b)   either a page action or a tool strip (probably should try tool strip as   they are easier to enable)  2. Navigate to ONLY pages that have no errors  such as   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/toolstrips">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/toolstrips</a>   or <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>  3. Hover over the tool strip after every page load and check the hover   action works (you can also click and see it darken a little)  or look at   the address bar to check if the page action still shows up.  4. Go to a page that has an error  such as gmail (gives 'Refused to set   unsafe header &quot;Connection&quot;')  5. Now check for the page action or try to hover/click the button.      The page action should show up just like normal  and the toolstrip should   work as before      The page action no longer shows up and the toolstrip is inactive. After   what appears to be about 90-120 seconds  the rest of the extension is   active again. Going to another page with errors (or even returning to the   original one with errors) will disable them again.    <b>Please provide
