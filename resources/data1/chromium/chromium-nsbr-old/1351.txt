<title>Issue 1351 -   chromium -    JS bug - array elements out of order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I posted this to the Chromium-dev group  and was asked to re-post here.  I'll paste the email verbatim below:    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hi...    I have discovered what may be a possible bug.  I don't see a bug  tracker on the code.google.com site  so I figured I would post it here  - apologies if I'm in the wrong place.    Anyway  have a look at this site:    <a href="http://www.webgenius.co.nz/">http://www.webgenius.co.nz/</a>    in both Chrome and any other browser (tested in FF3  Safari 3  etc).    The navigation elements under the header are out of order in Chrome.    The script that sets up the menu items is here:    <a href="http://webgenius.co.nz/TemplaterMenu.js">http://webgenius.co.nz/TemplaterMenu.js</a>    and the AsylumNav class is defined here:    <a href="http://webgenius.co.nz/TemplaterNav.js">http://webgenius.co.nz/TemplaterNav.js</a>    and the unpacked version of that code is here:    <a href="http://www.webgenius.co.nz/original.TemplaterNav.js">http://www.webgenius.co.nz/original.TemplaterNav.js</a>    It's a pretty simple two-dimensional array that uses parentId (the  first argument to the AddLink method) as the key for the first level  and linkId (the second argument) as the key for the second level.    I can't see why the array is getting out of order  and I also can't  see any logic to the way the array is being re-ordered (although it's  very late here and I'm probably just missing it).    Let me know if you need more info.    Cheers     Matt  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   </pre>
