<title>Issue 18138 -   chromium -    Auto focus on new background tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Right click on any link  2. Click &quot;open in a new tab&quot;  3. chrome auto focuses onto the new tab  instead of opening into the   background      All previous version of chrome opened new tabs in the background through   this method (right click menu).       This new version autofocuses on this tab. I believe this should not be the   default setting. Middleclicking is not an option for some people as they do   not have the mouse wheel button (or is assigned to voice command/other   functions). Ctrl-click requires use of keyboard. At least having the option   to switch back or having the previous default of opening in a background   tab is MUCH more convenient. Especially when you want to open multiple   links on one page  you don't have to keep refocusing on the old tab.    <b>Please provide
