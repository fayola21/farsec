<title>Issue 16813 -   chromium -    Omnibar ctrl-enter behavior inconsistent with rest of browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter term in omnibar  2. Press enter  note result.    3. Enter term in omnibar  4. click the 'go' button  note result.    5. Enter term in omnibar  6. Press ctrl-enter  note result.    7. enter term in omnibar  8. press ctrl and click the 'go' button  note result.    9. enter term in omnibar  10. press alt-enter  note result.        the keyboard shortcuts for executing omnibar commands should match pressing   the 'go' button. (and the &quot;go&quot; button behavior already matches general page   link behavior).        For normal page links and for the 'go' button  ctrl-enter opens the omnibar   term or the page link in a new tab.    The keyboard shortcut ctrl-enter 'autofixes' the url when executed from the   omnibar.  The alt-enter command is used instead to open in new tab  and is   inconsistent with other behavior.    <b>Please provide
