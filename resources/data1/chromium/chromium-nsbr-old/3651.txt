<title>Issue 3651 -   chromium -    Downloads appear complete but are always corrupt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This reproduces consistently for me with 0.3.154.3 on my desktop at work   (although through Remote Desktop  not that it should matter):      1. Navigate to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/10-21-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/10-21-</a>  2008/3695/  2. Click on either zip file to start downloading    I made 10 attempts at downloading the large zip files. Each time Chrome   would only download it partially and what's worse  it doesn't tell me that   it failed to download. It appears as if it was successfully downloaded  but   when I try to open it  the built-in zip in Windows says the archive is   corrupt and I see that the file is only partially downloaded (file sizes   have ranged from 1.5MB or 9MB when they should be 12MB or 23MB depending on   which zip you download).     </pre>
