<title>Issue 22787 -   chromium -    Help link in NTP tips page takes me to wrong OS-specific help - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I got a tip that said &quot;press f6 to focus location bar&quot;.  I think this may not work on the Mac (? I think the f-key row is used for   system functions) and the link it provided for learning more about keyboard   shortcuts took me to a Windows-specific page. </pre>
