<title>Issue 17531 -   chromium -    stray ui elements in popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Related/followup to <a href="http://crbug.com/16329">http://crbug.com/16329</a>      1. open incognito window  2. go to gmail  3. open a new compose (or any other popup window)  4. make the window larger        You'll find logo from the right side of the window floating down over the   content area.    Since we had this problem with the tab strip  do we need some better   handling to make sure we generically handle all the content that could be   added to the tab strip over time?   </pre>
