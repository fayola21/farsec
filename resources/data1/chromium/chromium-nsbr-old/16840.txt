<title>Issue 16840 -   chromium -    Page menu &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript console doesn't actually show a JS console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Page menu's Developer submenu has a &quot;JavaScript console&quot; menu item in  it. Selecting it brings up the DOM inspector  not the JS console. We should  fix this menu item.    What should we call it? &quot;Inspector&quot;?    BTW  where is the JS console now? </pre>
