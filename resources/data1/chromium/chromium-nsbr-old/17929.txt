<title>Issue 17929 -   chromium -    new feature request -  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Is there an opportunity/interest to support a scientific  research and  non-profit communities to have MODE where the browser Trust extended  list of Certificate Authorities. ?    Problem:-  not having the self signed  Root Certificate Authority  in the  browser  is a huge problem for Science and research communities. These  folks are not a small group of people; they spread across the world (i  think may be few in south pole too) and rely on distributed computing  resources for their daily work. The user experience with the browser  became terrible; it used to be a certificate popup asking for the user  to confirm; now the browsers are asking for adding an exception; and  some doesn't give any option at all  they just give you a dead page.    Proposed Solution:-  proposed solution could be 'the browser can be run in different types  of MODES/PROFILES'.  - one mode could be FINANCE/MONEY mode where the browser only   trusts  the set of certificates(i.e the list of Root CA certificates that are  now in the browser)  - other mode could be non FINANCE/MONEY mode where the browser has   the different set of list of Root CA certificates which  include the previous   list plus the 'scientific/ community' Root CA certificates. The money  transactions are simply prohibited in this mode. Or when the money/  fund transaction happens the browser automatically switches back to  the 'FINANCE' mode. I am not sure if the browser can detect these type  of transaction.    Any one has a better solution?    The Self Signed Root CA certificate distribution doesn't work; unless  it comes with the browser. So the Trusted Root CA certificates has to  come with the browser.      thanks </pre>
