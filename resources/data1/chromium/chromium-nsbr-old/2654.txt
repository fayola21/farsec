<title>Issue 2654 -   chromium -    [zh-CN] - Chrome - Should have space between &quot;Google&quot; and query string  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1274185&gt;  In the address-bar/search-bar  typing directly  the drop down list   shows &quot;Google&lt;querystring&gt;&quot; without space between &quot;Google&quot; and   &lt;querystring&gt;. This is incorrect.    Though Chinese do not have spaces between words  please note that here we   do not translate the verb &quot;Google&quot; into Chinese  so we should have the   space separating &quot;Google&quot; and query string.    See the attached screenshot. </pre>
