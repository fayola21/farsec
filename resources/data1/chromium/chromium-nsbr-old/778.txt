<title>Issue 778 -   chromium -    Sorting bookmarks &quot;folders first&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. After installing Chrome it imported my IE 7 favorites - so far OK  2. When I click the &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; in Chrome the list is ordered   alphabetically but folders are not first.  3. Would be nice to have an option to sort folders first    What is the expected result? Sort folders alphabetically first then other   links      What happens instead? Folders and links are sorted alphabetically      Please provide
