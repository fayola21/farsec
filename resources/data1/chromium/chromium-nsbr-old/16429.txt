<title>Issue 16429 -   chromium -    Window resize from left edge looks noticeably worse than from right edge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.194.0 (20368)  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit  window manager : Gnome      1. Open a Chrome window  open a new tab it displays the new &quot;new tab&quot;   page(8 frequently visited pages etc)  2. Click and expand the window from right size of screen  all content in   the window stays centered relatively smoothly  3. Now try to resize the window using mouse from left side  it tries to   center the content but now jumps a lot compared to resize from right size.   Not as smooth as right side resize.        It should smoothly redraw and center the content when resized regardless of   location of resize    I am not actually sure this is actually a bug or expected behavior though   :) </pre>
