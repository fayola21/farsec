<title>Issue 12252 -   chromium -    Clicking outside of OmniBox dropdown should dismiss it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - launch chromium  - type a few letters in the omnibox to get the dropdown  - click somewhere outside the window    Expected:  - dropdown should go away allowing you to access the rest of the window    Actual:  - dropdown doesn't go away. The only way to make it go away is to load a  page or hit escape with the text box focused.    Even focussing a text field within the webpage content area doesn't dismiss  it  even while you type! </pre>
