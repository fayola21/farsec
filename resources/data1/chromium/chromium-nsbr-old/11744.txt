<title>Issue 11744 -   chromium -    Write an automated rebaselining tool - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  it takes building local checkouts in three platforms to produce   layout test baselines  which is a little harder than it should be.    We should write a tool that does this for us using layout test results    created by the build bots.    Essentially  the tool will accept a list of test files  and do the following:     * Download at the waterfalls' buildbots latest results for all three platforms   * Parse results and convert them to new baselines   * Use svn add to add new baselines to the working copy    The goal is that after running this tool  the working copy will be ready to   create a change containing all new baselines.    Ideally  the tool could also have a &quot;compare&quot; mode  where it would do the   above and then provide an easy way to compare expected results with the   ones  produced by the build bot (similar to what run_webkit_tests does for   failing tests). This mode would greatly ease troubleshooting failing tests.    The tool should be written in Python and live in webkit/tools/layout_tests. </pre>
