<title>Issue 19233 -   chromium -    Regression: all text fields are spellchecked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553)  URLs (if applicable) : google.com or anything with text fields.      1. Go to www.google.com (or any text form!)  2. Type 'australia'  3. It gets underlined with capitalized version (Australia) suggested.  4. While I typed the URL www.google.com this very moment  it got underlined   in two places (www and google).        Clearly  URLs should be recognized and not spell checked.  Also  in Google   text boxes (and most online text forms)  using lowercase is fine and the   user should not be distracted with capitalization.  I would argue that   forms like Google OneBox should not spell check at all (it already has   instant auto-suggestions  which are smarter).  Capitalized words like   &quot;OneBox&quot; (which got underlined too) should be presumed to be names and   exempted.  Especially in quote marks as used here.        See attached images.  Red ink all over.  Very distracting!   </pre>
