<title>Issue 10548 -   chromium -    After update some 'old-version' folders remain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.1 (Offici��_��_le build 13271)  URLs (if applicable) : %AppData%LocalGoogleChromeApplication      0. Maybe you have to be on the dev-channel???  1. Go to that folder  2. Notice some folders from old versions still exist here.      The folder of the old version should be deleted if it is succesfully   updated.      The folders stay... </pre>
