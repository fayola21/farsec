<title>Issue 19573 -   chromium -    Sync Bookmarks giving &quot;Error Signing in&quot;. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1      1. Try out the new feature for Sync Bookmarks.  2. Gives the error message &quot;Error Signing in&quot;        New Sync feature should work      It doesn't work    -----------------------------------  My google password is obviously correct as I sign in with Gmail etc.   without a problem.  -----------------------------------  I am however behind a proxy server in my office  and just wondering out   loud if this new feature doesn't play nice with the whole auto   authentication thing(NTLM)?    ----------------------------------- </pre>
