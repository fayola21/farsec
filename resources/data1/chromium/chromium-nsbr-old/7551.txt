<title>Issue 7551 -   chromium -    About:network crashes browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.160.1 (Developer Build 9392)        1. Navigate to about:network.      What is the expected output?     * About:network window should pop up on top of parent window and have  keyboard focus.  * If the about:network window is underneath the parent window and you hit  the &quot;Go&quot; button or &quot;Reload&quot; button  it should come to the top.    What do you see instead?    * About:network window pops under the parent window.  * If you hit &quot;Go&quot; or &quot;Reload&quot;  the about:network window doesn't come up to  the top.   </pre>
