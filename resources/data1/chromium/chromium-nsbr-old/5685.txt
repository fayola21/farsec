<title>Issue 5685 -   chromium -    Paint issue in the pdf plugin area while reloading and dragging the tab at the same time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vijayan/vijayan-thesis.pdf">http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vijayan/vijayan-thesis.pdf</a>  2. Reload and then drag the tab and move it around      I expected the renderer area to be clean but see a paint issue instead.   Once it pdf loads the paint issue is not seen anymore.     Chromium 1.0.155.0 (Developer Build 7225) </pre>
