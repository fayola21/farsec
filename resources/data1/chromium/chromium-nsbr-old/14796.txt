Orange stars overlap album name and the button that says Save it! wraps the   text.      What is the expected result?      No overlap and no wrapped button text.  Renders fine in FF3.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/Angel-Hildur-Gudnadottir-MP3-">http://www.emusic.com/artist/Angel-Hildur-Gudnadottir-MP3-</a>  Download/11910647.html  2. Look at the album title &quot;In Transmediale&quot; and the Orange stars (middle   right of screenshot) and see how they overlap.  3. See also how the Save it! button below the album cover has text that   wraps.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Looks fine in FF3    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
