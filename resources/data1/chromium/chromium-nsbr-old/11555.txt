Click &quot;Choose File&quot;  4. in the Open dialog  start writing a character which is the beginning of   some file in that folder  note the suggestion box that appears...  5. change folders to some other folder  6. now continue the file name you wrote  7. choose that file name  try to open it... it does not exists... (unless   of course you have a file named the same in the new folder too...)     autocomplete box is connected to the old folder until it is empty again   (deleting a few characters won't do)        suggestions box/autocomplete should show relevant suggestions      the suggestions showing are for the old folder....    since all browsers seem to FAIL this...is this a windows bug? i am using XP   SP3  can't see a reason not to update the search destination of the autocomplete   box when switching folders...   </pre>
