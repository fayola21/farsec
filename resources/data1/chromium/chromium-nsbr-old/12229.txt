<title>Issue 12229 -   chromium -    Linux: improve build failure error messages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 	Build 16363      1. Try to compile Chromium for Linux with the Linux BuildInstructions from  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructions">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxBuildInstructions</a>      Should compile      You get an &quot;SConscript not found error&quot;.    It seems that the Build Instructions for Linux are not actual. They work  with very early builds but not with any actual one. Also all other  documents linked there are obsolete (they all reference to a SConscript in  /src/build witch was removed some builds ago...)    So please update it!   </pre>
