<title>Issue 6372 -   chromium -    Remove the magic transparency color from our Skia code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is blocked on <a title="Cleartype text not rendered correctly with opacity applied" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=559"> issue 559 </a>. Once that's fixed  we need to remove the   magic transparency color and actually use transparent layers. This will   allow us to fix a number of other bugs including <a title="Rounded corners with -webkit-border-radius with a drop shadow renders as black" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128"> issue 128 </a>. </pre>
