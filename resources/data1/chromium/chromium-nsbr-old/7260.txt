<title>Issue 7260 -   chromium -    Request: Menu option to open files (ala File &gt; Open) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1093064&gt;    I think  it is the minimum basic feature for most of the applications.    We should provide this flexibility for the user to open local html files  (what ever).    I don't think 'drag and drop'/Ctrl O  will serve this purpose. </pre>
