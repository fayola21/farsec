<title>Issue 21098 -   chromium -    URL display occasionally cut off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not exactly sure what causes it  but occasionally my URL bar will have   everything after the first 40 characters or so cut off.  Sometimes it gets   cut mid-letter.  It looks like it's not getting painted right  or it's   getting painted over or something.    Causing it to get repainted by dragging other windows over it or causing a   tooltip to show does *not* fix it.    Loading a different URL does *not* fix it.    Clicking in the bar does fix it.    I believe it only happens in the GTK theme  so I think it's some painting-  related bit there  maybe related to clip regions.    This happened on my Karmic-ish 32-bit laptop before and still happens now   that I've reinstalled with the latest Karmic alpha. </pre>
