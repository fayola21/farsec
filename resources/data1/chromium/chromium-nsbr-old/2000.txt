<title>Issue 2000 -   chromium -    Uninstall happens even when a Chrome dialog is still open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome 151.0   2. Launch uninstall.exe from Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Google Chrome [Dialog  that says  Please Close all Chrome windows will appear]  3. Close Chrome  4. Perform step 2 again (This gets the confirmation dialog)  5. Click ok     What is the expected output?   1. I think we should close the dialog from step2 and launch the  confirmation dialog  2. We should not allow closing chrome without interacting with the dialog  from step2    Either 1 or 2 should happen I guess!!    What do you see instead?  Chrome gets uninstalled and the dialog from step 2 can be still seen. Also   some of the files still remain    log  ----  [0909/160333:ERROR:uninstall.cc(66)] Failed to delete registry key:  SoftwareClassesChromeHTML  [0909/160333:ERROR:uninstall.cc(66)] Failed to delete registry key:  SoftwareClientsStartMenuInternetchrome.exe  [0909/160333:ERROR:uninstall.cc(80)] Failed to delete registry value:  Google Chrome  [0909/160333:ERROR:uninstall.cc(217)] Failed to delete folder: C:Documents  and Settingssunandt.GOOGLELocal SettingsApplication  DataGoogleChromeApplication </pre>
