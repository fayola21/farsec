<title>Issue 21549 -   chromium -    Zooming the New Tab Page way in and then restoring the normal size looks bad.  Real bad. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have a window that's a pretty ordinary size.  The attached image shows   a window that's 1050x762.  I've found that if the window is too narrow  the   bug is less likely to occur.  On my Mac and Windows laptops  a window the   size of the screen (&quot;maximized&quot; on Windows  press &quot;shift&quot; and click the   green + zoom button on Mac) will show the bug every time.  2. Open a new tab to get yourself a New Tab page.  3. Press command-= or control-= (equals/plus) a bunch of times to zoom   in until it doesn't zoom in any more.  4. Press command-0 (zero) or control-0 to restore the original zoom level.      Expect: the page to look normal  like how it did when it was opened  Observe: it looking abnormal    This may ultimately be a WebKit bug  but I'm classifying it as Browser   UI/NNTP first for investigation.
