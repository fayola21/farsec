<title>Issue 13338 -   chromium -    Favicons not transferred when importing bookmarks from another browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3      1. Import bookmarks from Firefox or Internet Explorer  2. Open the bookmark manager      The imported bookmarks should have the favicons they had in the browser   they were imported from.      The favicons didn't get imported.    This is an important issue for first time users who switch from another   browser. My sister was disappointed about this. </pre>
