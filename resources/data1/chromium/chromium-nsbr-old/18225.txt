<title>Issue 18225 -   chromium -    make the locale fallback better for en-FOO and pt-Foo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off <a title="Canadian English not supported with inline spellchecker"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18187">issue 18187</a>.    Currently  all en-FOO's are mapped to en-US except for en-GB. For es-FOO  and zh-FOO  we do some special handling  but we don't do anything special  for en-FOO.      Because en  zh and es are the only languages with regional/script  variations that we currently support  we don't have to worry about cases  like de-CH  de-AT  fr-CH  ar-FOO at the moment. (they're all mapped to the  only possible match : de  fr and ar)    Perhaps  we have to map en-{ZA AU NZ} to en-GB (there are many more). It's  not clear what to do with en-CA  though.      </pre>
