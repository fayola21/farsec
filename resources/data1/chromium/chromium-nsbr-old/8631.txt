<title>Issue 8631 -   chromium -    Linux download shelf needs many UI touchups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The download shelf has several problems:    - focus (generally)  - it lacks animations   - giant down-arrow when new download starts   - slidy download items   - download item progress  - the download items don't stack properly (those on the right should   disappear if there's not enough room for them  and new ones should show up  on the left  not right)  - it doesn't have a show all downloads link or a little down-arrow icon </pre>
