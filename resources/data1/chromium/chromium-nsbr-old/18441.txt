<title>Issue 18441 -   chromium -    Video cannot play slow enough when playback rate is reduced. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Play a video with low framerate.  2. Adjust the rate to slow it so there should be gaps of at least 60us   between frames.  2. Watch and listen as the audio plays (at the correct speed) whereas the   video plays too quickly.      A/V should stay synced. Instead video plays too fast.    I believe the cause is VideoRendererBase::kMaxSleepMilliseconds being too   small. For 30fps videos at .5 speed  we should be sleeping for ~67us   between frames  so forcing a sleep of at most 60us causes the video to slip   out of sync.  </pre>
