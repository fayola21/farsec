<title>Issue 8889 -   chromium -    Downloading two files to same location causes unresolved conflict - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.170.0 (Developer Build 11729)        1. Download a file to a given folder and filename.  2. Pause the download.  3. In another tab  download another file to the same folder and filename.    What is the expected output?     The second download should recognize that Chrome is already downloading to  that target location and give a warning.    What do you see instead?    On the download shelf  the second download shows status &quot;Starting...&quot;  but  never starts or times out.  The progress on the Download page is displayed  as &quot;-1% at 0&quot;.   </pre>
