<title>Issue 15259 -   chromium -    New FtpNetworkTransaction doesn't handle short reads well - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While working on FtpNetworkTransaction I discovered the issue with short   reads. I added a capability to mock sockets to simulate short reads  and   copied one of the tests for FtpNetworkTransaction that passes and activated   short reads simulation. It failed.    I'm working on fixing that. </pre>
