<title>Issue 14735 -   chromium -    Cookies aren't getting saved in extensions anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Put the attached HTML file in an extension (I used --load-extension)  2. Run page (you should see alert &quot;null&quot;)  3. Refresh page  you should see alert &quot;&lt;some number&gt;&quot;  4. Quit and restart Chrome  you see alert &quot;null&quot; again    ===    On step 4  it should alert &quot;&lt;some number&gt;&quot;  but cookies are not being saved   across sessions. </pre>
