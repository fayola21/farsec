<title>Issue 615 -   chromium -    Multiple keywords for search engine in omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (Build 1583)    It should be able to have multiple keywords for the search engine   integration in the omnibar.    For example  when wanting to use wikipedia search  I have the keyword   &quot;wiki&quot; so typing wiki will get the search  but it would also be nice to be   able to press tab if the highlighted link is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a> or   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_page</a>   and I believe adding multiple   keywords per search engine could fix that (of course  it is possible at the   moment to have many search engines corresponding to the same one just with   different keywords  but it's unpractical). </pre>
