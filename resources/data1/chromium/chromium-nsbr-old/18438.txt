<title>Issue 18438 -   chromium -    Text colors need to adapt to theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0      1. Install a dark theme  e.g.   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_baseball.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_baseball.html</a>        Text in the tabs  download shelf  etc  should be readable. See   linux/windows.          Text stays black and is hence not readable on a dark background. </pre>
