<title>Issue 19725 -   chromium -    Can't drop a Chromium tab *anywhere*. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Posting on behalf of chovanec:    This is an issue I encountered with Chromium on gHardy.    It started when I was moving a tab from one Chromium window (within which   it was the only tab) into another Chromium window where I had 3 tabs open   already.    Somehow  I got into a state where I couldn't put the tab down anywhere. If   I dragged the mouse into one Chromium window  the tab would get added to   that window  but if I kept moving the mouse the tab would follow it. I   wasn't holding the mouse button down anymore  and no amount of clicking   would change anything. I tried switching desktops  and the tab followed me.   I tried hitting ctrl+alt+f1 to go to a command prompt  and then I came back   with alt+f7--it was still there  attached to my mouse pointer.    I probably fiddled with it for 5 minutes before I did something with the   magic touch and it finally dropped into one window and stayed there.    Interesting sidenote  while I was dragging the tab around  I had some   trouble moving from one monitor to another. It wasn't that the tab wouldn't   follow  but it seemed like I was hitting a wall that neither the mouse nor   tab would go through.    Sorry  I imagine this will be hard to replicate; if I have time I'll try it   again and see if I can figure out what triggers it. </pre>
