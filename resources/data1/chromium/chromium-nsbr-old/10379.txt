<title>Issue 10379 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   Some times it fails because the animation starts before the first dom dump  so the text doesn't match.   MAC : LayoutTests/svg/hixie/perf/007.xml = FAIL PASS   (Automatically generated from line 1537 to line 1541 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
