<title>Issue 4185 -   chromium -    Importer tests are not being run at all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The review at:    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/9416">http://codereview.chromium.org/9416</a>    Causes that these tests are no longer run even in the presence of the test   data. PathExists() does not take '*'.    I also think this early return is not the right thing to do  for example   the ssl tests fail unless you have the certs.    Nobody reads the extra LOG output anyways.       </pre>
