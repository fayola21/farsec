<title>Issue 13799 -   chromium -    make build needs to rebuild on command line changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently don't track command line changes across builds.  This results   in two problems:    1) Changing a compile time flag (e.g.  -DFOO) doesn't cause a rebuild.  2) Dropping a .cc file doesn't cause the .a files to rebuild.    There's a comment in the top Makefile that gets generated that mentions mimicking the if_changed rule in the kernel source to fix this. </pre>
