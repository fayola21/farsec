<title>Issue 16973 -   chromium -    NNTP: Action buttons should get mouse hover state with tabbing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT(r 20899)    I believe  we regressed here  becoz of the fix for <a title="The Tab key in the new new tab page does not go to the first choice" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16342"> issue 16342 </a> !    --Do tabbing in NNTP.  -The first choice goes to the first thumbnail. After all the thumbnails  the   keyboard focus goes to Action buttons  but they don't get mouse hover state   (selection state). so user confuses  as if they are not getting keyboard   focus. </pre>
