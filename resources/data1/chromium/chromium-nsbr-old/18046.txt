<title>Issue 18046 -   chromium -    Video playback dead on linux due to file/stream parsing bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open up a video file with a video tag.  Try to play.  Codec will be failed to recgonized.  Specific UI will show controls  but no   window.    For ogv  a log message like      [ogg @ 0xb8d82c0]Could not find codec parameters (Video: theora  1280x544)    will be dumped to the console.    This seems related to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21999">r21999</a>.  Reverting <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21999">r21999</a> manages to make things work   again. </pre>
