<title>Issue 11553 -   chromium -    User's Chromium folder doesn't get removed when uninstalling with removal of profile option set - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install system level Chromium 2.0.179.0 (Developer Build 15425)  2. Exit Chromium  3. Launch uninstaller and select the option to remove profile while   uninstalling    What is the expected output?   To remove Chromium folder @ C:UserstestingAppDataLocal    What do you see instead?  It remains though the profile is removed    This happens on Vista.  </pre>
