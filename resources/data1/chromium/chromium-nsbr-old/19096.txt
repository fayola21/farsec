<title>Issue 19096 -   chromium -    Need to decide which file extensions should trigger dangerous download warning on shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> download_exe.cc defines a list of file extensions for which the &quot;dangerous   download&quot; warning is shown. Currently  I've only put &quot;dmg&quot; in there. We   should make a list of file types that can automatically execute on OS X (.app   doesn't count  since it's a folder). What makes sense here? Applescript files?   Anything?    CC'ing a few random people. This discussion only makes sense after   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/165295">http://codereview.chromium.org/165295</a> is in. </pre>
