<title>Issue 6611 -   chromium -    Feature request: Remember what language is used for each tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In windows vista (possibly xp as well  i'm not sure)  when switching the   focus between different programs  the OS remembers what input language was   in use in each program  so even if i've been using e.g. english in VS2008    open Chrome and switch to greek  when i return the focus to VS2008  the   input language will revert to english.  i don't know if this is possible  but i was hoping that since each tab in   Chrome is a separate process  that this feature of the OS can be   implemented into the browser  so that when i change the language in 1 tab    the other tabs are not affected.    kudos to the team for producing such an awesome browser. </pre>
