<title>Issue 4542 -   chromium -    Meebo.com does not load correctly using dev updates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.22  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.meebo.com/">http://www.meebo.com/</a>           Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to www.meebo.com using the Chrome browser with dev updates.  2. Login      Page should load without error messages  and buddy list should appear with   no screennames bold  and misc. things like the choose font drop down box   should be there.      Page loads differently almost every time with me. The main meebo homepage   always loads properly. Here are the different ways it has loaded once   signed in  in the order of best possible to worst:    1. Page loads completely with no error messages  but all the screennames in   the buddy list are bold  which should only happen briefly when you first   login  and when someone signs in. Clicking the 'A' button to change font   settings brings up the utility  but the font choice drop-down box is not   there  and neither is the font size drop-down box. No buttons  such as an   OK or Cancel button  are present. Buttons to close windows  such as the X   in the corner  are there. Clicking any of the utility links at the top    such as 'accounts'  'preferences'  etc. brings up the appropriate window    but there is nothing in that window  and usually causes the a &quot;Oops! Meebo   detected a network interruption. Please check your network connection.&quot;   error message. The buttons at the top of the buddy list for adding a buddy    blocking a buddy  etc. do not work at all.    2. Page loads completely  but with error message(s). One message is &quot;Oops!   Meebo detected a network interruption. Please check your network   connection.&quot; and another message is relating to not being able to login to   a specific IM account  such as AIM. Sometimes  usually after the website   has been loaded for a while  when you double-click a screenname to send an   IM  nothing happens. The IM box does not show up. The errors listed in   example #1 are all present in this example.    3. Page does not load completely. Most if not all of the screennames in the   buddy list are missing  and some or all of the accounts (if signed into a   meebo account with multiple IM accounts) are missing on the left. Both   error messages that are described in example #2 are given  and you are not   able to send any IMs. The errors listed in examples #1 and #2 are all   present in this example.      These issues did not exist before I switched to the dev updates  at least   for me. Screenshots are provided. </pre>
