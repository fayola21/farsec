<title>Issue 4685 -   chromium -    chromium build should not depend on WebKit/WebKit or WebKit/WebKitLibraries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apparently the mac build does. I'm about to commit a change that deletes   them from our tree and then pulls them via DEPS from webkit.org. We'd   prefer to not pull them at all though.     Darin said to make this a P1. :) </pre>
