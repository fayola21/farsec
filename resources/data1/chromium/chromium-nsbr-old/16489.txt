<title>Issue 16489 -   chromium -    Provide a real implementation of PasswordStoreDefault/PasswordStoreWin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  PasswordStoreDefault (intended primarily for Windows use) has an   ugly shim to the old WebDataService implementation of the password   manager.    PasswordStoreDefault needs to be re-implemented as a non-hack on top of   LoginDatabase  and already-stored passwords migrated from WebData into   the new database. The new implementation should be trivial  it's just the   migration that may be tricky. </pre>
