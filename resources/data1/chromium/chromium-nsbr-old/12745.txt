<title>Issue 12745 -   chromium -    After drag-install of a .crx file  browser won't close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Generate a .crx file with the python script  2. Drag it onto a browser window (started with --single-process --enable-  extensions)  click ok on the install prompt dialog  3. Try to close the browser  note that the browser doesn't shut down    This seemed to work before; perhaps it broke with Matt's utility process   changes?    I'm not sure who should work on this so I'm CC'ing all extension devs. </pre>
