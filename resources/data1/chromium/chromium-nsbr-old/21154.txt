<title>Issue 21154 -   chromium -    Multiple Play Lists - Download Function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Any  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.di.fm">http://www.di.fm</a>      1. Vist the website and click on a Win Amp Stream      A .pls play list file is downloaded.        A .pls play list file with a different file name is created every time you   click on the button  this is because the file already exists. This can soon   clutter up the downloads on your computer if you listen often.    This is a feature request  not a bug.    Is there any exception that could be added for Play List files like .pls?    Please see the attached screen shoot for more information.   </pre>
