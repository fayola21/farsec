<title>Issue 21803 -   chromium -    Window shows without any border [windows classic] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    Other browsers tested: N/A    Some windows appear with no border around them. See attached screenshot for   an example.    Probably related to <a title="Checkboxes and scroll bar arrows sometimes disappear under Windows classic"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3543">issue 3543</a> (the explanation in comment #155 could be   relevant here  too). </pre>
