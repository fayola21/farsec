<title>Issue 13298 -   chromium -    UI to submit crash even if not participating in usage stats - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 182.5  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Install Chrome on a clean machine.  2. On launch uncheck the Optional field in the pop up you get to disable the usage statistics.  3. Crash Chrome.      Expected:  We should get a dialog asking the user to send the crash report to Google. We should also have a   dump file in ~/Library/Breakpad/Chrome_Mac.    Actual:  Chrome does not create any dump files and does not give any pop up.     </pre>
