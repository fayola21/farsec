<title>Issue 1043 -   chromium -    Unable to re-attach application tab to any chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A      1. Create a new application shortcut.  2. Double click this shortcut to open the desired URL in Chrome.        Chrome should give the option whether to open the application within the   same window  or at least provide the re-attach tab functionality to this   window.        Chrome opens the URL in a completely isolated window  and the user can't   attach it to any already opened window.   </pre>
