<title>Issue 12554 -   chromium -    Add UI tests to test workers. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to add UI tests to test workers after we switch to process-per-worker   model and remove uses of V8 lockers. Due to this  we can not run any worker   layout test that starts multiple workers because we load V8 instance in DLL   in test shell. To cover this deficiency  we need to add UI tests to test   multiple workers.   </pre>
