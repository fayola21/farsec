<title>Issue 18359 -   chromium -    Chrome loads the favicon when opening site or opening the link when Chrome windows size is possibly smallest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J3050)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 3.0.197 SVN Revision: 22269  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open 15-20 sites in different tabs. (Few sites of them should have favicons)  2. Make Chrome window as smaller as possible.  3. Open new tab and open any site which has favicon  or  4. Go to any already opened tab which has favicon.     - Click on any link.    Expected result:  3.1/4.1 Chrome strips the favicon.    Actual result:  3.2/4.2 Chrome shows the favicon and clicking on the favicon closes the  tab  since favicon overlaps the 'close button'.    Note:  - Screen-shots are attached. </pre>
