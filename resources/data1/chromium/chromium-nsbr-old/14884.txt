<title>Issue 14884 -   chromium -    background bitmap incorrectly placed on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When custom frame mode is enabled  the top bitmap isn't placed properly on   linux.  It should be aligned at 0  0  but it's currently offset by the frame   that we draw.    I need to move the painting of the background from the titlebar to the   window expose directly.   </pre>
