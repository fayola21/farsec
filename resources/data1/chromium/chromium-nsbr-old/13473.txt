<title>Issue 13473 -   chromium -    DNS prefetching incorrect without a local cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  we hammer out DNS queries knowing that the OS-level cache will   answer any repeated requests.  On Linux  we can't rely on such a thing.    Lorenzo saw multiple requests for the same domain all in a row from us.    It seems we'll need a cache within Chrome.    The reason this hasn't been done before is that the resolver API we're using   doesn't give us enough info to know how long we can cache a given entry.  One   idea to work around that is to make the cache just have a very low timeout    like ten seconds.  It's not as optimal as Windows but it'll probably cover   95% of requests. </pre>
