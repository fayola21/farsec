<title>Issue 4748 -   chromium -    Username/password appear to get encoded too often in ftp links. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a webpage with this content:  &lt;A href=ftp://%:%@google.com&gt;click me&lt;/A&gt;  2. Click the link  3. Check the error message:  The webpage at ftp://%252525:%252525@google.com/ might be temporarily down   or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.    I tested this with a fake FTP server and it received this command:  USER %25252525    The username would need to get encoded 4 times to go from &quot;%&quot; to   &quot;%25252525&quot;  which seems to me is a bit much.       </pre>
