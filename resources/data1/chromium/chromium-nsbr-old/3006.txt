<title>Issue 3006 -   chromium -    Implement and use SSLClientSocket::ReconnectIgnoringLastError - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the new HTTP stack can handle an SSL certificate error  without using SSLClientSocket::ReconnectIgnoringLastError  so  that method is still not yet implemented.    This is because we complete the SSL handshake first  and then  report certificate errors to the users  before sending the  request.  So the servers are patiently waiting for us to send  the requests  and the connections stay open.  When the users  click the &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; button  we can just proceed to  send the request.    It is certainly possible that some servers may not be that  patient and will close the connections quickly. </pre>
