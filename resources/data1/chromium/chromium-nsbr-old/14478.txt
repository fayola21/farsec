<title>Issue 14478 -   chromium -    Add profiling data for recent network requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At a high level  I would like to simplify investigation of network performance problems. For example    consider this situation:    User X loads a couple of pages in chromium. Her perception is that loading foobar.com was really slow. So she   files a bug. In order to investigate further  a developer needs to ask user X to (a) reproduce the jank (b)   be running some external tools or instrumented build while reproducing the problem  in order to capture the   data I need.    This requires a fair amount of cooperation/sophistication from user X  and can real tricky for problems that   only reproduce occasionally.    Really  we would like this workflow to become:    User X loads a couple of pages and notices that there was slowness. She loads up &quot;about:network&quot; AFTER HAVING   ALREADY REPRODUCED THE PROBLEM  and copy-pastes a new &quot;recent transaction performance&quot; section into a bug   report. Looking at the bug report  there is now a wealth of information on how much time was spent and where   for the request.    To do this  the network backend needs a way to credit and export performance data per-request(whereas most of   what we have right now is in aggregate). Then chromium could save the most recent requests perf stats into a   circular buffer  and display it when navigating to about:network (since it is passively logged  you wouldn't   need to explicit start a capture). </pre>
