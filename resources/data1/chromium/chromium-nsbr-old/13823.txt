<title>Issue 13823 -   chromium -    Characters truncated when searching in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)      1. Click into the omni box  2. type &quot;google chrome blog&quot;      What is the expected result?  It should issue a search for &quot;google chrome blog&quot;.    Instead it issues a search for &quot;google chrome bl&quot;.    It's always cutting off exactly two characters.  Correcting manually seems   to work.    This reproduced on two different machines for me. </pre>
