<title>Issue 3016 -   chromium -    Google search leaks private data when searching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  URLs (if applicable) : any search using Google         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK        Opera 9: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Do any search using Google    When using Chrome  the search results show with extra &quot;nn visits&quot; and   &quot;date/time visited&quot;.    This leaking of private data is a bug/error and must be fixed not to do   this.  Or at least __provide an option__ to not do this.    Chrome is just another browser and should use and display Google searches   just like any other browser does. </pre>
