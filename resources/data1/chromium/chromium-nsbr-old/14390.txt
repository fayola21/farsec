<title>Issue 14390 -   chromium -    [nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl]: ajax not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/details 191 108791095.asp">http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/details 191 108791095.asp</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?    A JavaScript alert appears and a box with &quot;Similar Offers&quot; (in Polish:   Podobne oferty) is missing on the bottom of that page. Also  page never   stops loading according to Chrome (the blue wheel spins all the time on the   tab)        What is the expected result?    No JavaScript alert and the missing box should be shown on that page.   Page stops loading after displaying all elements.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. While opening this page on Chrome you will get this JavaScript Alert   with the message in Polish stating that &quot;Creation of the AJAX communication   object has failed&quot;. See the first Screen in the attached file.    2. When you hit OK  the rest of the page will continue to load  except of a   box with &quot;Similar Offers&quot; (in Polish: Podobne oferty). See the second   screen which was taken in Safari.    3. Note that the page appears to be loading all the time in Chrome   (spinning blue wheel on the tab). Even after 30min nothing happens though.    In the case when this url won't load (don't know whether those ads can get   expired and what happens with the urls in such case)  try going to the root <a href="http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/">http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/</a> and pick an example ad from there. You   should get the same error.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Works OK on:  Safari 4.0  FF 3.0.11  FF 3.5b99  Opera 9.64    Please provide any additional information below.    <a href="http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/">http://nieruchomosci.gazetadom.pl/</a> is a real estate portal owned by one of   the biggest newspapers in Poland. </pre>
