<title>Issue 12250 -   chromium -    trying to open the inspector crashes the browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See topic.  This seems to have started in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15947">r15947</a>:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/115292">http://codereview.chromium.org/115292</a>    The inspector works fine with the --disable-oop-devtools switch.  Maybe on   linux/mac we should force that until DevToolsWindow is implemented on   linux/mac?   </pre>
