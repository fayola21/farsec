<title>Issue 9767 -   chromium -    Chrome XML support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I have a aspx page that spits out xml. As you have know Chrome only   displays raw data. In this case however no XML is being displayed   whatsoever.  2.When I create a call to a webservice I get xml file in return. When I try   the same with Chrome I just get an empty page.  Is there any way around it? or should I just exclude chrome from my list of   supported browsers?                  <b>Please provide
