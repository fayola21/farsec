<title>Issue 12259 -   chromium -    InfoBubbleGtk (star popup bubble) needs cleanup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Click the star button  2. We get a bookmark bubble that says &quot;hej!&quot; and has a placeholder menu.    We should either finish implementing this or remove it.  The current   implementation (as a toplevel window) looks bad on ion since it obscures the   window below it. </pre>
