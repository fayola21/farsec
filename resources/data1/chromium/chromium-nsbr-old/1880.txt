<title>Issue 1880 -   chromium -    SafeBrowsingProtocolManagerTest.TestGetHashBackOffTimes is flakey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> src$ while ./chrome/Debug/unit_tests.exe --gtest_filter=Safe*; do date;   done    Eventually this will fail.    ....browsersafe_browsingprotocol_manager_unittest.cc:127: Failure  Value of: pm.next_gethash_time_ == now + TimeDelta::FromMinutes(480)    Actual: false  Expected: true      We are comparing two separate Time::Now() calls  one in the test  to one   done internally inside of the SB code.  If we're unlucky  these differ   enough for us to fail the test.  This caused me to revert some time   changes.  For now  I will disable the test. </pre>
