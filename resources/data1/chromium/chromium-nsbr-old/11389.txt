<title>Issue 11389 -   chromium -    Infobar correctness tweaks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the new infobar system  a couple of things were broken:    - the close box is no longer centered at the end of the infobar strip. The   infobar should have right padding equal to the top and bottom padding.  - the infobar animation looks wrong - contents are positioned relative to   the height at the current frame of the animation... this means the text   moves weirdly as the infobar animates in. It should be positioned relative   to the target height of the infobar at the end of the animation and offset   in the y axis by the 1 - current animation amount. </pre>
