<title>Issue 18753 -   chromium -    Chrome becomes awfully slow after an Idle time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : In all the versions    Other browsers tested: Yes        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Start Google Chrome  2. Open several tabs (8/9 tabs) with different sites  then minimize the      window and leave it for 1 hour  3. Maximize the window and try navigating different tabs.        The browser should behave with the same or almost same speed as it was    working with one hour ago.       You'll notice the browser is working awfully slow.   This problem exists since the birth of chrome and its there still now.   I'm eagerly waiting for a fix on this.       </pre>
