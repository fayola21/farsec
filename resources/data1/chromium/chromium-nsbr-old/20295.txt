<title>Issue 20295 -   chromium -    Window buttons are two pixels too high - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0  OS version               : Mac OS X 10.5+        Close/Minimize/Zoom should be shifted two pixels downwards (per the attached screenshots.)  This is hard to do because the window likes to move them back to their original position.    </pre>
