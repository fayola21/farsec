<title>Issue 9024 -   chromium -    Expanding our existing dock behavior with attachable windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a stub bug to cover adding more permanent docking behavior to our   UI. This will aid with windows such as the inspector (<a title="Web inspector button &quot;dock to main window&quot; does nothing" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25"> Issue 25 </a>)  and may   involve changes to the resizing behavior of our existing solution. </pre>
