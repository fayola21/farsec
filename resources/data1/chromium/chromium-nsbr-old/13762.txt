<title>Issue 13762 -   chromium -    Tab sometimes paints black (instead of white) when switching tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: tab sometimes paints black (instead of white) when switching   tabs.    This has been around for a long time (since before our initial beta).  I   think it was a regression from <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=422">r422</a>  which introduced the global backing   store cache.    It seems like we can sometimes incorrectly end up painting from an   uninitialized backing store. </pre>
