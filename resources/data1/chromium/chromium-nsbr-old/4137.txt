<title>Issue 4137 -   chromium -    Error detecting plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://air1.com/broadcast/setup.aspx?">http://air1.com/broadcast/setup.aspx?</a>  media=listen&amp;bt=3           Safari 3: Not Tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Starting at air1.com/listen and following the questions/options to begin   the music stream  you end up at the point where you are asked to select the   preferred plugin that will stream music.  2. At that page  it shows that none of the plugins are detected  however    other websites are able to play windows media files as well as real media   files.      The options should be able to be selected (considering both are installed)   and the setup process can continue.      No plugins are detected  however  other websites are able to embed Windows   Media files as well as Real Media files and they will play appropriately.     </pre>
