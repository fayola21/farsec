<title>Issue 8531 -   chromium -    Autosearch when oepning Find-In-Page when it already has a string in it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature Request:    Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.0 (11219)      1. Search for some word in an opened tab (Ctrl+F)  2. open some other page using that tab  3. Press Ctrl+F again      the text should be automatically searched      you need to click the find next/previous buttons to make it search      finally you can now search for the entered string without editing the text   first which is a huge improvement but IMO this would be even better </pre>
