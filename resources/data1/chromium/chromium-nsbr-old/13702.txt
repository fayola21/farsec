<title>Issue 13702 -   chromium -    Chrome2.* stops sending x y coordinate in NPP_SetWindow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     There were some changes to Chrome that introduced a new window   class &quot;WrapperNativeWindowClass&quot;.  This is causing an issue with the   window coordinates that are passed the the SetWindow function as defined   below.     typedef struct _NPPluginFuncs {      NPP_SetWindowUPP setwindow;     The SetWindow function takes an NPWindow structure which contains   information about the window.  In Firefox and Chrome 1.0 the x and y   coordinate values where set correctly to contain the position of the   window relative to the document.  The npapi.h header file defines how   these work.  In Chrome 2.0 the x and y values are always set to 0.  My   assumption  without looking at the Chrome code is that the addition of the   new window described above caused a coordinate mapping issue.  I believe   this is a bug in Chrome since according to the NPAPI docs the x and y   values should be set correctly to the relative position within the   document.      Valid x y coordinate of plugin window relative to the *page* window      Always 0 0 for x y coordinate      <b>Please provide
