<title>Issue 6450 -   chromium -    Cookies set during a 401 are not applied to the restarted transaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The cookies sent by a HttpNetworkTransaction is determined by request_info-  &gt;extra_headers  which is populated during URLRequestHttpJob::Start() by   URLRequestHttpJobAddExtraHeaders().    So when a transaction is restarted by URLRequestHttpJob::SetAuth()  it will   continue to use the previously constructed cookie header. Yet it is   possible that the triggering 401 wrote cookies  so the cookies should be   re-gotten each restart.   </pre>
