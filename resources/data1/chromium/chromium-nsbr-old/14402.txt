<title>Issue 14402 -   chromium -    [www.maccabi-health.co.il]: Poor page layout on www.maccabi-health.co.il - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.maccabi-health.co.il">http://www.maccabi-health.co.il</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?    Various layout elements are in the wrong place  size  color  etc:    - News ticker appears in upper-right corner rather than in the ticker box   in the center of the page.  - Menu items on right sidebar are in a poor color which makes them hard to   see/read.  - Menu items on top-left sidebar are on a two-tone background with white   patches that shouldn't be there.  - Pulldown menu bar on left side is too narrow to display the menu options.  - Border decoration elements in the center of the page are incorrectly   positioned so they don't actually border the boxes they belong to.          What is the expected result?      IE seems to get it right.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to www.maccabi-health.co.il    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Works on IE6. FF3 shows similar problems as Chrome  though not all of them.    Please provide any additional information below.
