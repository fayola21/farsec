<title>Issue 5739 -   chromium -    Relaunched browser window has size  position of last open popup  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 1.0.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7316">r7316</a>)    When the last open window was a popup (opened from within an application)   and you re-launch Chromium  the new browser window takes on the size and  position of the popup. It can look a little odd. It only happens on trunk.        1. Install <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest12.html">http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest12.html</a> as an application.  2. Close all Chromium windows.  3. Launch application.  4. Click on link &quot;Multi-PopUp Test #2&quot;.  5. From the blocked-popup list  select the top entry.  6. Close the application window  leaving only the popup window still open.  7. After awhile  close the popup.  8. Double-click the Desktop icon to re-launch Chromium.    What is the expected output?     Browser window should have the same size/position as the last (tabbed)  browser window that was open.    What do you see instead?    Browser window has the same size/position as the last popup window.  See attached picture.     </pre>
