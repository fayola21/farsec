<title>Issue 14574 -   chromium -    Extension: need an API to access the UI language and the value of accept-language  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some extensions need to read (and perhaps modify) Chrome's preference   entries.    For instance  a dictionary or translation extension may want to pick the   target language from the list of languages for Accept-Language (stored in   intl.accept-languages).      A proposed 'encoding menu in the context menu' (<a title="suggestion: add right click menu item for Encoding"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13055">issue 13055</a>) may want to   access 'profile.recently_selected_encodings' to have the shortlist of   encodings to show in the context menu as opposed to the full encoding list   (which is rather long and is not suitable for the context menu). </pre>
