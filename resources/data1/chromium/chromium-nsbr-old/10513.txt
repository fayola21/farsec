<title>Issue 10513 -   chromium -    Paint issue with extensions in full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Assigning to aa for triaging.      1. I installed one of the extensions that adds an icon. (Talk to me if you   need details on how to repro).  2. I pressed F11 for full screen mode.    I noticed that even though there is no toolbar in full screen  the icon for   the extension shows through. </pre>
