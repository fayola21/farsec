<title>Issue 2877 -   chromium -    Advisory - Google Chrome Window Object Suppressing Denial of Service - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> *Issue:***  The Google chrome browser is vulnerable to window object based  denial of service attack. The Google Chrome fails to sanitize a check  when window.close() function is called. The window.close() function is  called in a suppressed manner by default which makes it vulnerable to  denial of service attack. This inability of Google Chrome diversifies the  attack pattern as number of events can execute this function without a  security check prompting a user to allow the event to trigger.    This security issue is a result of design flaw in the browser.Scripts must  not close windows that were not opened by script  if script specific  code is designed..    *Proof of Concept*  *<a href="http://www.secniche.org/gws/gws.zip*">http://www.secniche.org/gws/gws.zip*</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.secniche.org/gws">http://www.secniche.org/gws</a>&gt;  **<a href="http://www.secniche.org/gws/gws.rar*">http://www.secniche.org/gws/gws.rar*</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.secniche.org/gws&gt;*">http://www.secniche.org/gws&gt;*</a>    Your response awaited asap.
