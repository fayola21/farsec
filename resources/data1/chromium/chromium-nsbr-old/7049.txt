<title>Issue 7049 -   chromium -    RealPlayer plugin area is being clipped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~cczrmg/accordent/pmzcc1/20080616-093701-">http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~cczrmg/accordent/pmzcc1/20080616-093701-</a>  IH01/rnh.htm  2. Look at the left side of the RealPlayer window -- it looks like several   vertical lines of pixels aren't showing.    The RealPlayer plugin area should not be clipped.  Running with alternate user-agent strings doesn't fix the issue  so it's   most likely a compat issue  not an evangelism issue.     </pre>
