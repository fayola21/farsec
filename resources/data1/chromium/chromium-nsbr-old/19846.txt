<title>Issue 19846 -   chromium -    Tabs fail to open in extensions with message &quot;Error during undefined: No current window&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Official Build 23673) - Windows and Mac  (OS X 10.5.8)      1. Load chrome with the attached extension      A tab opens with google.com loaded      Most of the time  the above.  Occasionally  no tab is opened  and the  message &quot;Error during undefined: No current window&quot; appears in red in the  console log.    Seemingly caused by the Chrome window not fully loading before trying to  add a tab.    Much easier to reproduce on Mac  as it loads Chrome slower than Windows.   Adding a delay of 10s before opening the tab fixes the issue.    Having some way of catching the error from the extension would be very  useful (perhaps some kind of error callback?) </pre>
