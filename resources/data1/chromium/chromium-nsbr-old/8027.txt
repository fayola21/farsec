<title>Issue 8027 -   chromium -    Web content autofill dropdown does not close when toggling fullscreen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe  we should close auto-complete popup  if user switches to  FullScreen mode. That will be easiest way to fix it (?)    -Bring up auto-complete pop-up  -Switch to Full Screen mode    Result:  Auto-complete popup shows in the original location prior to full screen mode.          </pre>
