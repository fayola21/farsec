<title>Issue 21627 -   chromium -    Sometimes window dragging mode gets enabled without the possibility to anchor the window back - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	4.0.208.0 (Developer Build 25971)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.10  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.208.0 Safari/532.0    I usually close a tab with two buttons click emulating a middle click    sometimes it happens that tab dragging is activated instead and it can't be   anchored (clicking Esc doesn't help either)  the only solution is to kill   Chromium as the minimised window keeps following the mouse. </pre>
