<title>Issue 22410 -   chromium -    Moles don't work on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2 (Official Build 26474)    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A (don't have Windows computer)      1. Download and install mole test toolstrip   (<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/ext">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/ext</a>  ensions/samples/mole/)  2. Click on the toolstrip.        A mole should appear with height equals to 400 pixels.        Although mole content becomes visible  I can also see part of the toolstrip   and the mole itself is as tall as the extensions bar.    ***I was trying to add a mole to my extension but could not make it work.   Then I decided to try a sample and downloaded the extension mentioned   above. It did not work. I am not sure if this is expected behavior for Mac   version. </pre>
