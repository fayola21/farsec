<title>Issue 614 -   chromium -    Deleting half finished search terms from omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                  1. Type goo (google) I hit enter by accident (no suggestion offered on   keyword I used)a/ (was meant to be adwords)  2. Then retype goo it comes as top result with no way of deleting individual result?       I would hope to be able to hit delete like in firefox and remove the entry      Nothing I can see  delete  backspace and any combination of key + del would   work?      Regards.    </pre>
