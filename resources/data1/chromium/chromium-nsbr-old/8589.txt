<title>Issue 8589 -   chromium -    If spell check is disabled  disable the 'Check the spelling of this field' menu item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 2.0.169.0    1. On a textarea  right-click &gt; Spell-checker options &gt; Language   settings...  2. Uncheck the Check spelling box and click OK  3. Right-click &gt; Spell-checker options    EXPECTED:  Check the spelling of this field should be disabled (at least it should be   unchecked).    ACTUAL:  Check the spelling of this field is enabled and checked.    NOTE: If we don't disable the menu item (just turn off the checkbox)  then   we have to be able to somehow only enable spell checking for this one   field. That seems harder than disabling the menu item. </pre>
