<title>Issue 7039 -   chromium -    Tab auto-resize fails when docking a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  expand window to fill all horizontal space on the monitor.  2. Open 10 tabs (or however many are required to use all horizontal space   on your monitor)  3. Drag a tab off to the side to 'dock' the tab (select a position that   will automatically tile the resulting 2 windows)      Tabs in the original and new window should resize to fit the new window   sizes.        Tabs in the original window now with 9 tabs will be the original size so   they will not all display.    Tabs will not resize when the window is again expanded/contracted.  Adding   a new tab and removing it seems to restore tab resizing functionality.      Please provide
