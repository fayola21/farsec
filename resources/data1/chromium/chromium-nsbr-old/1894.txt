<title>Issue 1894 -   chromium -    Flash issue : &quot;streaming&quot; sound loaded with loadSound() does not stop downloading when calling sound.stop() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : www.awdio.com           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. loadSound(URL  true) // true means &quot;streaming sound&quot;  2. sound.stop()    Compiled under Flash 8.      The sound should stop downloading.      The sound stops as expected  but the browser does not close the connection.  After a few sounds  the browser gets &quot;saturated&quot; and does not play anymore  sounds. Plus  the bandwidth usage is of course high.    I am the CTO of the company. So you can contact me if you need any further  information : frederic.olivie on the same domain.   </pre>
