<title>Issue 11187 -   chromium -    'X' button [Window's control] stucks with mouse hover state with 'download is in progress' confirmation dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has been introduced when we implemented download is in progress   confirmation dialog.    -Have one instance of chrome window.  -Start downloading a file  -Click on &quot;X&quot; button (on title bar) to close the window.    If you dismiss/don't dismiss the 'download is in progress' dialog  notice the   'X' button still maintains the mouse hover state.   </pre>
