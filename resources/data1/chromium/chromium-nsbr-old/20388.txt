<title>Issue 20388 -   chromium -    Look of minimize/maximize/close buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.204.0 (Developer Build 24601)  OS + version : Linux      1. build latest chrome  2. don't use system window deco  3. select GTK theme  4. compare the look of those minimize/maximize/close buttons to a revision   from a few days (yesterday?) ago      The buttons used to have a more &quot;3d-ish&quot; look  now they are totally flat.   Also  the highlight was filling the whole button  now only the edges are   highlighted. The old look used to blend very nice into GNOME (using the   default theme)  this one does not.    </pre>
