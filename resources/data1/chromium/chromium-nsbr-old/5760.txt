<title>Issue 5760 -   chromium -    Capitalize all the access keys in Korean - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Korean      All.          All over the translation. For example:  &lt;translation id=&quot;3909791450649380159&quot;&gt;��__��_��__��_�␕�_��_(&amp;amp;t)&lt;/translation&gt;    The Korean translator seems to have no experience on GUI translation. Some  access keys were written in lowercases in the same way of the English  strings  but they should be written in uppercases.    The upper/lower makes no difference in Korean translation so conventionally  they are written all in uppercase. All known Korean GUI desktops use the  same convention.         </pre>
