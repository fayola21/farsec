<title>Issue 22192 -   chromium -    Merge WebPreferences and RendererPreferences into RenderProcessSettings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently have two sets of preferences that we send down to each webview.    It turns out that these preferences are actually global preferences and it   would be easier to just send them down at render process creation (currently   we send it during render view creation).    The proposal is to merge them into a RenderProcessSettings that gets passed   in with we create the renderer. </pre>
