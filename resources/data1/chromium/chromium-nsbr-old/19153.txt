<title>Issue 19153 -   chromium -    password manager can't handle google apps across multiple domains - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 3.0.197.11    I regularly use Google apps across four domains:    <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?..">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?..</a>.  <a href="https://www.google.com/a/google.com/ServiceLogin?..">https://www.google.com/a/google.com/ServiceLogin?..</a>.  <a href="https://www.google.com/a/linus.com/ServiceLogin?..">https://www.google.com/a/linus.com/ServiceLogin?..</a>.  <a href="https://www.google.com/a/upson.org/ServiceLogin?..">https://www.google.com/a/upson.org/ServiceLogin?..</a>.    The chrome password manager can't figure out that these are different login   pages. It would be great if it could.    Brett  Stuart  I'm sending this your way since you seemed to have done   checkins to the password manager recently but feel free to send it on if   someone else would be better. </pre>
