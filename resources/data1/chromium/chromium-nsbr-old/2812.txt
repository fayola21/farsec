<title>Issue 2812 -   chromium -    Using Ctrl+F on New-tab-page causes text rendering issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)    Other browsers tested:  n/a      0. Make sure the New-tab-page is enabled in options.  1. Open a new tab.  2. Press Ctrl+F  enter a string or single character that occurs several   times on your new-tab-page  for example 'a' or 'e'.  3. Press F3 repeatedly.      Searching for text should work as on regular web pages.  Or: Searching for text should be disabled for the new-tab-page.      Text begins to overlap and even disappears.    Attached:  Partial screenshot of my new tab page after searching for 'a'  then holding   down the F3 for a few seconds.     </pre>
