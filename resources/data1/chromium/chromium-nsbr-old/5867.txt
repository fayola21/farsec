<title>Issue 5867 -   chromium -    Javascript window.moveTo(0 0) Problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : www.bestimage.com.tr         Safari 3: No Test      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Enter the site and let the popup open  2. Popup opens. If I place  window.resizeTo(350 350)  window.moveTo(0 0)  code in popup window  popup is opened maximized.    If I only place window.resizeTo(350 350)  popup opens in coordinates like   200 0 but it must also be opened in 0 0 because javascript code in source   page has top=0 left=0.        I expect that popup should open in 0 0 with and without moveto and   size(350 350).        Instead it opens in full or 350 350 dimension with something like 200 0   coordinate.   </pre>
