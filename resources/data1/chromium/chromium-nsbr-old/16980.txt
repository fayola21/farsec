<title>Issue 16980 -   chromium -    Slow loading of scripts .. maybe proxy related - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.1 (Official Build 19007)  URLs (if applicable) : localhost                There is a considerable slowness in the loading of script files  the twist  here is that if Fiddler is active then the delay is reduced by a big  margin. Since Fiddler acts as the proxy so I played with all the possible  IE proxy settings but nothing helped.    My test page is as following (with references to 16 copies of jQuery ..all  are same except for their names).    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;          var startTS = (new Date()).getTime();      &lt;/script&gt;      &lt;script src=&quot;jquery.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;script src=&quot;jquery (2).js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;script src=&quot;jquery (3).js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   ...          &lt;script src=&quot;jquery (16).js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;          alert((new Date()).getTime() - startTS);      &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;      IE8 reports a time of ~300ms in the alert  the timings for Chrome were much  larger. I captured the resource load in the developer tools and it was  around 2 sec with Fiddler enabled and around 6 sec otherwise. Granted  the  developer tool adds some delay of its own but still there is a considerable  time taken to process the scripts. In addition  the graph is staggered by 4  loads .. is that some kind of parsing/locking limitation.     </pre>
