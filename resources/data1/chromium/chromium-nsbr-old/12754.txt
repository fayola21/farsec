<title>Issue 12754 -   chromium -    &quot;Resolving host&quot; takes forever; disabling prefetching helps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1 (Official Build 16409)  URLs (if applicable) : Just about all of them -- esp. Google search results           Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK            IE 7:OK            IE 8:OK      1. Just browse the web like normal  2. In some cases  when you click a link  Chrome says &quot;Resolving host&quot; for   multiple seconds.    3. Page loads.        Chrome says &quot;Resolving host&quot; for no more than a second.      Chrome says &quot;Resolving host&quot; for multiple seconds.    This happens frequently with Google search results  and sites that haven't   been visited in the past.  Usually  when you go to a site for the first and   this occurs  it won't happen again for that site.  But that's not always   the case. </pre>
