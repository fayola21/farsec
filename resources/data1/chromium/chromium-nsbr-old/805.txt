<title>Issue 805 -   chromium -    User experience is crummy over remote desktop (RDP) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Connect to a Windows XP machine over RDP.  2. On the remote XP machine  run Chrome.  3. Open new tabs  download files      Things don't grind to a halt.      Fade animations are really slow.  In particular  when you initially start  Chrome  the new tab thumbnails fade in slowly.  When you download a file   there's a big animated arrow that appears in the lower left corner.    Also  the thumbnails in the new tab are great locally  but over RDP it  means that they're additional bitmaps that need to be transmitted over the  wire  making them much less performant than a blank tab.    Please provide
