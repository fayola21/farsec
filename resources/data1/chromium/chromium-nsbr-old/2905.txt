<title>Issue 2905 -   chromium -    Delayed redraw of non-visible tabs on resize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch Chrome (non-maximized) and open two tabs (preferably long pages    so they have scroll bars)  2. Resize the browser window (make it wider  by dragging the bottom corner   to the right)  3. Switch to the other open tab      The other tab should have already redrawn itself (and its scrollbar should   be all the way to the right of the screen).      For a brief second  I see the scrollbar in its old location. Then  there is   a flicker  the page redraws to fill its new dimensions  and the scrollbar   moves all the way to the right  as expected.    Please provide
