<title>Issue 5277 -   chromium -    Reopen closed tag with Ctrl+Z - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: don't know  but think that FAIL        Opera 9: OK      1. Open 2 or more tabs.  2. Close one of them.  3. Press Ctrl+Z.      Closed tab opens again.      Nothing.    It is more convenient to me to reopen tabs with Ctrl+Z  as it is in Opera.   This has certain sens: reopening tab is like undo it's closing in context   of &quot;editing&quot; tabs list.    Moreover  I use globaly defined action for Ctrl+Shift+T. And I can't use   for it another shotcut cause it is a part of shotcut set that lets me   perform text cursor movements  text selections and something else with   right hand on its default typing position (H  T  N  S buttons in Dworak   layout)  i.e without moving hand to arrows keys. </pre>
