<title>Issue 2671 -   chromium -    Tabstrip Overlaps Control Box in Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open and maximise Chromium.  2. Open enough tabs to fill the tab bar along the top. I'm using 1280x1024   and 7 seems to be the magic number for me.      The tabs should shrink to ensure that they are kept to the left of the   window control buttons.      The tabstrip overlaps the buttons  making it very difficult to use the   chrome tab controls in that corner.    Please provide
