<title>Issue 12465 -   chromium -    programmatically inject scripts from an extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a conversation with an extension developer today  they'd like a way to   programatically inject scripts  or a way to dynamically update the user   script match list.  The issue is that they've got rules that define which   URLs to modify  and those URLs are dynamic and come from their servers. </pre>
