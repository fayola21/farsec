<title>Issue 5993 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Open links in incognito mode automatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When Google Chrome is set as the default browser  and a web link from a   program is clicked  the browser always opens in non-incognito mode. It   would be nice if users could run the entire browser in Incognito mode so   when links are clicked (and the browser is closed)  it would open in   Incognito mode. </pre>
