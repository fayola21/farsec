<title>Issue 22332 -   chromium -    gyp trigger (hook) is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Someone must have recently done something to GYP to make it do .grd   introspection.  I'm not positive  but I think it was Brad.    This means that we need to re-run GYP via the hook any time a file that might   affect GYP's output changes.    I just spent a not-so-fun half hour trying to figure out why a few builders   were screwed up.  Turns out  they had some bad info from a .grd file that had   changed.  When the .grd changed. no .gyp did  so GYP never re-ran.  The   now-deleted .grd files were still referenced in the GYP-generated .scons files    though.  Bad. </pre>
