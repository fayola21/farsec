<title>Issue 7063 -   chromium -    Middle click closes tab  even when you move your mouse away before releasing (if you've changed your mind) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43                  1. Middle click to close tab  but then  if you change your mind and while   holding middle click down  move pointer away from tab  and then release    the tab still closes.      It should cancel the close if you release middle click while not focused on   the tab.        The tab closes anyway       </pre>
