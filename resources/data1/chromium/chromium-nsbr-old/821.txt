<title>Issue 821 -   chromium -    TAB's Problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>       When I open multiple tabs  a lot of tabs  the view of them is very bad       because each one is very small and unpractical.            A solution could be that Chrome allows a certain number of   tabs above and then  for more tabs opened  Chrome should show an   expand list with them or an horizontal-scroll buttons to navigate from side   to side.           Please provide
