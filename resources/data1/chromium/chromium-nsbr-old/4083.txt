<title>Issue 4083 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager doesn't have Minimize or Maximize/Restore buttons on title bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4462)        1. Bring up Bookmark Manager (Ctrl+Shift+B or menu).      The &quot;Minimize&quot; or &quot;Maximize&quot;/&quot;Restore&quot; buttons are not displayed on the  title bar of the Bookmark Manager window  yet the menu items &quot;Minimize&quot; and  &quot;Maximize&quot; (&quot;Minimize&quot; and &quot;Restore&quot; if the window is maximized) are  enabled. Double-clicking on the title bar is also enabled.      For consistency:    If the intent is to disallow Minimize and Maximize/Restore  then the menu  items should be disabled (and double-clicking on the title bar to  maximize/restore would also then be disabled).    If the intent is to allow Minimize and Maximize/Restore  then these buttons  should be displayed on the title bar.   </pre>
