<title>Issue 11908 -   chromium -    Detect corrupted profile and recover gracefully - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If your profile becomes corrupted  Chrome launches and exits silently. Simply   creating a new profile fixes the problem. Chrome should detect this case and   create a new profile automatically (along with an apologetic message   delivered via an infobar) rather than leave users hanging.    The message should say something like &quot;Rats! Chrome can't open your bookmarks   and browser history. Learn more&quot; </pre>
