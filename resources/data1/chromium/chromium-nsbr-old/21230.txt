<title>Issue 21230 -   chromium -    Page loading sucks when page allocated to swapped out process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Use a computer with 2GB RAM (e.g. laptop)  Use lots of tabs  apps (e.g. photoshop) etc  leave open for a while. You   should have enough processes that the system will attempt to reuse existing   ones instead of creating new ones.    Now that many Chrome processes are swapped out  open a new tab and load a   URL.    Note that it takes forever  since the new site navigation was allocated to a   swapped out process that must now be yanked back.    This is horrid and makes Chrome feel degraded. The solution is to restart so   all its processes are hot  or use task manager to kill them. </pre>
