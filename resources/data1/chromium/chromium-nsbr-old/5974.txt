<title>Issue 5974 -   chromium -    Add DEFER annotation back to layout-test lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to postpone fixing some kinds of layout tests  in particular some  of the ones dealing with HTML5 features we haven't yet implemented.  So we  need a DEFER annotation for tests_fixable.txt again.  The pass/fail status  of deferred tests should be tracked separately from the rest. </pre>
