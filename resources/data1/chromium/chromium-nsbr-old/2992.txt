<title>Issue 2992 -   chromium -    Do Not Remove History Lines on Click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Visit a website to create a line in Chrome's history viewer.  2. Wait at least one minute.  3. Click the history line to revisit the same page.    What is the expected result? An additional (duplicate) history line will be  added above the existing history line  with the new timestamp.      What happens instead? The old history line is removed  and replaced with  the new history line with the new timestamp.    This is a problem in a scenario where I want to be able to recreate a web  browsing session  or detect and/or identify unauthorized users who have  accessed my computer.  The situation that brought this about was an  unauthorized user using my computer  and using Chrome to access personal  data.  Upon visiting Chrome's history page and clicking the links to see  what was accessed  the original log and corresponding timestamps were lost.   Had this been  for example  a law enforcement matter  or otherwise a  situation where I needed the precise log data to be preserved  I would have  been out of luck.  History should not be modified just because I revisit  the same page - it should be preserved until archived as usual. </pre>
