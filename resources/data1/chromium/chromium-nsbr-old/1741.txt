<title>Issue 1741 -   chromium -    Have files named diffently until finished - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When downloading .rar files which have 10 parts and part 5 is still   downloading I usually start unpacking the rar file already and winrar will   be done 60% so I can use the data faster but when the file exists it gives   me errors that the file is broken if its not there it waits for it. </pre>
