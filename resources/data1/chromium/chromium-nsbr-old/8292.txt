<title>Issue 8292 -   chromium -    Cannot use formatting menu in Google Sites (Jotspot) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to sites.google.com and start editing a page  2. In the (rich text) editor  scroll down (the issue is worse when   scrolling is involved).  3. Select one or more words with the mouse  then click on &quot;Format&quot; or any   other menu option.      In Firefox 3  it shows the Format options as a list right below the   &quot;Format&quot; button.      When no scrolling is involved  it might show the Format menu list somewhere   at the bottom of the screen.  If scrolling is involved  it doesn't show anything (= the format options   are not shown / completely broken).    Please provide
