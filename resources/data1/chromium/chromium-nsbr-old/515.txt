<title>Issue 515 -   chromium -    Text is sometime squashed when page is rendered (text becomes very difficult to read) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Although not strictly a bug  the font that is sometime used to render a   page is incredibly difficult to read. I have been creating web services   with VS2005 and the test pages for the web service contain examples of the   SOAP method calls. In IE these are incredibly easy to read  however in   Chrome there seems to be some attempt to squash the text to fit the window   and the font is therefore very difficult to read. My understanding is the   IE uses smoothfont technology to make the text easier to read and some   similar feature in Chrome is really needed. We all spend a lot of time   looking at web pages and the font used and the way the text is rendered is   incredibly important. Otherwise so far I've been impressed ...                     Please provide
