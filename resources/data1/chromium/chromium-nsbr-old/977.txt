<title>Issue 977 -   chromium -    Igoogle is slow  esp with the clock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : igoogle            Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. dragging around the igoogle boxes seems sluggish. I tested on FF and IE   while Chrome is open and its fine  but in Chrome itself it is slow. CPU   usage seems to spike to 100% of one core  same as FF and IE7  however there   is noticeable lag in Chrome.    It might be something to do with having to stretch the page wrapper to be   wider  because it didn't seem to be slow when I was moving the mouse around   to locations that didn't change the width.    By dragging around  i mean holding left click  and moving the mouse fairly   rapidly around the screen  changing the location of the selected box.      Be uber fast  seeing as V8 is supposed to ;)      Lagy    </pre>
