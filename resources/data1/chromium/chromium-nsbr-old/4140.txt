<title>Issue 4140 -   chromium -    Assertion when allocating large &lt;canvas&gt; elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a canvas element is too big and the allocation fails  the renderer will   crash.    This is a CHECK(0) on the error  so it should not be exploitable.    For canvas allocation failures  we should be able to handle the case more   gracefully  like returning some 1x1 bitmap. </pre>
