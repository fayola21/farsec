<title>Issue 2128 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Identifying resource hungry tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The ability to view the resources each tab is using struck me as a really  nice feature. This would theoretically enable you to determine which tabs  are eating up your cpu and/or memory and deal with them. The problem is  it  doesn't.    Significant resource usage often is from a plugin the page uses  for  example  an embedded flash object. However  the resources that a plugin is  using are not shown under the tabs that use that plugin  they're shown  under the plugin. Even if 3 tabs are using flash  the resources that flash  is using are all shown under &quot;Plug-in: Shockwave Flash&quot;. If the flash  object in one of the tabs is using significantly more cpu than the other 2   you have no way of telling which tab is the culprit.    I propose a hierarchical display in the task manager. Tabs in the task  manager would by default be collapsed  but when you expand them  you would  see what plug-ins the tab is using. The plug-ins under the tab would list  their resource use that is local to that tab. The tab's resource use would  be equal to its resource use plus the sum of the resource use of the  plug-ins under it.    I don't know if this can be (easily) done  but I do know that if it isn't   then the task manager won't be much use to me. </pre>
