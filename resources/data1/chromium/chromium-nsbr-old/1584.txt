<title>Issue 1584 -   chromium -    FEATURE: Automatically put clipboard (copy) into onmibox when making new tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27    When you copy a URL  and make a new tab (CTRL-T) Chrome should look to see   if you have a URL in your clipboard  and automatically enter this into the   omnibox on the new tab. (Or even automatically go to this url).    Chrome can also be smart  and even if a URL isn't in the paste  perhaps if   the clipboard was recently copied from another tab  and then moments after   you just copied  you make a new TAB  it should regonize this and have this   automatically in the onmibox for quick searching.      People copy things to hopefully do a quick Google search on the copied   item.  If chrome can do this  it would be very helpful.  I often find   myself copying words or phrases or URLS  then CTRL-T and pasting them into   onmibox to search.  Would be nice if chrome realized I was making a new tab   to search these copied items and help me with this. </pre>
