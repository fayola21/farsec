<title>Issue 6872 -   chromium -    Want &quot;Add Search Engine&quot; context menu option in content search fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now users who know about keywords and want to add one have to right-  click the address bar and open the keyword editor  where they type their   input manually.  Firefox makes this easier: it puts an &quot;Add Keyword For   This Search&quot; context menu item on search boxes in content.  We should do   the same.    Note: We already have a string for this in place. </pre>
