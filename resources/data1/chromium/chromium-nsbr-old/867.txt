<title>Issue 867 -   chromium -    Non-icognito window knows about the opened incognito page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open new tab  2. Open an incognito window  3. shift-esc kill the new tab  4. reload the new tab      Would think I'd get the new tab page      I get the &quot;You've gone incognito.&quot; Page.  This implies some data-sharing  between normal tabs and incognito tabs  which seems mostly horrible    Please provide
