<title>Issue 5082 -   chromium -    History Maintenance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    This is a feature request not a bug (as far as I know).  The ability to   clear history that is greater than 7 days would be useful.  I understand   the current history maintenance allows for deletion of items within the   past 24 hours  1 week  1 month.  However  if we are able to go the other   direction - delete anything past 24 hours  1 week  1 month  that would be   more useful.  Oftentimes  I want the material from the last 7 days or 1   month  but would rather delete the older items - such is not possible with   the current features. </pre>
