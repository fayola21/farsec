<title>Issue 11040 -   chromium -    FYI : integrity level misreported by Proccess Explorer .... (an MS bug  not yours) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.0 (14559)    i post this FYI  as when i first saw it i thought you managed to screw   something with the renderer processes    what i had (and have) is that i sometimes saw the the renderer process runs   with integrity level medium  which i thought ?????  and i was kinda happy to know i found a bug in your program  but then i   thought &quot;could it be this is a bug in proccessExplorer (11.33) ?&quot;  so i killed it  and re-run it  and yes! the integrity of that same process   is back to low again!    it is not very easy to reproduce  but happens always at some point  maybe if i am bored  i will report this in the sysinternals forum  but not   sure    (and yes  i know how to recognize jobs in windows  and i know how to tell a   --target=renderer from the plugins  and YES this is a MS bug)   </pre>
