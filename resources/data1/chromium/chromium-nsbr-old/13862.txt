<title>Issue 13862 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: about:version is missing most information on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : Chromium - built from src@18158  OS             : x86_64 GNU/Linux (kernel 2.6.24)    Problem doesn't seem to reproduce on Windows (tested with src@18142).            1. Navigate to about:version.          I expect to see something ala:      Chromium: 3.0.189.0 (Developer Build 18158)      WebKit: 531.0          V8: 1.2.7.1  User Agent: &lt;....&gt;          All the version numbers and some of the strings are missing. It looks   something like this:              : ( )      WebKit:	            :  User Agent:	     </pre>
