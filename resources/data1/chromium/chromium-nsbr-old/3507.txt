<title>Issue 3507 -   chromium -    Right click in email compose box  selects the entire text some times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. type some flaky text in Gmail internet compose box.  2. Right click on each word and add to dictionary.  3. Repeat step2 for all of the words as fast as you can.    We can notice 2 issues  at some point of time.    1) Right click on word  brings up context menu of previous word��_��_��_s context   menu.     (I believe this issue is covered in some of the bugs  just exploring   here)    2) At some point of time  right click on a word selects the entire text.  This is really annoying behaviour. I can easily reproduce it every time. </pre>
