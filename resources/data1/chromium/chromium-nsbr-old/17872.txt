<title>Issue 17872 -   chromium -    install-build-deps.sh silently ignores apt-get failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. To reproduce  Apt-get must have some difficulty installing the exact   versions install-build-deps.sh asks for. This is the case on my Ubuntu   64bit 9.04 Machine. If this is not the case on your machine you can   intentionally break apt  e.g. with: mv /etc/apt/sources.list{ .bak}  2. dpkg -r gperf # just so that we have a package that should be installed  3. ./install-build-deps.sh  4. which gperf        I would expect that important packages such as gperf would be either   installed  or that I would be given some notification that they cannot be   installed  together with a list of packages that have to be manually   installed.        Important packages like gperf are silently not installed. Note that trying   to compile before gperf is installed cannot be fixed simply by installing   gperf and trying again  see e.g.:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/f08878972a5836d2?pli=1    Please provide
