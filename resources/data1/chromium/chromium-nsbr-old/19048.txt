<title>Issue 19048 -   chromium -    Yahoo mail compose is not rendering properly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on DEV - 197.11 and ToT(r 23025)    -Login to yahoo mail CLASSIC a/c.  -Click on compose link.    Result:  As shown in the screenshot  compose page shows first with small tiny input  boxes (To/CC/BCC/Subject). After few seconds  the input boxes rendered  properly  but the text is overlapped with 'Attach file' button.    It reproduces consistently at least for me. Happy to demo you  if required.    FYI: My yahoo a/c is clubbed with att.net  not sure if that makes any  difference.  </pre>
