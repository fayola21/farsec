<title>Issue 9652 -   chromium -    Ctrl+shift+T should restore the tab in the correct location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Close a tab somewhere in the tab strip  2. Hit Ctrl+Shift+T      I expect the tab to show up in the exact same location. Instead  it shows  up at the end of the tab strip. This is confusing.    Solution: preserve the tab position when restoring tabs. I know this is  tricky when the tabs have changed order  things have been closed  etc. but  as a first step  just remembering the absolute index should work correctly  90% of the time. </pre>
