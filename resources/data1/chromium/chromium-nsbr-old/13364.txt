<title>Issue 13364 -   chromium -    [regression] test_shell sizing is not synchronous - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After the message loop changes in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17357">r17357</a>  we started getting failing layout   tests due to the test shell window not getting sized properly.    It seems that the SizeTo() call is not synchronous.  (It never was before    but somehow these message loop changes made it worse.) </pre>
