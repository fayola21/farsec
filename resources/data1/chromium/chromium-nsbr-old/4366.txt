<title>Issue 4366 -   chromium -    tab name didn't update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 5249  URLs (if applicable) :  www.fedcourt.gov.au and facebook.com    Haven't been able to reproduce it  but the attached screenshot shows that   the tab name failed to update.    I was on  www.fedcourt.gov.au and type facebook.com into the Omnibox.  The browser went to facebook  but failed to rename the tab.      Chromium renames the tab      It didn't.    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.   </pre>
