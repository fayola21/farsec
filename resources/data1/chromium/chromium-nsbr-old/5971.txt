<title>Issue 5971 -   chromium -    Issue in this interface  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Language] Spanish    [Version number]1.0.154.36    [OS details] windows vista    [Where is the poor translation?]nothing    [attach any screenshots below] no      google chrome error is that you can not write e-mail from www.hotmail.com   and from correo.orange.es     For information on these sites inform me that the mistake is that Google   Chrome does not accept the interfaces of these two sites.     I want to continue using hotmail. In your beta  worked properly and was   very well written e-mail  but have since released the final version does   not work when writing email from these two sites.     I hope you correct  but because I have to use other browsers  I do not   like.     A greeting.   </pre>
