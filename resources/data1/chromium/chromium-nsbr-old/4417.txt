<title>Issue 4417 -   chromium -    Crome does not allow user to open more than one browser per webmail.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Like Firefox  Safari - Crome allows user only to be hooked on one webmail   (gmail.). Trying to open the second gmail in a new browser  no problem -   but then you are logged of the first account.... Irritating when you have   to work with up to 5-6 webmails at the same time..    Until you fix this bug - I have to work with IE - where  sorry - this   problem does not exist :-)    Have never used a browser that is SO fast - respect for this product!    BR  Bent  Denmark </pre>
