<title>Issue 12331 -   chromium -    Dns Prefetching is disabled (sometimes). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.180.0  URLs (if applicable) : about:dns    I wonder why when I'm going to about:dns I've got message:  Dns Prefetching is disabled.    I haven't change anything.  And when I'm going to my configured website on Apache  it's says:  &quot;The web page at null ...  Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): Unknown error.  &quot;  I've tested on Firefox  it's working fine.    It could be related to:  <a title="can't connect to apache localhost with no interner connection" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5234"> Issue 5234 </a>  But with that difference  that I've got working internet connection.   </pre>
