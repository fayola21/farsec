<title>Issue 9351 -   chromium -    Mem leak in media_unittests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Valgrind on Mac thinks that media_unittests leaks memory.  We'll soon be enabling auto-analysis on valgrind output  before which the detected leaks need to   be fixed (or suppressed).    I'm marking it to you since you were the last person to have touched this. If this is an error    please feel free to reassign to someone more appropriate (or bounce back to me).    The following is valgrind's output. (Refer waterfall for latest).    ==4169== 276 (28 direct  248 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 103 of   168  ==4169==    at 0xC4842F: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:217)  ==4169==    by 0xDEBF6C: HALCADClient::AddPropertyListener(unsigned long    AudioObjectPropertyAddress const*  long (*)(unsigned long  unsigned long    AudioObjectPropertyAddress const*  void*)  void*) (in   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/CoreAudio)  ==4169==    by 0xDEBE4E: HALDefaultDevice::InstallServerListeners() (in   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/CoreAudio)  ==4169==    by 0xDEBA77: HALDefaultDevice::Initialize() (in   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/CoreAudio)  ==4169==    by 0xDEA069: HALSystem::CheckOutInstance() (in   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/CoreAudio)  ==4169==    by 0xDF5C73: AudioHardwareGetProperty (in   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/CoreAudio)  ==4169==    by 0x1F661: AudioManagerMac::HasAudioDevices() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0x2CE7: MacAudioTest_PCMWaveStreamGetAndClose_Test::TestBody() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xB6BD1: testing::Test::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBB6C0: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::Run() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xC1834: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::RunTest(testing::TestInfo*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBC076: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestInfo*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestInfo*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestInfo*)) const (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBB5A9: testing::TestCase::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xC1818: testing::TestCase::RunTestCase(testing::TestCase*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBBEBC: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestCase*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestCase*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestCase*)) const (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBB416: testing::internal::UnitTestImpl::RunAllTests() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xBB50B: testing::UnitTest::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xF8BF: TestSuite::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)  ==4169==    by 0xEF0B: main (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/media_unittests)   </pre>
