<title>Issue 20577 -   chromium -    Add a button to load an extension from a folder in chrome://extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> People have problems with --load-extension  and it also stinks because it   requires you to restart the browser (you were probably in the middle of   reading something about how to write extensions).    We should instead have a [load extension] button in chrome://extensions that   opens up a browse dialog. </pre>
