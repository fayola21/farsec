<title>Issue 9579 -   chromium -    Javascript stopped when tab lost focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Compose new mail in RCMail  2. Hit the send button  3. Switch to another tab        The mail should send        As soon as I switched tabs - the JavaScript seems to be halted. They have a   little spinning logo which halts. The mail never sends. Once you switch   back to the tab  and click on the website  the logo starts spinning again.    I am currently running the beta version  which doesn't seem to suffer the   same problem. Having said that  I will still do more testing and advise.    <b>Please provide
