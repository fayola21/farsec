<title>Issue 4693 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager is not letting you edit the Title of bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested on XP and Vista  Chrome: V - 154.23    If you copy and paste couple of bookmarks in Chrome from Firefox it take   all the links name/URL's under 'Title' but only takes first link 'URL'    Then it will not let you edit or change the Title which is the text of   couple of bookmark links      1. Go to Firefox &gt; Bookmarks &gt; Organize bookmarks &gt; will open the bookmark   library properties window  2. Under 'All Bookmarks' &gt; Mozilla Firefox &gt; There are couple of links   select all and copy the all the links  3. Now under chrome press 'CTRL + SHIFT + B' to open the Bookmark Manager   properties window  4. You will observe that all the links get copied under one Bookmark   'Title' but it will only copy first link as 'URL'  5. Now if you try to 'Edit' it does not show all the text so not letting   you edit it      Should be able to edit the bookmark title    See Attached Screen Shot  ==========================           </pre>
