<title>Issue 22298 -   chromium -    Allow extensions to display the inspector's console output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The inspector's console is fantastic for extension developers.  Not only  does it provide an easy logging system but it also gives us access to any  errors that Chrome throws.  The Chrome errors are essential for helping us  figure out when and how things are going wrong.    Unfortunately  it's extremely difficult to describe to users how to access  the inspector's console.  I'd love it if the output were available (perhaps  as a chrome:// URL?) so I could just create a link for users. </pre>
