<title>Issue 19507 -   chromium -    omnibox autocomplete not working as expected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Developer Build 23308)    The URL bar does not follow standard linux text-field conventions:    1) Clicking a word in the URL bar should select the word-boundary-separated   word  not the whole URL. The whole URL should be selected on double click.  2) The autocomplete system is a complete usability mess. I want to select   the autocompleted URL  so I press enter  and inevitably search Google for   URL fragments. I've tried tab  but that does not finish the autocomplete.   Neither does space (which would be a gross solution). Down would be an okay   choice  but pressing the down arrow selects the *second* autocomplete   result  not the first. To select the first you have to press down and then   up. End works  but was the last thing I thought of. For this to match   existing linux autocomplete systems  please allow enter to select the   autocompleted field  or allow tab to do autocompletion and make the down   key select the first autocompletion suggestion. </pre>
