<title>Issue 20706 -   chromium -    rebaseline.py has a lot of options that seem useless - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was trying to use the rebaseline tool with the webkit canary bots and was confused by the variety of commandline options that all sounded similar. I ended up having to look at   the python code to figure out which one to use. Normally  I would say that we should improve the descriptions of the options  but in this case  I think many of these are just not   very useful. I think we could safely get rid of the options listed below.    All builders use the same filename here  no?    option_parser.add_option('-t'  '--archive_name'                              default='layout-test-results'                              help='Layout test result archive name.')    I don't see why someone would need this.    option_parser.add_option('-o'  '--no_html_results'                              action='store_true'                              default=False                              help=('If specified  do not generate html that '                                    'compares the rebaselining results.'))    This doesn't really seem to need controlling.    option_parser.add_option('-d'  '--html_directory'                              default=''                              help=('The directory that stores the results for '                                   'rebaselining comparison.'))    When would you actually need this?    option_parser.add_option('-c'  '--clean_html_directory'                              action='store_true'                              default=False                              help=('If specified  delete all existing files in '                                   'the html directory before rebaselining.'))    Just using the default browser on the machine seems fine. I doubt anyone will ever care enough to use this.    option_parser.add_option('-e'  '--browser_path'                              default=''                              help=('The browser path that you would like to '                                   'use to launch the rebaselining result '                                   'comparison html')) </pre>
