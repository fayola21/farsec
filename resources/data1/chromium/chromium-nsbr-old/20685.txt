<title>Issue 20685 -   chromium -    High CPU Usage with Flash (wmode=transparent) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use Flash          I would expect that my computer wouldn't catch fire just for using Flash.    ;-)  CPU usage is waaay too high with flash.      I start to look for smoke and flames coming from my CPU.  It generally runs   at less than 20% CPU  about the same as Firefox 3.5.  But my fan starts to   spin really fast and loud with Flash on Chromium  and it doesn't happen   with Firefox.    Please provide
