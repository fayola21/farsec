<title>Issue 12761 -   chromium -    Test theme alignment in maximized mode  fix TODO - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Theme alignment  specifically tabs over the frame background  hasn't been   properly tested in maximized mode.    Related  there is now a TODO in TabRenderer::PaintInactiveTabBackground() to   use an oracle function instead of a hardcoded constant to find the offset   within the frame background that tabs should start at.  This should be fixed   (and probably has to be fixed as part of the above). </pre>
