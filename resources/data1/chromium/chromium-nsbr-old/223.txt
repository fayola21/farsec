<title>Issue 223 -   chromium -    [V8] Inserting into DOM happens in a pseudo-random way (object properties not enumerated in insertion order) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Other browsers tested: IE6  IE7  FF2  FF3  Safari 3         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Loop over object properties with a switch inside (using jQuery $.each())  2. The case sections generate HTML on-the-fly  3. ...and insert this HTML into the DOM (for example in a table or list)      The list items should appear in the same order like in all the other  browsers on the market.      The order doesn't change on reload (so it's no totally random)  but is  still not the order of the properties in the object over which was iterated.    See screenshots.  </pre>
