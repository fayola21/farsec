<title>Issue 19943 -   chromium -    ��_��_��_Reveal in Finder��_��_��_ should be ��_��_��_Show in Finder��_��_��_ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download something.  2. Click on the triangle to see the download item's menu.      Observe: a menu item named ��_��_��_Reveal in Finder��_��_��_.  Expect: ��_��_��_Show in Finder��_��_��_.    Reveal in Finder doesn't sound very Mac-like to me.  Show in Finder is   better  and is what other Mac browsers use.    chrome/app/nibs/DownloadItem.xib    4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23673">r23673</a> (official dev channel) </pre>
