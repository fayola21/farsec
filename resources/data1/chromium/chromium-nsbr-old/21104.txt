<title>Issue 21104 -   chromium -    OSX page interaction super janky on restore tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have a bunch of tabs open  2. Crash Chrome and restart  3. Click the &quot;Restore those 17 tabs&quot; button.        All the tabs are coming back  which is great.  The first tab is Gmail  and while waiting I try to login    and things are super super super janky.  Selecting the password field to type into takes 4-5 seconds    then it will take another 4-5 seconds after I type my password before the dots are echoed.  Part of it   could be CPU contention in the renderer processes  but I'm kind of wondering if it couldn't also be   contention for the UI thread across all those tabs.   </pre>
