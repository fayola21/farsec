<title>Issue 12932 -   chromium -    Incorrect coordinate data reported when using postion: fixed div with a canvas inside - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28  URLs                 : <a href="http://mark-adams.info/canvas-test/bug-case.htm">http://mark-adams.info/canvas-test/bug-case.htm</a>   (attached)         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK (3.0.10  3.5b4)            IE 7: N/A (Needs Canvas)           IE 8: N/A (Needs Canvas)      1. Open the web page  2. Scroll down on the page  3. Move your mouse over the canvas and/or try to click on the ball      When the mouse is moved over the canvas  a red circle should appear under   the mouse. When a ball is clicked on  it should disappear from the canvas.      The red circle does not appear and the balls do not disappear when clicked.    I think this is an issue with how Webkit reports coordinates on fixed-  position elements during scroll. As stated above  FF3 displays the correct   behavior. Either FF has the behavior wrong or Webkit / Chromium does.    Try out the included or linked test case.   </pre>
