<title>Issue 19721 -   chromium -    Don't display user name in an editable text box when re-login is required  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead  the text box should be removed and user name should be displayed as   bold text  which is what Google Accounts does for certain services when the   user has already logged in to another Google service and the password is   required before logging in to the new service. This is more than a cosmetic   issue because the sync engine is not designed to allow changing username   (when re-logging in for example).     In addition  the text in red (&quot;User name and password do not match&quot;) and the   two links (&quot;Create an account&quot; and &quot;I cannot access my account&quot;) should be   removed. </pre>
