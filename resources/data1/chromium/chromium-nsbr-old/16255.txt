<title>Issue 16255 -   chromium -    Find on page box does not move out of the way if it is in the way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0 (Official Build 19969)  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : metacity      1. Go to this page: <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/find-in-page">http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/find-in-page</a>  2. Press Ctrl+F  3. Type &quot;Sea&quot;. Notice that there is one match  but where is it? It's under   the find box.  4. Scroll the page so that the find bar obscures a word  5. Type the word it obscures (you may have to reposition the page after   beginning to type the word  since the page will scroll when there are other   matches)      The correct behavior according to the above page is that it should slide   out of the way or scroll the page. This happens correctly on Windows.      The result is hidden by the find bar. </pre>
