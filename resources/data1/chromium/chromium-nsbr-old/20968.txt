<title>Issue 20968 -   chromium -    Subscribe extension fails to show feed preview for techcrunch.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you try to subscribe to the feed at techcrunch.com  the preview is empty   and if you look at the inspector  it reports an exception from   XMLHttpRequest.send().    This is probably related to the changes I recently submitted to enforce   cross-origin permissions. </pre>
