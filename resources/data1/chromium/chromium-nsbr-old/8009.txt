<title>Issue 8009 -   chromium -    When using the center click on the mouse to navigate within a page  the direction of navigation is incorrect relative to the locus of the arrow cross - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click the center mouse button to activate mouse relational navigation   within the page.  2. Move mouse closely around the arrow cross created by the center click.    Note the direction of the arrow in relation to the arrow cross.  3. Notice the incongruity based that the arrow points left when directly   under the arrow cross    It looks like  based on observation  that the arrow cross is at the top   left of a larger navigation locus  rather than at the center.  This means    if I put my mouse directly under the arrow cross icon  the page scrolls   down and to the left  rather than directly down  as it should.                Please provide
