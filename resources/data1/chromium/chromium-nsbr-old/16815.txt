<title>Issue 16815 -   chromium -    LD_LIBRARY_PATH is cleared when execing SUID binaries  so it's not passed to the zygote - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the SUID sandbox  certain environment variables (esp LD_LIBRARY_PATH)   are cleared for security reasons. This means that the child zygote process   isn't run with the correct environment and can fail to start.    Need to find the list of scrubbed envvars and re-establish the environment   for the child process. </pre>
