<title>Issue 23155 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcuts causing unwanted navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sites such as Tiwtter and Facebook that grab keyboard 'alt+1' shortcuts to   navigate between URLs.  When using the same shortcut to change tabs in   Chromium  the page will receive the keys as well as the browser.    To reproduce on http://twitter.com:    1. Open three tabs  with twitter.com in the 3rd.  2. Log in.  3. Search using the search box  4. Press alt+1 to navigate to the first tab.  5. Switch back to the third tab    I expect twitter to still be on the search page.   Instead  it has   navigated back to it's home page.    Firefox has the behaviour I expect.    Using chromium  tot  on Ubuntu Karmic x64. </pre>
