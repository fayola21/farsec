<title>Issue 12940 -   chromium -    Drawing problem - horizontal lines on picture after scrolling in Picasa - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 3.0.183.0 (Developer Build 17072)  URL = http://go/picasa-dashboard    IE7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari4: Not OK!  =&gt; looks like WebKit issue        1. Open page http://go/picasa-dashboard  2. Expand the jpg(32) folder from the left pane.  3. Select one of the items under jpg(32) to display corresponding picture.  4. Make sure the window is short enough in height so that the scroll bar  shows up for the right-hand pane. Scroll the right pane up/down.    What is the expected output?     Pictures should display normally after scrolling.    What do you see instead?    Drawing/redrawing problem:  Horizontal lines appear on picture after scrolling.   </pre>
