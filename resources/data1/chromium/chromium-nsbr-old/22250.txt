<title>Issue 22250 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Z in Gmail disables input focus from textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1 (Official Build 25376)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com/">http://mail.google.com/</a>      1. Click reply in an existing mail of Gmail  2. Type some words  3. Press Ctrl+Z to undo      The last change is undone  and you can type again.      The last change is undone  but you can't type again: the focus from the textarea is lost  and you have to click to keep typing.    I found this behavior only in Gmail: when typing this bug  I didn't find the problem. Also  it doesn't lose the focus 100% of the times  but almost always. </pre>
