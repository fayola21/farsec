<title>Issue 21758 -   chromium -    Explore SetWaitableTimerEx) as a way to save battery life - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We use SetTimer() and WM_TIMER on Windows. See MessagePumpForUI::ScheduleDelayedWork() in  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/base/message_pump_win.cc?view=markup">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/base/message_pump_win.cc?view=markup</a>    Windows 7 supports SetWaitableTimerEx() to add a 'TolerableDelay' (fuzz factor) to the timer   fire schedule. That would probably help battery usage by waking up the processor less often and   doing more at each wake up.  [Win7 MS folks where positive that it does help battery life.]    Contrary to SetTimer()  SetWaitableTimerEx() uses a kernel handle and may optionally fire an   APC function so it may be problematic to implement. Also  it is fairly possible that WM_TIMER   is already so imprecise that using SetWaitableTimerEx() doesn't help.    The only way to know for sure is to do a full implementation and do a test run on a win7 laptop   to see if it gives real advantage  thus putting it P3.    Note: Most javascript assumes 15 ms fuzz anyway so I think it'd be fine to start with 15 ms for   javascript events  maybe everything (?) as a test.    [Something similar probably be implemented on linux] </pre>
