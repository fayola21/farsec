<title>Issue 14089 -   chromium -    Support common OS X tab-switching shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0  OS version           : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): all shortcuts work  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): all shortcuts work      Chrome currently only supports Cmd-Alt-Left/Right for tab-switching on OS  X. The &quot;standard&quot; shortcuts are Cmd-{ and Cmd-}  and there's also Ctrl-Tab  and Ctrl-Shift-Tab. (The current shortcut should not be removed  though;  it's handy and also supported by Firefox and other popular applications)    Note that Firefox trunk (3.6) uses Ctrl-Tab for the tab-switching widget   similar to the system's Cmd-Tab  though 3.5 and Safari just use it the same  as the other shortcuts. </pre>
