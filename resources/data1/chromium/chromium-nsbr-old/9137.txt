<title>Issue 9137 -   chromium -    Vacuum chrome/browser/views of windows-specific cruft - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's lots of Windows-specific code in chrome/browser/views because it's   only ever been compiled on Windows. This code should be vacuumed:    - Replace HWNDs with gfx::NativeView/NativeWindow  - Move windows-specific stuff to appropriate win_util files  - Create abstractions where applicable  - Ifdef on last resort </pre>
