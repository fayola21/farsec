<title>Issue 19000 -   chromium -    Use real creator code for Keychain items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/browser/password_manager/password_store_mac.cc:20:    static const OSType kChromeKeychainCreatorCode = 'rimZ';    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/165290">http://codereview.chromium.org/165290</a> gives 'rimZ' to the branded Google   Chrome  and uses 'Cr24' for Chromium.  I've registered both codes.    Stuart  you were reluctant to do this in the past  but I think we should use the   app-appropriate creator code when interacting with the Keychain.  I think of   this as similar to giving Google Chrome and Chromium different default   profile directories  which is something else that we do.
