<title>Issue 3563 -   chromium -    The unconfirmed download prefix should be internationalized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For files that are potentially executable  we download to the file   'unconfirmed 34534.download'. We move the file to a new name only after the   user confirms that they want this download.    To make the filename more readable and understandable  we should make the   prefix a localized resource. (I don't see any reason to localize the   suffix.)    While we're at it  the prefix should be capitalized in English   ('Unconfirmed 2345.download').     </pre>
