<title>Issue 17164 -   chromium -    Delayed work not processed after wake from sleep? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to sleep  2. Wake up  3. Use URL bar      Expect dropdown.  Observe no dropdown.    After right-clicking somewhere to get a contextual menu  dropdown   functions again.    192.0.  Reproducible?  Likely not easily.  But I need to make sure that the   delayed work timer will fire after waking up from sleep  or something. </pre>
