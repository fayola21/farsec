<title>Issue 19500 -   chromium -    address bar not wisible in fullscreen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : gentoo package chromium-bin 0_p22046  OS + version : gentoo  window manager : e16      1. Run chromium under enlightenment.  2. Press window to fullscreen shortcut.     (note that this is fullscreen mode where you can't see any window  decoration  just fullscreen window.)  3. Now address bar is not wisible even when it's focused.        Either address bar is wisible all the time in fullscreen mode (as it is in  firefox) or pops out when gets focus (as it is in midori). </pre>
