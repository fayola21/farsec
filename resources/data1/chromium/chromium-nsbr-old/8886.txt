<title>Issue 8886 -   chromium -    Full screen thing doesn't eat mouse-down properly or something - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac time.    When restoring a tab from full-screen to a normal window  the mouse click  on the full-screen expandy thing bleeds through to whatever part of the  menu bar was &quot;behind&quot; it and is exposed when exiting full-screen mode.   This causes menu bar extras to open up once the mouse is moved  even though  nobody's actually clicking on those menu extras.      1. launch Chromium.app  2. click the full-screen expandy arrows at the right side of the URL bar  3. observe the tab filling the screen (good)  4. click the full-screen expandy arrows again  5. observe the tab is no longer a full screen (good)  6. move the mouse within the menu bar    What is the expected output?  The mouse should move freely within the menu bar.  No menus should open up.    What do you see instead?  As soon as the mouse is moved  the Fast User Switching menuExtra or the  date/time menuExtra will have its menu open.  This depends on which menu  item is beneath the mouse pointer.    When did this happen?  As long as there's been a Chromium.app on Mac.  I just never bothered  filing a bug.  Today  that changes. </pre>
