<title>Issue 15998 -   chromium -    Multi-value select boxes cannot do non-contiguous selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0 (ToT <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19940">r19940</a>)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/query.cgi?format=advanced">https://bugs.webkit.org/query.cgi?format=advanced</a>  OS version               : 10.6  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Possible  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Possible  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Possible      1. Select all values in a multi-option &lt;select&gt; box  2. Hold Option/Alt and click one of the options  3. All the values besides the one clicked in step 2 are now deselected.      The option key is used to allow non-contiguous selection on the mac.   When opt-clicking an item in the &lt;select&gt; list  that one option should   become deselected.      All the items but the just-selected item become deselected. It looks like   the behavior is still bound to the ctrl/Control key (from Windows) and just   needs to be rebound to the opt/alt key on Mac.    I'll take a stab at this. </pre>
