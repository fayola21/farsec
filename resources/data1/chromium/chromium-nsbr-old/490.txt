<title>Issue 490 -   chromium -    Plugins: NPStream.end sometimes is -1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : raptorsafari.com           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        1. As per NPAPI documentation  it does not say that -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) would  be a valid value in NPStream.end structure. However  for downloads started  with NPN_PostURLNotify/NPN_GetURLNotify  in NPP_NewStream callback the  NPStream.end is 0xFFFFFFFF.        NPAPI documentation states that for unknown size  zero should be provided  in .end member of the structure.          0xFFFFFFFF is passed as NPStream.end value.   </pre>
