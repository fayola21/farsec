<title>Issue 7718 -   chromium -    avis.co.il: Submit button for getting rental car quote is hidden. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To be clear this is not a bug report for Chrome on Windows.  This bug occurs in Firefox and will   also also affect the Mac version of Chrome when we release it.      1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.avis.co.il/">http://www.avis.co.il/</a> in Firefox or Safari.        The submit button for the bottom form on the left hand side is invisible so you can't submit the   form.    ___��__��_ _��____��__��_ _��__��____��__��__��_ _��____��_ _��__��__��__��_    Analysis:  The problem is that the frame containing the form is too small and the submit button is hidden.    Proposed solution:  Make the iframe a little taller so that the submit button is visible.  Be sure to check on Firefox/Safari on Mac OS X to make sure the button is visible there too.    Other browsers:  Firefox: FAIL  Safari: FAIL  Chrome: OK  IE7: OK </pre>
