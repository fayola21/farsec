<title>Issue 6783 -   chromium -    In FORCED_QUERY mode  don't show non-searches in Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we show them  and we screw them up somewhat: NavSuggest results   have a &quot;?&quot; prepended to fill_into_edit  which is wrong.    I see no reason to fix the goofed up ones as opposed to preventing them   from happening in the first place.  Seeing such results in this case is   weird. </pre>
