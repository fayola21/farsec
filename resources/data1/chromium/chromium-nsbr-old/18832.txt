<title>Issue 18832 -   chromium -    Regression: Tab resize problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553) and ToT  OS: Win Vista x64      1. Open some tabs till they are beginning to resize themselves  2. Close one tab  remain with your cursor on the tab bar and wait 1 second.      Tabs should not resize so that you can close another tab without moving the   mouse. Not until the cursor moves away they should resize.      After about 1 second the tabs resize.      NOTE that this just happens in non-maximized windows. </pre>
