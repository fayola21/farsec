<title>Issue 3662 -   chromium -    Numbering of duplicate downloaded files on Download page/shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 3783)        1. Go to page  <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~skylined/release/repro/Chrome/carpet%20bombing/carpet.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~skylined/release/repro/Chrome/carpet%20bombing/carpet.html</a>  2. When the Carpet Bombing dialog pops up (&quot;This site is attempting to  download multiple files. Do you want to allow this?&quot;  choose &quot;Allow&quot;.   3. Note the numbering of the duplicate downloaded files.    What is the expected output?     The downloaded files should be numbered in order  i.e. download.php   download (1).php  download (2).php  etc.    What do you see instead?    The downloaded files in the Download page and the Download shelf may have  multiple entries with the same number  i.e.  download.php  download  (1).php  download (1).php  download (1).php  etc.    The numbering of the actual downloaded files on the local drive looks OK.    See attached pictures.   </pre>
