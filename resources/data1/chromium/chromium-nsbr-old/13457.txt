<title>Issue 13457 -   chromium -    build/install-build-deps.sh tries to install libxcb-xlib0  which doesn't exist on Ubuntu Jaunty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just ran the build/install-build-deps.sh script on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04  (Jaunty) today.  The script failed because it couldn't install the  libxcb-xlib0 package.    This search shows that only Ubuntu Hardy and Intrepid have libxcb-xlib0:  <a href="http://ns2.canonical.com/search?keywords=libxcb-xlib0">http://ns2.canonical.com/search?keywords=libxcb-xlib0</a>    I removed the two occurrences of &quot;libxcb-xlib0&quot; from the  build/install-build-deps.sh script.  I was able to run the script  successfully and build and run chrome.  This shows we don't need the  libxcb-xlib0 package on Ubuntu Jaunty. </pre>
