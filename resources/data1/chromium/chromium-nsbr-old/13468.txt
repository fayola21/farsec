<title>Issue 13468 -   chromium -    Sometimes omnibox just stops working. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm still trying to repro this  Dimitri commented on it this morning  and I just   saw it  but it was different from what he saw.  The symptom is that when you   type in the omnibox  nothing happens  you just get the stuff you typed.    The difference was that Dimitri was able to type and when he hit enter  it went   to the thing you would expect it to go to if you had typed and it was working.    So you could type &quot;google&quot; and get &quot;www.google.com&quot;.  What I was seeing was   weird  the box did not update  but it didn't complete when I hit enter because   hitting enter didn't do anything at all. </pre>
