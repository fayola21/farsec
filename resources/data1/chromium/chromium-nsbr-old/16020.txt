<title>Issue 16020 -   chromium -    FFmpegDemuxer should be duplicating every packet of encoded data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The AVPackets returned from av_read_frame() are not guaranteed to be valid   after subsequent calls to av_read_frame().    Currently we are only duplicating them for MP3 packets  when we should be   duplicating every packet (we're getting lucky with the other formats).    There's already a packet-duplicating function written (see  ClonePacket() at   the top of media/filters/ffmpeg_demuxer.cc) -- it needs to be used and the   unit tests updated to expect duplicated packets. </pre>
