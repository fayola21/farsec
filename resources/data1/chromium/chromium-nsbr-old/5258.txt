<title>Issue 5258 -   chromium -    Autofill popup flickers when typing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a form with a field that will autofill  2. start typing        Notice that on every keystroke the popup flickers. This is because on key   down we immediately hide the popup. Instead of hiding immediately we should   wait until we get a response back  that way it won't flicker.       </pre>
