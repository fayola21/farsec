<title>Issue 2883 -   chromium -    Clicking the browser title bar with middle mouse button opens system menu  but should not - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)      1. Click the browser's window title bar by using the middle mouse button.      The click event shouldn't be handled by the browser.    Note that regular application windows don't even get WM_xBUTTONx messages   when the user clicks their title bar  but instead WM_NCxBUTTONx messages.      The window's system menu opens.       </pre>
