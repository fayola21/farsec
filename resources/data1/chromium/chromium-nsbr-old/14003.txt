<title>Issue 14003 -   chromium -    Dock menu crashes when selecting a closed window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Drop the attached file in /tmp or something.  2. Load it.  It will popup a window  wait five seconds  and close it.  3. While loading  right-click the Chrome icon.  4. After close  select the Untitled window.  5. Crash!    I would expect to have the dock menu updated  but that may be excessive.  At least we shouldn't   crash.    Replicated in v3.0.189 on Mac. </pre>
