<title>Issue 11450 -   chromium -    Linux: omnibox looks funky with dark system theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Attached are a couple images of the omnibox acting strange with a dark  system theme.    The image called background.png illustrates what appears to be a failure to  color part of the background white (the text field is instead the default  black). This problem goes away after navigating.    The image called text_color.png shows that the host part of the url is  white instead of black. I guess it's not explicitly setting the text color  to black  but is using the system default?    FWIW this was observed on KDE. (The infobar has similar problems that I'll  fix tomorrow) </pre>
