<title>Issue 21969 -   chromium -    Cache clean up gone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    Lost the ability to clean browser cache and so on in chrome  please see   attached jpg.     I have uninstalled and reinstalled chrome several times and still have the   same issue.  There needs to be a removal tool that will clean up all traces of chrome. I   have had on one system have chrome just so mess up that I had to go in to my   registry and remove it by hand. </pre>
