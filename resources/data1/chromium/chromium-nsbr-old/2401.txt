<title>Issue 2401 -   chromium -    &quot;save page as&quot; not working properly with .vbs files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open <a href="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/lhcode/janitor_0.2.1.vbs">http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/lhcode/janitor_0.2.1.vbs</a>  2. choose &quot;save page as&quot;        The filename name should be set and the file should be saved as a .vbs   file. See firefox behavior.      The save as dialog opens without any name set and if we put a name on it    it won't save it with a .vbs extension as it should.    Please provide
