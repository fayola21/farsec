<title>Issue 19488 -   chromium -    Tail of URL omitted with &quot;...&quot; on LinkInfoBar &quot;Did you mean to go to&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type some intranet URL (i.e. host name  e.g. a to access http://a/    Windows: Happens  Linux: Doesn't happen  Mac: Not checked    Version: Chromium 4.0.202.0 (23540)      - expected: Search result for &quot;a&quot; is shown and the info bar appear with a   message &quot;Did you mean to go to http://p/ ?&quot;  - actual: Info bar says &quot;Did you mean to go to http://... where the tail   of URL is omitted nonetheless there's enough space between &quot;/&quot; icon and   close button.    It seems that width passed to canvas-&gt;DrawStringInt in Label::Paint is a   bit small to fit the string. When I passed text_bounds.width() + 1 instead   of text_bounds.width()  there was no omission.   </pre>
