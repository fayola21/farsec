<title>Issue 9310 -   chromium -    Progress circle does not immediately appear when navigating away from new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (Official Build 12323)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open a new tab  2. Navigate anywhere that will take a few seconds to load        An indicator should appear where the favicon goes to show that the page is   loading or that the connection is being established.        No progress circle appears until the page actually starts loading and   rendering.    This is a regression and did not occur in 2.0.170.0 </pre>
