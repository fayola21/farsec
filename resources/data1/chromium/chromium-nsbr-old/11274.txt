Start Chrome.  Since it was maximized on last closing  the window starts   maximized.  2. Start a second Chrome window by double-clicking a Chrome icon (*not*   using the New Window shortcut)      The second Chrome window should also start maximized.      The second Chrome window starts in restored/regular mode.    This worked previously  so this is a Regression bug.
