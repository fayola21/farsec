<title>Issue 8880 -   chromium -    Some perf plots have more noise than error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For some perf plots  the difference in performance from one build to the  next is much larger than the reported per-build error. This is implausble  and worth investigation. It may be that there's a source of noise we can  eliminate  or maybe the error calculation is wrong.    For example  see  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/moz-http/report.html?history=50">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/moz-http/report.html?history=50</a>    (at least around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11879">r11879</a>). </pre>
