<title>Issue 9484 -   chromium -    Chromium continuous and snapshot builds should use the name &quot;chromium&quot; and &quot;chromium.exe&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     Continuous builds:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/</a>    Snapshot builds:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/</a>    The Chromium continuous and snapshot builds should create files with the name   &quot;chromium&quot; and create executables with the name &quot;chromium.exe&quot;.  Instead  they   currently have names like &quot;chrome-win32.zip&quot;  etc. with executables named &quot;chrome.exe&quot;.    Since these nightly builds are builds of Chromium  the about:version says Chromium  and   Wrench menu &gt; About Chromium  the files should be named chromium as well.    Also  more importantly  the executables should be named &quot;chromium.exe&quot; so that they   display as &quot;chromium.exe&quot; in the Windows Task Manager. </pre>
