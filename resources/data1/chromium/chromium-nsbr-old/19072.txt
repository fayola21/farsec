<title>Issue 19072 -   chromium -    Windows 7 jumplists do not take command line switches into account - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.202.0 (Developer Build 23059)    Jumplists in Windows 7 do not take into account the parameters passed to   the original chromium shortcut  which makes them difficult to use.      1. Unzip the latest Chromium zip  2. Create a shortcut to Chromium: P:Chromiumchrome-win32chrome.exe --  enable-user-scripts --user-data-dir=&quot;P:Chromiumprofile&quot; --enable-  extensions  3. Pin it to the Windows 7 Taskbar  4. Right click the taskbar icon and click on New Window        I would expect Chromium to start with the profile I defined for the   original shortcut and to support extensions.         Instead  a new profile is created in my user home dir and extension support   is disabled. I'm guessing I can go and edit the registry to change the   jumplist items  but isn't there a way to create the jumplist items based on   the original shortcut?   </pre>
