<title>Issue 3552 -   chromium -    Paint issues while closing the download shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dev channel build 0.3.153.3      1. Download a file and close the tab once the file download is complete   (don't close the download shelf)  2. The download shelf gets repainted over all other tabs and stays there.   The close button does not work.  3. If you force a repaint by minimizing and maximizing the window  then the   download shelf disappears.   </pre>
