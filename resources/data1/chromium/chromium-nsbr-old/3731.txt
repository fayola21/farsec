<title>Issue 3731 -   chromium -    http://webcam.keywest.com/ does not show webcams - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : First Public release through 0.3.154.6  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://webcam.keywest.com/">http://webcam.keywest.com/</a>          Firefox 3: Webcam images load instantly.           IE 7: Webcam images load here as well.      1. Go to the above URL.  2. Click on a link to one of the webcams  example: <a href="http://webcam.keywest.com/cowboybills/">http://webcam.keywest.com/cowboybills/</a> But any of them will produce the   same results.  3. There is a square where the cam image is suppose to be.      Seeing the webcam feed.      There is a blank square the color of the background.      There is no mention of a plugin that is needed for this site. The cam   images are dynamic image files. I do have the Firefox Windows Media Player   plugin installed  but I don't think that is used. There is one cam on that   site that uses that and it works. I forget which one. I have been testing   this site with each new version of Chrome. I don't understand why the   images do not load. They are jpg images that regenerate every 5 or 8   seconds or whenever you refresh the page  so Chrome may not like dynamic   images. Firefox  the images load instantly. IE takes about a second for   them to load. I have not tested IE8 yet.    My system is Windows Vista Home Premium x64. In case that helps. :) I have   used the webpage submit thing built into Chrome  but this has not been   resolved when I submitted it a while back with the first public release of   Chrome. This issue may affect other sites that use dynamic made images.    Thanks. </pre>
