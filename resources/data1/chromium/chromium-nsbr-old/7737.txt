<title>Issue 7737 -   chromium -    How Google Chrome is unstable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Rubbish Google Chrome  I will never use it again.    Always crashed when downloading a file that is greater then 1GB  especially     whole app is halted when I am trying to open the Download tab and   downloading 1GB file.    All the tab are gone and I cannot remember them at all. How can I restart   those tab again  I always lose those tab due Google Chrome fault.    btw  it crashed / halted again after I have started it again and pressed   the &quot;Download&quot; tab again  so it is useless for any user since it can't be   able to download a large file. </pre>
