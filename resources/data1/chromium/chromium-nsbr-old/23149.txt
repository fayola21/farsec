<title>Issue 23149 -   chromium -    Cannot open PDF with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Trying to open any PDF  including web links in my email. (if chrome is   my default browser)          I expect the PDF not to open and have therefore changed my default browser   to IE.      Error message  &quot;Cannot use Adobe Reader to view PDF in your web browser.    Reader will now exit.  Please exit your browser and try again.&quot;    Is there a way to fix this.  Please advise.  Thanks.    <b>Please provide
