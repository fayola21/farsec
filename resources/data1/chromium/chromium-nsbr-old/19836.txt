<title>Issue 19836 -   chromium -    CPU Usage on www.mbl.is - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Version 4.0.202.0 (202.0)&gt;  URLs (if applicable) :www.mbl.is  OS version               : &lt;10.5.8&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:OK      1.Go to www.mbl.is          Standard CPU usage      I have been looking at how the CPU usage of Chrome changes depending   on which site I visit. I have concluded that the worst site of all (exept from   online games  streaming videos etc.) is www.mbl.is. That site used 10x the   CPU as www.bbc.com. I have checked it a total of 5 times with the same   result.    Is this just normal or is it bad coding on the site or program? </pre>
