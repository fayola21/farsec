<title>Issue 7983 -   chromium -    Plugin tests seems to be failing after r10214 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The plugin tests seems to have started failing somewhere around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10214">r10214</a>.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?</a>  builder=XP%20Perf%20(dbg)    They passed last time in this run  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Perf%20%28dbg%29">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Perf%20%28dbg%29</a>  /builds/4447/steps/plugin_tests/logs/stdio    and have been failing consistently since then -   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Perf%20(dbg)/bui">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Perf%20(dbg)/bui</a>  lds/4449/steps/plugin_tests/logs/stdio    Peter can you check if these failures could have anything to do with your   submit? I am going to disable these tests in the mean time.         </pre>
