<title>Issue 18730 -   chromium -    Themes Gallery: yellow box message should not display if chrome meets version requirements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. install 3.0.197.11 on linux  2. go to wrench/options/personal stuff/get themes      No yellow box message should appear on the front of the themes pages.    Instead I get the following message: &quot;We're sorry  but themes are available   for Google Chrome 3.0.195.3 and above only&quot;    This message should not appear because we're using a newer version than   3.0.195.3         </pre>
