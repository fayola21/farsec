<title>Issue 3254 -   chromium -    Alt+Shift+T should be disabled for app windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  I got surprised with apps the way they behave with keyboard   shortcut Alt+shift+t.    We say (help center)  Application windows don't display tabs  buttons    address bar  or menus. BUT  it is not true. The user can still access all   of them with Alt+Shift+T keyboard shortcut.    I'm really confused with above statement  &quot;don't display tabs    buttons..blah..blah..&quot;  does this mean they are hidden (?)      1. Launch Any App's shortcut (Gmail internet email a/c is fine)  2. Alt+Shift+T on the App window and use arrow keys to get access to those   buttons and menus.    See the attached screenshots.    What is the expected output?  Alt+Shoft+t should show only app��_��_��_s drop-down menu list (back  forward    reload  duplicate  copy url  etc.)    What do you see instead?  The short cut shows all the regular browser window buttons and menus.   </pre>
