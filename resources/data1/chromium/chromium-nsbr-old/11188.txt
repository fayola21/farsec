<title>Issue 11188 -   chromium -    gmail.com: chrome window resizes by itself and previous size can't be restored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new tab (with chrome window not maximized  maybe size to take  half of your screen)    2. navigate to www.gmail.com  3. Try to resize window  setting it to the previous size.      As soon as the login page displays  the Chrome window resizes- bigger than  the previous size. Attempts to resize it smaller doesn't work.      FF 3.0.8: ok  Konqueror 3.5.10: ok </pre>
