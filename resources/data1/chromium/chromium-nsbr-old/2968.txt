<title>Issue 2968 -   chromium -    maximized chrome leaves phantom whitespace for taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1    This was reported to me by Louis. Attached are two screenshots showing the   problem. Note the extra whitespace at the left. Chrome somehow thinks it is   leaving space for the taskbar. After interacting with the app the content   eventually pops back to the left hand side of the browser window.             </pre>
