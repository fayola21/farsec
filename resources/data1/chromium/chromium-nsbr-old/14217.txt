<title>Issue 14217 -   chromium -    Navtive drop-down box rendering issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18529">r18529</a>)    -ON CLEAN PROFILE.  -Launch Installer for the above revision.  -Click on 'Start Chromium' of the FRUI dialog.  -Click on 'Change Search Engine' button of the First Run Bubble.    Notice as shown in the screenshot  Default Search drop-down box is not  rendered properly.   If you reopen the options dialog  then it works fine.   It reproduces consistently atleast for me  if I follow the above exact  repro steps.    PS: I don't think it's a DEV Release Blocker.  </pre>
