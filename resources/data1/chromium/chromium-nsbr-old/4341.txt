<title>Issue 4341 -   chromium -    Use old pop-up blocker visual for single popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.18 [dev channel]    When only a single pop-up is blocked  the old visual should be used - it's   more intuitive  and it looks prettier. In the event that multiple popup   windows are blocked  the new visual is fine - but why bother the user with   another pop-up menu when it's not needed? </pre>
