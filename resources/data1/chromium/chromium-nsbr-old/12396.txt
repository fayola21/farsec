<title>Issue 12396 -   chromium -    Use system default stack size for worker thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've found that current thread stack size 64KB is too small.  For example  CERT_PKIX_VerifyCert function of NSS consumes a lot of stack  space (NSS bug 439169)  and causes segmentation fault by stack overflow.  So  there would be some third_party code might use a stack space more than  we expected.  For workaround of NSS's CERT_PKIX_VerifyCert  it's ok to increase  kWorkerThreadStackSize to 128KB.    Couldn't we use system default stack size that would be several times  bigger than 128KB  or should we limit to 128KB? </pre>
