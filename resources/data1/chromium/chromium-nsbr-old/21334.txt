<title>Issue 21334 -   chromium -    With latest sync code  sync doesn't properly reinitialize after close/restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21094">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21094</a> fixed  I'm now   seeing another issue revealed.      1. Enable sync on two browser instances (two --user-data-dir 's).  2. Make a change.  It should propagate instantly via notifications.  3. Close both browser instances  and then start two new browser instances   (using the same --user-data-dir arguments as before).  4. Make a change on one of the browsers.  It does not propagate to the other   browser as expected.  About:sync shows one or both browsers stuck in the   SYNCING state. </pre>
