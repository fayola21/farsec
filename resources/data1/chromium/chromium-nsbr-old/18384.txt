<title>Issue 18384 -   chromium -    git tool should update rietveld issue with committed revision - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In addition to automatically closing the issue which I think it does  the   tool should update the issue description with a link to the committed   revision.  This helps someone figure out if an issue is committed or not.  I   find it very useful. </pre>
