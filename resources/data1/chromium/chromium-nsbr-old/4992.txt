<title>Issue 4992 -   chromium -    Draging items in the &quot;other bookmarks&quot; menu closes the menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Drag something in the &quot;other bookmakrs&quot; menu (as in to move it a bit   closer to the top fr example)  2. Observe      The item should be moved and the menu should stay opened to allow me to   reorder more items...      The item is moved but the menu closes    This is a weird behavior (different from IE/FF or any other menu such as   the windows start menu)     </pre>
