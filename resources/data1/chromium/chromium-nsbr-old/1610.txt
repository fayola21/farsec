<title>Issue 1610 -   chromium -    Little bug when &quot;closing a lot of tabs  together&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : --  Other browsers tested: --         Safari 3: --      Firefox 3: --           IE 7: --      1. Open a lot of tabs (just simply start clicking +)  2. Start closing them from somewhere (not the first  because then it's   alright).      The closing button (little x) is staying the same position  so it's easy to   close the whole group of tabs.      The size of the tabs are changing a little bit (very little)  and after   closing some (about 10-15)  these changes are enough to not be able to   close the others tabs  without moving the cursor  because the little   closing x is located some pixels away - so we can't interact with it   without moving the cursor.   </pre>
