<title>Issue 10633 -   chromium -    &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; should trigger history page refresh  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.175.0 (Developer Build 13871)  	    This could be a dupe of <a title="Delete history from Incognito mode should refersh the history page " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9984"> issue 9984 </a>.  I'm filing a separate report because  it's not related to Incognito mode.  If it's really the same issue  please  feel free to dupe it.    It is a regression which happened between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11410">r11410</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11412">r11412</a>. CL for <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11411">r11411</a>  mentions changes to history search.        1. Open History page.  2. Click on link &quot;Delete history for this day&quot;.    The history page is not refreshed automatically.   </pre>
