<title>Issue 12218 -   chromium -    Extensions: sandbox content scripts better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  content scripts and page scripts can communicate and it is   therefore extension developer's responsibility to carefully validate messages   coming from content.    This also means that we have to disallow increased privileges in content   scripts.    We should completely separate content scripts from page JavaScript.   Essentially  this means having separate script wrappers for each C++ object   for each content script. </pre>
