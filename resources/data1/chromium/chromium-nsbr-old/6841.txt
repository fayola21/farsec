<title>Issue 6841 -   chromium -    Continue buttons do not work on taxact.com  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As reported:  The static portion of the site seems to work fine. But while filing a   return - the &quot;continue&quot; button does not work on many wizard pages. I   suspect wizard pages with text input fields on them don't work.    Taxact is a high-profile site that gets many visitors per year.  Getting   Chrome supported on this site would be great for users.     </pre>
