<title>Issue 18279 -   chromium -    Stored password dialog has &quot;Remove all&quot; without ANY &quot;are you sure&quot; dialog  NOR &quot;cancel&quot; for dialog itself. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	3.0.193.2 (Official Build 21134)  WebKit	531.3  V8	1.2.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.193.2 Safari/531.3      Summary.    My god  I just deleted all my passwords by a minuscule mousing-mistake.    F.u.c.k ^10.    God damn  Google - how is it even POSSIBLE to write such a moronic dialog?!   &quot;Remove all&quot;  about 5 pixles from &quot;Remove&quot;  for fucks sake  and just   everything is gone in a flash!!?? - without any &quot;Are you sure&quot; dialog  nor   any &quot;Cancel&quot; button for the dialog itself??    I am baffled. I am actually near shocked.    I am so pissed now.    What is it with this new-style __bullshit__ of not having &quot;OK  Apply    Cancel&quot;  but instead &quot;insta-apply&quot; everything and instead only a &quot;Close&quot;   button on the different dialogs? Are we ripping off the most annoying   aspects of Apple iPhone's GUI? (accidentially toggle a switch when you just   were trying to scroll the window - and have no idea of which switch this   was  w/o any way to cancel the changes. Arghh..) </pre>
