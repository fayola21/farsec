<title>Issue 4445 -   chromium -    named shared memory prevents test shell from multiple users on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Start test_shell on linux  2) close test_shell  3) try to start test_shell as a different user    Step 3 will fail.  We use named shared memory at /dev/shm/testshell for the stats   table.  This never gets removed so the second user to try to run test shell can't write   to the shared memory.  We should try to stop using shared memory or at least   namespace it based on the user name. </pre>
