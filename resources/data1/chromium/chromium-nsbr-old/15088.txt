Clicking on an icon button to show calendar component does not focus   window with date picker if it is already shown (and displayed on   background).          What is the expected result?        The already existing window should be focused.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Log in to internet banking from Ceska Sporitelna (www.servis24.cz)  2. Navigate to one of the accounts here and show 'transaction history' page   (Transakcni historie)  3. Select period (Vyberte obdobi: interval)  4. Click the calendar icon/button and new window is displayed and focused   5. focus again the main window and calendar will be hidden so click the   icon again and it is not focused.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Works well with Firefox3    Please provide any additional information below.    The site has disclaimer that only IE &amp; FF are supported. Ceska Sporitelna   is one of the largest banks in Czech Republic. I do not know if there is a   chance to get a testing account there and you need to log in i order to   reproduce this. Let me know how i can help you to track it down.     </pre>
