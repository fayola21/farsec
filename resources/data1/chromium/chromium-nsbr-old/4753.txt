<title>Issue 4753 -   chromium -    Form state lost on reload/back/forward - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a simple form (note: not Google hopepage  this does some extra stuff)   and type in a form field. Not hit reload. The form changes will be erased.   This is related to <a title="Back button loses functionality after refresh with hash links." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4684"> bug 4684 </a>.    The same thing seems to happen for back/forward in some cases. </pre>
