<title>Issue 9266 -   chromium -    Dragging link from Downloads page to client area does nothing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12362)        1. Open Downloads page.  2. Drag a link from one of the downloads and try to drop it on the content  area of a Chrome browser window.    What is the expected output?     If Chrome is able to open the file type  it should be opened in the browser  window.  Otherwise  Chrome should offer to save it.    What do you see instead?    Nothing happens  although the drag image would indicate that dropping is  allowed.    Dropping the link on the client area of IE7 or Firefox 3 works OK.     </pre>
