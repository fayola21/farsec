<title>Issue 16892 -   chromium -    Theme authors should be able to specify values as floats or ints - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently our GetReal and GetInteger methods do not like input that is not   of the exactly desired type. We should allow at least reals to be specified   as ints (e.g. RGBA(255  255  255  1) instead of requiring RGBA(255  255    255  1.0) </pre>
