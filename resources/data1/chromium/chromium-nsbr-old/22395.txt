<title>Issue 22395 -   chromium -    Histogram values may be skewed by debugging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While debugging the browser  I happened to trip a DCHECK in Histogram::Add:      DCHECK(value &lt; ranges(index + 1));    The actual histogram being added was for some DNS lookup (sorry  I didn't   think to record this until later  so I don't know the exact one).  It looked   to me like the reason this was out of range was because I had been stopped in   the debugger during its measurement window.      I wonder how many of the bogus values getting reported in the histograms   could be attributed to people debugging their browser? </pre>
