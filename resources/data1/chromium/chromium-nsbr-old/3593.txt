View the time stamps on most recent entries        This particular website attempts to discover the system time or time zone   of the users computer so that the entries are listed in their own timezone.   instead of the timezone of the person who made the entry  it is in reader's   timezone.      On any particular visit to this page  ALL entries are listed 4 days and 3   hours earlier than my current time zone (Eastern). One such entry reads   October 20th  2008 - 11:55am in IE  FF  and Safari  but Chrome shows it as   October 16th  2008 - 8:55am.  4 days and 3 hours is the equivalent of being   99 hours off of my current timezone (I'm guessing this may turn in to 100   hours after Daylight Savings ends in a few weeks).         Please provide
