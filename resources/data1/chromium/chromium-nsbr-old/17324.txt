<title>Issue 17324 -   chromium -    1px grey border at bottom of renderview - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is one pixel of grey at the bottom of the render view at all times.   This is hard to see on google.com since the bg is white  but easy to see on   sites with a dark background.    At first I thought it was due to the GtkPaned that was introduced recently   to hold the docked devtools  but commenting that code out proves it's not   that.    This occurs both with and without the custom frame. </pre>
