<title>Issue 7876 -   chromium -    Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As we start to look more and more at site compatibility  we should start to   look at more automated ways to detect compatibility errors.  While many   compatibility errors require a human to detect  often the presence of JS   and HTML errors are enough to indicate that there's a problem that should   be looked at.    On the user's machine  we could record unique errors and sites they   happened on in a log file.  If the user ever used the &quot;report a bug&quot;   feature  we could also prompt them with a request like this:    &quot;Chrome keeps a local log of errors that it runs into on web pages as you   surf.  Being able to analyze these errors will help us to identify and fix   compatibility problems with more websites more quickly.  Is it OK to upload   these errors along with this bug report?  &lt;View Errors/NO/YES&gt;&quot;    It's possible that it may be too difficult to write this message in a way   that users wouldn't be freaked out by the log  even though it's only on   their local machine. </pre>
