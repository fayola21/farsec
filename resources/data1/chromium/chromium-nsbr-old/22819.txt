<title>Issue 22819 -   chromium -    web inspector elements view is sometimes blank in 212.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was trying to verify that a tip-of-tree inspector bug wasn't affecting   212.1  and instead ran into a different bug.  When I inspector certain pages   (extension or otherwise)  I get a blank Elements page.  Actually  when the   window first comes up  the Elements tab isn't even selected at all  and the   pane is just completely empty.  When I select the Elements tab  the right   navbar shows up  but the main pane stays blank.    I'm not sure which pages this specifically affects.  For example  it does   happen for me on code.google.com bug pages  but doesn't happen on   google.com's front page. </pre>
