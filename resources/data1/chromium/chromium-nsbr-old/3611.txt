<title>Issue 3611 -   chromium -    Mouse offset while hovering Flash context menus. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3  URLs (if applicable) : www.drawball.com (potentially offensive due to its   open nature)                         www.youtube.com                         [insert any Flash scripts that follow mouse   positions]         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 2: OK           IE 7: OK     Opera 9.26: OK (ish  haven't directly checked mouse positions)      1. Go to <a href="http://two.drawball.com">http://two.drawball.com</a> (or similar mouse-monitoring Flash.)  2. Right click somewhere in the top left of the object  hover over the   menu.  Notice how the mouse is being offset to the bottom-right from its original   position while hovering the menu.    OR    1. Go to a video on youtube.com  2. see attached image to show where to right click on the video  3. Hover around on the menu and notice that the volume and viewing mode   icons are being highlighted.      More detailed analysis:  1. Zoom into a place on drawball by clicking on the ball once  then again   when it loads to get to 100% zoom.  2. Move mouse to the top left quadrant of the drawing area  3. Left click and hold  then right click  move mouse somewhere else (not on   menu)  then left click.  This should draw a straight line  but offset from where it should have been   drawn.    So  it appears that the position of the mouse is being offset.  While nothing major  it can cause some problems when trying to access menus   or change settings  sometimes requiring a few clicks  depending on activity   behind it.  (which is sometimes the reason for opening it  to set the   quality lower)         </pre>
