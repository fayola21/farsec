<title>Issue 4653 -   chromium -    AJAX page not working correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 0.4.154.23 (Official Build 5672)  URL: <a href="http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/listingDisplay.php?listingid=3">http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/listingDisplay.php?listingid=3</a>        1. Go to <a href="http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/listingDisplay.php?listingid=3">http://myhouseweb.net/fsbo/listingDisplay.php?listingid=3</a>  2. Click on &quot;Next &gt;&gt;&quot; a few times    What is the expected output?     There are 3 pictures on this page. The AJAX/Javascript code should cycle  through all of them when &quot;Next &gt;&gt;&quot; is clicked multiple times.    What do you see instead?    It's not cycling past the 2nd picture.    Compare to the way IE and FF cycle correctly through the pictures.  =&gt;Safari has same problem as Chrome.   </pre>
