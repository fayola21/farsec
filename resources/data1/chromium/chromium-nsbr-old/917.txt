<title>Issue 917 -   chromium -    Chrome does not support Sharepoint sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sharepoint sites don't work with Chrome.  Webkit (nor firefox) are   supported browsers by Microsoft.  But Sharepoint is so common in office   environments it may be worth figuring out how to make these work.  They use   ActiveX a lot.    Tried using --allow-all-activex without success.   </pre>
