<title>Issue 12149 -   chromium -    Review direct dependency on Webkit in Mac TestShell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/113147">http://codereview.chromium.org/113147</a> makes checkdeps.py also scan .m and  .mm files  and #imports.    It was necessary to add some DEPS rules  and one of them is a &quot;+mac&quot; line  in webkit/tools/DEPS.    This is a direct dependency on Webkit  currently needed for test_shell_mac.mm    ERROR in  /b/slave/linux/build/src/webkit/tools/test_shell/test_shell_mac.mm  Illegal include: &quot;mac/DumpRenderTreePasteboard.h&quot;     Because of no rule applying    This direct dependency should be reviewed  and probably removed.    Feel free to re-assign this issue. </pre>
