<title>Issue 8764 -   chromium -    Rightclick - options does not work correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 1.0.154.48&gt;    Rightclick on Bookmark-Folders and Names in the Bookmark-Bar works   but if you &quot;rightclick&quot; a bookmark inside a folder  sometimes you have to   click the little icon directly  otherwise the windows dissapears  and   nothing is going to happen  so you have to navigate in that folder again.      </pre>
