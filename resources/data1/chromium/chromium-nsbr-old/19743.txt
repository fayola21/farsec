<title>Issue 19743 -   chromium -    throbber start/stop visual jank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of the polish push for 4.0 the throbber needs slick start and stop   animations. It should start from nothing and then morph in to the favicion at   the end. The tab title shouldn't bounce around either. It needs to smoothly   scoot left and right to make way for the throbber and favicon.   </pre>
