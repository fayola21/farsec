<title>Issue 12390 -   chromium -    Page layout not displaying correctly after latest DEV update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.gmacfs.com/AccountCenter">https://www.gmacfs.com/AccountCenter</a>           Safari 4: --    Firefox 3.x: --           IE 7: OK           IE 8: --        Unfortunately  the display defect shows up after logging into my account    so to test this fully will require access to the secure area of the GMAC   accounts site.    However  the account management page is a fairly standard layout where   there is a menu/navigation vertically down the left of the page. With each   selection  the main area of the page (probably a frame?) just to the right   of the vertical menu changes.    After the update to DEV 181.1 this page no longer displays correctly. The   main portion of the page is drawn below the vertical menu. The area to the   right of the vertical menu (which normally holds the main section) is blank   and only shows the background color.    In the pictures attached below  I blurred the images so you cannot see my   account information. However  you can very clearly see the difference   between how the page was drawn in IE versus Chrome.    Again  this is a new issue with DEV 181.1 (possibly 180). When I accessed   the site 20 days ago  it rendered correctly (that was DEV 178). </pre>
