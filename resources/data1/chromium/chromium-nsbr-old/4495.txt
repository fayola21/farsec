<title>Issue 4495 -   chromium -    Popups are broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> All popups seem broken. Legitimate popups don't appear at all. Go to <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2203687/">http://www.slate.com/id/2203687/</a> and click on the &quot;Launch&quot; button for a   slideshow in a popup. You will get a taskbar entry but no popup.    Going to a blocked popup page such as this: <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest1.html">http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest1.html</a> seems to work properly  but you   also get taskbar entries for each of the blocked popups </pre>
