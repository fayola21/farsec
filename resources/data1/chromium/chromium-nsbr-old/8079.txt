<title>Issue 8079 -   chromium -    Single tab fails to load new domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> dev channel 2.0.164.0    Ran into this while loading a list of sites that are linked to some odd  behavior in the distributed stability tests.  For completeness  here is a  list of actions taken during life of tab:    - open tab  - change proxy settings (to mimic distributed stability test env)  - load several sites    After a few loads  new sites stopped loading in this tab.  I thought the  proxy blew up  so I opened a new tab but it behaved just fine.  I then  noticed that the broken tab appeared once in the chrome task manager  but  twice in about:memory (see screenshot).  The second process (different pid)  appears when attempting to load a new domain in the broken tab  and goes  away after refreshing the broken tab (which successfully re-loads the last  site that loaded in the tab).    Attaching screenshot and memory dump of second non-functioning (loading)  tab process. </pre>
