<title>Issue 8539 -   chromium -    App icons should update/repair - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> old version = 2.0.166.1  new version = 2.0.168.0    On Friday I was running 166.1. I opened the About box and it updated to   168. I did *not* restart the browser. I shut down my system. On Monday   morning I started up my system and the icons for my installed apps  gmail   and calendar  were the generic windows unknown icons instead of the icons   for gmail and calendar. Clicking on them does correctly launch the apps.    See attached screenshot. </pre>
