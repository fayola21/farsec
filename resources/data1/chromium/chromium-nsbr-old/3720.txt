<title>Issue 3720 -   chromium -    Two pixels of grey above infobar  no pixels below. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Trunk with MagicBrowzr  2. Have bookmark bar CLOSED  3. Do something to trigger an infobar (save password)    * What is the expected output? What do you see instead?  When the infobar appears  there should be a grey line at the top and   bottom  instead we see two grey lines at the top and none at the bottom.     This might have something to do with the one pixel line drawn in place of a   closed bookmarks bar being laid out above the infobar instead of below. You   can toggle the bookmark bar on and off to see the effect disappear and   reappear. This only occurs with MagicBrowzr enabled.   </pre>
