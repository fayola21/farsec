<title>Issue 15064 -   chromium -    [mail.google.com]: Gmail category indicator misplaced when zoomed in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="https://mail.google.com/a/google.com/#starred">https://mail.google.com/a/google.com/#starred</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.33 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.33 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?      The box indicating which mails I am currently seeing is placed too low when   zoomed in. Sometimes it is placed so low that it looks like I'm in &quot;Drafts&quot;   while I am actually in the &quot;Outbox&quot;.      What is the expected result?      Box should be placed higher  over &quot;Starred&quot;.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. In corp gmail  activate the weather theme (the one with the tree). Not   sure if this step is required.  2. Zoom in twice by pressing Ctrl-+.  3. Select &quot;Starred&quot;  &quot;Sent mail&quot; etc.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  with Firefox 3.0.4 and IE6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_qfe (using the &quot;text   size&quot; property)    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
