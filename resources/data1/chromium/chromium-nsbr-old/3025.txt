<title>Issue 3025 -   chromium -    Javascript fails to run during page load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to this page: <a href="http://developers.cogentrts.com:8080/DH_ajax_1.asp">http://developers.cogentrts.com:8080/DH_ajax_1.asp</a>  2. You should see data changing in the table twice per second  3. In Google Chrome  no data is visible in the table.      This page uses AJAX &quot;streaming&quot;  where an invisible iframe reads a URL that   is served by a server-side app.  The server holds the page open   indefinitely  with new javascript &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags being added up to   10 times per second.  Each time the iframe gets a new script tag it should   be executed  causing the table data to update.      The javascript in the iframe does not execute as it is loaded  but instead   begins executing only after the page in the iframe has completely loaded   and the connection to the server is closed.  Since this page is designed to   remain open  the javascript never executes.    Please provide
