<title>Issue 9605 -   chromium -    No keyboard focus tracking in omnibox dropdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set keyboard focus to the omnibox using F6  2. Use down arrow to bring up the dropdown  and arrow up/down through the list. Use a tool like   Inspect32 to highlight keyboard focus.        Expected:  Keyboard focus moves with visual focus (grey highlight).    Actual:  Keyboard focus stays put in the omnibox  and never moves with the highlight.     </pre>
