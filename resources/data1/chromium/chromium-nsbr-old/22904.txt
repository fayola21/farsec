<title>Issue 22904 -   chromium -    Scroll bars in chrome are mismatched with the settings in the appearance panel. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.2  URLs (if applicable) : Any page which is &quot;tall enough&quot; to need a scroll bar. I   used wikipedia.  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Open System Prefferences  &quot;Appearance&quot; Panel  2. Set &quot;Place scroll arrows&quot; to &quot;At top and bottom&quot;  3. Open Chrome  4. Open the wikipedia page.  5. Observe how the scroll bars act and look.. they should look and behave   fine.  6. Do not close Chrome  7. Set &quot;Place scroll arrows&quot; to &quot;Together&quot;  8. The bars now BEHAVE in the &quot;Together&quot; but still are rendered as &quot;At top   and bottom&quot;.  Sometimes the scroll bars in chrome seem to &quot;sometimes&quot;   act this way even after you have closed and reopened chrome.  Sometimes   it even behaves differently in different tabs of the same chrome window.      When switching the &quot;Place scroll arrows&quot; mode  the scroll bars should   behave as they do in (for example) textedit.  They should change their   appearance and behavior as soon as the setting is changed with no   closing/reopening required  and the behavior and appearance should   always match.        Nothing changes visually when the setting is changed  but the behavior   sometimes does change.  Sometimes the behavior and appearance do not   match even when the setting was not changed while chrome was open.    I've attached screen shots of the wikipedia page when the error is   happening (behaving like &quot;At top and bottom&quot;  but displayed as &quot;Together&quot;)   with annotations explaining what happens when I click/drag in various   spots on the page. </pre>
