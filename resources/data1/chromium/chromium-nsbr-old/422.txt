<title>Issue 422 -   chromium -    &quot;Aw  Snap&quot; page while creating a [New Tab]. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I just opened Chrome issues in Chrome.  2. I was reading issues one by one.  3. I read the issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=406&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20Area%20Mstone%20Type%20Owner%20Status%20Summary%2  0Modified&amp;start=300  and click on &quot;+&quot; button to create a [New tab] and clicked 2 time or 3   times..same &quot;Aw  Snap&quot; page.  Did Ctrl + N to create New window..but still no use -- same aw  snap page   only.  But no crash in eventvwr.  I can't reproduce this again. I mean  when I restart Chrome  every thing is    fine.    Thanks   Venkat Yellapu.                  Please provide
