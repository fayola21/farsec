<title>Issue 5376 -   chromium -    Double-Click on New Tab  Icon should not Maximize Window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Double-Click on the New Tab Icon +      A new tab (or two) should be inserted and the Chrome Window geometry does  not change.      Chrome gets maximized (or restored if it was maximized already) AND two new  tabs are created.    Rationale:  With some pointing devices it is easy to accidentally double-click when a  single-click was desired. Having this happen when trying to insert a new  tab is disruptive.    There is a standard Windows title-bar behavior which is to maximize/restore  upon a double-click of unoccupied space. However this does not happen on  buttons  icons and decorations.      Please provide
