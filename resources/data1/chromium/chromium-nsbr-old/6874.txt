<title>Issue 6874 -   chromium -    Keyword cleanup and fill_into_edit should agree on trailing slashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I have an auto keyword for &quot;google.com&quot;  and start typing 'g'  I get   inline autocompleted to &quot;google.com/&quot; (note trailing slash).  The keyword   hint system manages to figure out that this matches.  But if I now hit   &lt;end&gt; + space + another key  so that I have &quot;google.com/ g&quot;  I don't get   the keyword UI  because apparently now &quot;google.com/&quot; is considered not to   match my keyword.    The best solution to this is probably to make this second input string also   match the keyword.  Another possibility is that none of the   AutocompleteMatch::fill_into_edits could include the trailing slash. </pre>
