<title>Issue 8665 -   chromium -    &quot;slave lost&quot; should turn the builder purple  not red - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was looking at the tree this morning and noticed a bunch of red  but the   tree was still open.  Curious  I looked around and saw that some of the red   was caused by a master/slave disconnect/reconnect.  While it's important to   indicate these failures  I think we should use the purple indicator rather   than red so that people can see that this is a tools issue and not a tree   closing issue per-se. </pre>
