<title>Issue 15546 -   chromium -    Chrome/mac doesn't support OS X's url handlers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Enter an url registered with OS X into chrome (e.g. &quot;txmt://&quot; if you have   TextMate installed  &quot;mvim://&quot; if you have MacVim  or go to &quot;apple.cm&quot;)        The registered url handler should be invoked (for &quot;apple.cm&quot;  iTunes   should be opened  for example).        Nothing.    (Do we have a default assignee for triage?) </pre>
