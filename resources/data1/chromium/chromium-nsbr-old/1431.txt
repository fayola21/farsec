<title>Issue 1431 -   chromium -    Create new tab next to current tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)              Firefox 3: OK        1. Create new tab with Ctrl-T      Tab should open right next to the current tab  as if clicking on a link   with the middle-mouse.      Tab is opened at the end of the tab strip.      There should be an option to configure this behaviour  or at least a new   shortcut to create a tab next to the current one. </pre>
