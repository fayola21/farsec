<title>Issue 17759 -   chromium -    odd renderer drag nbehavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1    couple pretty weird things I noticed on kde4 (not tested on other DEs or   WMs):    1. Highlight text in an &lt;input&gt; and drag it anywhere in the renderer. It   will simply disappear (probably because we always report success  even if it   ends up being a noop drag).    2. drag text into an &lt;input&gt; from somewhere else  such as the omnibox. When   it is dropped it is highlighted. Now click anywhere. The text disappears. </pre>
