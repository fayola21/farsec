<title>Issue 11783 -   chromium -    Feature: &quot;Copy Link Text&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I right click a URL or mailto: link  it would be useful to have a &quot;copy   link text&quot; option. Sometimes it can be a real pain to get the selection   cursor in the absolute correct spot to select the link text without actually   clicking the link itself. </pre>
