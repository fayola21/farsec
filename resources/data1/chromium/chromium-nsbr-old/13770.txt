<title>Issue 13770 -   chromium -    Save crash dumps for TestShell crashes (when running webkit layout tests) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Save crash dumps for TestShell crashes (when running webkit layout tests)    Presently  if we have a layout test that sometimes crashes  it can be hard to   track down the cause.  Our tools should just record a minidump in these cases   and make it available via the buildbot. </pre>
