<title>Issue 19117 -   chromium -    Mac: Cmd-P in location bar offers to print its contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22917)      1. Focus the location bar.  2. Press Cmd-P.      Presumably nothing  since printing isn't yet implemented. (Better yet would be a dialog box for   printing the web contents.)      A dialog box pops up offering to print (the contents of the location box). It works too.    (Depending on what you do after dismissing this dialog box  a DCHECK() failure may soon follow;   this has been filed as &lt;<a href="http://crbug.com/19116&gt;.">http://crbug.com/19116&gt;.</a>) </pre>
