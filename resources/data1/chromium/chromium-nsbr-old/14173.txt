<title>Issue 14173 -   chromium -    Google Chrome is a memory pig - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	2.0.172.31 (Official Build )                  Open Google Chrome into 5 Tabs. Open Process Explorer. Add up Virtual Size entries   for all Google Chrome entries. For the pages I have visited  the result is 779MB.   Working set is smaller at 200MB.        I expect to be able to keep open many web-pages without having to worry about my   2GB of RAM being used up.          Google Chrome eats up 0.75GB of memory space. That's about 150MB of space for each   page.            I like Google Chrome - but its isn't the svelte lightweight browser it promises to   be. Its a bloaty thing that has me managing how many pages I keep open to try to   keep its memory us down. </pre>
