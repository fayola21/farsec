<title>Issue 14284 -   chromium -    [www.lametayel.co.il]: http://www.lametayel.co.il/zoom/ - RTL text in dropdowns is not right aligned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.lametayel.co.il/zoom/">http://www.lametayel.co.il/zoom/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?  Dropdowns have Hebrew text. When closed  the text is right aligned. When   clicking the dropdown to select another option  all text lines are left   aligned instead of being right aligned.            What is the expected result?  Hebrew (or generally  right-to-left) text in dropdowns should be right   aligned  same as the selected text when the dropdown is closed.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. go to <a href="http://www.lametayel.co.il/zoom/">http://www.lametayel.co.il/zoom/</a>  2. click any of the dropdowns    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  FF3.0 - yes  IE6 - yes  Safari4.0 - No  even the selected text (when the dropdown is closed) is   left aligned - worse than in Chrome. But at least it's consistent :)      Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
