<title>Issue 6812 -   chromium -    Chrome remains in &quot;Checking for updates...&quot; state and does not exit completely when GoogleUpdate.exe COM server crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Originally reported internally &lt;b/1305225&gt; by David Dorwin:     I encountered an assert in Google Update when the About Google Chrome   dialog was doing an update check. I aborted and the About Google Chrome   dialog continued to display &quot;Checking for updates...&quot;. I closed the About   Google Chrome dialog and reopened it  and it was still saying &quot;Checking for   updates...&quot; but did not launch GoogleUpdate.exe again.    When I exited Chrome  the main chrome.exe process - the one without any   arguments - did not exit. </pre>
