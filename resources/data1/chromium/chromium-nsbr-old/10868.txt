<title>Issue 10868 -   chromium -    Post resubmition impossible on page with frames - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: ?      1. Load a page that uses frames  like phpMyAdmin  2. Submit any form  like the &quot;SQL&quot; tab.  3. Click on any link  4. Hit the back button  Chrome will say that  to load that page  you must   resubmit the form  and to do so  you must click on &quot;Reload&quot;.  5. Clicking on Reload will Reload the whole page (a.k.a. the FrameSet)  not   the just the frame you need to reload  therefore you lose everything...      To somehow be able to reload just the frame containing the form.      You reload the whole page  losing everything...    (The screenshot is in Portuguese  but you shoulg get the idea...)   </pre>
