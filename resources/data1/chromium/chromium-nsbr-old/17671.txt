<title>Issue 17671 -   chromium -    Spawing a new tab in the middle horks z-ordering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a few tabs  - select the first tab  - open a link from the first tab into a new tab  creating one right beside it    expected:  - new tab appears 2nd  selected  tab strip should look ok    actual:  - new tab appears  2nd  but 3rd tab is z-ordered above it.    This is a regression from my z-ordering bug fix. </pre>
