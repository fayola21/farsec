<title>Issue 5535 -   chromium -    Alert box too small for longer strings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36      Firefox 3: WORKS  IE 7: WORKS      1. enter the following in the url bar:  javascript:alert('chromechromechromechromechromechromechromechromechromechr  omechromechromechromechromechrome.')  3. press enter      An alert window that displays the whole string.      The alert window is not big enough so the string is cut off.    I guess this happens because of the use of this oddly looking UI toolkit   with custom crafted windows/controls.  Isn't it like one of the top ten rules of usability to use the platforms   default look and feel (and behaviour)?     </pre>
