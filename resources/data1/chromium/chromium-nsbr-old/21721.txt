<title>Issue 21721 -   chromium -    [http://www.partypoker.com/] The login page is blocked by Chrome silently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">http://www.partypoker.com/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">http://www.partypoker.com/</a>  2. Click on Instant Play button  3. A new window should be opened  wait until it is loaded(an applet may be  needed to install during this procession)      After the new window is loaded  a pop-up login page should be displayed  (IE's behavior)  or an alert box should pop up and alert that browser  pop-up blocker is switched on (Firefox's and Safari's behavior).      In Chrome  the login page is just blocked silently  without any alert box  like Firefox or Safari.    Issue also happens in latest trunk 4.0.209.0 (Developer Build 26079)   </pre>
