<title>Issue 2520 -   chromium -    There is no scrollbar in &quot;Send Invitation&quot; window when editing google online speadsheet - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1) Create an online spreadsheet (I did this on internal docs) using Google   Docs  2) Click on 'Share' and add collaborators (my email list was pretty long so   pls make sure yours is too)  3) Click on 'Invite Collaborators' button  4) New window pops up with an invitation.      Slider appears and you can scroll down to 'Send invitation' button.      You can edit your message  but you can not click on 'Send Invitation'   button because there is no slider on the right hand side. I tried expanding   the window  no luck.    Please provide
