<title>Issue 6153 -   chromium -    RTL: Left and right side bars are flipped at www.3rbspaces.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;See b/1006175&gt;    1. Go to <a href="http://www.3rbspaces.com">http://www.3rbspaces.com</a>  2. The leftmost and right most blue strips are flipped in Chrome/Safari   FF3n compared with IE7    Noticed that if you manually set the direction to LTR (View | Encoding |  Right to Left document) gives exactly the same (seemingly incorrect)   layout as other browsers.    Comments from Urib:  This page has a couple of extra &lt;html&gt; tags in it (not &quot;HTML tags&quot;  but  actual &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; tags). Specifically  the one on line 1356  has a dir=&quot;rtl&quot;  attribute set on it.    Firefox (Gecko) and Safari/Chrome (WebKit) apparently apply the dir  attribute on this tag to the entire page  as if it had dir=&quot;rtl&quot; on its top  &lt;html&gt; tag. IE seems to ignore this attribute.  The page layout is designed to be overall LTR - which means it displays as  intended in IE  but not in Gecko/WebKit.   </pre>
