<title>Issue 1371 -   chromium -    Can't select spellchecker dictionary for the specific textbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : Any        Firefox 3: OK      1. Open the page with text box or text area widget on it (this one would  suffice).  2. Assuming your mother tongue and Chrome language setting is different  from English  enter something in the text field (in English  obviously) and  try to change spelling language for this specific text.  3. You just can't.      I expected to see an option to select spellchecker language (as well as  enable/disable spelling) in the context menu.      Nothing - there is no option for selection it except in Setting dialog  (which is moreover inferred from Chrome language setting - i.e. if you want  to have US English interface and Russian dictionary by default  you are  somewhat out of luck).    </pre>
