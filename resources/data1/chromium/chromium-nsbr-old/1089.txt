<title>Issue 1089 -   chromium -    Proxy and Exceptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27      On system without administrator privileges configuring proxy is based on   configuring IE advanced Proxy settings and it working fine so far.  On system with administrator privileges you cannot configure that settings.  For user who wont use this browser to replace current (Firefox who has   built in proxy settings) for instance at work (on computer that control   administrator) is not very useful. Wold be implemented in future versions   or can somehow Chrome use Firefox proxy settings?    Sorry about my bad English.   </pre>
