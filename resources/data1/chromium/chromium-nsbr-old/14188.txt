<title>Issue 14188 -   chromium -    HostResolver::Observer is not sent completion notification if response was cached - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> HostResolver::Observer is not sent completion notification if response was   cached.    It should be calling OnResolutionCompletedWithStatus() for this case as well.    Not doing this will cause PrefetchObserver to leak. </pre>
