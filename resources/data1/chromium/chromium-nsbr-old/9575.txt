<title>Issue 9575 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Provide incremental search in the &quot;Passwords&quot; dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 2.0.171.0    Please provide a small edit control above the list view in the Passwords   dialog that provides incremental search. It should search both usernames and   website URLs. By incremental  I mean that as I type each character it should   update the search results.    To get to the password dialog in question  go to Options &gt;&gt; Minor Tweaks tab   &gt;&gt; Show saved passwords.    The behavior should be as close to Firefox 3's behavior as possible. </pre>
