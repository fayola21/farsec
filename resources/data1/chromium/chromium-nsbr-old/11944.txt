<title>Issue 11944 -   chromium -    provide keyboard shortcut for creating a new tab right next to the current tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.180.0    When current tab is in the middle of long tabs list  it's frequently more   convenient to open a new tab (for a site related to current tab) just next to   the current tab--instead in the right end of the list (as it'll take more   efforts to find original tab when I'm done in the new tab).    Currently  the only shortcut for opening a new tab is Ctrl-T  which creates a   tab in the end of the list--while new tab right next to current can be only   created with mouse  in the context menu for the current tab.    Please provide keyboard shortcut for creating a new tab right next to the   current tab. </pre>
