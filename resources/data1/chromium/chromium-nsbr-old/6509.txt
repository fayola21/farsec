<title>Issue 6509 -   chromium -    Browser (tab) crash (caused by javascript?) on sms.orange.pl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to <a href="http://sms.orange.pl/">http://sms.orange.pl/</a>  2. Type some letters into the &quot;odbiorca&quot; (receiver) field.  3. The tab crashes (the &quot;sad tab&quot; appears).          The letter gets removed from the input field (I think there's some kind of   javascript input validation and that's a field for a phone number).      The tab crashes (the &quot;sad tab&quot; appears).    Please provide
