<title>Issue 11131 -   chromium -    [Linux] Toolbar buttons look bad at very narrow browser width - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you make the browser too narrow to hold all the toolbar buttons  they  start to overlap (instead of just truncating the ones on the right). This  is because of the way the GtkHBox that holds them allocates its children.  One way we could fix this is by setting the hbox in a GtkFixed and giving  the hbox a minimum width. </pre>
