Post a reply for any discussion thread in   that community.  2. A CAPTCHA is displayed for verification before posting the contents of   reply  3. Type the CAPTCHA in the provided text box and hit Enter key      If the CAPTCHA word  as shown in the image  is entered properly in the text   box  the contents of the reply message should get posted under a discussion   thread of that community.      Even after entering CAPTCHA word correctly in the text box  an error   message is displayed saying the word was incorrect and a new word is   displayed. Even after multiple attempts the same error message keeps   repeating and new words are displayed even if the word I typed in the text   box matched exactly with the displayed word. It happens to me 7 out of 10   times while I am trying post replies for discussion threads in the Orkut   communities. Every time I give up after trying about 12-15 times. I haven't   faced this problem while using IE or Firefox. CAPTCHA word gets verified   and the reply gets posted in the first attempt itself when using IE or   Firefox.    <b>Please provide
