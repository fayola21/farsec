<title>Issue 4683 -   chromium -    Allow completion of foo-&gt;foo.com instead of search by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Type &quot;foo&quot; in the URL bar.  2. Hit enter.  3. The browser does a search on your chosen search engine for &quot;foo&quot;.    Standard old-school behavior in other browsers was to try foo.com  then   fail if it didn't exist.  Later  Firefox did an &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; search    but you could turn it off if you wanted to.  There's no way to get this   behavior in Chrome  so I do a lot of unintended searches.  It's annoying    it wastes my time  and it tells Google a lot about my browsing that I'd   rather not share with them.  If I want to search  I'm perfectly capable of   doing so myself  either with a search keyword  the search box  hitting down   arrow to select &quot;Search for &quot;foo&quot; on Google&quot;  etc.                Please provide
