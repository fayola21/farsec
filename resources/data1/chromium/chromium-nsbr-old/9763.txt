<title>Issue 9763 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Shift text alignment depends of the sides of both the Ctrl and the Shift keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.2             IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Use LeftCtrl+RightShift to RTL or RightCtrl+LeftShift to LTR a text in a   textbox      In Windows  only the Shift key matters- as long as you use the Right one it   will RTL   and as long as you use the Left one it will LTR  There is no difference between which Ctrl key you choose to use with it.      In chrome the side of the Ctrl does matter for some reason  so the above reproduction steps will do nothing   </pre>
