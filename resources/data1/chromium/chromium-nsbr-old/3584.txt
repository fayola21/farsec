<title>Issue 3584 -   chromium -    Handle image downloads as Opera - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request from user:    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1672">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1672</a>  The option to disable image downloading (showing cached images instead) is   very useful for GPRS-connected users and for &quot;per MB&quot; ISP users.  For example  in Russia lots of people still use Opera just because it saves   traffic very much if you disable image downloading </pre>
