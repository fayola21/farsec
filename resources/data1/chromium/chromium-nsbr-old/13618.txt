<title>Issue 13618 -   chromium -    Tooltip popup from toolstrip crashes Chrome on close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1                    1. Install any extension that utilizes the toolstrip on the bottom.  2. Hover over that extension and wait for the tooltip to popup.  3. Close out Chrome.      Chrome should close out normally.      You receive a message stating Chrome crashed  and if you want to cancel or   restore.    This was tested with numerous extensions and seems to occur with anything   utilizing the toolstrip. </pre>
