<title>Issue 5896 -   chromium -    IE takes the total width of all child elements where as others take the width defined in parent element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Open the htm file in Chrome.        There should be visible white space of 10px between the image with red   background on the left and the div with blue background on the right.          The attached file shows a case where the padding-right style attribute is   being ignored. The div floating on the left (in red) has a padding-right   value of 10px yet the div floating on the right (in blue) is NOT shifted to   the right by 10px of the image inside the left div. IE does this correctly.   Firefox also fails this. This clearly is not the result developers would   expect.    Note  the div on the right has not been given a width and I feel that since   normally divs attempt to take up as much space width-wise as possible  that   it should stretch to the right end of the browser window. Chrome and FF   give it the width of its content. IE stretches it to the edge of the   window. I do not know which method is following IEEE standards.    Please provide
