<title>Issue 4151 -   chromium -    Wrench and page menus should swap - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For nearly two and a half decades  users have been conditioned to expect   application-level actions  such as new window and quit  to be contained in   an application's first menu.  Document-level actions like copy/paste and   search in page belong in the second menu.    In fact  Apple's Human Interface Guidelines recommend:  'In general  place the menus that display commands to handle higher-level    more universal objects toward the left of the menu bar and the menus that   focus on the more specific entities toward the right.'    Please switch the positioning of the Chrome (wrench) and Page menus to   follow this convention. </pre>
