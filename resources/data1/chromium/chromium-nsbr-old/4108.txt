<title>Issue 4108 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: much slower scrolling on simple pages like news.google.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: much slower scrolling on simple pages like news.google.com    observed in 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4734)    this is probably a regression from the webkit merge that resulted in   replacing our ScrollView implementation with the new one from hyatt.    perhaps we are doing something wrong that causes optimized scrolling code   paths to be disabled. </pre>
