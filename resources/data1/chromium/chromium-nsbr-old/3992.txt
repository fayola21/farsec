<title>Issue 3992 -   chromium -    U+30FC U+30FB are regarded as unsafe when mixed with Kanji  Katakana  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Follow-up to <a title="Raw Punycode is displayed though it should not be" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3158"> issue 3158 </a>.     U+30FC and U+30FB are classified as 'Script_Common' rather than 'Katakana'.  As a result  they're regarded as unsafe when mixed with Kanji.     This is an issue only if we determine the IDN safeness *without* language  info (i.e. only based on script-mixing detection). Because our test takes  into account A-L in most cases  it's not that critical.      </pre>
