<title>Issue 9978 -   chromium -    Resolve Mac omnibox TODOs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The change <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/50074">http://codereview.chromium.org/50074</a> lands a ton of TODOs  in the interest of having   a working basic omnibox without letting perfect be the enemy of good enough.  This bug is to   remind me to review and convert every TODO to either a separate bug w/associated set of goals  or   just address them all.    The files are under chrome/browser:  autocomplete/*_mac*  cocoa/location_bar_view_mac*     </pre>
