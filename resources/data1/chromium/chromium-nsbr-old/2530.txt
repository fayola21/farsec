<title>Issue 2530 -   chromium -    Need better documentation/notification about new versions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/</a>    When a new version of Chrome is released  you need better documentation   that it has been done  and the release notes need to be updated on time (at   the above webpage and any other relevant webpages).    Chrome 149.30 was released on Sep. 17  but the release blog was not updated   until late on Sep. 18.  There have already been many sites/reports that say   there is no auto update  or the update has problems  or are complaining   that release notes were not available.    Of course  the auto update is fine (it may just take a few days)  but even   in less than 24 hours  there will be people that correctly complain there   were no release notes  not on time anyway.    You need to have the release notes prepared and blogged when the new update   is available. </pre>
