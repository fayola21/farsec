<title>Issue 17365 -   chromium -    &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0 (21170)  URLs (if applicable) : NA      1. Open any web page that contains links.  2. Right click on a link and choose &quot;Open link in new tab&quot;.  3. The new tab will open in the foreground ie it will be switched to   immediately  instead of placing it to the background.        I think in previous versions new tabs were opened in the background. It would   be nice to let the user choose which behaviour to use. </pre>
