<title>Issue 1383 -   chromium -    window.focus from child window does not put focus back on the parent (opener) window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3 for Windows: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK       IE6/IE 7: OK      1. Launch a new window using window.open with some window name say 'Child'.  2. From child window  try to put focus on parent (opener) window using   window.opener.focus().  3. Parent does not get focus.  4. On similar notes  put focus back onto the parent window and invoke same   script that had launched the child window. As window name is same  the   focus should go to the already open child window. Make focus() call on   child window handle.      window.opener.focus() should have put focus back on to the opener window.   Also  providing existing window name to window.open function should put the    focus back on to the child window.      Focus does not shift. In general  window.focus() function does not seem to   work at all.    Please refer attach files 1.html &amp; 2.html to see the issue in action.  </pre>
