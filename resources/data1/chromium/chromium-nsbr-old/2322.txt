<title>Issue 2322 -   chromium -    GDI leak in browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't yet have STR. Using the browser (trunk) for a period of time    multiple tabs and windows  eventually the omnibox will go black. Typing in   it will cause a white omnibox to paint at 0 0 on the display (i.e. outside   the browser window). If I look in Task Manager at this point I see   chrome.exe with 9 996 GDI objects. A process is allowed 10 000.    At this point  if I open a new tab (Ctrl+T)  Chrome will crash.    This is worth tracking since I've seen it three times in two days now.   </pre>
