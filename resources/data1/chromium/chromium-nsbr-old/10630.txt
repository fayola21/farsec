<title>Issue 10630 -   chromium -    Shortcut for activating RTL should not be available in RTL systems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Build oficial 13645)                      Safari 4: OK                 Firefox 3.x: OK                        IE 7: OK                        IE 8: OK  Every other app on Windows: OK ;)      1. Find a textarea (bottom of this page for example) and write something  2. Press RightCtrl + RightShift (in this order)      Nothing should happen  since I don't have any RTL language support installed; just like in the other browsers and everywhere   in Windows (Notepad  Wordpad  Word...).      RTL is activated and user gets confused and frustrated :(    Please note that I am reporting this from the perspective of a non-RTL user. I have Windows XP in Spanish and my keyboard is   in Spanish  and I _never_ use a RTL language. That's why I haven't checked the first box in this screenshot (Control Panel &gt;   Regional and Language Options &gt; Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages (including Thai)):    <a href="http://www.i18nwithvb.com/images/RLO_Tab2.jpg">http://www.i18nwithvb.com/images/RLO_Tab2.jpg</a>    My suggestion: detect if RTL is available in Windows (it is if that box is checked). If it is  enable shortcut. If it is   not  disable shortcut.
