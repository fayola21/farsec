<title>Issue 4005 -   chromium -    Add histograms for cookie garbage collection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add some UMA/histogram data for cookie usage and garbage   collection policy  especially with an eye towards whether our cookie limits   (1000 global  50 per-host) are appropriate.  I have a sneaking suspicion   that heavier usage of many tabs  and of the internet in general  means   these limits (mainly the global one) are low.    Specifically  it'd be nice to know how many cookies people have and how   fast that value grows over time (especially as a function of how many   cookies they already have); how often garbage collection runs  and how many   cookies get pruned due to the host limits versus the global ones; and the   buckets for cookie creation times/access times/remaining lifetimes. </pre>
