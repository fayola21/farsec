<title>Issue 12320 -   chromium -    Refactor TaskManager so it's easy to close it programatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently TaskManager::Close doesn't mean &quot;close the window&quot;  but rather   &quot;this is the callback from view code run when the window is closed&quot;.    This makes it hard to make a cross-platform test which explicitly closes the   TaskManager  so I'm going to add a static TaskManager::Close method with   meaning &quot;close the window&quot; and rename existing &quot;Close&quot; to something   different. </pre>
