Go to some site  say  uefa.com.  3. Wi-Fi router's DNS will resolve this to the IP of router's admin console   and ask you for login and password.  4. Connect Wi-Fi router to internet.  5. Check that all sites are working.  6. Go to uefa.com. Notice that it goes to router's admin console again.  7. Try Ctrl+F5 - force refresh.      loads real uefa.com      reloads admin console.
