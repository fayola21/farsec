<title>Issue 6788 -   chromium -    &quot;ps/2&quot; should default to search iff &quot;ps&quot; defaults to search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think my heuristic that says &quot;nonempty path == URL&quot; is wrong.    I think we should navigate for a URL iff we would navigate for its host.    This will probably be quite tricky to pull off.  We would need to mark this   &quot;unknown&quot; and then score it differently in the HistoryUrlProvider  perhaps    the way we do for bare host entries.    Nicolas noted to me that if the user types in &quot;who/nicolas sylvain&quot; and we   know &quot;who&quot; is an intranet domain  we should navigate instead of search.   </pre>
