<title>Issue 1639 -   chromium -    New tab do not inherit parent history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)          Firefox 3: FAIL       Galeon 2: OK      Open a link in new tab.      It would have been nicer if clicking the Back button in the new tab should   work as if the link was opened in the original tab.      Should I want to go back  but the original tab in which I opened the link   is already closed  I need to open the History page in stead.    The Galeon web browser in the desired way  and I really miss it in other   browsers. </pre>
