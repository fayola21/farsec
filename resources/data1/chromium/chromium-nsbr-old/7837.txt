<title>Issue 7837 -   chromium -    Allow setting of queries and paths (and maybe hosts?) on path URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe Safari and other browsers will  allow setting the query or   reference on a path URL like data or about.

This blocks <a title="ed2k:  apt:  mailto: and other protocols should not encode | and =" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=160"> issue 160 </a> </pre>
