<title>Issue 2311 -   chromium -    Need a URL that shows tree open/close state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> e.g.     build.chromium.org/isthetreeopen    ... we should then access this URL from gcl commit before checking in to   make sure the tree is open before the commit proceeds.    a -f/--force option would override for people checking in bustage fixes. </pre>
