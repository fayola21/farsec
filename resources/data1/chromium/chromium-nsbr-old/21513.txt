<title>Issue 21513 -   chromium -    Restore pages that were open last sometimes shows blank page until window is resized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Select options-&gt;on startup-&gt;restore the pages that were open last  2. Open around 5 tabs  3. close Chrome  4. restart Chrome    What is the expected output?  Tabs should be restored and display properly.    What do you see instead?  Sometimes one of the tabs will be blank.  Reloading appears to do stuff   (based on spinner  etc) but contents still do not display.  Resizing the   window causes the contents to suddenly appear.    This is with google-chrome-unstable on Ubuntu Jaunty.  I've seen it with   multiple versions of chrome but just remembered to file the bug now.    The pages I had open the last time were something like:  <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html">http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html</a>  <a href="https://mail.google.com/a/google.com/">https://mail.google.com/a/google.com/</a>  <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=37.42&amp;textField2=-">http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=37.42&amp;textField2=-</a>  122.08&amp;FcstType=graphical  something on <a href="http://www.pamf.org">http://www.pamf.org</a>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cycletracks/updates/list">http://code.google.com/p/cycletracks/updates/list</a>   </pre>
