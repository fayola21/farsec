<title>Issue 6645 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Play video file while it is downloaded by Chrome  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43             IE 7: OK (i have to find the file in Content.IE5  but IE allows the   file to be played while it is downloaded)      start downloading a video file  when 2 or 3 MB of file has been downloaded   try to play the file (in my case vlc player)  the file will not play. other   players fail too.      the file should play      the file will not play  because google chrome is using it and deny access.   i want this feature so i can decide whether i want to download this file or   not.  <a href="http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=54860">http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=54860</a>      </pre>
