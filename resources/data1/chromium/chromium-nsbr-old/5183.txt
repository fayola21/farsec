<title>Issue 5183 -   chromium -    can't set multiple -webkit-transforms on a single element  as you can in Safari - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: n/a           IE 7: n/a      1. Set the following CSS rule on an element (I used an IMG):  -webkit-transform: skew(0  -15deg) scaleX(0.9)      The skew should be applied to the element  and then the scale should be   applied to the skewed element.      Only the scale transform is applied.     </pre>
