<title>Issue 19293 -   chromium -    Port SSLConfigService to Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to port SSLConfigService to Mac.    If Mac has system settings for &quot;checking certificate revocation&quot; or &quot;Use SSL   2.0  SSL 3.0  TLS 1.0&quot;  we should use the system settings.  Otherwise  we   need to provide an SSLConfigService interface that can be implemented by an   application  such as using the application's preference system.    mattm is changing SSLConfigService into the interface I referred to in <a title="Port SSLConfigService to Linux" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19290"> issue   19290 </a>. </pre>
