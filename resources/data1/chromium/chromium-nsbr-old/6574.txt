<title>Issue 6574 -   chromium -    Need help link in &quot;plugin needed&quot; bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many users have difficulty installing plugins for a variety of reasons   (Chrome has to close  they don't have admin rights  etc.)  They often try   several times to install a plug-in without success  and give up.  We can   improve this problem by pointing to help resources.    To this end  we should have some way to point users to help on why the   installation might be failing  and what they can do.    If possible  please add a link to the right side of the &quot;you need a plugin&quot;    bar that points to a help center article about common problems when   installing plug-ins. (See mock screen shot  attached)           </pre>
