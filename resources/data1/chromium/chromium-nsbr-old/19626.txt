<title>Issue 19626 -   chromium -    Clear Browsing Data Dialogs are all different - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open Clear Browsing Data on Linux  Mac and Windows    What is the expected output?      Dialogs should match    What do you see instead?    Buttons differ in labels and order:     Mac buttons are   Cancel  Clear     Linux buttons are  Close  Clear Browsing Data with icons on the buttons     Windows buttons are Clear Browsing Data  Close       We should use the same text.  Cancel seems more appropriate.       Buttons should be in the same order on the screen.    Default buttons inconsistent:     Mac default button:  Cancel     Linux:  Clear browsing history checkbox     Windows: Clear browsing history button (hitting enter or space after the   dialog opens clears your history!)       Cancel should be the default button. </pre>
