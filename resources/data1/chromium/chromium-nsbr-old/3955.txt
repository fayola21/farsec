<title>Issue 3955 -   chromium -    Use F5 to reload unloaded page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9      1. Open page  that loads slowly because of connection issues or something   else.  2. Use F5 to &quot;reload&quot; (start load again) this page to make it loaded at   last (thanks for stupid ISP I really need to do this sometimes and it   really helps)      Page starts to load again as if I stop loading and start it again.      If page hasn't loaded at all it wouldn't reloads. I really don't know how   to describe that moment. May be it happens when domain name wasn't resolved   in IP address or when server doesn't answer yet. But it really don't   responds to F5 sometimes. It's annoying.       </pre>
