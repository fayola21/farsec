<title>Issue 13163 -   chromium -    Add a &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; DNS cache to HostResolver - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (&quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; are terms coined by jar).    &quot;micro&quot; cache:  Concurrent requests for the same hostname should result in a single OS   resolution  rather than parallel requests to the OS for the same hostname.    &quot;macro&quot; cache:  A short-lived cache in front of the OS resolver (1 minute)  that avoids   asking the OS to repeatedly resolve the same hostnames.
