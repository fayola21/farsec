<title>Issue 4512 -   chromium -    Tab becomes untitled while changing views in Google Reader - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Have a Google Reader account with at least two subscribed feeds.  2. Read one feed ('subscription').  3. Click on a different feed while looking at the tab title.    * What is the expected output? What do you see instead?  The tab's title changes to 'Untitled' or '<a href="http://www.google.com/re...'">http://www.google.com/re...'</a>   while the new feed is loading. The title should not change (Firefox and   Safari both exhibit the correct behavior). Note that this does not occur   for all navigations within Reader (the settings page  for example).    The effect is mostly one of annoyance. Not sure whether the fix should be   in our browser UI (maybe we shouldn't empty tab titles if we already have   one for a page) or further down in WebKit.   </pre>
