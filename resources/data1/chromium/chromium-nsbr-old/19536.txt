<title>Issue 19536 -   chromium -    Mac video tag just hangs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a page with a video tag w/o --single-process  2. Watch the beachball spin.  3. Watch it spin more.        The video area should at least render with default controls.  So should the   rest of the page.    For Darin  it seems that the tag itself doesn't paint (no word about   whether or not the rest of the page hangs).    If you enable --single-process  video works better  but there are various   hangs and freezes that will come up at random (often when scrubbing    seeking  or playing with controls).   </pre>
