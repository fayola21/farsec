<title>Issue 5996 -   chromium -    Tooltip gets direction from Chrome langauge  not element (or even page) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create and open a page with the following source:  &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;  &lt;span dir=rtl style=&quot;background-color:Red&quot; title=&quot;_��__��__��__��_!&quot;&gt;Hover here!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Blue&quot; title=&quot;Hi!&quot;&gt;And now here!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;    2. Hover over the red span. With Chrome's language set to English  the  tooltip reads (visually) &quot;_��__��__��__��_!&quot;. With Chrome's language set to Hebrew  the  tooltip reads (visually) &quot;!_��__��__��__��_&quot; (which is what you want to be).    3. Hover over the blue span. With Chrome's language set to English  the  tooltip reads (visually) &quot;Hi!&quot;. With Chrome's language set to Hebrew  the  tooltip reads (visually) &quot;!Hi&quot;.        The directionality for the tooltip should be taken from the element on  which it is declared  as is the case in IE7 and FF3. Arguably - but less  usefully - it could also be taken from the page's directionality (body  element). Taking it from the browser's language  as is the case currently   is useless.        The tooltip's directionality is taken from the browser language. This  results in English tooltips being garbled in a Hebrew Chrome and Hebrew  tooltips being garbled in an English Chrome. There is no workaround. Using  Unicode BiDi formatting characters (LRE  RLE  PDF) in the tooltip text only  works if Windows is configured to have complex script support  which is not  the case for the vast majority of machines.
