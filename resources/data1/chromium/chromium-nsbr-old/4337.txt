<title>Issue 4337 -   chromium -    Layout tests on Windows don't collect stderr - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Although test_shell_thread.py tells the subprocess module to pipe stderr   with stdout  on Windows it looks like it's being dropped on the floor   instead. This is hiding possible problems.    I tried a fix that pulled stderr out into its own pipe and read and printed   it out after receiving #EOF on stdout  but this led to instability on the   buildbots. The test harness would hang on most  but not all  runs. I   haven't looked closely into what was going on or whether there was a   specific subset of tests that cause problems.    At first  the patch caused Python to abort with a MemoryError  which I   fixed by not collecting empty stderr lines. Then one test did hang more   consistently  so I added it to tests_fixable with a SKIP. Then I tried   commenting out the lines that were collecting and printing stderr.  But   none of that helped  so I rolled back the original change completely.
