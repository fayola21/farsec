<title>Issue 3574 -   chromium -    [new http] Impose a timeout on keep alive connections - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sourced from buganizer:1278706.    [new http] Impose a timeout on keep alive connections    Right now  we just wait for the server to close a keep alive connection    but if the server chooses never to close the connection  then we'll end up   keeping the connection open too long.  We should have our own timeout. </pre>
