<title>Issue 18242 -   chromium -    Extension tries to install by itself - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	3.0.197.0 (Udviklerversion 22243)      1. Install an extension  2. Let Chrome run (idle?)  3. After not having used the browser for ex 30 mins and returns there's a   dialog  whether I want to install extension - yes or no - no records of   what extension it is.      The dialog shouldn't just show by itself         Dialog with extension install appears.    There is none windows open where there's a possibility to install an   extention so I have no idear of how this happens. But it has done this at   least 3 times now. I'v tried reboot and reload of extensions but no luck.    I have the following extensions install:  FlashBlock  Gtalk  Facebook Notifications  Fastbook - Right click context menu for faster actions on friends   </pre>
