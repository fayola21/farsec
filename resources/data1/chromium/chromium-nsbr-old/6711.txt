<title>Issue 6711 -   chromium -    Gmail chat is buggy when zoomed and other usability problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open gmail.com  2. login  3. press Ctrl+Plus several times       Should work as nicely as before      Horizontal scroll appears  which makes very inconvenient to work with the   right-side chat and labels.    Also  if I open chat  everything is moved in a very buggy way - so chatting   in zoomed Gmail is almost impossible (see screenshot).    Please provide
