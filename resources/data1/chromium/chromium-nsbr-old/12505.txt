<title>Issue 12505 -   chromium -    Can't close or minimize a non-main window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1  OS version           : 10.5.6    Open a chrome window and switch to a different app.  Try to close or  minimize the chrome window.  The chrome window will come to the front  but  not become main  and it will not close or minimize.  Clicking again will do  nothing  unless you first make the window main by clicking in it elsewhere. </pre>
