<title>Issue 15079 -   chromium -    NNTP: First run experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   In NNTP  If user has no thumbnails  then we show empty thumbnail frames. I   believe it could be intended to work  But I like the old fashioned   informativate &quot;The 'Most visited' area shows the websites that you use most   often. After using Google Chrome for a while  ...blah..blah..&quot;    Pls  feel free to close it  if it is intended to work !!! </pre>
