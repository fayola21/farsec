<title>Issue 14036 -   chromium -    Customizing bookmark bar favicons; adding text to hover without adding to toolbar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My primary issue is that I would like to know how to customize the bookmark   bar icons with my own selected ones and/or freeze cached ones.  The bookmark   bar is too small to allow text  so I depend on the favicons to determine what   sites they load.    My secondary issue is related:  I would like to have a selected &quot;hover text&quot;   for these bookmark icons.  If I eliminate the text from the bookmark bar    only the URL is displayed when I hover  and that does not always sufficiently   identify the site.  This could either be done by adding another field in the   diting of the bookmarks  or adding a check box for &quot;suppress text on toolbar&quot;   or something like that. </pre>
