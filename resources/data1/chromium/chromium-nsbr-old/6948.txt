<title>Issue 6948 -   chromium -    Tab's are above the screen when maximized and cover windows buttons when windowed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;2.0.158.0&gt;      1. Open window at maximized  2. Maximize a Window  3. Put chrome into windowed mode      The screen to be maximized without the tabs leaving the screen or covering   buttons.      When Google Chrome is maximized (Full Screen) the tabs are slightly out of   the screen. When windowed the tabs cover the windows buttons in the top   right of the screen but only very little. I have added 2 screen shots. </pre>
