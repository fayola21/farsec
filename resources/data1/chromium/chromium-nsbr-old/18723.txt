<title>Issue 18723 -   chromium -    Keychain sometimes throws multiple windows at once - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure how to reproduce this  but most of us have seen it at least once:   you go to a site with one or more stored passwords  and a bunch of keychain   dialogs show up all at once.    Given that they are modal  I have no idea how this could be happening  but   we need to figure out how and why more than one keychain dialog is   sometimes coming up. </pre>
