<title>Issue 9262 -   chromium -    Hitting Enter should close and save in dialogs with default button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12362)    This issue applies to Edit Bookmark  Add Folder  Import Bookmarks and  Settings  Clear Browsing Data  About Chromium  and possibly other dialogs.        1. Right-click on Bookmarks bar to bring up context menu.  2. Select &quot;Add folder...&quot; to bring up New Folder dialog.  3. In dialog  hit the Return key.    What is the expected output?    Default button action should be performed (OK  Import  etc)  provided that  keyboard focus hasn't been switched to another button.  Settings  if any  should be saved and dialog closed.    What do you see instead?    Nothing happens.   </pre>
