<title>Issue 10656 -   chromium -    Chrome inaccessible by non-admin user after 2.0.172.6 update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.6    I am on Vista SP1 with UAC.      1. Install Chrome as usual  2. Switch to the beta channel  install 2.0.169.1. Everything worked.  3. Today it was auto-update (by Google Update service?) to 2.0.172.6      Able to run chrome as usual (non-admin).      If I run chrome.exe as non-admin nothing happens. If I run it as  administrator  Chrome opens as usual.    In C:Program FilesGoogleChromeApplication I see two directories.  2.0.169.1 has read permissions for everyone. 2.0.172.6 has permission only  for admin (see screenshots).    If I add &quot;Read and execute&quot; permission for my non-admin user (from the  &quot;Properties&quot; window of the 2.0.172.6 directory)  I am able to run chrome as  usual. </pre>
