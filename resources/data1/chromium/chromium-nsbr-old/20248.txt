<title>Issue 20248 -   chromium -    OSX Omnibox context menu differs from Windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Windows context menu has:   Undo   ----   Cut   Copy   Paste   Paste and search (or Paste and go)   ----   Select all   ----   Edit search engines...    Mac has Cut  Copy  Paste  Font&gt;  Spelling and Grammar&gt;  Substitutions&gt;  Speech&gt;  Writing   Direction&gt;  and a variety of context-sensitive options &quot;Open URL&quot;  &quot;Make Link&quot;  &quot;Search in   Spotlight&quot;  &quot;Search in Google&quot;  and &quot;Look up in Dictionary&quot;.  All of the context-sensitive items   appear at the top  so even if they do belong here on some level  on another level they probably   shouldn't interfere with important items like the editing commands.   </pre>
