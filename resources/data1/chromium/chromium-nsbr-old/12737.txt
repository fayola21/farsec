<title>Issue 12737 -   chromium -    '+' sign doesn't move forward when merging outside tab as last tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: rohitbm-macbookpro15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.6 (Build 9G55)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 3.0.182.1  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Start Chrome with 3-4 tabs.  2. Drag any of tab out. (So we will have window 1 and window 2)  3. Try to merge tab as last tab in window 1.      3.1 '+' sign moves forward to indicate that it has created space to  accommodate outside tab as last tab.    Actual result:  3.2 '+' sign doesn't move  so it confuses whether outside tab is being  welcomed by window 1 or not. </pre>
