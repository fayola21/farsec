<title>Issue 18694 -   chromium -    Restarting a crashed extension doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install any extension  2. Open task manager and select the extension process  3. End the process. An info bar will appear with a 'Restart' button  4. Click on 'Restart'    What is the expected output?   The extension should start again and should be painted on the extension   strip    What do you see instead?  Looks like the process gets started but it isn't painted on the strip. We   need to restart the browser!!    May be we should do what Reload exactly does?    Chromium 3.0.198.0 (Developer Build 22518) </pre>
