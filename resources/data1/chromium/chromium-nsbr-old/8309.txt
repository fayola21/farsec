<title>Issue 8309 -   chromium -    Printing Southwest airlines ticket - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1.0.154.48    If you login to Southwest online and attempt to print your ticket your seat   location will not print while all other information does.  You can see the   seat location in big letters on the screen.  I end up logging in to IE to   print my ticket. </pre>
