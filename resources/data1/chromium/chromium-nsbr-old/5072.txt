<title>Issue 5072 -   chromium -    Fix DirWatcherTest.SubDir to work on Vista (temporarily disabled) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/12907">http://codereview.chromium.org/12907</a> adds a DCHECK which is triggered in   DirWatcherTest. The fix triggers a test failure on Vista (but not on XP).    So the test is disabled on Vista  as maruel suggested  but it should be   fixed quickly.    [ RUN      ] DirectoryWatcherTest.SubDir  directory_watcher_unittest.cc:144: Failure  Value of: 0  Expected: directory_mods_  Which is: 1  [  FAILED  ] DirectoryWatcherTest.SubDir   </pre>
