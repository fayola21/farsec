<title>Issue 9426 -   chromium -    Turn off About:Network for Chrome Official Builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a number of issues with about:network that outweigh its value in   official builds.  The Google Chrome builds should not have this feature.  It   will remain available in Chromium builds.    Search for the label:AboutNetwork to find the issues I demoted. </pre>
