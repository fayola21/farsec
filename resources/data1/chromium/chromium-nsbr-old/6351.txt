<title>Issue 6351 -   chromium -    Javascript alert() brings tab and window to front (and even un-minimize browser window if needed) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. middle-click the link above to open it in a new tab  2. Chrome switches to the tab as soon as the page is loaded (alert() is called from onload).  3. Same goes if you open in a new window: the window is bring to front (and un-minimized if   needed).      The alert should only be shown when you switch to the tab where it belongs (tab blinking as in IE   is IMO more distracting than useful). It should not cause the window to gain focus either.    As an aside  of course  the alert shouldn't be modal to the window as it would prevent you from   switching from tab to tab using Ctrl+Tab (you'd first have to dismiss the alert); but that's   already covered by <a title="Javascript alerts are modal to Chrome UI  not to individual tab."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456">issue 456</a>.      Chrome switches to the tab automatically as soon as alert() is called; the window is given focus   as a result (bringing it to front  un-minimizing it if needed)    <b>Please provide
