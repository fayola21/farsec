<title>Issue 2428 -   chromium -    translation service built into Google toolbar is not available   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Translation service built in the Google toolbar for IE or firefox is  quite useful when browsing web sites for many people. I think it should be  a build-in feature for Chrome.      2. The Google-Kingsoft Powerword (a Chinese-English translation software)  can't capture the words in the web pages of Chrome. However  it can capture  the words in the titlebar of a tab  menubar  or anywhere else. Also  it  works perfectly for IE or Firefox. I don't have Safari installed  so i  don't know whether this is a bug in WebKit engine.    I really love chrome. But the lack of these two features( or bugs) makes me  switch to firefox sometimes.          </pre>
