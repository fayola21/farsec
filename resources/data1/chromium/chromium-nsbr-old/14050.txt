The awm.com.br site: Always get captcha error in first attempt. || The   Banco do Brasil one: password must have 8 digits even when I type 8 digits.

In banco do brasil it gives me the   error saying password must have 8 digits and  as the bank politics  after   the third try  the bank blocks my password and I can't log in even in   Firefox or IE.    <b>Please provide
