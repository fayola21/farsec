<title>Issue 22499 -   chromium -    No accept-language header in omnibox queries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Brad complained: &quot;FFS Google+Chrome  stop sending me to google.ru in   Russian. As fun as it is reading the funny letters  I'm using Chrome+GNOME   in English. I'm logged into Google  the past 10 months of which have been   using English. I've set my /ncr cookie and &amp;hl=en cookie(?) a dozen times.   All signs point to English  except my IP address. Yet you use my IP   address.&quot;    Steven responded: &quot;Google.com is supposed to use accept-language  which is   sent in the request header by the browser. Is chrome not setting the   header?&quot;    Brad responded: &quot;Yeah  searching using the Omnibox in Chrome Linux doesn't   send the HTTP Accept-Language header (according to the Web Inspector in   Chrome). Verified that Firefox's search does send it.&quot;    I had thought that basically all sites ignore accept-lang these days but   what do I know. </pre>
