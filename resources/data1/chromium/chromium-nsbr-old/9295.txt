<title>Issue 9295 -   chromium -    Remove first run &quot;Upgrade&quot; class for mac/linux+views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> first_run.h has an &quot;Upgrade&quot; class  described as the following:  // This class contains the actions that need to be performed when an   upgrade  // is required. This involves mainly swapping the chrome exe and   relaunching  // the new browser.    This is very Windows-specific  and probably should be just removed on other   platforms  but it depends on how the upgrade code works so I'm punting for   now. </pre>
