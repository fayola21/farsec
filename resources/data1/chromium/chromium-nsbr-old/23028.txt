<title>Issue 23028 -   chromium -    Toolstrip background repeating x and y. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)    Screencast which shows issue (audioless) 29s:  <a href="http://goview.com/goldwyn/spring/play?">http://goview.com/goldwyn/spring/play?</a>  method=playRecording&amp;recordingId=6b4807a9-373f-4ea4-9635-d56c91a2c91e    The toolstrip is basically doing the equivalent of a CSS property set like   so:  background-repeat:repeat;    However  it should be:  background-repeat:repeat-x;    and probably this would be good too:  background-position:bottom left; </pre>
