<title>Issue 8873 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Maximized window wrong size after unlock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This does not reproduce if I lock and immediately unlock my machine  but   when coming in in the morning after having my machine locked all night  one   of my maximized Chrome windows is the wrong size -- it's inset from the   edges of the work area by SM_CXSIZEFRAME.  I presume we're catching a work   area change notification and clipping the window to the work area wrongly    but I'm not sure exactly what's going on.    This started happening either due to my WM_NCCALCSIZE changes or due to   Ben's frame changes. </pre>
