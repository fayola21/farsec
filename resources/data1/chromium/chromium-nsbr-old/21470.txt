<title>Issue 21470 -   chromium -    computer takes long time to wake up from sleep when chrome is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	2.0.172.43 (Official Build )  WebKit	530.5  V8	1.1.10.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)  AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.43 Safari/530.5    URLs (if applicable) : several tabs open (mostly static pages and gmail)      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. open some pages in tabs in chrome  2. browse around for hours/days  3. sometimes put the computer into sleep mode  4. you'll notice  that sometimes it takes a lot of time for the computer to  wake up from sleep (looks like it's dead for 10+ seconds or some minutes).      Computer wakes up from sleep/stand by immediately  even if Chrome is open.      Computer takes a long time to wake up from sleep/stand by.    -----  It took several months to figure out it may be a Chrome problem.  When I stopped using chrome for a while  everything was fine.    I couldn't reproduce this problem when I wanted  but it keeps coming  consistently when I leave Chrome open before putting the computer to sleep.    I used different laptops (all with Win XP  XP SP2): hp nc6000  another hp  model  ibm lenovo t60p  I talked to some other people using similar setups and they had similar  problems. When they close Chrome  everything seems working.     </pre>
