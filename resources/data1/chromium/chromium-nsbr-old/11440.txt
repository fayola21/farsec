<title>Issue 11440 -   chromium -    Popup blocker whitelist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm going to try and implement some simple popup blocker whitelisting UI.    * Whitelist will be stored in a dedicated table in the Web DB.  * Whitelisting will be hostname-based  no facility for custom filters/user   editing.  * Popups will be stored in the blocker with an associated hostname.  At the   bottom of the blocker context menu will be &quot;Allow popups from &lt;hostname&gt;&quot;   items  one per unique creating hostname (for most pages this should be one   entry).  Clicking these items will whitelist that hostname and open all the   popups.  * On sites with whitelisted popups  the blocker bubble will still appear    providing the ability to access &quot;Block future popups from &lt;hostname&gt;&quot;   entries. </pre>
