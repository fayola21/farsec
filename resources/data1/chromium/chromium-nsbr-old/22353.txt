<title>Issue 22353 -   chromium -    Remove mixed content preferences on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to the Under the Hood preference pane    Expected: There are no mixed content preferences.    Actual: There are mixed content preferences.    We removed these preferences because no one in the history of the universe used them.  Their   ghosts are still around on Mac.    (Sorry for always CCing pinkerton.  I'm just not sure who the right contact is for this issue.  Thanks.) </pre>
