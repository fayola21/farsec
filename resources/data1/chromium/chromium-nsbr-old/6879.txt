<title>Issue 6879 -   chromium -    Need a UI to delete the customized profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. We can create new profile from &quot;New window in profile&quot; menu but there is  no way to delete it from Chrome.    2. Have to delete it by deleting the shortcut on desktop and user data  under &quot;C:Documents and Settings&lt;user name&gt;Local SettingsApplication  DataChromium&quot; manually which is inconvenient for user.    3. This is a beta and dev channel issue  we don't have &quot;New window in  profile&quot; feature in stable build.    Build:  2.0.158.0 (Developer Build 8452)  2.0.157.2 (Official Build 8084)             </pre>
