<title>Issue 21818 -   chromium -    Investigate cost of browser-&gt;extension round trip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There have been numerous cases where we've wondered about the cost of doing   browser-&gt;extension round trips. For example  we might want to expose an API   to allow extension developers to cancel window opening  or tab closing. Or we   might want to allow extension developers to get inside the HTTP request   stack.    In order to be able to debate this intelligently  we need to have some idea   of the cost.    One way to do this would be to have an experiment that periodically does a   blocking &quot;ping&quot; to an extension from the browser process. Maybe we could   create a histogram of it? </pre>
