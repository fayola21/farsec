<title>Issue 19052 -   chromium -    Option to configure max-persistent-connections-per-proxy  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now there is no option in Chrome to change the option -  network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy  like in firefox. My main  concern is that in some places where they use proxy servers  which limit  the maximum persistent connections per user per proxy  if some default  value higher than the value allowed by the organization/institute is used  by the browser  the page doesn't load well.     It is exactly what happens in my case  where the allowed max value is 4 and  I think chrome uses a much higher value. So it is highly necessary (  atleast in my case ) if something could be done to redress the situation   please !     Thank You.   </pre>
