<title>Issue 6302 -   chromium -    Images disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STR (convoluted  but guaranteed to work):    1. Open: <a href="http://tours.tourfactory.com/tours/tour.asp?t=469738">http://tours.tourfactory.com/tours/tour.asp?t=469738</a>  2. Click through the tabs in the page to look at the different pictures.   After looking at a few of them a random large subset of the images on the   page will all disappear and no amount of force-repaints or force-relayouts   will cause the images to return.  3. This problem bleeds through to other pages now too so that all their   images disappear. This makes the browser basically unusable </pre>
