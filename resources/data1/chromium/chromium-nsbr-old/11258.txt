<title>Issue 11258 -   chromium -    Linux: gracefully handle small browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Currently the browser window's minimum size is 1x1. It would probably be  better to match windows. pkasting says:    &quot;FWIW on Windows we're not allowing &quot;arbitrarily small&quot;.  The main  window  for example  will stop shrinking horizontally when the location  bar is 0-width  and vertically when the content area is 0-height.  (Roughly.)  Allowing the window to get smaller than this looks odd.&quot;    Of course  we can only set hints for the window manager  and some WMs will  ignore our hints.    2) It would be nice to make widgets that are too small to be shown normally  shrink gracefully. For example  the text of an in infobar should be elided  instead of overlapping with the close button or being truncated. </pre>
