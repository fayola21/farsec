<title>Issue 113 -   chromium -    &quot;google&quot; as first term in search query gets removed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In the omnibar  type 'google chrome download' without the quotes.  2. Press Enter.  3. You get a google search for 'chrome download'  not 'google chrome   download'. The omnibar seems to assume that the &quot;google&quot; part means a   google search.  Some may consider this a feature  and maybe it is. However it is contrary   to expectations and would at minimum require a bit of retraining. I see now   that the suggestion dropdown shows first an option to search for &quot;chrome   download&quot; and second an option to search for &quot;google chrome download&quot;. Not   bad. I'm sure I could learn to use it.  It's a little suspect though that if I know exactly what I want to do  and   I type it  I still have to check the suggestion dropdown to make sure the   browser hasn't &quot;intelligently&quot; inferred changes into my query.                Please provide
