<title>Issue 6972 -   chromium -    Page title on tab selector disappears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0      I have not found an exact way of reproducing it. I saw it happening a few   times. Clicking a few links and the tab selectors will be back to normal.      The various tab selectors contain the page title and  if present  the sites   favicon.      The tab selector only contains the close button and sometimes the favicon    but not the title.    I have attached a screenshot to show what I mean.    I am running a dutch version of Windows Vista SP1 and chrome is also in   dutch.   </pre>
