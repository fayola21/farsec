<title>Issue 17230 -   chromium -    HTTP authentication dialog doesn't highlight non-alphanumerical characters on double-clicking a masked password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37 (Official Build )  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/internal">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/internal</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Go to any site that requires basic HTTP authentication  2. Enter a password in the password field with non-alphanumerical   characters in it  such as !lolol!  3. If you double click on the masked password (*******)  the non-  alphanumerical characters will not get selected (that is  in the case of   !lolol!  the asterisks on the edges won't get highlighted)      Double clicking on a masked password should select the whole password.      It tries to select only a single word  that is  the selection stops at word   boundaries such as non-alphanumerical characters.     </pre>
