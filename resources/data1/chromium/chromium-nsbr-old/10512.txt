<title>Issue 10512 -   chromium -    Drag &amp; drop text on NTP Search box allowed  but dropped text ignored by search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.175.0 (Developer Build 13665)        1. Drag a link  a Most Visited thumbnail  or a Recent Bookmark  etc. and  drop it on one of the Search boxes on the New Tab page.  2. Or  just enter text in the Search box.  3. Hit Return to initiate a search.    What is the expected output?     Either navigate to whatever URL is in the box  or disallow  dropping/entering text in the Search boxes.    What do you see instead?    Navigates using the original search.  Chrome appears to be dropping text  and then ignoring it when you try to perform a search.   </pre>
