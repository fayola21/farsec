<title>Issue 6015 -   chromium -    Suggestion: I wish Chrome would confirm &quot;close all tabs.&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    I often close all my tabs on accident  when I mean to close only the   current tab. I'm just so used to clicking the X in the upper right hand   corner  it seems impossible for me to break this habit.    In IE  if you do this while multiple tabs are open  it says  &quot;Are you sure   you want to close all tabs?&quot; Which I find really helpful. I can't figure   out a way to make Chrome do this. Is there a way? If not  then I would like   to suggest it!    Thanks. :)    PS Here is a way to make it better than IE: When the &quot;Are you sure...&quot;   dialog comes up  IE gives you the options CLOSE TABS and CANCEL. But   usually what I really want to do is just close the active tab instead. So   if you added a CLOSE ACTIVE TAB button  Chrome would be approximately one   million times better than IE. </pre>
