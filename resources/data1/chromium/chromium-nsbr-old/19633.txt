<title>Issue 19633 -   chromium -    UI issue - Tabs should extend to top of window as they do on Win32 versions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1    OS version               : 10.5.7 Build 9J61  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Tabs extend to very top of window      1. Open Chrome  2. Open multiple tabs  3. Observe tab placement      Tabs should extend to the very top of the window to maximize screen real   estate as they do on the Win32 versions        There is a gap of space over the top of all the tabs about half the height of   a tab.  In the beta versions of Safari 4 the UI had tabs placed in an almost   direct mimic of the Win32 Chrome builds.  The Chrome UI for builds for OS   X should maintain this same UI design  and eliminate the gap of space   above the tabs. </pre>
