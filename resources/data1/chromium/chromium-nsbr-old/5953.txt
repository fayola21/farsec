<title>Issue 5953 -   chromium -    can't scroll by hitting &lt;SPACE&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.156.0 (7533)  Maybe since revision &gt;6000  6000 is OK.    When the content is large enough to need scrolling(surely this is the most   common case)  I prefer to hit &lt;SPC&gt; to scroll to next screen but nothing   happened.    Do you guys all do this with mouse wheel?    Sorry for my pool English.   </pre>
