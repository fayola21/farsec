<title>Issue 8893 -   chromium -    Middle-click on Home button should open new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0           Safari 3: No      Firefox 3: Yes           IE 7: No      1. Middle-click any link in the bookmarks bar or links in a page.  2. The window will open in a new tab.  3. Middle-click the home button      Open the home page in a new tab      Nothing. Middle-click event is not recognized on home button.    Notes  This is feature Firefox has  and I've grown accustomed to it. Chrome   doesn't have this feature  so if I want to open my home page in a new tab I   have to first open the tab  and then click the home button. You should be   able to middle-click the home button like any other link.   </pre>
