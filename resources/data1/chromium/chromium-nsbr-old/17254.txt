<title>Issue 17254 -   chromium -    Low contrast scrollbar thumb - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;include svn revno; e.g. dpkg -s chromium-browser&gt;                  1.Look at the thumb (if you can find it)      My GTK+ theme has a fairly high contrast scrollbar: blue thumb against gray   gutter.  Chrome has a gray thumb against a darker gray gutter.  If you   stare right at them  it seems easy enough to tell them apart  but in   practice  I just don't notice it.  I think it's primarily an issue when I'm   expecting to see in my peripheral vision an indicator of how far down a   page I am. </pre>
