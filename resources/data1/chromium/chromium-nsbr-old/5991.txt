<title>Issue 5991 -   chromium -    Trim Idle Tab Memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36      1. Open a new tab  2. Browse 5-10 pages in it  3. Repeat    This is a typical usage scenario for a many-tab user like myself.  We   browse a little  find something interesting to consider  then open a new   tab to continue free browsing.  Right now I have gmail  8 &quot;interesting&quot;   tabs  and 1 active browsing tab.    After the &quot;interesting&quot; tabs are idle (having not been actively navigated   for some time) their memory usage is far higher than need be because they   are still retaining their cached history.    Tabs should have an idle timeout where they progressively (or all at once)   start discarding their back-forward history information (and other memory   cached objects).  Sometimes after a long while  maybe even a browser   restart (with the reopen tab option)  I manually trim the browser memory.    I do this by copying the url for a tab  closing the tab  opening a new tab    pasting the url  then go there and repeat for the next tab.  This can   almost halve the browser memory consumption but it is time consuming. </pre>
