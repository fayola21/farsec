<title>Issue 23053 -   chromium -    Add median and standard deviation to the slowness report - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ojan suggested that the slowness report at   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/slowness-report/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/slowness-report/</a> should also display   median and standard deviation.    Filing a bug so it doesn't get lost. </pre>
