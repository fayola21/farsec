<title>Issue 8726 -   chromium -    Cursor should be reset when popping up right-click menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right click a link and pick &quot;copy link address&quot;  but don't move the mouse.    The mouse is a hand  even if it's not over a link.    This is minor  but it's made much worse if we bring up a modal dialog from   the right-click menu -- the whole renderer is stuck with the cursor set as   the hand. </pre>
