<title>Issue 11592 -   chromium -    feature request: chrome should be able to automatically delete cache/history etcetera after a specified time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [FEATURE REQUEST:]  Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1             IE 7/8: Partially OK               In internet explorer you are able to set a time that the History should be   deleted. If you for example have specified to keep your history 15 days and   you visit a page on 1 April  the history of that page will be deleted on 16 April.  I think Chrome should also have such a thing for History  the Cache  Download history  Cookies and saved forms. So if I specify that I don't   want to keep the history more than 14 days it will be deleted automatically    on the 15th day.       Currently you can only delete it manually from wrench - delete browsing   data (not the correct translation  but in dutch it is &quot;Browsegegevens   wissen...&quot;). Also you currently are only able to delete this day's  last   week's and last month's history  but you for example can't specify 'two   weeks' or something like that. </pre>
