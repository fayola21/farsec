<title>Issue 10713 -   chromium -    No connecting-to--host indication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.5 &amp; .6      1. click on link at the &quot;Most visited&quot; page  2. ...or type url and hit enter        First: Small light blue circle (besides the tab title) turning counter   clockwise until Chrome has connected to site.    Second: The same circle going bold (or dark blue) and turning clockwise   during loading of site.        First step doesn't happen. Second step does  but until Chrome has   connected  everything is quite and still.    This gives the impression that Chrome is slow or unresponsive. Liked it   better the old way and hope this is merely a bug and not redesign of GUI. </pre>
