<title>Issue 11761 -   chromium -    Find in page inconsistent and wrong for certain search strings. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Search google for &quot;HTML&quot;. The results page should have lots of instances  of the string &quot;HTML&quot;.  2. Search in page (ctrl-F) for &quot;HTML &quot;. The find box reports [0 of X] where  X is the number of hits  however  none of the hits are highlighted. Note  that if you just search for &quot;HTML&quot;  it works as expected.    This is broken on a variety of chrome builds: I tested the beta channel  (windows)  ToT (windows)  and ToT (linux). The same search works fine on  Safari 4 (528.16). </pre>
