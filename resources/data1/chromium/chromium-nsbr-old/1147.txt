<title>Issue 1147 -   chromium -    Clicking on object/embed TAG with flash content disables keyboard shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. visit above link  2. click on flash player image to the right        A popup should open  exactly as if you clicked the text link below the   image      nothing opens  but I noticed that after clicking  CTRL-T does not open a   new tab  while you're still viewing this tab... perhaps Chrome THINKS it   DID open a popup?    Please provide
