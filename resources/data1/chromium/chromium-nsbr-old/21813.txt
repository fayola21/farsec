<title>Issue 21813 -   chromium -    default Dictionary is corrupted with non-words that I never added. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43      1.  Cannot edit the dictionary to remove 'words' that are really typos such   as inst for isnt and fro for for.          I expect to be able to remove these words from the dictionary used for the   spell checker.       I have to manually spell check every document.     </pre>
