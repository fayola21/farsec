<title>Issue 2243 -   chromium -    Accessibility tests' use of indices to locate views is error-prone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's very easy to break the accessibility tests in ways that are not   immediately obvious how to fix. This is because the tests locate views in   the browser window using indices and predefined containers. The   documentation in chrome/test/accessibility/constants.h etc is also a bit   sparse as to the structure the tests expect.    Ideally  all of these controls would have view IDs  and the tests would   just use the IDs to locate the views. </pre>
