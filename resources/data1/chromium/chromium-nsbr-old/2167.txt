<title>Issue 2167 -   chromium -    Confusing behavior after adding the New Incognito Tab page to bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : New incognito tab page      1. Open a new incognito window  2. Add the new tab (the one with &quot;You've gone incognito&quot;) to bookmarks.  3. Switch back to the &quot;normal&quot; window.  4. Click on the bookmark.      The &quot;normal&quot; new tab page should open  or maybe this page shouldn't be  bookmarkable (or something else?).      The &quot;You've gone incognito&quot; page shows. This is confusing as we are in a  normal window. Users could think their privacy is safe  while it's not.    Also  I tried to add the New Tab page and the New Incognito Tab page to  bookmarks  the pages are different but the URLs are identical:  chrome-internal:.    Note: after restarting Chrome  the bookmark leads to the normal New Tab page.    </pre>
