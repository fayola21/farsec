<title>Issue 21091 -   chromium -    Chrome being very unresponsive  freezing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	4.0.207.0 (Developer Build 25450)  URLs (if applicable) : All  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    What happens?  I truncated the cookie-cutter bug report stuff because it didn't apply..    Chrome's web area (perhaps the renderer?) randomly locks up. I click a link   to go to a next page and the hand icon stays there and the page is frozen   until the new page loads. I'm trying to copy text (click'n drag)  it   freezes. I try to close Chrome (via the window X) and it takes a good 3   seconds to close (it seems as if it's waiting on the renderer to shut down?  ).. it's not event driven  apparently -- I can be doing anything (to   clicking on a button  a checkmark box  dragging text) and the renderer just   seizes. I don't even have to be doing anything.. sometimes I'm just   scrolling through the page and it stops.    At first I thought it was a plugin  so I used the --disable-plugins   parameters to disable them  and it still persists.    I also thought it was the latest version of the dev build (and it still   very well may be)  so I installed the dev build I had a few days ago (~200   revisions) and it persisted.. maybe I didn't notice it a few days ago  but   I certainly do now haha          System specs:  Windows 7 RTM 64-bit (build 7600)    Please let me know if you need anything else. </pre>
