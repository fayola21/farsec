<title>Issue 9208 -   chromium -    Linux: &quot;Show item in folder&quot; should show item in the file manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The download item menu item &quot;Show item in folder&quot; is currently  unimplemented on linux. There are two aspects to this:    a) We must be able to open the folder in the system default file manager  (probably want to use xdg-mime or xdg-open for this)  b) We *should* be able to select the file within that file manager </pre>
