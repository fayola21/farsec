Site functionality is blocked by map module which renders other services   unusable. The site is written for IE6/7 or FF2. Old site which is not   adapted to Chrome or newer FF versions.          What is the expected result?  Users will use another browser          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Run URL  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Tested Chrome FF5 where the page does not load correctly. States prior to   loading page that IE6/7/FF2 is required  so the site is prob. outdated.   Might not want to address this?    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
