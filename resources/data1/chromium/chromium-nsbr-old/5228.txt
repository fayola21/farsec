<title>Issue 5228 -   chromium -    Crash: when right-click Preview and then Cancel from Save As dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 0.4.154.31 (Official Build 6264)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Click a link which downloads a file (eg. the Download link for the   attachment in this bug report)  2. In the Windows &quot;Save As&quot; dialog  in the TOP pane  right-click on an already   saved JPEG and select Preview.  This will display the JPEG in Windows Picture   and Fax Viewer (or whatever your default JPEG viewer is.)  3. Close Windows Picture and Fax Viewer  4. Click Cancel on the Windows &quot;Save As&quot; dialog.    5. Repeat steps (1) through (4) for the same Download link    Chrome will crash usually within within 1 to 3 times.    Crash specifics differ depending on:  - how long you wait after the &quot;Save As&quot; dialog appears  - if a duplicate file already exists in the default download folder and Chrome   auto-suggests a ...(1)... alternate filename  - if the file you right-click to preview is the identically named duplicate   file or if it is a totally different filename  - if the second file you click to Download is the same as the first file or not    Usually  when Chrome crashes  it will prompt you to restore the previous pages   when restarting.  One time  I said &quot;Yes&quot; to restart  but it never prompted to   restore the previous pages (and they were not restored).   </pre>
