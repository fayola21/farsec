<title>Issue 17913 -   chromium -    Wrong description of printing-related string translation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       &lt;message name=&quot;IDS_DEFAULT_PRINTER_NOT_FOUND_WARNING_TITLE&quot;   desc=&quot;Title of the warning dialog when no when no printer is available&quot;&gt;          No printer found  Please install a printer.        &lt;/message&gt;      Looking at the use of this  it seems this is not the title of the dialog    but rather the content.  If it really is intended to be the title  it should   be much shorter and have different capitalization.  If it is intended to be   the body of the dialog  it should not have a sentence splice.  :) </pre>
