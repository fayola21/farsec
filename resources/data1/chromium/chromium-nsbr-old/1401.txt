<title>Issue 1401 -   chromium -    Playback of audio (and possibly video) in a background tab stutters when working with other tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27    Open an online radio  start playing the stream and continue working with   the browser. The playback should stutter at least once in 30 minutes   (though with my PC it usually is more)    I suspect there is some synchronization between the tabs  and that's the   reason for stuttering. There is a somewhat similar bug here with the flash   video stopping while a big page gets loaded in a background tab  it might   be related. </pre>
