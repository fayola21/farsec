<title>Issue 22951 -   chromium -    History should re-use existing tab if it's on NTP  otherwise create a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - create a tab but don't load anything (so it's on the NTP)  - open history (cmd-y or menu)    expected:  - history re-uses empty tab  but if the current tab isn't NTP  creates a new   one    actual:  - history always creates a new tab.    Usually i get into this pattern where i want to navigate to a new website  so   i open a new tab  then realize it's in my history  when opens up yet another   tab. It should recognize that I'm on an empty tab (starting a new   navigation) and re-use that tab.    It shouldn't re-use the current tab if it's anything but NTP. </pre>
