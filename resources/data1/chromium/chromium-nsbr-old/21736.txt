<title>Issue 21736 -   chromium -    Breakpad glue should have the same interface on all platforms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's kind of annoying that the Breakpad glue has a different interface on   each platform.  It makes it harder to work on the parts of the app that   interface directly with Breakpad  such as Breakpad init and testing whether   a handler is present.  Working on the implementations on each platform is   further complicated by having different implementations on Mac and Linux   for the &quot;stubs&quot; used when Breakpad is not used.  To further complicate   things  Windows doesn't use &quot;stubs&quot; but it has its own way of doing   something different when Breakpad is not in use.    It would be nice if all of our Breakpad glue shared the same interface on al   platforms.    chrome/app/breakpad_*.     </pre>
