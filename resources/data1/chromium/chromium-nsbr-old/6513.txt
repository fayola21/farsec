<title>Issue 6513 -   chromium -    Possible leak in TabContents::AddInfoBar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a cursory look through AddInfoBar it looks like if the delegate is not   added (one exists that is Equal)  then it is leaked. I suspect the right   thing to to do is to make it delete the delegate before returning (and add   a virtual destructor to InfoBarDelegate)  but the code needs to be   investigated more thoroughly to make sure callers can deal with that. </pre>
