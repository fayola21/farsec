<title>Issue 5095 -   chromium -    TestShell: Clicking popup menu select asserts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a page with popup menu selects  (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>) and click one of the popup  menus. We assert.    What's happening is that we're asked to create a popup widget with no  NSWindow parent (webwidget_host.mm  WebWidgetHost::Create()). We then  subtract the toolbar height from that empty frame rectangle  giving us an  invalid size rectangle. We then assert trying to use it.    Treating a popup menu like a window sounds bad  we'll have to figure out  how to get around this and use a real NSMenu. I think on windows they fake  it  but we shouldn't do that.  </pre>
