<title>Issue 8449 -   chromium -    Can User maximize/size a Full Screen window ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11008">r11008</a>  This looks like quite interesting.    -Switch to Full Screen mode from a [Maximized/Un-maximized window.]  -Alt+space bar to get the window's context menu.    In the context menu  I believe we should disable Size/maximize button.  (Screenshot 1)    I can able to resize/maximize/Restore a full screen window. See the  attached screenshot2  how it looks like for a RESIZED FULL SCREEN WIDNOW.    IE7.x: Looks good   they disable both of the above options. The move option  is enabled for which it is used the exit the full-screen.    FF3.x: Behaves like Google Chrome.     </pre>
