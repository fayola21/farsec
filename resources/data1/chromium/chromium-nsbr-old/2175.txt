<title>Issue 2175 -   chromium -    Uses huge amount of CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.0  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://mobile.younet.com/files/20/20149.html">http://mobile.younet.com/files/20/20149.html</a>            Firefox 3:OK        1. open url <a href="http://mobile.younet.com/files/20/20149.html">http://mobile.younet.com/files/20/20149.html</a>      The cpu usage should be low.           But chrome cost 100% cpu usage.    With firefox 3.01  there  about 20% cpu usage. And when the tab is not  active the cpu will drop to 0.  But with chrome  there are always 100% cpu  no matter the tab is active or not.  It seems that the chrome still run the non-active tab. And the flash plugin  use much more cpu than firefox       </pre>
