<title>Issue 3512 -   chromium -    Context menu key should show up right context menu where ever applicable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed in various scenarios  we are not showing up the right context   menu with Context menu key of the focused element.    Secenario 1:  1. Do tabbing in [New Tab] to get keyboard focus on a thumbnail.  2. While focus on a thumbnail  hit context menu key.     [we end up with rendered page context menu instead of thumbnail context   menu]    Senario 2:  1. Do tabbing in [New Tab] to get keyboard focus on links in Recently   Bookmarks/Recently Closed Tabs section.  2. Hit context menu key.    We end up with rendered page context menu instead of link context menu.  Scenario 2 is applicable to on any link in a rendered web page also.       </pre>
