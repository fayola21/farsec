<title>Issue 19964 -   chromium -    Tab-modal sheets don't work in full-screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 203.0 (Developer Build 23709)  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Cmd-Shift-F to go full screen.  2. Navigate to a site which requires http auth login (or carpet bombs) -- you have one   bookmarked  right?      An http auth login (or download blocker alert) sheet.      Nothing. Really  a GTM assertion failure. More badness/weirdness follows when you try to quit   (but you can  eventually).    Presumably  I'm on this. </pre>
