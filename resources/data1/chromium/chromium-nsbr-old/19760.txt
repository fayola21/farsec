<title>Issue 19760 -   chromium -    Experiment with shorter suggest delays - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we delay 200 ms after typing before sending a query to the   Suggest URL.  This helps prevent unnecessary load on the server at the cost   of making the omnibox results laggier.    We should experiment with lowering this to determine the right cost/benefit   point.  For example  we could histogram the intervals between keystrokes    the time it takes Suggest results to return after sending the query   (segregated by default search engine)  how long it takes the dropdown to   become stable  etc.; we could also collect server-side load info for a   small experimental cadre.    Anecdotally  setting this to 0 in my local build feels nicer than 200  but   the effect is small unless the history DB results also come back very fast   (which generally only happens on a newish profile). </pre>
