<title>Issue 9120 -   chromium -    Move a11y accessors on View onto separate utility object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> View exposes numerous a11y accessors and setters. It'd be nicer if there was   an a11y metadata object that a View could configure and return. This would   also remove the windows.h dependency from view.h </pre>
