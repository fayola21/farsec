<title>Issue 7624 -   chromium -    Add automatic correction to spell checker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should make it so that commonly misspelled words get automatically corrected. For example    &quot;tihs&quot; could be switched to &quot;this&quot;  &quot;teh&quot; to &quot;the&quot;  etc. This feature will probably need some   tweaking before it feels right  but could be a real improvement to spell checking in browsers.    The words should get corrected immediately after the user types a space or another separator.   This correction should only happen for typed text  not for text that has been copy-pasted or   automatically filled in (like the reply text in an email).    Some UI should indicate that the correction happened and allow the user to revert it (and other   actions such as &quot;add to dictionary&quot;). However  lets worry about that once we have an initial   prototype and get a feel for whether we like it or not.    Initially  we can use the existing spellcheck suggestion generator  and pick the most common of   the suggestions. I'm not sure if this comes with some measure of confidence  but if so we would   want to use a fairly high threshold.    We may also want to develop more specific algorithms. I presume these errors are often due to   people typing too fast and letters getting swapped out  so one possible algorithm would be:  * if the just typed word is misspelled (&quot;tihs&quot;)  * create alternatives by swapping adjacent letters pairwise (&quot;iths&quot;  &quot;this&quot;  &quot;tish&quot;)  * look up each alternative in the dictionary  * if one alternative gives a correct spelling  auto correct the word  * if there are several matches  disambiguate by picking the most commonly occurring one   </pre>
