Links on the right hand side of the page are shown slightly above where   they should be. Since they overlap with the dark background  they are not   clearly readable.        What is the expected result?      Those links should be located lower so that they do not overlap with the   background.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://www.origo.hu/hircentrum/index.html">http://www.origo.hu/hircentrum/index.html</a>  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    It worked properly in Firefox 3.0 on Linux.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
