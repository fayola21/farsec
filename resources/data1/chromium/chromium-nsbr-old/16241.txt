<title>Issue 16241 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/dom/anchor-toString.html is unnecessarily platform-specific - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The above test case contains &lt;a href=&quot;/somefile&quot;&gt;. When loaded locally as a   file URL  this can produce platform-specific results in anchor.toString().   Changing this to &quot;http://localhost/somefile seems to be safer and is   generic. </pre>
