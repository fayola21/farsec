<title>Issue 5820 -   chromium -    Gmail leaks memory if left idle overnight - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.36&gt;        1. Open gmail (with chat)  2. check memory usage  3. leave over night  3. check memory usage again      There shouldn't be more memory used as time goes on.      Seems like the memory is doubled from the day before.       </pre>
