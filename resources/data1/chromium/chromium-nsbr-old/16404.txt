<title>Issue 16404 -   chromium -    'Always open files of this type' no longer working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Always open files of this type worked fine until the latest dev channel   release. Works fine in previous version.  2. In case it matters  I found the problem as I was clicking on torrent   links  which would normally download the torrent and then open them up in   utorrent. Now it no longer opens them unless I click on the downloaded   torrent.                  <b>Please provide
