<title>Issue 4134 -   chromium -    Crasher with dangerous download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Download the smallest .exe file you can find   2. Chrome prompts of a dangerous download  3. Make sure the download tab is opened (CTRL-J)  4. Press Discard for the pending dangerous download    Causes a crasher.      Notes:  The download tab keeps a list of the dangerous downloads that are complete  but not yet validated  for clean-up reasons: it registers as an observer  for these downloads (so be notified when they are validated) and needs to  unregister itself.  We are deleting the download item before we notify the donwload tab that  the model changed. It still owns a ref to the download item and crashes  when accessing it. </pre>
