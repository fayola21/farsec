<title>Issue 14131 -   chromium -    New windows tile incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using 3.0.187.1 (Official Build 18142).    When I do New Window (ctrl-n)  windows tile towards the left  and such that I   can't see their contents.    My expectation is for them to tile towards the right  and be visible.    Screenshot attached -- the foreground window (completely clipped) is the last   window placed by ctrl-n.    This probably has something to do with my taskbar being on the left. </pre>
