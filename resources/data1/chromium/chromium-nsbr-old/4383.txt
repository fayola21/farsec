<title>Issue 4383 -   chromium -    Chrome cuts downloaded file without any warning if there is not enough free space on the drive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Take USB Flash drive with 20MB of free space  2. Try to download a 50MB file  3. Chrome says that it succesfully downloaded 50MB but the file size on the   USB Flash will be 20MB because there is no more free space.      Chrome should check for free space on the drive and show a warning message   if the file will be cutted.        The file is cutted.  I got the issue when i tried to download this file:  <a href="http://www.avg.com/filedir/inst/avg_free_stf_eu_8_175a1382.exe">http://www.avg.com/filedir/inst/avg_free_stf_eu_8_175a1382.exe</a>    Please provide
