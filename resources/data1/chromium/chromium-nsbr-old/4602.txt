<title>Issue 4602 -   chromium -    Update Default Settings copy within product - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.154.9    Changes to copy within product:  1) When you press the 'Reset to default' button in Tools menu &gt; Options &gt;   Under the Hood  the confirmation dialog message shows some mis-  capitalization: '...Do you want to Reset Chrome options?'    2) After you reset to default  the spell-checker should be turned on.   Currently  if you've turned it off in Tools menu &gt; Options &gt; Minor Tweaks &gt;   Change fonts and language settings &gt; Languages tab  the 'Check spelling'   checkbox remains unchecked after resetting to default.
