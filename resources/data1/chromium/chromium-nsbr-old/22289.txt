<title>Issue 22289 -   chromium -    kMDItemWhereFroms metadata attribute is missing from downloaded files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (Official Build 25617)    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): FAIL  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Download a file  e.g. gears-osx-opt.dmg.  2. Try to determine the file's origin without reference to   chrome://downloads/        Once download is complete  the file should be placed in ~/Downloads and   set the com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms attribute to record its   origin.    $ mdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms gears-osx-opt.dmg   kMDItemWhereFroms = (      &quot;<a href="http://dl.google.com/gears/current/gears-osx-opt.dmg">http://dl.google.com/gears/current/gears-osx-opt.dmg</a>&quot;       &quot;<a href="http://gears.google.com/download.html?statcb=1">http://gears.google.com/download.html?statcb=1</a>&quot;  )        The file is placed in ~/Downloads but the   com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms attribute is not set. As a result   there is no mechanism (besides chrome://downloads/) to determine the   file's origin.    $ mdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms gears-osx-opt.dmg   kMDItemWhereFroms = (null)      The Finder exposes the contents of the kMDItemWhereFroms attribute in   the Get Info window  and various third-party utilities  such as Hazel  use   the information to facilite automated filing (for example to organise the   Downloads folder by originating domain). </pre>
