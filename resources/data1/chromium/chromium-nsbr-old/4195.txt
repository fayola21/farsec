<title>Issue 4195 -   chromium -    MessagePort GC layout tests are flaky. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running all the layout tests in the LayoutTests/fast directory    LayoutTests/fast/events/message-channel-gc.html will sometimes fail.  This   started happening after a completely unrelated change.    The code is:      var channel = new MessageChannel;    channel.port1.foo = &quot;bar&quot;;    gc();    channel.port1.foo;  // -&gt; sometimes undefined    I'm guessing that the port1 wrapper is not kept alive across GCs.  The   flakyness is probably because the gc() call does not always cause an actual   GC. </pre>
