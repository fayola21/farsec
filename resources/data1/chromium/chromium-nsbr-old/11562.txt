<title>Issue 11562 -   chromium -    Address bar focus feature request  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi  I would like to request a feature to let the user experience better.    What happens now:  * Now when we go to address bar we need to click one time on web address to  have this full selected (focused).    The idea:  *I think will be better if we just need to hover the mouse on address bar  to have this full selected.   </pre>
