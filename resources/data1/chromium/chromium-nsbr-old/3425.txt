<title>Issue 3425 -   chromium -    Remove port/history/HistoryItem.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a copy of third_party/WebKit/WebCore/history/HistoryItem.h in  port/history/. Eventually this needs to be removed.    It was added because under gcc  '.' is always the first item in the include  &quot;&quot; search path. So when we were including &quot;HistoryItem.h&quot;  we were pulling  in third_party/WebKit/WebCore/history/CachedPage.h instead of  port/history/CachedPage.h. </pre>
