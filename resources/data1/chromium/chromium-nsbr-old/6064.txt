<title>Issue 6064 -   chromium -    -webkit-box-shadow + position:absolute renders incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the attached test case  select the word foo and watch the drop-shadow   disappear under the word.    This will affect new tab page soon as we'll be using box-shadow +   position:absolute there.    This does not happen in webkit nightlies.    Alternately  paste the html from the test case into <a href="http://www.plexode.com/cgi-bin/insta-html.py">http://www.plexode.com/cgi-bin/insta-html.py</a> and select the word foo. The   shadow paints ~100px above the word. </pre>
