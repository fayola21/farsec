<title>Issue 4662 -   chromium -    Download manager UI doesn't effectively use window space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  0.4.154.23      1. Download any file and got to download manager view      I can clearly read the status of the downloaded file.      Some most important information on UI is truncated even if there is a free   space left to use.  In my example I should be able to read how big the file is  but that   information is unnecessarily truncated.      P.S. Please don't treat such kind of suggestions as trivial becasue in fact   most of impression for the users creates the UI.     </pre>
