<title>Issue 4284 -   chromium -    Omnibox flashes with black color  before Edit Search Engines dialog is displayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may be covered by similar bugs.    I notice  Omnibox flashes with thick black color  before &quot;Edit Search  Engines&quot; dialog is displayed (from Omnibox context's menu)    I believe this happens every where (32-bit XP/Vista  XP/VISTA 64-bit  machines). But it is very hard to notice this flash on local machines as it  happens very quickly.  The better idea is to connect to a remote machine and reproduce it.      (I've connected to Vista 64 bit machine remotely)  1. Navigate to any webpage.  2. Right click on Omnibox and say &quot;Edit Search Engines&quot; from the  interstitial context menu.  Notice the entire omnibox is flashed with black color.    See the video @ http://go/bug_videos/OmniboxFlash.avi    Please  feel free to close it  if it is working as intended.   </pre>
