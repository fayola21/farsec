<title>Issue 8353 -   chromium -    Clicking space when focused on a button also (mistakenly) scrolls down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Find a page with a form with a button (preferably one that does not   cause a page-change; for example  the &quot;Send&quot; button in GMail.)  2. Use Tab to focus the button.  3. Hit the space bar.        Should be the equivalent of clicking the button with the mouse (pressing   the button).        Button is pressed  but ADDITIONALLY  the page scrolls down.    Here's a minimal HTML fragment that shows this effect. The very long image   is needed so the page could scroll down:    &lt;form&gt;  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; onClick=&quot;return false&quot;&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;invalid&quot; width=&quot;10&quot; height=&quot;10000&quot;/&gt;   </pre>
