<title>Issue 7385 -   chromium -    Nightly tarball should pull a known-green revision - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Rather than pulling whatever is in the tree at 2 AM  the nightly tarball  should contain the last known-green build. This revision number can be found in  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/LATEST/REVISION">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/LATEST/REVISION</a>    Since the latest green revision may not change from day to day (unlike the  latest revision overall  which is highly likely to change each day)  the  script should also make sure it's different to avoid unnecessary work. </pre>
