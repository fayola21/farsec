<title>Issue 21175 -   chromium -    Add &quot;New Window&quot; to the Dock menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome version: 4.0.206.1  OS version: 10.6  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Safari shows &quot;New Window&quot; Dock   menu item      1. right-click the Chrome icon in the Dock while Chrome is running      A &quot;New Window&quot; menu item should be present.      No &quot;New Window&quot; menu item is displayed.  This feature would be convenient especially for users that utilize the   &quot;Spaces&quot; feature of OS X. Currently opening a new Chrome window while   another Chrome window is already open in another &quot;space&quot; requires the   user to switch to the Chrome window on that other space  open a new   Chrome window  and drag it back to the original space. </pre>
