<title>Issue 13052 -   chromium -    Options dialog too tall for a netbook. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.0 (Developer Build 0)      1. Open the options dialog      The options dialog will fit on the screen of my netbook which has a maximum   resolution of 1024x600.      The options dialog is too tall to fit on the screen.  As a result  the   lower portion of the dialog along with the close button are cut off.      The options dialog should be made shorter (maximum height of 560px or so)   (and wider if necessary) in order to fit on netbook displays. </pre>
