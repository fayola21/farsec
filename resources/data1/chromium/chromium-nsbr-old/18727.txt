<title>Issue 18727 -   chromium -    404s should not be added to history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enter an incorrect URL into the omnibox twice (or however many times it   takes to start autocompleting) such as googlechromreleases.blogspot.com        Since this page returns a 404 status code (I checked) I wouldn't expect   Chrome to learn to autocomplete it. </pre>
