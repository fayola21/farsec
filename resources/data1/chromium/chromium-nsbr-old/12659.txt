<title>Issue 12659 -   chromium -    Dragging higlighted text near the edges of scrollable regions should make them scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 8: OK      1. Highlight some text on a page  2. Mouse down to drag that text  3. Drag it near the edge of a page  frame or textarea that scrolls      The scrollable region scrolls.      Nothing    In textareas  this means you can't move text around past long blocks of   text without using the clipboard. In web pages  it means you can't drag   something you've just read into a control further up the page  for example   if you wanted to search for it using the site's search. IE8 has a good   implementation of the ideal behaviour.   </pre>
