<title>Issue 6367 -   chromium -    processingUserGesture() erroneously returns false - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Split off from <a title="Popup blocker overzealous  needs heuristic improvements"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6363">issue 6363</a>)    Visit <a href="http://www.in2art.com/art-supplies/sharpie-markers">http://www.in2art.com/art-supplies/sharpie-markers</a> and click on one   of the products.  In ChromeClientImpl::createWindow() when we ask if frame-  &gt;script()-&gt;processingUserGesture()  we get false. Looking upwards on the   stack  the javascript is running in response to a mouse event.    The result is that we block a user-initiated popup.    Who knows how many other sites are affected. </pre>
