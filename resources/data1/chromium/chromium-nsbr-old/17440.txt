<title>Issue 17440 -   chromium -    Controls and links broken on Ubuntu 8.10 (another fonts problem?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm running Ubuntu 8.10  with no particular things I've done to it.  When I  browse to www.google.com  I get the attached screenshot.  Text is rendered  right  but in the wrong place  controls are very tiny.  None of the  apparently links is clickable.  I can kinda select text  but my mouse  position and what's being drawn does not match.  All of the chrome fonts  seem fine  it's just the web page that's wrong.    Oddly enough  www.cnn.com works when I mouse over controls that I think are  using JavaScript to provide highlighting and links.  It's just the regular  old-school links which don't seem right  with no cursor change.  Sometimes  the text in the JavaScript links seems &quot;too high&quot;  but the area highlighted  is still right-ish  even if the text stands off the top.    Sorry for the vague report  this is completely repro on my box  it's never  worked for me.  Can't find any open bugs around it.  Attached the stdout. </pre>
