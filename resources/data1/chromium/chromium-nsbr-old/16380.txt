<title>Issue 16380 -   chromium -    Search engine management window ellipses and accelerators - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.194.0 (Developer Build 20304)  OS + version : Linux      1. Go to Options -&gt; Manage (Search Engines)    The &quot;Add&quot; button should be &quot;Add...&quot; because it opens another window and   does not  for example  add the selected item. The &quot;Add...&quot; button in the   Basics tab follows the same logic.    Also  all the buttons in the Search Engines window (except Close) are   missing keyboard accelerators.     </pre>
