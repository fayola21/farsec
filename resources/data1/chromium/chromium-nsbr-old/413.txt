<title>Issue 413 -   chromium -    Auto complete doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I enter text in the text field in my CMS i use always the same sunmer   but browser doesn't remember it next time I start to enter the same text...    Also  Maxthon browser has this nice option where you can scroll between the   tabs with mouse wheel. That way you get tab that you need realy quickly   without moving your hand and mouse at the same time...    </pre>
