Preconditions:  --save Yahoo.com page (some other) on your desktop.    Repro  #####  --Create an application shotcuts for google internet email a/c.  --Launch application shortcut (app integration)  --Drag and drop the yahoo page from desktop to app integration window.    Notice the yahoo page contains empty favico instead of Yahoo favicon.    Comments from Ben:  ##################  We should not allow drops onto app windows. This seems like an unforseen  condition. I'm morphing your bug. </pre>
