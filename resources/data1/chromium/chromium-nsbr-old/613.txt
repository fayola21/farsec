<title>Issue 613 -   chromium -    context menu has the wrong target when a text area is scrolled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: not tested      1. Select something in a text form (like this one in submit page)  2. Right click the selection.  3. Chrome drops the selection and selects the content in the end of the text   form. (same happens when clicking with no selection and also in spell-  checker's &quot;highlight&quot;...  4. Resizing the test form make the problem stop (not really all the time...   as the problem didn't happen in all forms all the time  but still happening)        Right click should not affect selection (current or a new one) and proper   context menu display.      The last characters in the form are selected and the context menu displayed   are relative to this new and undesired selection. </pre>
