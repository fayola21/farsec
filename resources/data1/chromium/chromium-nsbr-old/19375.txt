<title>Issue 19375 -   chromium -    Need new &quot;options lockdown&quot; setting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  elements in the options dialog is freely editable by users.  We   need to add support for a registry key setting that restricts users from   editing the settings in the Options dialog.    When the registry key value at    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesGoogleChromeOptionsLockdown is set to   1  the different elements in the options dialog are &quot;disabled&quot;  so the user   cannot edit them. </pre>
