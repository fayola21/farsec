<title>Issue 18368 -   chromium -    Additional Internal URL about:textbox for simple spell-checking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0         Safari 4: not reproducible    Firefox 3.x: fail    As title say  I'd like an internal uri for a textbox  preferably    about:textbox  with spell-check overrided (always enable.)    An optional feature since there are OSes that implement system-wide spell   check (I just hate that notepad cant do spell check  so....) A decorated page   should make it more interesting. </pre>
