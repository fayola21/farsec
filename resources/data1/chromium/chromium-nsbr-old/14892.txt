<title>Issue 14892 -   chromium -    Toolbar UI polish issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issues that came up from the UI polish review re: toolbars. Didn't want to  file individual issues at this stage.       1. buttons appear to be too flat - outline is too light     2. should have the chrome on windows style (border radius  3D ness)     3. horizontal spacing between each element on the toolbar should appear  equal  same for vertical padding at top and bottom.     4. Icons not aligned correctly within buttons - reload and star look too  far to the left.     5. Icons not subpixel aligned correctly - back and forward look  different (square ends)     6. Reload arrow too small.     7. 'Bookmarked' star yellow appears too light. Bottom-right star arm  looks smaller than the others.   </pre>
