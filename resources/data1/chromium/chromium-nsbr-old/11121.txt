<title>Issue 11121 -   chromium -    WebKit merge 42805:42932 Regressions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These tests started failing after landing the merge:    LayoutTests/fast/repaint/layer-outline-horizontal.html  LayoutTests/fast/repaint/layer-outline.html    The difference seems to be in the way corner paints overlap  perhaps just a   rebaseline is needed. </pre>
