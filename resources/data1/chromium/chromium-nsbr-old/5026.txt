<title>Issue 5026 -   chromium -    remove ATL dependencies from grit-generated .res string table files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to remove ATL dependencies from Chromium so that people  can build it with Visual C++ Express.    The .res string table files we generate using grit have an ATL dependency  (they #include winres.h and presumably depend on some features from that).    Note that this affects test_shell in addition to chrome since webkit has  webkit_strings.grd. </pre>
