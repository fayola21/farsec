<title>Issue 21217 -   chromium -    JAVA  Soundwave  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> What is the use of a web browser if you can't do the most simplest things on   it. You have not made it work with the most common needed essential for the   internet  that being JAVA  Soundwave  Shockwave  ect. you can't do anything   without them. why use this web browser when i can just use firefox and get   better results. this should have been the first thing you did.   </pre>
