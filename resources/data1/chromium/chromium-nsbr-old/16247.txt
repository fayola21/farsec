<title>Issue 16247 -   chromium -    Extensions should be able to set location=no when creating new windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.191.3    Chrome (rightfully) ignores &quot;location=no&quot; when a web page tries to open a  new window.  However  extensions should be able to hide the location bar.
