<title>Issue 11061 -   chromium -    Cannot search ! (exclamation mark) or &quot; (double quotes) with Ctrl+F - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Build oficial 13645)      1. Go to any site and press Ctrl+F.  2. Try to search a ! (exclamation mark)  3. Try to search a &quot; (double quotes)      All the ! or &quot; should be marked in the page.      Thhe characters are not searched. Instead  ! behaves as PgUp and &quot; as PgDn (?).    Please note I am using a Spanish keyboard layout and this could matter. If you   can't reproduce this bug with other keyboard language  try with Shift+1 instead of   ! and Shift+2 instead of &quot;. </pre>
