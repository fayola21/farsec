<title>Issue 1777 -   chromium -    Facebook Photos - 'Stuck' on a particular photo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Login to Facebook.  2. Find an album with at least a few pages of photos (I noticed this   problem with an album with 53 pictures)  3. Starting from photo #1  click on the photo  as if normally looking at   the photos.      Clicking on the photo should bring you to the next photo  and so on.      A particular photo will get 'stuck' (for me  it was photo 46 the first   time  then photo 22 when I tried to reproduce this bug so it may be   random)  and while you can click quickly through to the photos after that   one  it will always jump back to that photo after half a second.    Please provide
