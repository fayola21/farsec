<title>Issue 19591 -   chromium -    Separator character in Gmail inbox list is displayed as a square &quot;ZWSP&quot; glyph - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (23528)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com">http://mail.google.com</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  Operating System: Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open my Gmail inbox in the Chromium browser (<a href="http://mail.google.com/">http://mail.google.com/</a>)      The &quot;-&quot; character that is used in the list of inbox emails to separate the   title and excerpt of the email should display correctly and does so in   other browsers. e.g.    News - It was lovely to hear from you the other day...        Instead the - character is displayed as a square glyph with the letters   &quot;ZWSP&quot; inside in the Chromium browser as you can see in the attached   screenshot. This is the case for all of the emails in the list - all other   characters display correctly.    </pre>
