<title>Issue 20184 -   chromium -    right click -&gt; save as... on crx file doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because of the way we are integrating with the download system  it is   impossible to download a crx file. When you try  it gets installed instead.    You should be able to right-click -&gt; save as... and download the file as   normal. Note that in this case (in contrast to 20183)  the crx *should* show   up in chrome://downloads. </pre>
