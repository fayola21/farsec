<title>Issue 19020 -   chromium -    Copyright string in Google Chrome Mac about box is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In a branded Google Chrome build on the Mac  the copyright text at the   bottom of the About box (Chrome:About Google Chrome) reads:    Copyright � 2009 The Chromium Authors.  All Rights Reserved.    This is not correct.  For the branded Google Chrome  the copyright string   should be:    Copyright � 2006-2009 Google Inc.  All Rights Reserved.    This is the string that Google Chrome on Windows uses in its about box.    We can retrieve the correct string from Info.plist's   NSHumanReadableCopyright (ignoring the newline difference).  However    we don't currently provide InfoPlist.strings files in our lprojs to contain a   localized copyright.  See <a title="Mac localizations need InfoPlist.strings" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19019"> issue 19019 </a>.  We can probably also access the   correct string through our l10n machinery. </pre>
