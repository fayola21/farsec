<title>Issue 18351 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't cut the long &quot;words&quot; and messes layout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1 (Official Build 21222)  URLs (if applicable) : see attach          Firefox 3.x: OK        See the attached HTML.  There was a post on Blogger  to which someone commented  including very   long &quot;word&quot; (actually  a link: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%">http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%</a>  B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0  )  and as a result  the layout of the whole page got screwed because Chrome   allowed the middle column to become much wider than it should be.     I have cut down the page to include only the comment  both columns and CSS.  The whole page is also available if necessary.    I don't supply URL because I had to delete this comment to maintain   readability of the post. </pre>
