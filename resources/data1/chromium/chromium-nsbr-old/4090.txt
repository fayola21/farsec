<title>Issue 4090 -   chromium -    Flush chromium_utils.RunCommand output periodically even if there's no newline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In chromium_utils.RunCommand (in the buildbot scripts)  we wait for a   newline before potentially flushing output from the command.    We should also flush the buffer if it's been stale for more than a certain   amount of time  say 30 seconds  even if there's no newline.    This would help us make sure we are printing all output on the buildbot   output page. </pre>
