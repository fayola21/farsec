<title>Issue 2643 -   chromium -    Restore tabs on startup doesn't work when close an incognito window after the main browser. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I already posted this issue but it was misunderstood  let me try it again.    Product Version      : 0.2.149.30  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a         Safari 3: n/a      Firefox 3: n/a           IE 7: n/a      0. Open Google Chrome (lets call it BROWSER 1).  1. Ensure the options are set to &quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot;   under &quot;On startup:&quot; (BROWSER 1).  2. Open a few unique tabs (BROWSER 1).  3. Open a new INCOGNITO WINDOW (this action opens a BROWSER 2).  4. Close Google Chrome (BROWSER 1).  5. Close the incognito window (BROWSER 2).  6. Open Google Chrome (BROWSER 1  not incognito window).      The main browser (not the incognito window) should &quot;startup&quot; with its   previously closed set of tabs.      Google Chrome has the same size of the last incognito window and shows a   blank tab.   </pre>
