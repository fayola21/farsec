<title>Issue 14114 -   chromium -    Full screen mode causes strange/unnecessary resize in unviewed tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.187.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18043">r18043</a>  OS + version : Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit  window manager : Metacity  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com google.com/ig etc          1. Ensure that your browser window is significantly narrower than your   screen (not maximized)  2. Navigate to a website that resizes when the browser does (preferably a   complex one with a delay after resizing) such as Gmail or iGoogle  3. Switch to another tab  4. Go into full screen mode (F11)  5. Leave full screen mode  6. Return to the tab with gmail/igoogle  7. There's a jump as the page resizes to full-screen-size and then back to   the original browser width        The window is the same size as the rendered page  so no resize should occur        For some reason  the page resizes first to the full screen size and then   back to the original size totally unnecessarily. </pre>
