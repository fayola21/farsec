<title>Issue 19658 -   chromium -    Run googleurl_unittests on Mac &amp; Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is blocking on <a title="File URL test failing in Googleurl on Windows"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19657">issue 19657</a> (test failing on Windows).    The googleurl unit tests are currently only running on the Linux buildbot.   There have been several problems that have gotten through as a result of   this. For a while  the tests wouldn't even run. Now there is a failing test   on Windows.    There is a nontrivial amount of platform-specific code  especially for   Windows file URLs  which needs to be tested  so we really need to run these   tests on each platform. </pre>
