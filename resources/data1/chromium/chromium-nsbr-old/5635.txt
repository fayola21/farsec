<title>Issue 5635 -   chromium -    RenderThread::current() should be faster - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This getter does some thread local storage stuff  even though there is (I   think) only one render thread in the renderer.    When I was looking at link coloring performance  we call this twice for   each link on a web page due to the way that the WebCore integration works    which is a lot more than we were calling it previously.    For the Mozilla page cycler  it adds up to 6ms! All of the time is spent in   Windows' TlsGetValue.    I think this can be moved to a global pointer. We just have to be careful   not to call it on the main thread in the renderer. </pre>
