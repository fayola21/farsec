<title>Issue 5187 -   chromium -    The default focus is not defined for history page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.31 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)    I guess the default focus is not defined for history page [OR the rendered  page in history tab is not grabbing keyboard focus]  IF user comes back to  history page.    Here is the scenario  where you can replicate it very easily.      1. Ctrl+H to open history page.  2. Create a [New Tab] and navigate to any webpage.  3. Click on tabstrip to go to History page -- THIS IS IMPORTANT.  4. Hoping you did not click anywhere on the history page  just hit F5 Key  to refresh the page [OR]  Do tabbing to navigate to each element in the page.    What is the expected output?   The page should be refreshed [OR] should be navigated to each element    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.    I will notice the same behavior even 149.30 build  i.e not a regression :)    We believe history page is just a normal webpage  so the default focus  should be defined at all the time NOT just only at the time of creating  History tab where search input box has the focus.   </pre>
