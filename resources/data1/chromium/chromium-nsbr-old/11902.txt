<title>Issue 11902 -   chromium -    Better support for tiling window managers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both ion and pwm managers implement tabs at the window manager level by   having a 1:N relationship between window frames visible on the screen vs   windows created by applications. This makes any application-created/managed   tabs mostly redundant.    ( See <a href="http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/screenshots/ion3-3.png">http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/screenshots/ion3-3.png</a> for example   screenshot )    I propose the following changes to enhance the usability under these window   managers:    - Have an option &quot;always open on new windows&quot; or equivalently &quot;never use   tabs&quot;    - Remove the tab strip when that option is selected (making it 1px tall   could work as a simple implementation)  so that we recover even more   vertical space for the web content. </pre>
