<title>Issue 19993 -   chromium -    Add a UI indicator to improve perceived sync responsiveness during setup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have account with large amount of deleted items  2. Log in  3. Sync will not commit till we get all updates  this can take a long time  4. User confusion and sync appears not to work    Sync actually works  but can take a long time to start working.    We should sync status reporting so that users don't think we're broken for   these accounts.     Backend needs to support this as well. </pre>
