<title>Issue 21655 -   chromium -    Remote Links and Text in Download Page Not Draggable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.209.0 (26068)      (1):        1. Open the Downloads page      2. Drag a link from there or Copy Link Address          Link to remote file (eg <a href="http://somewhere.com/somefile.zip">http://somewhere.com/somefile.zip</a>)          Link opens/copies URL of local file only.      (2):        1. Open the Downloads page      2. Select URL of remote file (triple-click to get it all)      3. Drag selected URL to Omnibar  TabBar  Page  etc.          Remote file is opened/downloaded.          Nothing  nothing at all.      I don��_��_��_t know about other people  but I find that most of the time when I   open the downloads page  it is because I need to do something that involves   the URL of the remote file (eg  re-downloading a failed file  etc.)   </pre>
