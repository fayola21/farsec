<title>Issue 9333 -   chromium -    Middle-click behavior has many problems (listed here) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    1. Middle-click  and then click a new tab. Then come back to the original   tab  and you have the middle-click arrow still visible with middle-click   still active. I belive one a user has clicked a new tab  the middle-click   should be &quot;released&quot;.    2. Middle click &amp; drag downwards in a Gmail chat box  and it creates white   space at the bottom of the page.    3. Middle-click &amp; drag should be released when the button is released by   the user.  But when user clicks &amp; then drags separately  should be   released when the user clicks again. None of this happens.   </pre>
