<title>Issue 16083 -   chromium -    Image-Map doesn't work after zooming in/out (only works in normal view) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33 (Official Build )         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: Not tested yet           IE 8: Not tested yet           Opera 9: OK      1. Zoom in/out inside the browser.  2. Roll-over any image map area.  3. Try clicking that area too.      The mouse cursor shape changes after rolling-over an area  and clicking it   should redirect the user to another page.      Nothing happens at all(Neither rolling-over nor clicking works)  like   there's no image map area. (Image-Map will work normally if switched back   to normal view) </pre>
