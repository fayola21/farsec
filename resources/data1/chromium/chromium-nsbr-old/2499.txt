<title>Issue 2499 -   chromium -    Throttle the safe browsing I/O - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Regarding bug <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265</a>    On XP  the thread's priority has very little impact when doing I/O  i.e.  the whole system will still suffer. The only way to throttle this is either  to call PlatformThread::YieldCurrentThread() or to use  THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE. Idle level has impact on the I/O since the thread  won't be immediately scheduled for execution even if a core is in the idle  state  thus creating a form of throttling alas YieldCurrentThread.    Microsoft fixed that on Vista with the THREAD_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN flag  which has true effect on I/O throttling.    This feature request is about implementing both in the  SafeBrowsingService::db_thread_. </pre>
