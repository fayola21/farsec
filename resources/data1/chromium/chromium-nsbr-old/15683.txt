<title>Issue 15683 -   chromium -    tab titles don't always update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have exact steps for this  but I'm seeing it pretty often  so I'm   recording it for references.    With gmail open in a tab  at times I'll notices it's tab includes the paren   unread count  when i go look  I have no emails unread in my inbox.  Hitting   the refresh link in gmail does nothing for the title  but creating a new tab    seems to cause the other tab title to correctly update. </pre>
