<title>Issue 14201 -   chromium -    Installer should add preferences on update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Background: We want to install certain extensions as crx files when the user installs   Chrome  so that they become features of Chrome by default (features that the user can   get rid of or replace with better extensions). The RSS page action extension is an   example of this.    We already have the mechanism to specify (using preferences) which external extensions   to install and the ability to ship such preferences as defaults with all new   installations of Chrome.    We currently lack the ability to drop in new preferences when the user upgrades Chrome   (in such a way that existing profiles get the new preferences).     We need to make sure that dropping an upgrade crx for an extension does the right   thing even if the extension has been automatically upgraded through other means. I   don't think this affects this issue  but thought it was right to mention it in case it   does.    Non-goal: We don't at this point need to have a way to remove (revoke) preferences.    Rahul has graciously accepted this task  so I am assigning to him. </pre>
