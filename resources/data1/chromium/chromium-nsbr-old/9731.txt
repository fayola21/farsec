<title>Issue 9731 -   chromium -     Chrome and Google Maps enableDrawing() - bug?  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version  2.0.169.1     : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : jeff-h.com/test/enableDrawing.html  VictorHikingTrails.Org/map          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      What steps will reproduce the problem?  VictorHikingTrails.Org/map  1.Click the &quot;Pedometer&quot; button.  2.the &quot;Draw New&quot; button  3.Click on the map to do the drawing. (Note wrong box-point for Chrome)  4.click &quot;End Draw&quot; to put it on the map.  (All points displaced in Chrome)    [As posted in Maps Group:]     Chrome enableDrawing() - bug?     Has anyone else seen this &quot;bug&quot;?    Using Google Map's polyLine enableDrawing() in Google Chrome (&quot;up to  date: (2.0.169.1)&quot;) gives the wrong point.  It is offset to the north  and west of the clicked point; about 4-px and 10-px.    Here is a page that illustrates the problem I am seeing comparing  Firefox and Chrome on Windows Vista:    <a href="http://jeff-h.com/test/enableDrawing.html">http://jeff-h.com/test/enableDrawing.html</a>    (Opera and Internet Explorer also work as Firefox.)    And here is a live page that shows the problem.  (Sorry  I don't have  stripped down error-only page.):    <a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/">http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/</a>    To draw on it: Click the &quot;Pedometer&quot; button. Then the &quot;Draw New&quot;  button. Click on the map to do the drawing.  Finally  click &quot;End Draw&quot; to put it on the map.    My javascript routine is:    {    HEPoly = new GPolyline([]  &quot;#ff00ff&quot; 5 .50);    map.addOverlay(HEPoly)    HEPoly.enableDrawing()    GEvent.addListener(HEPoly  &quot;endline&quot;  function() {HEdit(-1)})    }    Potential work around:  If required  I will &quot;browser sniff&quot; and for  Chrome alter all the points in the HEdit() subroutine  but I don't  like that at all!    Thanks for any help.                      </pre>
