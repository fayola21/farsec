<title>Issue 2008 -   chromium -    On About Google Chrome page ... Update Server Not Available (error: 3) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. On my browser cannot update through the About Google Chrome page ... I   downlaoded latest build and installed it but did not correct issue. Running   Vista 32-bit and Symantec Endpoint Protection so to get the browser to work   I added -no-sandbox to the .exe file. Would this also cause the issue for   updating?                    Please provide
