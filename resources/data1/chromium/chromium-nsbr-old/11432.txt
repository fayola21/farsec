<title>Issue 11432 -   chromium -    Fail to build if build dependencies aren't met - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> gyp runs pkg-config at file generation time.  If a new user checks out the   tree  then runs install-build-deps.sh from there  it's possible that second   step installs some build dependencies that were needed at gyp-running time   (aka when we were checking out).    What are the possible fixes?  1) Make gyp fail when you don't have all build dependencies.  That will   prevent people from starting the build only to have it fail in mysterious   ways that don't point at the fact that you need gyp.  We'll still need to   instruct people to run gclient runhooks --force.  :(    2) Make the tests for pkg-config happen at build time.  I don't like this   since it slows down the build.    3) Add in some extra pass in between gyp and building  for generation of   this sort of data.  Like autoconf.    I think 3 is the most correct but 1 would at least stop confusing   developers.  P1 because this is causing me customer support time.  :) </pre>
