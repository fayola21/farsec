<title>Issue 20579 -   chromium -    Malware site causes Chrome to lock hard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0  Win Vista    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://antispyware-scanner5.com/1/?">http://antispyware-scanner5.com/1/?</a>  sess=p2T50jTwMSZpcD0yNC4xNi4xNDcuNDkmdGltZT0xMjU0NEAMPQZN    Also (I believe) get redirected there from this link:  <a href="http://www.abt.com/product/29216/Sony-HDRCX7.html">http://www.abt.com/product/29216/Sony-HDRCX7.html</a>      1. Just visit this page in a browser.  Scammy popups appear warning of some   malicious software having been detected  and an EXE file downloads   automatically (is that expected on page load??!).        Should be able to close the tab to dismiss the malware page.      I close all the prompts by hitting the red X close button  and then the   browser tab is locked hard and I have to use Task Manager to kill it    nothing else will work.     </pre>
