<title>Issue 3954 -   chromium -    &quot;Always open this type of file&quot; does not work all the time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Always open this type of file&quot; does not work when the download finishes   before the file is renamed.    In DownloadManager::ContinueStartDownload  we call DownloadFinished for all   finished downloads  and then we rename the file. DownloadFinished is the   one who launch (OpenInShell) the download file  and it fails because it's   not renamed yet.    We need to call DownloadFinished when the file is downloaded and renamed    not before.    An easy way to replicate:    1. download a small zip file and check the &quot;Always open this type of file&quot;  2. download again the same file a couple of times. It won't open all the   time since it's taken from the cache and the download is really fast.    Another way:    Use &quot;Always ask where to save a file&quot; and download a small zip file. You'll   see that it's not launched. </pre>
