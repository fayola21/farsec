<title>Issue 19694 -   chromium -    config dialog is too big when using french locale - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.0~svn20090818r23670      The options dialog is too big when translated in french (see attached   screenshots).  In english locale  it's 606 pixel large.  In french locale  it's more than 1280 pixel large (xwd failed to copy non   displayed parts of the dialog)    Some widgets should be better sized (maybe some labels should be flagged as   wrappable)      1. run chromium with the french locale  2. open the &quot;otions&quot; dialog        a dialog that fits on the screen      the dialog does not fit on the screen </pre>
