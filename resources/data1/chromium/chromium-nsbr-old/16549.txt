<title>Issue 16549 -   chromium -    extension load error isn't very useful - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have an old extension that's failing to load.  It displays the following   error in chrome://extensions    Could not load extension from 'C:Documents and SettingserikkayLocal   SettingsApplication DataGoogleChromeUser   DataDefaultExtensionsnoonppgljalnobgdpickdgaohcncdpeh0.1'. Required value   'page_actions[0].icons' is missing or invalid.    Presumably this is the RSS extension where we made an incompatible change to   page actions.  However  I have no easy way of knowing that from the message   (only the id is shown  and even that is in the middle of a long path).  I   also have no way of getting rid of this error message.  I can't tell Chrome   to remove the extension or to silence the error. </pre>
