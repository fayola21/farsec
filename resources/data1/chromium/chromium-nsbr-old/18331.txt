<title>Issue 18331 -   chromium -    Searching while page is loading stops future searches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page that takes a few seconds to load - e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_throne">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_throne</a>  2. Search on the page for some text  e.g. &quot;the first forty&quot; in the example   above  3. Reload the page.  4. As the page is reloading  press F3 to search for the item again.  5. When the page has finished loading  press F3 again.      First time I press F3 the result may not be found  since that part of the   page hasn't loaded yet. But after the page has loaded  F3 should find the   occurrence.      First time Chrome doesn't find the text and beeps. This is fine.  But after the page has loaded  pressing F3 still can't find the text.   Chrome does scroll to the right part of the page  but it beeps again  the   text is not highlighted  and the search box has &quot;1 of 0&quot; with a red   background.    <b>Please provide
