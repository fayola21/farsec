<title>Issue 16349 -   chromium -    Shadow/stroking layout tests failing as of WebKit r45473:45487 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cloning from 15873. The following layout tests are failing after updating WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45473">r45473</a>:45487:  WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/fast/box-shadow/transform-fringing.html = FAIL (this is a new test)  WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/fast/transforms/shadows.html = FAIL  WIN : LayoutTests/fast/text/stroking-decorations.html = FAIL    Probably related to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45477">r45477</a>  which modified RenderBoxModelObject.cpp. Changes to shadow   clipping behavior  apparently. </pre>
