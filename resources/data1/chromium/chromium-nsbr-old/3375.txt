<title>Issue 3375 -   chromium -    Persistent issues with window not getting WM_MOUSELEAVE messages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the mouse moves from the client area of the top level HWND into the   non-client area  or into a child control  a WM_MOUSELEAVE message is not   sent. This results in controls that occasionally appear stuck in their   &quot;hot&quot; state. </pre>
