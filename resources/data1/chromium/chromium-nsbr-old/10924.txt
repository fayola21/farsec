<title>Issue 10924 -   chromium -    V8 extension scheme check doesn't work for window.open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we do a window.open(url)  the window is created initially at   about:blank  then later navigated to the URL given.  But we need the script   object before navigation  so a context is created.  At this point  we insert   V8 extensions.  Some extensions only apply to specific schemes  but when they   check the document URL  they see &quot;about:blank&quot; and don't apply. </pre>
