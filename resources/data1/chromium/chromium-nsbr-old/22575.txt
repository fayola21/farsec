<title>Issue 22575 -   chromium -    Browser actions (and page actions): Need to be able to decode images on the fly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought there was a bug on this already  but couldn't find it.    During the implementation of PageActions we discussed being able to change   the icon to something that was not necessarily declared in the manifest. This   would require changes to how we unpack the images in the renderer.    Now  with the concept of a BrowserAction (<a title="Implement browser action buttons" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22099"> bug 22099 </a>)  this looks to me like   it is becoming a requirement. </pre>
