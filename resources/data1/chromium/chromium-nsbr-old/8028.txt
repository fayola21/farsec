<title>Issue 8028 -   chromium -    No more support for Alt+Shift+ T ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DEV: 2.0.166.0 (Official Build 10175)  Trunk: 2.0.167.0 (Developer Build 10297)    I'm not sure  we really regressed here or not supporting this any more.    Alt+shift+t should allow the user the go through toolbar buttons.    Right now  the above event is ignored.   </pre>
