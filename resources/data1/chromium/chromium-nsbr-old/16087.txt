<title>Issue 16087 -   chromium -    favicons don't show up the first time an unknown site is visited - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3  URLs (if applicable) :  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: works probably      1. Go to a page you haven't been before (e.g. asdf.com)    What is the expected result?    A favicon different from the default &quot;world globe&quot; should show up (the   &quot;blank page&quot; favicon for asdf.com).    What happens instead?    The globe shows up until the page is reloaded. This is true for every web   site (google.com  gmail  etc)   </pre>
