<title>Issue 3541 -   chromium -    Per tabs control over sounds in web pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add a &quot;speaker&quot; icon to every tab that allows you to en/disable   sound for each individual tab. It should have three options: enabled    disable and auto. By default  each tab is set to &quot;auto&quot;. A user can click   the icon to change it.    enable = play sounds even if the tab is not the current tab.  disable = no sounds even if the tab is the current tab.  auto = play sounds only when the tab is the current tab.      </pre>
