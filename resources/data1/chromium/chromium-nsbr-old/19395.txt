<title>Issue 19395 -   chromium -    Need an automation call to wait for multiple navigations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Otherwise errorpage_uitest.cc is flaky.    Something similar to routines in ui_test_utils.h where you can specify   number of navigations to wait for should be added to automation to make that   test not flaky.    It seems to be quite complicated to do so  so I wrote a browser test instead   and disabled the UI tests. </pre>
