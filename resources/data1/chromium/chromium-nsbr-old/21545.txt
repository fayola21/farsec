<title>Issue 21545 -   chromium -    For each automated_ui_tests crash  include the action sequence in the logs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When there is more than one automated_ui_tests crash per log  you see many   crashes and can't be sure which corresponds to which action sequence.    This info is available via http://chromebot but it's not accessible outside   the Google corp network. It'd be useful for me if the information was in the   logs. </pre>
