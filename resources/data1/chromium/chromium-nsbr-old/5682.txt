<title>Issue 5682 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/pservers-grad-11-b.svg has some rendering errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of the outlines on the text in the layout test:    LayoutTests/svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/pservers-grad-11-b.svg  is missing. I'm not sure why. This is in the code that gets outlines from   Windows and draws them using Skia.    This is not a very high priority bug. </pre>
