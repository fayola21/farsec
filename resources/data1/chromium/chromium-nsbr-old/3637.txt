<title>Issue 3637 -   chromium -    About Google Chrome dialog incomplete while checking for updates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On 154.3  when I open the &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; dialog box  if the   &quot;checking for updates&quot; hangs or takes a while  the dialog is not fully   painted until the check for updates completes. Something is hanging on the   update check  and during that hang the copyright sentence is incomplete.   See attached screenshot. </pre>
