<title>Issue 10890 -   chromium -    Build number not showing up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The original discussion thread for this issue is here:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/ff6036a506e52eca?hl=en    I have been using the latest dev build of Chromium for a few days now    and I've noticed that in the &quot;about&quot; menu the build number does not   show. My version information look like:     2.0.177.0 ()     See that there is nothing between the parenthesis. Is there something   wrong with my installation or is this a bug? I always use the latest   mini-installer. Below is my about:version info:       The Chromium Authors   Copyright ï¿½ 2006-2009 The Chromium Authors. All Rights Reserved.
