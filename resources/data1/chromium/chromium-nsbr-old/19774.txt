<title>Issue 19774 -   chromium -    Determine the proper conditions to continue a syncer sync cycle after it has terminated without ShouldSyncAgain  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1942448    The following code is in syncer_thread.cc:346     const bool syncer_has_work_to_do =     status.updates_available &gt; status.updates_received     || status.unsynced_count &gt; 0;    It determines whether or not to immediately attempt to continue a previous   sync cycle.  There is reason to believe that check against the server and   locally cached revision numbers is not worthwhile.  This needs to be   verified. </pre>
