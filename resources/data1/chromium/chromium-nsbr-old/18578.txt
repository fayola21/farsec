<title>Issue 18578 -   chromium -    New tab icon misplaced when some tabs are pinned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (Official Build 22005)    (Tested on gHardy)      1. Open many tabs.  2. Resize window width to small enough that there's no more empty space in   the tab strip (and tab width is smaller than default)  3. Pin a few tabs.        New tab icon is always flushed against the last tab.        There is a gap between the last tab and the new tab icon.  Unpinning tabs   will recover this space  as will increasing the size of the window. </pre>
