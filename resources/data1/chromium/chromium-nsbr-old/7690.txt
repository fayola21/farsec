<title>Issue 7690 -   chromium -    Tab Close button may not be highlighting correctly on mouse down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48 (seen it on previous versions too)      1. Press (and hold) the left mouse button on a tab close button.  2. The color doesn't change  right? It's still red.  3. Now with the button pressed  very slowly move the mouse inside the   button. You'll see that the color changes to black.  4. That's a bit weird. Is that by design or is the button misbehaving?      It should probably be black from the beginning (of the on-mouse-down event)      It stays red  becoming black only with movement.   </pre>
