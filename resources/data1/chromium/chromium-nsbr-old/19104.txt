<title>Issue 19104 -   chromium -    When using appmode  reopening the last closed tab fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an appmode window and a regular browser window with one tab in it   (navigate to any page)  2. close the tab (which also closes the browser window)  3. focus the appmode window  4. hit ctrl+shift+t to reopen the closed tab    What is the expected output?   I expect to restore the tab I just closed.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens :(     </pre>
