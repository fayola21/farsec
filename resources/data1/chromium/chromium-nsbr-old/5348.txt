<title>Issue 5348 -   chromium -    Pop-ups to show as tab by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29 (Official Build 6138)  URLs (if applicable) : Any page where a pop up is blocked  such as <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/webbradio/?guid=96c7708a-ab53-4f6d-a896-">http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/webbradio/?guid=96c7708a-ab53-4f6d-a896-</a>  db0132d39126&amp;userID=50882      1. Go to a page that blocks a popup.  2. Open the pop-up (by clicking the &quot;pop-up blocked&quot; message in the lower   right corner.  3. The popup will open  but will not show as a tab.      I would prefer if the popup would open in a mode wich made it dragable into   the main chrome window      I have to click the chrome-icon in the top left corner of the pop-up window   and choose &quot;Show as tab&quot; in order to be able to drag-n-drop the popup into   the main window.    I see two way of solving this (if you chromium people choose to solve it   that is). One way is to have pop-ups show as a tab. The other way is to not   show popup as tab  but make it drag-n-droppable anyway.     </pre>
