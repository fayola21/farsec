<title>Issue 13843 -   chromium -    Upon full refresh  Chromium does not update cache with new stylesheet and resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.181.x  URLs (if applicable) : N/A    Description:  When performing a &quot;full refresh&quot; (Ctrl+F5)  the stylesheet (and subsequent   resources) in the cache is not updated to the latest version on the   client's computer.    Reproduction Example:  Website A uses background image file bg.jpg in its stylesheet (attribute   url(bg.jpg)). Chrome loads Website A  and subsequently caches the relevant   data. The website then changes the background image to bg2.jpg instead  and   updates the stylesheet accordingly on the server. Then  when the user loads   Website A for the first time in Chrome (using parts from the cache)  it   loads and displays bg.jpg. Performing a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) will then   load bg2.jpg instead.        When the user performs a &quot;hard refresh&quot; (Ctrl+F5)  Chrome/Chromium should   recache the stylesheet and all linked resources.        Chrome retains the original information in the cache  regardless of whether   or not the server has different/newer versions of the files. </pre>
