<title>Issue 20075 -   chromium -    NYS Courts web site looks terrible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit <a href="http://courts.state.ny.us/">http://courts.state.ny.us/</a>      Expect: it to not look terrible.  Observe: it looks terrible.    The ordinary content of the page is the dark blue rectangle that begins   below a bunch of garbage that's not intended for display.  The page   normally uses a lot of that garbage as stuff that should appear when you   hover over parts of the real page.  For example  the ��_��_��_Courts: Information   about��_��__��_��_��_ bit is only supposed to show up when hovering over ��_��_��_COURTS��_��_��_ at   the top-right of the page as intended to be displayed.  These mouse-overs   are not working as intended in the screwed-up version of the page.    This is a regression.  The page functions perfectly normally in 3.0.198.1   (official 198 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23116">r23116</a> with WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46910">r46910</a>).  This problem occurs in   4.0.202.0 (official 202 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23673">r23673</a> with WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47305">r47305</a>) and in 4.0.203.0 (trunk   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24088">r24088</a> with WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47646">r47646</a>).  The problem does not occur in Safari 4.0.3   or in Safari while using the trunk version of WebKit at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47676">r47676</a>. </pre>
