<title>Issue 555 -   chromium -    Flash keeps playing after tab close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a site with a flash music player (like: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4280765.html">http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4280765.html</a>)  2. Start the music player and allow it to buffer some seconds of music.  3. Close the tab.      I expected the music would stop when closing the tab.      The music keeps playing for a couple of seconds after the tab got closed.   It wasn't even in the tab bar  when I could still hear the music.    Please provide
