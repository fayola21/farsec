<title>Issue 7717 -   chromium -    discountbank.co.il: navigation menu doesn't look right in Chrome/FF - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.discountbank.co.il/cgi-">http://www.discountbank.co.il/cgi-</a>  bin/inetcgi/discount/front/eng_homepage.jsp?src=19322  2. Look at the navigation menu on the left.        The menu items overlap each other vertically and look wrong.    Analysis:    The menu uses a table that's sized in pixels  the fonts are a little larger in non-IE browsers and   so the menu items overlap.    The easiest fix would be to make the table cells a little higher so that things look right in non-IE   browsers.    I'd recommend testing the fix on Firefox &amp; Safari on the Mac as well to make sure it looks right.    The proper solution here would be for the design not to rely on the font size of the enclosed   items.    Other Browsers:  IE7: OK  Firefox 3: FAIL  Chrome: FAIL  Safari: FAIL       </pre>
