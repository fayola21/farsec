<title>Issue 20910 -   chromium -    Need saving symbols in build system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When test crashes on buildbot we need symbols to investigate crash dump.    Currently we build Chrome without symbols for performance reason. (the only   exception is Chromium_xp_rel bot). This makes most flaky tests on buildbots   and try servers very hard to diagnose. We need to find ways to make symbols   available in more bots while not sacrificing performance much.  </pre>
