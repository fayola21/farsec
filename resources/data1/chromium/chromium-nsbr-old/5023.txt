<title>Issue 5023 -   chromium -    remove ATL dependencies from webkit/default_plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to remove ATL dependencies from Chromium so that people  can build it with Visual C++ Express.    webkit/default_plugin has a bunch of code in it to handle installation of  plugins that is implemented with WTL/ATL.  Since this is at the WebKit  layer  it means that we can't even build test_shell without ATL. </pre>
