<title>Issue 22616 -   chromium -    javascript generated html breaks entire page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.safiri.dk">http://www.safiri.dk</a>           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to url www.safiri.dk  2. If all is ok - try clicking top link buttons untill commercial appears        Shown in correct proportions and with design      HTML rendering completely fails due to missing end tags generated by javascript - which causes   a lot of other tags to be ignored. This is clearly a mistake from our Ad partner  but should   propably not be able to break the entire structure (Because of one little &lt;embed&gt; + &lt;script&gt; tag   not ended properly).  Bug introduced in Safari 4 and Chrome 3. (new webkit?)    Thanks for any assistance.   </pre>
