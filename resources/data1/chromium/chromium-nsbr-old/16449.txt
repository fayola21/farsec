<title>Issue 16449 -   chromium -    NNTP: Thumbnail border fade-in/fade-out is too slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1      1. Open the new new tab page.  2. Hover the mouse over the thumbnails.      Border fading should feel responsive  or maybe it shouldn't be animated at   all. For reference  the tab fading animation feels right.      Borders fade in and out far too slowly  making the UI feel sluggish and   &quot;wrong&quot;. </pre>
