<title>Issue 20294 -   chromium -    64-bit Flash plugin weirdness on Youtube - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.0~svn20090825r24230-0ubuntu1~ucd2~jaunty  OS + version :  Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit):  64-bit  window manager :  kwin4  URLs (if applicable) :  any Youtube  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):  Works fine. (Also works in   Konqueror.)      1. Run chromium-browser --enable-plugins --enable-extensions  2. Go to any Youtube video  3. Try to watch the whole thing        Should be able to watch the whole video -- audio and video.        On this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIwiPsgRrOs&amp;feature=rec-HM-r2">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIwiPsgRrOs&amp;feature=rec-HM-r2</a>    playback stops nine seconds in  I get the little spinner that usually   appears when it's &quot;buffering&quot; -- it has now buffered over half the video    and has not resumed playback. Attempting to pause/resume does nothing.    On this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7Wh3Cw32Ug&amp;feature=fvhl">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7Wh3Cw32Ug&amp;feature=fvhl</a>    Click HD.    Audio works fine. About three seconds in  sometimes earlier  sometimes   later  the video freezes. Audio continues as normal  and the Flash UI works   properly  but the video is frozen. Seeking causes video to resume    momentarily  then it freezes again. </pre>
