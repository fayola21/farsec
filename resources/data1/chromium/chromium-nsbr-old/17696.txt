<title>Issue 17696 -   chromium -    Theme setup can be slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run chrome with --enable-extensions and click on one of the themes in   src/chrome/test/data/extensions/ (theme.crx or theme2.crx).  There's a long   pause when the theme is being installed and the download arrow hangs while   the theme switches.    Glen  does the image loading from the extension happen on the UI thread?  I   also wonder if we're spending a noticeable amount of time tinting images on   the UI thread. </pre>
