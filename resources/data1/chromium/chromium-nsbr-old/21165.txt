<title>Issue 21165 -   chromium -    Pressing up arrow at top of page causes focus switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load a large image like <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-">http://www.tenshu.net/wp-</a>  content/uploads/2008/08/2008-08-17-terminator.png   click it to make it   larger than the browser window  2. Scroll down with the arrow keys  3. Hold down the up arrow      Expected: scrolls up to the top of the image then stops.  Actual: scrolls up then focuses the omnibox.      I can totally see why this happens and the fix isn't obvious to me. </pre>
