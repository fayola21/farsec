<title>Issue 9883 -   chromium -    preventDefault on keydown from IME does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.2 (Official Build 13060)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jparent.googlepages.com/brokenIMEEvents.html">http://jparent.googlepages.com/brokenIMEEvents.html</a>           Safari 4: OK on Windows  FAIL on Mac because the event occurs AFTER   the dom is already changed.    Firefox 3.x: Not clear  they don't even fire events most of the time.           IE 7: OK on Windows Vista (using return false rather than   preventDefault)           IE 8: FAIL on Windows XP  event occurs AFTER the dom is changed.      1. Add a keydown listener to a text input  text area  or contentEditable   div.  From the listener  call preventDefault().  2. Type into the text input  text area  or contentEditable div with an IME   active.      Character typed is not visible  nor part of the innerHTML/value of the   node  just like English input.      Character typed is visible  is part of innerHTML/value of the node.    See demo page: <a href="http://jparent.googlepages.com/brokenIMEEvents.html">http://jparent.googlepages.com/brokenIMEEvents.html</a>.  If you   type into any of the input  text area  or contentEditable node in English    nothing shows up because the event is cancelled.  If you switch languages   to something requiring IME (I was using Japanese - Katakana)  then the   characters are entered. </pre>
