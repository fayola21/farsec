<title>Issue 576 -   chromium -    Solution breaks Visual Studio  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download tarball of source files  2. Open solution file in Visual Studio 2005 SP1  3. See &quot;IntelliSense updating...&quot; in the status bar forever        I expect that the solution would churn away for a while  but then stop   updating the IntelliSense index.        Instead  the CPU usage stays at 100% forever. I let it run overnight for 8   hours without it finishing.     Please provide
