<title>Issue 14439 -   chromium -    Shortcuts for user level install are being created for all users instead of creating them for just that user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install user-level Chromium 3.0.190.0 (Developer Build 18617)    See that the shortcuts in Start &gt; All Programs for Chromium are created @ C:ProgramDataMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsChromium. Looks as if it's   considering this install as system-level. They should be created @   C:UsersusernameAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsChromium    On uninstall  these shortcuts remain.         </pre>
