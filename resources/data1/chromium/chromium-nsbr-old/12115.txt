<title>Issue 12115 -   chromium -    Allow prettier extension IDs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The extension ID shows up in a few user-visible places:    - The url when an extension shows tabcontents UI  - The folder the extension is stored in    It would be nice to have prettier strings in these places than the current   SHA1 hashes that are used for extension IDs.    A number of solutions have been proposed:    - Host-name based IDs  eg  subscribe.reader.google.com.    - If we did this  we might also want to somehow verify the extension   developer has ownership of the hostname he specifies or a parent of it.    - Simple strings  eg  subscribe-in-reader. We'd need to figure out how to   handle conflicts.    - Simply allow developers to specify a string to be used in URLs. This   wouldn't be a unique ID. </pre>
