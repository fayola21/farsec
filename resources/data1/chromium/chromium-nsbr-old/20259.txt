<title>Issue 20259 -   chromium -    Stop using the ActiveX version of WMP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have to put up with an endless supply of compatibility bugs no real   benefit.    Problems:  -our implementation is not fully complete  -scripting the ActiveX and WMP is different  and sites assume that if   they're using ActiveX version they can use the IE method names  -no one is supporting this code  -lots of bugs    -i.e. outstanding ones that I know of: 15987  15991    -recently fixed ones: 8973  11054  8584    Benefits:  -this was used to test out the ActiveX support  which we have decided we   don't want to use for various other reasons.  This is the last remaining   user of that code  so if we take it out we can remove that code which adds   extra complexity to our plugin support.  -as Jeremy had seen in his evangelism work  it's too complicated to give a   site code that will work in all browsers to script WMP.  Most sites   can't/don't get it right  and you can bet that testing the ActiveX version   in Chrome is not high on their list.      The original reason to do this was:  -get a better WMP plugin    -the newer version from MS is good enough  i.e. Firefox/Safari and all   other non-IE browsers use it  -no need to be admin to modify the ShimInclusionList registry key    -this isn't needed on Vista  and on XP most users are admin anyways      Given all the ongoing work that this requires  and the little benefit  I   think it's about time we stop using it.  I'm going to submit a patch and   get this out to the dev/beta channels  and we can see if there any   problems.  I'll also update our plugin finder service to add MS's NPAPI   installer. </pre>
