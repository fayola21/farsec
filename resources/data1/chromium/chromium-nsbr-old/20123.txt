<title>Issue 20123 -   chromium -    Chrome Linux crashes or misbehaves sometimes on autoupdate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User Elliot reported:    -- snip --  1. two versions active at same time?  1A. Opening new windows and having them look different than the window that  were already open:  my previous version had the regular linux title bars and the new  version has the weird chrome ones  so i feel certain that i had two  versions running at the same time.    1B. Typing in &quot;http://b/ to the Omnibox and having it search instead of  navigate:  i normally type just &quot;b&quot;  but when  that did a google search for &quot;b&quot; (and didn't offer the yellow &quot;did you  mean http://b/ box)  i tried http://b/ myself  and still got a google  search for &quot;b&quot;. iirc  this affected both new windows and new tabs in  the old window.    2. Crash upon autoupdate:  this weekend (friday night) i was upgraded to 4.0.202.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23795">r23795</a>  and  chrome crashed: i came in this morning to no chrome running  and  restarting it gave me the little yellow &quot;chrome didn't shut down  cleanly  press 'restore'&quot; bar. (i've had this on several other weekend  updates too.)  -- snip --     </pre>
