<title>Issue 18849 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Tabs shift after closing one tab with cursor still hovering over tab bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This problem is a bit tricky to explain so bear with me...    1) Continue opening/creating tabs until existing tabs must shrink in size   in order to uniformly fit new tabs onto the bar. As you add more tabs    existing tabs will shrink more and more to compensate.  2) Pick a tab in the middle somewhere (Not at the end). Middle click it to   close it.  3) That tab will close  and all tabs to the right of it will shift left to   fill in the space.  4) About 2 seconds after that  all tabs increase slightly in size to fill   the empty space left by the tab you just closed.    The problem here is in Step 4. In the previous behavior  the tabs would NOT   increase in size to fill the empty space until you moved your cursor away   from the tab bar. I liked the old way it worked because it kept you from   accidentally closing other tabs as you keep the cursor hovered over the tab   bar.    Please fix this ASAP. </pre>
