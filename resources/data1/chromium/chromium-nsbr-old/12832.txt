<title>Issue 12832 -   chromium -    Implement 3 stage updates to reduce the size of installer for minor release updates. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am filing this to track and later QA all the changes being done to   implement the new Google Chrome updater.  - Apart from two options of sending full setup.exe or not sending setup.exe   at all  we would be adding a third option in mini_installer of sending   setup.exe diff patch.  - Our Pulse builder script will be changed to build this installer  - mini_installer will be changed to first call setup.exe with the setup.exe   patch so that it can patch itself and then invoke the patched setup.exe.  - will add the capability in setup.exe to patch itself given the right set of   command line arguments. </pre>
