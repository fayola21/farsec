<title>Issue 17995 -   chromium -    Find text box remains opened at new page load but can not be re-updated until re-opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37  URLs (if applicable) : (normal search in picasaweb)  Other browsers tested: none      1. Do a normal search on Picasa Web Albums (no login required  just normal   photo search)  so that the search returns multiple pages of results.  2. CTRL+F a findable string in the first page (e.g. pictures author) =&gt;   number of occurrences is shown (all ok)  3. Select a second Picasa search results page while the find text box is   still opened =&gt; a) number of occurences is not updated b) pressing CTRL+F   re-highlights the find text box (leaving the user with the impression that   the results have been updated  but they are not) c) healing only be closing   the find text box and re-opening it  4. Interesting  this does not happen on normal Google searches  where the   find text box is closed on opening a new results page.   </pre>
