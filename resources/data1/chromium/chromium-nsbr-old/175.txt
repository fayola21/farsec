<title>Issue 175 -   chromium -    Google search engine in startpage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 1583    The google search engine is not shown in the new-tab startpage (there's  only history and other search engines you have used). I know that I can use  the omnibar for search  but the main search engine should also be part of  the startpage IMHO. </pre>
