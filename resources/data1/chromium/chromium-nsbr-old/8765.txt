<title>Issue 8765 -   chromium -    LayoutTests needs to be moved to third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've had two people come to me very confused about the LayoutTests  directory. It's weird that it's under webkit/data. We should move it to  third_party/WebKit. It's especially confusing for people that are new to  working on layout tests.    The only thing I can think of that needs to change is run_webkit_tests.py.  Am I missing anything? </pre>
