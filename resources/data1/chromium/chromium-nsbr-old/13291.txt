<title>Issue 13291 -   chromium -    Screen reader support for web content is needed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start any major screen reader (JAWS  Window-Eyes  NVDA)  2. Navigate the page using Tab key  listening to the screen reader output.  Ensure that every focused element has a readout as expected.  3. Access the quick keys available for the given screen reader  and make  sure that those work as expected.  4. True test is manual testing by someone visually impaired  using a screen  reader.      See above. Currently  the readout works with NVDA when tabbing  but no  support for JAWS and Window-Eyes  nor any quick keys is available.   </pre>
