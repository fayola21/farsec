<title>Issue 6364 -   chromium -    Mixed-content images when filtered are not shown properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make sure Chrome is configured to show insecure images: Wrench menu  Options  Under the Hood tab  &quot;When   there is mixed content on secure (SSL) page&quot; section  Allow insecure images.   2. Open a page with mixed content images (for example <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a> then open an email with images   in it and click the &quot;show images&quot; link in GMail).    What is the expected output?  All images show grayed out with warning signs on them.    What do you see instead?  Some of the images are not just grayed out but have random color pixels on them (as if something went wrong   with the graying out process).    Note: it seems to be mostly images that are transparent that are affected (I could be wrong though).   </pre>
