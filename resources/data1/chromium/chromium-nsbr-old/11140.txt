<title>Issue 11140 -   chromium -    Toolbar importer crash @ first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a ToT build  start it with --first-run  2. In FRUI select customize  select to import from toolbar  3. Bang! the importer process dies    Note that the main process does not die  just the importer process. For a   casual observer this might go unnoticed  except that nothing got imported.           </pre>
