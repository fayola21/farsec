<title>Issue 7445 -   chromium -    Don't initiate a download in a tab that has just been restored. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I restore my session I end up getting a bunch of files redownloaded   since I happened to leave those tabs on the download page before I   restarted the browser. My assertion is that a tab that intiates a download   shouldn't trigger the download if the tab has been restored. </pre>
