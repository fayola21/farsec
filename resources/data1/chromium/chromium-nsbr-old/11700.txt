<title>Issue 11700 -   chromium -    Ameliorate problems due to renderer being swapped out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open lots of tabs in multiple windows  including plugins (e.g. youtube    hulu etc). Use computer for a while. Sleep it  wake it up  etc etc.    After hours and hours tab switching becomes unbearably slow. This is   frustrating when you are trying to close tabs and the system must page them   in in order to shut them down.    Honestly  it would be faster for me to shoot them and reload the page than   wait for it to come back.    Sometimes when the tab is repainting the whole browser UI locks too  and   the tab content is painted in a series of horizontal strips.    I would say this is one of the biggest obstacles using Chrome on my 2.4GHz   dual core laptop/2GB RAM.    Assigning to Darin so he can find the right person to work on this :-) </pre>
