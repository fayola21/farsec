<title>Issue 19739 -   chromium -    Can't resize window while http auth login sheet is up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 202.0 (Developer Build 23612)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works      1. Go to a page which requires an http auth  e.g.    &lt;<a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html</a>&gt;.  2. Try to resize window.      You can resize the window.      You can't (unless the download shelf happened to be open). (The same is   true for the download blocker if/once you close the download shelf.)    Why does this happen?  The resize widget is in the same rectangle as the tab view  unless the   download shelf is open. When the GTM sheet controller covers it up with an   invisible window (in which it hangs its sheet and with which it enforces   modality)  it covers up the widget.    How to fix it?  Hmmm. That is a good question. </pre>
