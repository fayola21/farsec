<title>Issue 7294 -   chromium -    Youtube website does not load with 1.0.154.46 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just installed Google Chrome 1.0.154.46 and when I type www.youtube.com   in the address bar and go to the website  it displays a blank page..    Note: Youtube works if I search it from Google and go to the website. Also    Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.0.5 both load Youtube using both methods.  </pre>
