<title>Issue 13147 -   chromium -    wrong FFmpeg license - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The change in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17321">revision 17321</a> to add FFmpeg to about:terms uses the wrong  license text.  It needs to have the LGPL 2.1 (or later) summary and the  current address for the FSF.  It currently says LGPL 2 (or later) which is  the old &quot;library&quot; GPL which is not used by FFmpeg. </pre>
