<title>Issue 3292 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Refresh broken on finance.yahoo.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. So to finance.yahoo.com  2. Sign in (hopefully with account with a portfolio  though it may not be   necessary)  3. Hit refresh (F5 or menu)    What is the expected output?  Form resubmission dialog is presented. Selecting continue causes page to be   refreshed    What do you see instead?   form resubmission dialog pops up again if 'continue' is selected.      This happens in TOT the dev channel build.  Works fine in 0.2.149.30       </pre>
