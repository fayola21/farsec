<title>Issue 6114 -   chromium -    Google Chrome logo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox  Internet Explorer  Safari and Opera have proper logos. For   example  Firefox 3.1  IE 8  Safari 3.1 and Opera 10. I think Google Chrome   should also have a logo like those. This helps keep track of the progress   of the browser and will encourage users who didn't want to use it before or   are waiting until it makes some more progress to try it again. </pre>
