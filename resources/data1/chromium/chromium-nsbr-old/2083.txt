<title>Issue 2083 -   chromium -    When close downloaded items bar window doesn't resize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.0      1. Download something  2. Close the download tab      To resize the website render area to take full available space.      The website window area is still reduced for the bar space  so the user   sees a while bar  that is not the purpose of closing the bar.   </pre>
