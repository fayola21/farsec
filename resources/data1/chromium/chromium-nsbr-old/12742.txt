<title>Issue 12742 -   chromium -    Something is broken with canvas - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just got this report from an attendee at Google I/O.  This page used to   render fine in Chrome 1  but Chrome 2 broke it (the fill style is incorrectly   set to black).  It works fine in Firefox &amp; Safari.    <a href="http://api.timepedia.org/benchmark/">http://api.timepedia.org/benchmark/</a>       </pre>
