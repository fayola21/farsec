<title>Issue 21417 -   chromium -    Linux Chrome sets http_proxy to http://:8080 when Automatic proxy configuration is set - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In Linux Chrome  click Wrench &gt; Options &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Change proxy   settings. The Network Proxy Preferences window opens.  2. Click Automatic proxy configuration. The default autoconfiguration URL   is set to http://&lt;server&gt;/wpad.dat  3. Open a new Linux Terminal and check $http_proxy:  $ echo $http_proxy  http://:8080/  $  4. cd to a Perforce folder and sync--Perforce displays an error:    $ cd mysite_client  $ p4 sync   invalid proxy name http://:8080/  File(s) up-to-date.  $     5. Go back to the Network settings and click &quot;Direct internet connection&quot;.  6. Open a new Terminal and recheck http_proxy:    $ echo $http_proxy    $     Note: This same error has been reported at   <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=189617">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=189617</a>  so it's not clear that it's a Chrome issue  but  as Firefox doesn't have this issue  it may be a  Chrome issue.      http_proxy should not be set.      http_proxy is inexplicably set to http://:8080 thus causing   p4 to display messages on each Perforce command.    <b>Please provide
