<title>Issue 22352 -   chromium -    Mac: Big fat unused bar at bottom of browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Wait until you update to 4.0.211.2.  2. Restart Google Chrome.      I expect to see a browser window with minimum intrusion and overhead.   Instead I see a big fat grey bar at the bottom of the window that serves no   other purpose (as far as I can tell) except to contain the window resize box.   </pre>
