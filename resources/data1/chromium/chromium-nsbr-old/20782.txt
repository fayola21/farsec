<title>Issue 20782 -   chromium -    Cookies disappear after restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2 (Official Build 24690)  OS + version : ubuntu 8.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : gtk      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): ok    Every restart of Chrome resets all cookies  even those that should last   really long.  The most obvious problem is that google.com search shows up in German for me   every time.   Logins that stay across browser restarts on Windows don't survive on Linux. </pre>
