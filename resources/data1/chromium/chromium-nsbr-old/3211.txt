<title>Issue 3211 -   chromium -    Inconsistent line break: Ideographic Comma / Full Stop and Fullwidth ones followed by ASCII. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary:  When followed by ASCII  line break happens after U+3001 (Ideographic   Comma) and U+3002 (Ideographic Full Stop). But it doesn��_��_��_t happen after   U+FF0C (Fullwidth Comma) and U+FF0E (Fullwidth Full Stop).    Steps to Repro  1. Open test.html (attached)  2. Narrow the width of the browser window.    ### PROBLEM ###  Line break happens at different positions.  1st sentence: ��_��_��_��_��_��_��_�Ԡ��_��_��_��_��_��_��_��_ (line break) ��_��_��_test��_��__��_��_頕�_�_ѕ�_ (line break) ��_��_��_Chrome  ��_��_堕�_�_ѕ�_  2nd sentence: ��_��_��_��_��_��_��_��_��_��_ (line break) ��_��_��_��_��_��_��__��_test��_��__��_��_��_ (line break) ��_��_��_��_��_�__Chrome  ��_��_�__��_��_��_  (Line break happens also at other positions  but it doesn��_��_��_t matter here.)    ### EXPECTED ###  The 2nd sentence should work in the same way as the 1st sentence.  Japanese people use both Ideographic and Fullwidth ones when writing   Japanese text.       Chrome 0.3.154.0 on Windows XP SP2 en (System &amp; User locale = ja).    Not repro on IE8 Beta2 and IE7.  Repro on Firefox 3.0.3.  On Safari 3.1.2  both sentences work like the 2nd sentence on Chrome.     </pre>
