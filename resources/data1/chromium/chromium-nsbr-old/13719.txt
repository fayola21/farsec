<title>Issue 13719 -   chromium -    JSON schema singleOrListOf doesn't appear to work properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In a recent change  I made singleOrListOf set minItems to 1 so that the   caller couldn't provide an empty list.  However  it appears that this   doesn't work.  It also appears that {} is accepted as a valid value for   this.    You can repro by using chrome.bookmarks.get({} function(results){};);    Here's the sample code that exercises this from   extension_process_bindings.js:      chrome.bookmarks.get = function(ids  callback) {      validate(arguments  arguments.callee.params);      sendRequest(GetBookmarks  ids  callback);    };      chrome.bookmarks.get.params = [      chrome.types.singleOrListOf(chrome.types.pInt)       chrome.types.fun    ];   </pre>
