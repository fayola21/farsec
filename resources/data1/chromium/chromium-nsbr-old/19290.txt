<title>Issue 19290 -   chromium -    Port SSLConfigService to Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to port SSLConfigService to Linux.  Since there aren't gconf settings   for &quot;checking certificate revocation&quot; or &quot;Use SSL 2.0  SSL 3.0  TLS 1.0&quot;  we   need an SSLConfigService interface that can be implemented by an application.    For example  the Chromium browser could implement SSLConfigService using its   preference system.    mattm already has a CL at <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/165003">http://codereview.chromium.org/165003</a>. </pre>
