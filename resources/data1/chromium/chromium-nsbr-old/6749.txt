<title>Issue 6749 -   chromium -    PrefMember observer doesn't fire when using PrefMember::SetValue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> PrefMembers can register an additional pref observer.  This is normally  used so that the object that owns the PrefMember can be notified of changes  to the PrefMember value.  There is code in the PrefMember observer that  tries to avoid an infinite loop between PrefMember::SetValue and  PrefMember::Observe.  It basically says that whenever PrefMember::SetValue  is called  don't call the observer.  This behavior is not obvious so it  would be nice if we could still fire the observer once (but not repeatedly).    One way to stop this would be to just have a counter and ensure that  observe is only called once during a SetValue.  Alternately  it may be the  case that this isn't even possible now because pref observers only get  notified when the pref changes (so repeatedly setting the value to the same  thing doesn't do anything).   </pre>
