<title>Issue 19486 -   chromium -    No printing option in Google Docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553)  URLs (if applicable) : docs.google.com  Other browsers tested: YES         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      Log into Google Docs  try to print any document (.doc  .xls  .pdf  etc.)      Until some time ago  a printing dialog came up allowing you to print   directly from Google Docs      Now you have to save the document as a pdf on your computer and print it   from there!    It works with no current browser  however I can't find any evidence that   Google disabled printing in Google Docs. </pre>
