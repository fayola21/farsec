<title>Issue 4847 -   chromium -    Hitting tab with an autocomplete popup menu displayed crashes the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit gmail.google.com  2. Type your user name into the field  3. While the autocomplete popup is displayed  hit the tab key to move focus   to the password field.  4. The renderer process crashes.  5. This crash is 100% repeatable for me.    You may need to visit gmail.google.com once and log in  so that the   autocomplete system has the data. </pre>
