<title>Issue 18129 -   chromium -    Toobar buttons are not visable until moused over (gtk theme) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> tot on Ubuntu Karmic    Using the gtk theme  the back/forward/refresh buttons are not visable until   they are moused over.    I believe this is what happening:     1) Un-highlighted version not displayed &lt;- this is the <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> bug   2 </a>) Mouse over causes highlighted version to show   3) Mouse moving off button causes un-highlighted version to display    So if the button does not have a mouse over state (ie  a forward button   before any back button has been pressed  or a new tab that has no 'back'   history) there is no state change to cause the button to draw. </pre>
