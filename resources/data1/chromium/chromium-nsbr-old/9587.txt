<title>Issue 9587 -   chromium -    Chrome window resized to fill the screen fully vertically (but not horizontally) is tens of pixels shorter after restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Resize the chrome window to the maximum height possible in your monitor.   (do not use 'maximize button. leave some room in the horizontal direction)  2. Quit Chrome  3. Restart Chrome        Expected :   Chrome comes back up with the same window size (the maximum vertical   height).    Actual : The window height is a few tens of pixels shorter than before the   restart and the window does not fill the monitor vertically. The horizontal   dimension is restored correctly  though.      It's reported in Korean Chrome U2U group.            </pre>
