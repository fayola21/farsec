<title>Issue 20727 -   chromium -    re-enabling disabled extension should put its toolstrip in the same place it was before - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I got an auto-update of the Buildbot extension that required a permissions   upgrade. I went through the re-enable/install flow and initially thought it   wasn't working anymore. It turns out it just moved to the end of my   toolstrips  when I was looking for it to be in the same place it was before.     It would be great if we remembered extensions' toolstrips' previous locations   when they are disabled  so they come back in the same place when you re-  enable.     </pre>
