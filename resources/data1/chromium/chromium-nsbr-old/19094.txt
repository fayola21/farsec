<title>Issue 19094 -   chromium -    Turn off RTTI and C++ exception handling in the Mac build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Offshoot of <a title="Tune compiler options for release builds"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16713">bug 16713</a>.    We don't need RTTI or C++ exceptions enabled.  We should turn them off.    There are a few things that stand in the way of turning them off  such as   broken/incomplete STL support for disabling them  and other freaky   expectations about their presence in our code and third-party code.    I spent the afternoon slogging through all of this and wound up producing   an RTTI-and-C++-exception-free Mac build.  This reduced the size of   our release-mode dylib (Google Chrome Framework.framework) by 6MB    or 20%.  I'm sure that there will be a performance improvement as well.    One of the changes is in WebKit  but it should be very non-contentious.    I'll clean up the work that I've done and get this in for beta. </pre>
