<title>Issue 3094 -   chromium -    EUC-JP implementation is not compatible with IE and Firefox. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;b/1361379&gt;    EUC-JP has some variants. Windows implementation is CP51932  which seems   to be the de facto of Japanese &quot;EUC&quot; web sites including the followings:  hatena.ne.jp  mixi.jp  livedoor.com  fc2.com  blogs.yahoo.co.jp    '��_��_��_' (U+71C1) is 0x8FCAB3 in Unix EUC-JP. 0xFAFC in CP51932.    IE expects 0xFAFC. Chrome expects 0x8FCAB3. They can't decode the   unexpected one.  Firefox can decode both of them  because Firefox's EUC-JP implementation   is basically CP51932 + supplement.    Also  when posting from EUC-JP pages  IE and Firefox encodes '��_��_��_' to %FA%  FC whereas Chrome encodes it to %8F%CA%B3.    Safari/Win 3.1.2 behaves in the same way as Chrome. (both decoding and   encoding) </pre>
