<title>Issue 9448 -   chromium -    GTK contextual menus should open on mouse down  not mouse up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was reading <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/56022">http://codereview.chromium.org/56022</a>.  Avi switched  contextual menus to open on mouse-down on the Mac (in addition to  permitting control-click).  I noticed that Windows and Linux were left  opening them on mouse-up.    Mouse-up is right for Windows  but in my GTK Ubuntu environment  context  menus all seem to open on mouse-down  not mouse-up. </pre>
