<title>Issue 12641 -   chromium -    NavigationController (?) can get out-of-sync  resulting in bizarre problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Several times in the past few days (with 2.0.181.1) I've had problems closing   a tab which contained a slow-loading site.  In particular  these were sites   where the server had never responded at all  so I still had the slow-spinning   throbber.  Middle-clicking the tab or left-clicking the close box did   nothing  but hitting &quot;stop&quot; and then attempting to close the tab worked   immediately.    I think this is a regression but I am not sure.    Sending to Ojan for initial triage only because I know he knows something   about the handshaking we do when trying to close a tab. </pre>
