<title>Issue 18901 -   chromium -    Synergy is janktastic while Chrome loads pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On my home network I have an iMac and a Windows Vista workstation  sharing a   keyboard connected to the Windows machine via Synergy.    When Chrome loads pages  synergy performance goes into the toilet and my   mouse movement on the Mac is very jerky to the point of not being usable.    What system resource are we trashing? </pre>
