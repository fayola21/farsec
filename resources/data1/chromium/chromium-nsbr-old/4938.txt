<title>Issue 4938 -   chromium -    Convert content to the monitor's color space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is split off from but 143. That one is &quot;handle tagged images&quot; and this   one is &quot;convert the resulting picture to the monitor color space.&quot; They   don't necessarily have to be fixed at the same time.    Ideally  everything would be converted to the monitor's color space. But   that may not be possible given that windowless plugins like to draw on our   DC and use sRGB  and if a designed specifies color #208000 in both Flash   (as an example plug-in that does this) and on their page  they expect the   colors to match.    As a result  I suspect the only way to make this work will be to use an   sRGB backing store. In which case  we should convert from sRGB to whatever   the current monitor profile is when we draw to the screen. The downside is   that if you're one of the few people that has an AdobeRGB monitor and you   are looking at one of the few AdobeRGB images on the web  the gamut will be   clamped to sRGB (but for most images you wouldn't notice).    One danger is that some people have accidentally assigned incorrect   profiles to their monitor  and since they don't run color managed   applications  they will think Chrome is broken.

We should watch how this goes  we   don't want to make a change that hurts more people than it helps. </pre>
