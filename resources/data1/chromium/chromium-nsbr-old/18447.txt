<title>Issue 18447 -   chromium -    Should populate NTP images from imported history/thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  when a user installs and imports their previous history  we don't   set anything on the new tab page.  This ends up being a bad user experience   since users get a new tab page that doesn't do very much.    We should not only be able to import the user's history and populate the NTP   options from it  we should populate the thumbnails as well.  (I don't know   the best way to do this or the obstacles  though.) </pre>
