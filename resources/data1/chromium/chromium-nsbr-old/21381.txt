<title>Issue 21381 -   chromium -    External links open in incognito window if last-focused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. In Chrome 206.1  open an incognito window.  2. Focus the incognito window and swap to an application that has web links   in it.  3. Click on the link.    &gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    The URL should open in a regular window  creating one if none exist. Instead    the URL opens in the last-focused Chrome window  in this case the incognito   window. While there's obvious value in this  we try to avoid adding things to   incognito (and losing history) without explicit user gesture  in this case   dragging or copying the link. </pre>
