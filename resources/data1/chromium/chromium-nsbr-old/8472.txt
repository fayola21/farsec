<title>Issue 8472 -   chromium -    Cannot go back to previous page within a constrained window after doing a search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm">http://echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm</a>  2. Click on &quot;Click here to go to Yahoo&quot;  3. In the constrained window  highlight a line of text  right click to   bring up context menu  4. Choose &quot;Search Google for....&quot;    What is the expected output?   After the search results are loaded in the same constrained window  I must   be able to go back to previous page    What do you see instead?  Back option is disabled and there's no way to go back.      In a regular tab  the search results are loaded in another tab so you can   always go back to your previous page. But in a constrained window  there's   no way to go back to your previous page.    This affects both stable and dev builds </pre>
