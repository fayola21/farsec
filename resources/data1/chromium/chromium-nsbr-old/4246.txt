<title>Issue 4246 -   chromium -    Embedded images in Gmail emails do not load properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Log into <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a>  2. Find an email within Gmail which has embedded images and where you have   NOT already selected to 'Always display images below.'  3. Click on 'Display images below'        I should be able to click on 'Display images below' in a Gmail message and   have the images load in the email without any additional steps and without   requiring a page refresh.        The message 'Some of the elements on this page came from an unverified   source and were not displayed.' appears at the top.    In order to actually see the images  I must click on 'Show all content' to   the right of the above message  which forces a page refresh. I must then   click 'Display images below' a SECOND time in order to display images.    Please provide
