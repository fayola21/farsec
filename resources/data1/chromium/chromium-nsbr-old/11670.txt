<title>Issue 11670 -   chromium -    AutocompleteEditView shouldn't know about TabContents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> AutocompleteEditView shouldn't need to know about TabContents as all it  uses it for is a property bag. The callers of SaveStateToTab() and Update()  should have that dependency  not the view code. We should strive to  decouple view code from browser model dependencies.    Shouldn't be too hard to move it up a layer as the uses of TabContents are  pretty limited. </pre>
