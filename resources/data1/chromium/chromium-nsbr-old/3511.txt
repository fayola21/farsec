<title>Issue 3511 -   chromium -    [Alt+Shift+t] Return key on &quot;Cancel&quot; button of Report Bug or Broken Web site&quot; dlg  takes me to previous page of the current tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is interesting.  0. Navigate to any webpage (eg: google.com) in [New Tab]  1. Alt+Shift+t on Chrome browser window and use arrow key to go to Page  menu.  2. Use down arrow keys to select &quot;Report Bug or Broken Web site&quot; menu   option and hit enter key to select it.  3. Do tabbing to get focus on &quot;Cancel&quot; button and hit return key.    Interestingly we are doing two things here.  The dlg is cancelled and at the same time user is navigated to previous   page on the current tab (this is bonus activity for you : ) ).         </pre>
