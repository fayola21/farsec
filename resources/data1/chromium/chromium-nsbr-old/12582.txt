<title>Issue 12582 -   chromium -    Feature request: [Shift+Enter] = &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1 (Build ufficiale 14854)    I really would like to have the shortcut [Shift+Enter] acting as the &quot;I'm   feeling lucky&quot; botton on google webpage.    Many time I don't know if a particular website I'm searching for is a .com or   .net or .anything  but I'm always sure that it will be the first one in the   search list.    NK </pre>
