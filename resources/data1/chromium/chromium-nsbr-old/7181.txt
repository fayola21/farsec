<title>Issue 7181 -   chromium -    New Tab button has dead zone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a        1. Click the New Tab button (see below for exact step)      A new tab opens      Nothing    The New Tab button appears to have a dead zone whereby clicking in this   zone does nothing.  The zone appears to be a horizontal band across the whole width of the   button  from around the centre to the bottom of the plus sign.  Below and   above that the button is live.    You can test it without opening tons of tabs by left-clicking and holding:    Live: Button turns dark blue (slide the cursor off so as to avoid opening a   tab)  Dead: Colour remains the same (do what you like  it won't open a tab   anyway)    I find this annoying as it's quite a large proportion (approx 1/3) of quite   a small button and I catch it there often when trying to open a new tab.  Also  as a reflex  when a new tab doesn't appear I quickly click again.  If   the clicks are both in the dead zone it registers a double-click and   'restores' the entire window (reduces from full screen to small window). </pre>
