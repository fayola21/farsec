<title>Issue 18369 -   chromium -    Omnibox result flicker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Type &quot;spa&quot; into the omnibox and wait for it to settle.  Then type &quot;m&quot;.  For   both Linus and me  this results in a nasty dual-update flicker.    The first update seems to have all the local results  with the second   bringing in Suggest + NavSuggest.  But the two come so close together that   it's not clear why these aren't both below the max delay threshold in the   controller.  They ought to somehow be coalesced into one.    Linus would like this to block stable (I think). </pre>
