<title>Issue 19163 -   chromium -    First run is haunting me  shows up at every launch of Chromium  not just the first - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Remove or move aside ~/Library/Application Support/Chromium  2. Launch Chromium.app  3. Uncheck the ��_��_��_Import bookmarks from��_��_��_ checkbox (because I can't get   either importer to work - will file another bug)  4. Click ��_��_��_Start Google Chrome��_��_��_ (the name is wrong  this is Chromium  I   filed another bug)  5. When the browser window and New Tab page appear  quit Chromium  6. Launch Chromium.app again      Expect: A browser window and New Tab page should open immediately  Observe: The first-run window appears again  even though I've already run   Chromium        4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23183">r23183</a> </pre>
