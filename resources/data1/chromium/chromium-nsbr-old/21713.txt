<title>Issue 21713 -   chromium -    Folders4Gmail script works intermittently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.209.0 (26088)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works fine  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:Unknown      1. Install the Folders4Gmail user script from   <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8810">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8810</a> into &quot;~/Library/Application   Support/Chromium/Default/User Scripts&quot;  2. Launch Chromium with --enable-user-scripts command line option  3. Visit <a href="http://gmail.com/">http://gmail.com/</a>  4. Ensure that your Gmail folders are configured per the instructions on the   Folders4Gmail homepage      Gmail labels should be split into folders as described on Folders4Gmail   page.  When you click on a &quot;collapsed&quot; folder (ie. the '+' symbol)  it should   expand to reveal sub-folders.      Sometimes the folders are collapsed  however clicking on them does not   cause them to open as it should  clicking appears to have no effect.  Note   that this problem is intermittent  sometimes it works as expected. </pre>
