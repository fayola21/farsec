<title>Issue 16032 -   chromium -    Tab deadzone in new window after dragging second tab of original window to new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 3.0.192 (192.0)  OS version               : OS X 10.5.7      1. Open at least 2 tabs in a window.  2. Drag the second tab so that it becomes a new window.  3. Now there's a deadzone where you can not drag (to move) that new   window. This deadzone is located approximately where a new tab would   appear if you were to make a new tab.      The window should be drag-able as normal in that particular empty space.      The window can not be dragged in that particular empty space. It is   effectively a dead zone.    Additional information:  - Only happens with 2nd tab. Not 1st  3rd  4th  5th  etc.  - Also happen to the second tab if you have only two tabs and drag the   first tab into a new window. (As opposed to dragging the second tab  as   described above.)   </pre>
