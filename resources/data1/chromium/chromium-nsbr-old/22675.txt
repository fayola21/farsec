<title>Issue 22675 -   chromium -    Only a subset of tabs functions after upgrade to 3.0.xxx - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 on windows xp        I have probably over 200 tabs open in four chrome windows.  A few days ago (I think when the 3.0.xxx update has made it to my PC)  a subset of tabs stopped working.    When I start chrome  it opens the four windows with all the tabs   but only about 70 first tabs are functional  the rest stay blank  and reloading does not do anything to them.    The functional tabs are: all tabs in the first window  about half  of the tabs in the second window and one tab in each of the other two   windows (those are the current tabs in those windows).    If I change the current tab in one of the last two windows to a non-  functional one and restart chrome  that tab loads  but not all the others   in that window.    When I open new tabs they sometimes function and sometimes do not. I have   not figured out any system there.    If I close some of the functioning tabs and restart chrome  I get more of   previously non-functional tabs to become functional  i.e. it looks like   chrome is running out of some resource.    I was wondering if it's possible to revert chrome to a previous version.  I still seem to have the directory with 2.something version of chrome code.   </pre>
