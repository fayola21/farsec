<title>Issue 5609 -   chromium -    BUG: Numeric characters to IP address conversion as the first suggestion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36      1. Type up to sixteen digits in the address bar.      First relevant result.      The digits are being converted to IP addresses and these IP addresses show   up as the first result whenever.      Bottom line - nice feature  simply does not really fit a browser  most people   find it merely irrelevant. Either move it to be the last suggestion  create an   option to show this result  or remove it altogether  in my opinion. </pre>
