<title>Issue 8310 -   chromium -    Desktop shortcut is always created in the default location regardless if the desktop path is modified  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This causes that the action for creating a shortcut on desktop creates a   shortcut in the supposed default path.    To prevent this  Chromium needs to check  if the path to desktop is   possibly  differing from default path. And if so  the real path should be   used  to make the shortcut visible on desktop.    Maybe this explains some more problems with undiscoverable objects  which   should have been created by chromium. </pre>
