<title>Issue 19873 -   chromium -    soften the CHECKs from syncapi - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1668808    The syncapi code makes heavy use of CHECK any time any invariant breaks.    We should audit this usage and see if we can't come up with a more graceful   way to handle such invariants; it's a bit of an undertaking without c++   exceptions.  One of the disadvantages is that this code must inherently run   in the browser process  where inducing crashes at any time sucks. Since the   client is the entity responsible for modifying entries (it performs   conflict resolution)  the advantage to CHECKing when you come across a   singularity/inconsistency in data is that it mitigates the possibility that   it will spread to the cloud.    So in some of these cases  maybe we do want to stick with CHECK (e.g the   .ServerKnows checks  and checks for various syncable properties). However    for the type of thing like verifying sqlite error codes or that input   parameters to functions are valid  or doing other important work inside   CHECKs (e.g serverconnectionmanager.cc @148   syncable.cc@724) don't really   comply with the Chromium style or guidelines for using CHECK (see bottom of   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style</a>). </pre>
