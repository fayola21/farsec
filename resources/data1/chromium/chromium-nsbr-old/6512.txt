<title>Issue 6512 -   chromium -    BUG: Problems and weirdnesses with application windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) : Any  System -  Windows XP SP 3 Professional Edition  Gigabyte ATI X300  AMD Athlon64 3000+  Windows Classic theme      Create an application shortcut for a website or open a popup window from a   website.  Right click the window task button in the task bar.    It will show a large menu - BUG.  This should only be shown (and also maybe) when you right click the title bar.    Then minimize the application window and right click the window task button   in the task bar.  Select &quot;Find in page&quot;.  The application is not restored or maximized - maybe a BUG (considering the   the large menu is not a bug).    Then click on the window task button to restore the window.  Click on the window task button to minimize the window.  The window is not being minimized - BUG.    Then restoremaximize the window again.  Try to right click the right area of the title bar  around 90 pixels from the right   and 15 pixels from the top - an example is attached.  This area is not responding to mouse clicks - BUG.    Then Close the &quot;Find in page&quot; bubble.  Click on the window task button to minimize the window.  The window minimizes itself only some of the time - BUG.    (Perquisites for another situation - make sure there is a working Chrome   window and a working Chrome Application window)  Right click on the title bar or task button.  Select &quot;Open browser window&quot;.  The other Chrome window will get focused and a new tab will be opened    instead of opening a browser *window* - may be a BUG. </pre>
