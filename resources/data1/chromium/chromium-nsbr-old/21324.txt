<title>Issue 21324 -   chromium -    Reloading a local page action makes icon stop appearing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Create a local extension that uses a page action.  2. Launch Chrome and load the extension using &quot;Load unpacked extension&quot;   from chrome://extensions  3. Visit a matching page and see your page-action icon in the URL bar.  4. Edit the manifest  adding or removing a matching pattern. (Other edits   might also work  or rather  not work.)  5. Reload the extension by clicking Reload on chrome://extensions.  6. Visit a matching page. No page-action icon appears in the URL bar.    Only tested on Windows.    I'm doing some preliminary investigation.

ReportBack in location_bar_view.cc  ... to see when the extension has finished loading the image from disk and   generated an SkBitmap to show in the Omnibox.    LocationBarView::RefreshPageActionViews  ... to see when the page_action_image_views_ start becoming visible.      That last function will get hit multiple times  probably  so you might want   to enable that after ReportBack has hit.  &quot;&quot;&quot;     </pre>
