<title>Issue 7563 -   chromium -    Chrome's bugs in rendering Chinese hypertexts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Chrome  the underline go too close to the characters. Sometimes the  shapes of the characters might change.  See the &quot;underlines.jpg&quot; in  attachment for an illustration  and there are several examples (e.g.  &quot;��__��_  ��__��_&quot;  &quot;��___��_��_��_&quot;) in the screenshot as well.    In IE  a special space was inserted between the Chinese characters and the  underline (except for in the result titles). However in Chrome no special  visual treatment was implied so far. There are the same situations in  Japanese and Korean where Kanji (Chinese characters) is occasionally used.     </pre>
