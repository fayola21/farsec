<title>Issue 12541 -   chromium -    App window content top edge is wrong in restored mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Only tested in opaque frame.    For app windows  the top &quot;content edge&quot;  along with one px below the corners    is drawn with the titlebar colors instead of the content edge color/graphic.    This makes the edge look fuzzy and weird. </pre>
