Open www.youtube.com and start playing any video.  2. Click on another tab in Chrome and wait a while.  3. Click on YouTube tab again and move mouse away from the tab header   rapidly.      Displaying the YouTube tab.      YouTube tab is shown on screen and in a second is undocked and placed to   new position of mouse cursor.      This bug &quot;works&quot; for any web page which needs more time to show (pages with   a lot of JavaScript  Flash videos  lots of text etc.). Every time when I   click to one of these &quot;high load&quot; tabs  Chrome stucks for a second and then   (if I move the mouse away from the tab header when Chrome keeps stucked)   the tab is undocked. </pre>
