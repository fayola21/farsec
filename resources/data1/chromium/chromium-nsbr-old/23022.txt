<title>Issue 23022 -   chromium -    Disgusting Theme corner on New Tab page. I can not make it go away!!!! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)        Remove that unremovable color stripe corner from the New Tab page.       It is there all the time. Colorful  staring  AND it is over the scrollbars.   It is disgust me. It duplicates functionality. (Same as Options&gt; Get   Themes)    Keep it simple keep it clean.        </pre>
