<title>Issue 6714 -   chromium -    Tabs resizing to small when there is enough space to show them large - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open a tab and enter a url  2. repeat a couple of times  3. after anything from 2 to 5 tabs are opened  the tab size shrinks to a   tiny size  as it would if you had many tabs open and there wasn't a lot of   empty space in which to show them.        tabs should only get smaller when space to display them is in short supply.        tabs resize before they need to.    Please provide
