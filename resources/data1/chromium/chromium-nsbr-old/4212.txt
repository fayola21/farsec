<title>Issue 4212 -   chromium -    spellcheck language switch in the context menu  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that the spellcheck language can be switched without restarting Chrome    we may want to go a step further.     In firefox  the spellcheck language can be changed in the context menu of   'textarea'. 'Add dictionary' is also available in textarea. Textarea   context menu seems to be a good place to have spellcheck-related menus.     BTW  in Firefox  the effect of changing the spellcheck language is global   (across tabs). We might consider making it per-tab  but that's a separate   issue.        </pre>
