<title>Issue 10775 -   chromium -    'Reopen Closed tab' is in-consistent with undo window.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (r 14028)    'Reopen closed tab' is in-consistent in undoing a window.    -Close 2nd window with single tab with mouse MIDDLE CLICK {This is IMP} on   the tabstrip.  -Ctrl+Shift+T/Right click on a any tab in the 1st window and select 'Reopen   Closed tab'.    Expected:  #########  The tab should be reopened in a separate window.    Result:  Opens in the same window.      PS:  Step1: If I close the tab with Alt+F  click on 'X' button  then  I will get   expected result.     </pre>
