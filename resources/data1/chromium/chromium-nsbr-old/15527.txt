<title>Issue 15527 -   chromium -    New Tab Page does not respect ntp_background_alignment of themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4 (Official Build 19293)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Create a theme .crx with &quot;ntp_background_alignment&quot; : &quot;top&quot;  2. Open Chrome and view the New Tab Page  2. Install the theme by dragging the .crx into the New Tab Page  4. Notice that the background image correctly aligns to the window top  5. Close Chrome  and then restart Chrome      The background image stays aligned to the window top.      The background image aligns to the window *bottom*.  Also  all subsequent   New Tabs have the background image aligned to the bottom.    As well  I think this problem also happens for &quot;ntp_background_alignment&quot;   values of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; as well. </pre>
