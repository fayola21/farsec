<title>Issue 8081 -   chromium -    Need sandbox on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="http://imperialviolet.org/page31.html#e600">http://imperialviolet.org/page31.html#e600</a> for a discussion of the   problems implementing sandboxing involves.    Current plan is to not implement a sandbox but to try to not paint   ourselves into a corner  as well as make it easy for third parties to use   whatever sandboxing system they prefer (even something as simple as chroot)   if they want to. </pre>
