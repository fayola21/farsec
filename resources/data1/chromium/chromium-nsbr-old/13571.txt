<title>Issue 13571 -   chromium -    Taskbar blinking when Chrome is maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.30          Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1. Application Shortcut is opened (for example google calendar or reader)   and sometimes some webpages.  2. Chrome window is Maximized.      Windows taskbar not blinking.      Windows taskbar blinks.(changing from dark color to bright several times)    In Windows Vista(SP1  SP2) with or without Aero activated. It's like when   you maximize and restore a window  the taskbar changes from solid dark   color (when maximized) to a clear transparent color (when restored) but in   this case  Chrome is always maximized.   </pre>
