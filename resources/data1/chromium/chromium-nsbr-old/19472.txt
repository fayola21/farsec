<title>Issue 19472 -   chromium -    When switching networks  chrome takes a long time to be able to open websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Surf a while  then close your notebook so that it sleeps  2. Go to somewhere else  open your notebook  3. Your notebook connects to a new wireless netbook  4. Enter some url into chrome's location bar  hit enter        Chrome should open the webpage.          The &quot;inactive&quot; throbber is displayed for quite a while. Opening the same url   in safari works immediately. After opening the url in safari and waiting a   while  the page usually opens fine in chrome after hitting cmd-r.      wtc  does that ring a bell? Some wrong dns server cached or something? </pre>
