<title>Issue 5804 -   chromium -    SVGPaintServerGradient::setup is ignored by linker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because SVGPaintServerGradient::setup is defined by both   SVGPaintServerGradient.cpp and SVGPaintServerGradientSkia.cpp  linker gives   a warning and picks one. Currently  it picks the non-Skia one.    We should investigate which one to keep and either drop the Skia one or   upstream a patch that allows us to cleanly implement it. </pre>
