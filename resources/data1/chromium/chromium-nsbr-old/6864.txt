<title>Issue 6864 -   chromium -    Focus is not restored  when Find-In box is closed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - Open google.com and set focus to google search box.  - Open the &quot;find in page&quot; (CTRL-F) and type foo in Find-box search.  - Close the &quot;find in page&quot; (press ESC)  - Ctrl +F to Find-box and hit delete key to delete the auto selected text   in find-page search box.  - Close the &quot;find in page&quot; (press ESC)    You don't see the cursor visible any where.    The interesting part over here is  if you type-in any thing then It will go   to Google search box..if you hit 'Backspace' to delete  then nothing   happens.
