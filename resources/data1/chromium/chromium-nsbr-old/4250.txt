<title>Issue 4250 -   chromium -    flash player going fullscreen while page still loading... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9&gt;             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open a website that the flash player goes fullscreen automaticaly.      The page continues loading and the flash player actually uses full  screen/fit to screen (don't happen all the time  probably related to how  long the rest of the page takes to load).      the flash player uses only a fraction of the screen size and also may go  off-screen... until ESC is pressed and fullscreen/fitscreen is requested  manually again. </pre>
