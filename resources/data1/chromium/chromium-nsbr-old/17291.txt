<title>Issue 17291 -   chromium -    Memory leak in v8::internal::JSObject::SetPropertyWithCallback() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks kind of similar to <a href="http://crbug.com/11569">http://crbug.com/11569</a>    Seen in  LayoutTests/svg/custom/use-instanceRoot-event-bubbling.xhtml and  LayoutTests/svg/custom/use-instanceRoot-event-listeners.xhtml    during the fishing expedition   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg  Presumably it would also be reproduced by more specific commands   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom  or   sh tools/valgrind/valgrind_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/svg/custom/  use-instanceRoot-event-bubbling.xhtml    (Twice as many blocks are lost during the event-bubbling test case  fwiw.)    but I haven't verified that.    Valgrind complains    152 (24 direct  128 indirect) bytes in 2 blocks are definitely lost in loss  record 722 of 1 054     at malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:193)     by WTF::fastMalloc(unsigned int) (FastMalloc.cpp:225)     by WebCore::V8EventListenerList::add(WebCore::V8EventListener*)  (FastAllocBase.h:96)     by WebCore::V8Proxy::findOrCreateV8EventListener(v8::Local&lt;v8::Value&gt;   bool) (V8Proxy.cpp:396)     by  WebCore::V8Custom::v8ElementEventHandlerAccessorSetter(v8::Local&lt;v8::String&gt;   v8::Local&lt;v8::Value&gt;  v8::AccessorInfo const&amp;) (V8ElementCustom.cpp:154)     by  v8::internal::JSObject::SetPropertyWithCallback(v8::internal::Object*   v8::internal::String*  v8::internal::Object*  v8::internal::JSObject*)  (objects.cc:1598)     by v8::internal::JSObject::SetProperty(v8::internal::LookupResult*   v8::internal::String*  v8::internal::Object*  PropertyAttributes)  (objects.cc:1878)     by v8::internal::JSObject::SetProperty(v8::internal::String*   v8::internal::Object*  PropertyAttributes) (objects.cc:1552)     by v8::internal::StoreIC::Store(v8::internal::InlineCacheState   v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::Object&gt;   v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::String&gt;   v8::internal::Handle&lt;v8::internal::Object&gt;) (ic.cc:973)     by v8::internal::StoreIC_Miss(v8::internal::Arguments) (ic.cc:1281)    There are a number of similar-ish leaks involving SetProperty;  I've filed them separately because it's messier to untangle  unrelated reports than it is to mark as dup.   </pre>
