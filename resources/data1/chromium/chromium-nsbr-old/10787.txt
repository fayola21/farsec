<title>Issue 10787 -   chromium -    Regression: linux dropdowns don't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the case for autocomplete as well as &lt;select&gt; dropdowns. No  dropdown shows  but we do sometimes get an error message:    Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x2ad1f)!    and sometimes    Xlib: sequence lost (0x3e934 &gt; 0x2e96d) in reply type 0x16!    Tested in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14049">r14049</a>. </pre>
