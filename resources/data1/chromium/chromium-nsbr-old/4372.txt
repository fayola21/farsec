<title>Issue 4372 -   chromium -    Use a separate heap for sqlite - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're getting some heap contention from sqlite  which does a lot of large   memory operations. We should consider using a separate heap for this. It   should be straightforward since sqlite uses macros for all heap functions    that we can override with our own calls. We can even change the heap types   to the low fragmentation heap or something if we like.    In addition to eliminating the contention  this should also make us a   little safer. If sqlite corrupts the heap (we have seen some suspicious   crashes)  then it's less likely to affect other code which would lead to   even more mysterious crashes. </pre>
