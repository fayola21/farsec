<title>Issue 19754 -   chromium -    With many tabs open  hovering over some tabs do not produce a tooltip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chrome 3.0.198.1  2. Press Ctrl + T and open up lots of tabs until the all the tabs just show  ellipses.  3. Try hovering the mouse over each tab.        Hovering over any tab should produce a tooltip with the tab's title. I  noticed some tabs do not do this. What the heck? </pre>
