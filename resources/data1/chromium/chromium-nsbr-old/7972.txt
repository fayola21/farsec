<title>Issue 7972 -   chromium -    Can the task manager be put in a tab? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like for the task manager to be put exactly the way it is now in to   a tab so that it can stay open without staying on top and without taking up   a window.    If you want to get fancier  perhaps the task manager should have screen   shots (like showcase in firefox) - but it would be a good idea to time how   long it took to open in the first place before *automatically* going   through that effort. After all  if I want to kill a tab I do not want to   have to wait for that extra feature to take effect. </pre>
