<title>Issue 1714 -   chromium -    Center mouse &quot;Click-drag&quot; scroll doesnt work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : o.o4.o9.2oo8             Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: NA           IE 7: NA      1. Center click mouse button on a page  2. move mouse to scroll down  3. ????  4. PROFIT      dont know what its called  but center clicking  releasing the center   (wheel) button  then moving the mouse usually scrolls the window your in in   the direction the mouse was moved. Cant seem to get that to work in chrome.   Not a huge deal  just scroll the mouse wheel  right? well its starting to   annoy me... especially when theres a long forum thread and the content i   want is at the bottom      </pre>
