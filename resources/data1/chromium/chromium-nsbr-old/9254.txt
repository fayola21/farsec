<title>Issue 9254 -   chromium -    Floating tooltip won't go away - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use chrome 1.0.154.48 on Vista 64 (other versions likely too)  2. Open iGoogle web page  3. ??  4. Observe a tooltip floating above the browser that does not close.        Tooltips should only last a couple of seconds. This one is permanent and it   floats above chrome but below other apps.     If you minimize chrome it disappears  but when chrome is shown again the   tooltip appears again as well.    Even though it was originated in an iGoogle page  it does not dissapear   when you close the iGoogle tab.    Looking with spy++ it looks there are many other tooltips whose owner is   chrome that are invisible/disabled. I think we are leaking tooltips.    We don't know how to repro but according to Beng is not that unusual.         </pre>
