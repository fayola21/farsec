<title>Issue 9919 -   chromium -    The mouse click event struck with scroll bar  if clicked on the thumb while renderer context menu shows up. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [May be wrong component]    -Navigate to a webpage where vertical scroll bar shows up.  -Right click anywhere on the page (for context menu and don't dismiss it)   and click on vertical scroll bar's thumb and drag it up/down and RELEASE   the mouse button.    Notice: Your mouse got struck up with the scroll bar. If you move the mouse   up/down  the page still scrolls accordingly  even though you released the   mouse. [Left]Clicking on the page does not help you though  but you need to   click on the scroll bar once more  to dismiss the mouse event.    Other browsers behavior with this use case:    IE7.x  FF3.x: works fine as expected.  Safari 4.x: Behaves as Chrome.     </pre>
