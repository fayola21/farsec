<title>Issue 13531 -   chromium -    Task Manager is not working in Google Chrome 3.0.183.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)                    1. Open the Task Manager          I should see stats in the basic Task Manager window.      I don't see anything. Instead  I only get an empty window. I've attached   the screenshot.    Stats for nerds window works fine. </pre>
