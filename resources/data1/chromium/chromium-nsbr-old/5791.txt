<title>Issue 5791 -   chromium -    We should not be re-defining the meaning of the chrome:// URL scheme! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should not be re-defining the meaning of the chrome:// URL scheme!    This means something already as defined by Mozilla.  Trying to make it mean   something else in the context of Chrome is sure to cause friction and bugs.    We originally used the scheme chrome-resource:// instead of chrome:// for   this very reason.    For the non-standard URL schemes that we invent  we need to prefix them   with a vendor'ish namespace.  We've been doing so by using &quot;chrome-&quot;    Looks like this change happened here:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/12418">http://codereview.chromium.org/12418</a> </pre>
