<title>Issue 658 -   chromium -    Dowload page does not inform if its a offline install or online install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A      1. Download the Chromsetup.ext from <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>  2. After download launch the installer.  3. The installation takes some time and the import dialog is shown at last.      I expected the download to be offline just like Google Picasa but it took  lot of time and the installer didn't inform me about the online installe      After launching the installer downloads the additional files from server(i  assume its goggle.com) and proceeds further        </pre>
