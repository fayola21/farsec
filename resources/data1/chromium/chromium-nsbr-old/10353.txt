<title>Issue 10353 -   chromium -    13 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   These tests are wrong because of:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24161">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24161</a>. This is not  important for current release.  The pixel diff is ok  but the render tree is different because of  our forked modifications to RenderTextControlMultiLine.cpp  specifically  the calls to set the overflow in createInnerTextStyle.  Linux pixeltest failure: We  with Windows  are failing to repaint correctly  Likely just needs to be baselined.  This test can end up taking longer than the amount of time we give  each test. DEFERd until we find a better way to deal with it.  This is failing on the mac debug only  not sure why  but it's pretty repeatable on the bots  so we  go to the complexity to split out that one case to track any other changes for the other platforms.
