<title>Issue 3283 -   chromium -    Improve startup time when session restore is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Startup with session restore enabled is slower than without it. We should   look at ways of improving this.    One idea (at the expense of longer shutdown time) is to reset the session   restore file on exit. This will minimize the size of the file we're reading   from. </pre>
