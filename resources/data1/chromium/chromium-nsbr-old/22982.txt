<title>Issue 22982 -   chromium -    Disabled checkboxes' labels should be rendered like native disabled labels - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Aero mode  the labels of disabled native checkboxes are rendered with a   face color of COLOR_GRAYTEXT (I think); in classic mode they are rendered   with a face color of COLOR_3DSHADOW  and have a (1  1)-offset shadow with   color COLOR_3DHIGHLIGHT.    Right now our labels do not differ at all  so it is near-impossible to tell   when a checkbox is disabled.    Testcases:  Native checkbox - WordPad Print dialog  select &quot;Add Printer&quot;  look at &quot;Print   to file&quot; checkbox  Our checkbox - Open &quot;Import data&quot; dialog  select &quot;Google Toolbar&quot;  look at   bottom checkboxes </pre>
