<title>Issue 15301 -   chromium -    White area appears in bottom of tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0 (Official Build 18569)    Occasionally  tabs contain a dead white area (where the download bar should   be). this survives tab reloads  and disappears if a download is started   followed by closing the download bar.    I am unable to reproduce this consistently.   </pre>
