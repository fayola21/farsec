<title>Issue 6474 -   chromium -    'Esc/Cancel' should not preserve the Checkbox changes on Clear Browsing data. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm sure  we don't have a bug for this behavior.      1. Bring up Clear Browsing Data dlg and check [ON] Clear Saved Passwords  option.  2. Hit Esc/Cancel button to dismiss the dialog.  3. Bring up the Clear browsing data dlg again.    What is the expected output?   Clear Save Passwords should be unchecked.    What do you see instead?  Clear Save Passwords is checked ON    Please note  we do the expected the behavior in case of &quot;Import Bookmarks &amp;  Settings&quot; dialog. We should implement the same behavior for the Clear  Browsing data dialog also.     </pre>
