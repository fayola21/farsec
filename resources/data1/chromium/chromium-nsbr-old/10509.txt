<title>Issue 10509 -   chromium -    Some Shift+keystroke result in scrolling when Find in page is focused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example:     ! (Shift+1) gets forwarded to the page as PageUp  ( gets forwarded as Up arrow  ) gets forwarded as Down arrow.    Turns out Shift+1  for example  sends a WM_CHAR with VK_PRIOR as the key   code. :s     We should not forward those keystrokes to the page.   </pre>
