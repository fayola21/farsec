<title>Issue 5134 -   chromium -    UFO lands on Desktop when dragging tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 0.5.155.0 (Developer Build 6362)  OS: XP or Vista    There is a mysterious artifact that appears on the Windows Desktop when you  detach a tab from a window.    Repro  ---------  1. Have a Chrome window with 2 tabs.  2. Detach one of the tabs and drag it upwards towards the top of the Desktop.  3. Notice that a square object appears at the top center portion of the  Desktop.    It's only visible during dragging.  I'm going to mark this as a MagicBrowzR issue; if it's not  please remove  the label.     See attached picture. </pre>
