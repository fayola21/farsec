<title>Issue 20474 -   chromium -    NPN_GetValue(NPNVnetscapeWindow) for windowless plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/180019">http://codereview.chromium.org/180019</a> effectively disables   NPN_GetValue(NPNVnetscapeWindow) for windowless plugins. Flash uses that   value to do X calls to change/hide the cursor.    The problem is that the XID of the page window can change at arbitrary times  (e.g. when the tab is detached then reattached)  so we need to be able to   track these changes  and let the PluginInstance know. This needs to be done   with synchronous calls to avoid races that would make the plugin issue X   calls with an invalid XID.  An alternative is to prevent that XID from changing  but I don't know if   it's possible. </pre>
