<title>Issue 19351 -   chromium -    Security: official browser security tests: chrome has bad score - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : The tests are about chrome 2 (stable channel)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: in the tests are also used:       Safari 4    Firefox 3     Opera 10         IE 8    In two official tests chrome scores pretty bad in blocking malware and phishing sites. You can read the tests here...  <a href="http://nsslabs.com/test-reports/NSS%20Labs%20Browser%20Security%20-">http://nsslabs.com/test-reports/NSS%20Labs%20Browser%20Security%20-</a>  %20Socially%20Engineered%20Malware%20Q3%202009.pdf  <a href="http://nsslabs.com/test-reports/NSS%20Labs%20Browser%20Security%20-">http://nsslabs.com/test-reports/NSS%20Labs%20Browser%20Security%20-</a>  %20Phishing%20Q3%202009.pdf    I don't know if this should be reported as a bug  but it  1. Is bad for chrome's imago  2. Is something to be concerned about    I think that if chrome does score so bad in such a test then the malware   and phishing blocking system should be changed to improve these things. </pre>
