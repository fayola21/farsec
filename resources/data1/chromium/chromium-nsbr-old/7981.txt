<title>Issue 7981 -   chromium -    Newly saved page replaces previously saved page on download shelf  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Right-click on content area &gt; &quot;Save as&quot; to save the current page.  2. Save the current page again. Can save under the same filename or  different one (doesn't matter).    What is the expected output?     A separate item for the newly saved page should be created on the download  shelf.    What do you see instead?    Instead of adding another item  the new item replaces the old one. So   there can only be one saved page displayed on the shelf at any given time.   </pre>
