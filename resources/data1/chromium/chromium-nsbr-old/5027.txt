<title>Issue 5027 -   chromium -    remove ATL dependencies from chromium UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to remove ATL dependencies from Chromium so that people  can build it with Visual C++ Express.    The Windows version (of the view part) of our UI toolkit is built around  WTL/ATL.  We should build a similar set of abstractions directly on win32.   </pre>
