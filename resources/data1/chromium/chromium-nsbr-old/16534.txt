<title>Issue 16534 -   chromium -    BUG: Selecting All  Copying And Pasting In The Omnibox Pastes Escaped Characters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0 (maybe also in 3.0.192.1) - Windows  URLs (if applicable) : solopianoradio.com (or any other website  even the   one you are currently looking at)      1. Append a quotes character (&quot;) to the Omnibox (do not delete the current   URL!).  2. Press Control+A or right click and select &quot;Select all&quot;.  3. Control+V or right click and select &quot;Paste&quot; (wherever).      The same text that was copied.      Instead of showing a quotes character  it will show %22.    Add a space and javascript:alert(&quot;s&quot;);  it will show -  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry%20javascript:alert(%22s%22);">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry%20javascript:alert(%22s%22);</a>  Copying the text inside the Omnibox sometimes escapes the characters before   copying (or simply does not unescape them internally). </pre>
