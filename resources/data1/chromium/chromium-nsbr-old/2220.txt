<title>Issue 2220 -   chromium -    FindNext doesn't work beyond page 1 of search results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/results.html">http://code.google.com/codejam/results.html</a>            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    I am having this problem for a page on the SAME tab. Here's how to   reproduce:    1. Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/results.html">http://code.google.com/codejam/results.html</a>  2. Press Ctrl + F and search for 'India'. You'll notice 1 match.  3. Now scroll upwards and click the 'next 250' link at the top of the list.  4. Move focus to the Find box by simply clicking on the Find input box.  5. Press Enter. This should search for 'India' again and should bring up 10   matches but nothing happens. It still shows '1 of 1' and the up-down   buttons do nothing.      </pre>
