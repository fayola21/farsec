<title>Issue 18534 -   chromium -    Cannot scroll down to see all entries when hovering over closed window Recent activity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I love the new new tab by the way  but I there are some problems.    First  the space right below the Google Chrome logo is simply being wasted.   It takes too much space and would force anyone with a small screen (or   someone that doesn't like to have Chrome open maximized  like me) to have to   scroll down to see the whole thing. I say you should bring the Thumbnails up   closer to the Logo.    Second  when I close a window and then try to reopen it from the recently   closed tabs (now called Recent Activities) I should be able to see a list of   the tabs in the closed window. In the New new tab I can  but I cannot scroll   down. The list does pop out when I hover the mouse over it  but I can only   see the very first tab (when I try to scroll down  nothing happens).  </pre>
