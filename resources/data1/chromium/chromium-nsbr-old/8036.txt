<title>Issue 8036 -   chromium -    Show thumbnails for open tabs on Windows 7 superbar (Aero Peek) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows 7  we should take advantage of the same OS feature that IE uses   to show thumbnails of all the open tabs when hovering over the Chrome entry   in &quot;Superbar&quot; (task bar).    This should not be a requirement for Windows 7 support but it is something   we'd like to prioritize based on the adoption of Windows 7.      For mac  we should do the same thing using stacks. </pre>
