<title>Issue 14768 -   chromium -    Need more keyboard shortcuts for navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all          Firefox 3.x: OK   Opera: OK    Chrome should include more shortcut keys for navigating. In particular:    1. Firefox has a plug-in for navigating Google results. Up and down to   scroll through the list of results  -&gt; to go to the next page. It works   beautifully. Why can't Chrome make navigating Google results this   effortless? (The existing Google labs keyboard shortcuts experiment is   pretty second rate; it does not highlight the current result  and there is   no way to move to the next page of results.)    2. Opera implements the forward button (ALT + -&gt;) in such a way that it   will move to the next page in a list of results even if you haven't been   there yet. It works with Google and Amazon  at least--not sure where else.   I've been waiting for that feature for a long time. </pre>
