<title>Issue 5772 -   chromium -    tar.gz files are uncompressed during download  and result in a file with extension .tar.gz.tar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36           Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL (subtly different: IE didn't uncompress the file  but   did save it with a .tar.tar extension instead of the correct .tar.gz)      1. Find a .tar.gz file for download somewhere (e.g.  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html_node.tar.gz">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html_node.tar.gz</a>)  2. Click the link to download the file  or right-click and 'Save link   as...'        File should be downloaded with its original .tar.gz extension  without any   extra processing (ie  it should still *be* a .tar.gz file)        File is downloaded with a .tar.gz.tar extension (if using the 'Save link   as...' route  the default filename has this extension)  and is the   gunzipped tar file not the original compressed file as sent by the server.    Other info:    I tried it in Firefox using the Live HTTP Headers extension.  In the   example URL above  the server is specifying Content-Type as application/x-  tar and Content-Encoding as gzip  so arguably IE and Chrome are correct.   However from my point of view as a user  it's not the result I expect or   want. Also  this has occurred with downloads of .tar.gz files from several   different websites  which would indicate that either most servers are set   up to give those headers  or that there's a deeper problem.     </pre>
