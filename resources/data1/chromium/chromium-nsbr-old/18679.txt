<title>Issue 18679 -   chromium -    Show app path and profile folder on about:version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'd love it if the application executable path and the profile folder in use were   shown on the about:version page. This should be separate from the command   line options bug I filed earlier.    This would make it clear which build of Chrome is running  and where it's   sourcing its data from.    Ideally  the display of the profile folder would have a button to the side   allowing that folder to be opened in the shell. </pre>
