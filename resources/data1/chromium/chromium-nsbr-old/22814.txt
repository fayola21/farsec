<title>Issue 22814 -   chromium -    Weird behavior of dropdown (select list) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.7          Firefox 3.x: OK    Probably it's duplicate  but I couldn't find any issue similar to this.  It started happening recently.      1. Click 4 times any dropdown.      It should open normally after another double-click.      It's not opening.    Another way to reproduce similar problem:  1. When you change value in some dropdown to different one  dropdown is not   closing (it looks like button was not released yet).    Tested on Win7 on different machines.   </pre>
