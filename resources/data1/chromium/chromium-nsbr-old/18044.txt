<title>Issue 18044 -   chromium -    Close window and Close tab key accelerators get flipped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Kris-MacPro-Leopard.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.6 (Build 9G55)    Processor: 4 Intel 2.66 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 3.0.196 SVN Revision: 21633  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87    To reproduce:    I don't have steps  we are stilling working on them but it is very  very   frustration.    Notes:    Once you get into the state if you create a window and add multiple tabs    command+w is still close window.      We have also see the reverse when a the only available option for a   window with one tab is command+shift+W.    Screen shot is attached of the first case and below is what I see in the   console when I create a new window  not sure if it is related:    7/29/09 5:52:41 PM [0x0-0x2fb2fb].org.chromium.Chromium[17075]   [0x0-0x2fb2fb].org.chromium.Chromium 17075 com.apple.console Notice   [17075:523:192144399664343:ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-rel-  mac/build/src/chrome/browser/tab_contents/tab_contents_view_mac.mm(  231)] Not implemented reached in virtual void   TabContentsViewMac::SizeContents(const gfx::Size&amp;)  </pre>
