<title>Issue 22310 -   chromium -    ProxyScriptFetcher does not take into account charset encodings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ProxyScriptFetcher is responsible for downloading PAC scripts.    However  the API for ProxyScriptFetcher is not clear about what the encoding   of the response is.    Currently the main consumer of ProxyScriptFetcher (ProxyResolverV8)   assumes that the response bytes are UTF8.    I will check into this  but from what I remember URLRequest does not   transform the bytes according to the charset. So this might be the issue   causing <a title="network proxy settings regression in Chrome 3?" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22082"> bug 22082 </a>. </pre>
