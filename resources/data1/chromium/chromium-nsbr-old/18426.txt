<title>Issue 18426 -   chromium -    Implement configurable ability to make new tab open home page (not new tab page) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We'd like to be able to test the ability to make the new tabs open the user's   home page  instead of the new tab page.    The hypothesis is that users are uncomfortable with the new tab page  or   would rather just see the home page instead.      We should implement this as a configurable option through the master   preferences  so we can test it in a distribution channel. </pre>
