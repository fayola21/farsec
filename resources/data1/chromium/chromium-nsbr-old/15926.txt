<title>Issue 15926 -   chromium -    VisitedLinkTest.Listener is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Somehow the test I wrote fails every so often with a one-off count  which   doesn't make sense. Fix it!    visitedlink_unittest.cc:420: Failure  Value of: listener_.add_count()    Actual: 1001  Expected: g_test_count  Which is: 1000   </pre>
