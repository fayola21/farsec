<title>Issue 9376 -   chromium -    Mem leak in unit_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> algrind on Mac thinks that unit_tests leaks memory.  We want to enable auto-analysis on valgrind output  before which the detected leaks need to   be fixed (or suppressed).    I'm marking it to you since you were the last person to have touched this. If this is an error    please feel free to reassign to someone more appropriate (or bounce back to me).    The leaking tests are:    BookmarkMenuBridgeTest.TestClearBookmarkMenu    BookmarkMenuBridgeTest.TestAddNodeToMenu    The following is valgrind's output. (Refer waterfall for latest).      ==9990== 28 (12 direct  16 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 92 of   348  ==9990==    at 0x595842F: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:217)  ==9990==    by 0x3C36E: BookmarkMenuBridgeTest_TestClearBookmarkMenu_Test::TestBody()   (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x70C771: testing::Test::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711260: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::Run() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x716BF4: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::RunTest(testing::TestInfo*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711BF6: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestInfo*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestInfo*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestInfo*)) const (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711149: testing::TestCase::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x716BD8: testing::TestCase::RunTestCase(testing::TestCase*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711A4A: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestCase*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestCase*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestCase*)) const (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x710FB6: testing::internal::UnitTestImpl::RunAllTests() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x7110AB: testing::UnitTest::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x692E61: TestSuite::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x691B51: main (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)      ==9990== 28 (12 direct  16 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 93 of   348  ==9990==    at 0x595842F: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:217)  ==9990==    by 0x3B290: BookmarkMenuBridgeTest_TestAddNodeToMenu_Test::TestBody() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x70C771: testing::Test::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711260: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::Run() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x716BF4: testing::internal::TestInfoImpl::RunTest(testing::TestInfo*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711BF6: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestInfo*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestInfo*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestInfo*)) const (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711149: testing::TestCase::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x716BD8: testing::TestCase::RunTestCase(testing::TestCase*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x711A4A: void testing::internal::List&lt;testing::TestCase*&gt;::ForEach&lt;void   (*)(testing::TestCase*)&gt;(void (*)(testing::TestCase*)) const (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x710FB6: testing::internal::UnitTestImpl::RunAllTests() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x7110AB: testing::UnitTest::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x692E61: TestSuite::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)  ==9990==    by 0x691B51: main (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/unit_tests)     </pre>
