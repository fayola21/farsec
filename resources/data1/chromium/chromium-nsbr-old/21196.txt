<title>Issue 21196 -   chromium -    Search/address box entry ending in .local should be considered address  not search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (25570)    OS version               : 10.4.8      both NA since they don't have a unified address bar        1. Type a hostname ending in .local into the search/address box      Chromium should offer to pull up <a href="http://hostname.local">http://hostname.local</a> by default  Rationale: Bonjour/avahi conventions are increasingly used on all networks    not just networks with Macs  due to the popularity of iTunes and various   pieces of Apple hardware.      Chromium only offers to search &quot;hostname.local&quot;    Suggestion for generalized fix:  Consider entries ending in .local or any domain entries in /etc/resolv.conf   to be real http addresses by default  not searches. </pre>
