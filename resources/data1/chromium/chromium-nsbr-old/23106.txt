<title>Issue 23106 -   chromium -    &lt;select&gt; drop-down is always left-aligned even the dir of &lt;select&gt; is RTL. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.219.0 (27124)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/preferences?hl=iw">http://www.google.com/preferences?hl=iw</a>  OS version               : 10.5.6  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): &lt;select&gt; drop-down is always   left-aligned.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): &lt;select&gt; drop-down's alignment is   determined by the directionality of &lt;option&gt;   Behavior in Chrome for Windows: &lt;select&gt; drop-down's aligment is determined   by the directionality of &lt;select&gt;      1. Open the above URL.  2. click the first &lt;select&gt; box  which is the &quot;interface language&quot; list in   Hebrew.  3. Observe the alignment of items in drop-down box      items in above &lt;select&gt; drop-down should be aligned right.      Aligned left in Mac.      Notes:  I asked Aharon about how should we align items in &lt;select&gt; drop-dwon.   Following is what he said:  &quot;the behavior I like for &lt;select&gt; is that the directionality be estimated   for each option separately  with each option displayed in its own   directionality both in the drop-down and when chosen. The select's   directionality should only affect the position of the arrow button (and   possibly the alignment of the items  in both the dropdown and the select    which is the real issue at hand). &quot;    Please refer to comment #5 in <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29612">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29612</a>   for more detail.    The patch for <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29612">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29612</a> fixes the   alignment issue in Windows and Linux.  But in Mac  through a brief debugging  seems that the painting of drop-down   items for &lt;select&gt; in does not stop at PopupMenuChromium.cpp Ln 829   (PopupListBox::paintRow())  where the fix kicks in.      </pre>
