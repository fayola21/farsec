<title>Issue 22871 -   chromium -    Allow adding new top-level domains to chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request. I file it as a bug because I don't see how to   file a feature request instead.    If I type in a domain with an official TLD (e.g. asdfasdfasdf.COM)  then   the drop-down will show it as a domain (in bold green letters)  even if it   does not exist  and if I press enter it will take me to the domain (or the   error page if it doesn't exist).    Now  if I do the same for a non-official TLD (e.g. asdfasdfasdf.COMM)  then   the dropdown will be show it as a search query (in blue)  and it will take   me to google search if I press enter - independently of whether the domain   exists or not.    This is very inconsistent in case of intranets and I find it very annoying.   It would be awesome if I could add new TLDs to the list (or a regex or   something).    I know that chrome will show a small popup afterwards if the domain exists    or that I can add a / at the end of the domain to force it to go to the   domain instead of the search page  but that's not what I want.   </pre>
