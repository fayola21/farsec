<title>Issue 15870 -   chromium -    Toolbar spacing and drawing wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Glen says:    Spacing between buttons is too high  Spacing between buttons and omnibox is too high  Toolbar is missing drop-shadow surrounds (top edge in all versions  side   edges in non-system titlebar mode). The top shadow is probably the most   important.  1px toolbar edge isn't shown at the left/bottom/right - web content just runs   straight into to the blue frame color. </pre>
