<title>Issue 20141 -   chromium -    MacChrome  accidentally torn tab doesn't rejoin window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Accidentally tore a tab.  2. Tried to drop it back.      Tab would return to its position.      See torn tab moved out of way at bottom of screen.  Tab is now &quot;undroppable&quot; and floats above all other chrome windows.  Clicking the 'x' to close the errant tab doesn't work.  Original window seems to preserve space for the tab.  Can browse/scroll in window but all key-presses goes to active Chrome   window.    <b>Please provide
