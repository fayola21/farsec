<title>Issue 7026 -   chromium -    Javascript features of Yahoo Mail &amp; Windows Live Mail not working properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi !!!!    On Google Chrome  the New Yahoo Mail  does not work as expected. Not able   to compose a new mail. The read pane preview  shows the incorrect header   details. Even the Windows live mail has some compatibility issue with   Chrome. I think the javascript options are not working properly with   Chrome  as expected. Just for these issues  I have to depend on other   browsers  at times. Earlier these issues were not there. In recent times  I   find them and they are consistent (hard-on).    Hope these will be fixed as soon as possible...    ~ NAVIN KUMAR Jayachandran (j.navinkumar@gmail.com) </pre>
