<title>Issue 21910 -   chromium -    Lazily create find bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The find bar controller in the Browser object doesn't need to be created until   it's actually shown. Creating it on Mac involves loading a xib file unnecessarily   and it would be nice to do this lazily everywhere.    This showed up as a small % of new window time during profiling on Mac.    There appears to be some weird interaction with the ui tests  but only on   windows. Ben was investigating why this isn't as obvious of a fix as it should   be  but then got sidetracked. Hence  this bug. </pre>
