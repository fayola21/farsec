<title>Issue 17720 -   chromium -    Still can't close a bunch of tabs quickly by mashing the mouse button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open a lot of tabs  2. Mash the close button of one towards the start of the tabstrip    3. Now that the &quot;defer resize layout till mouse moves away&quot; thing has been   implemented the tabs don't resize annoyingly  but my clicks to the close   button that falls under my mouse pointer are still lost. </pre>
