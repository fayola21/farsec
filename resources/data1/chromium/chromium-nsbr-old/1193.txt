<title>Issue 1193 -   chromium -    Chrome fails to resize correctly with Winsplit Revolution - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install and run Winsplit Revolution (http://www.winsplit-  revolution.com/)  2. Run Google Chrome  3. Move the Chrome window such that the top-left corner is not in the top-  left of the screen.  4. Manually resize the Chrome window to be larger than one-quarter the   screen (this also ensures that the window has focus).  5. With the default Winsplit Revolution key-bindings  hit ctrl+alt+numpad7   to reposition the Chrome window in the top-left corner and resize to one-  quarter the screen.      When hitting ctrl+alt+numpad7  the Chrome window should move to the top-  left and resize to fill one-quarter of the screen.      The Chrome window repositions itself correctly but fails to resize.    Please provide
