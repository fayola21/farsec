<title>Issue 7607 -   chromium -    Ping when get a hit against malware list for opt-in users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For users who have opted in to providing stats  we should help malware team   by providing a notification as to which resource on which page matched the   list. This is done as follows:    Here are the requests that GDS currently makes:    GET /safebrowsing/report?evts=malblhit&amp;evtd=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Emalwaresite%  2Ecom%2F%5F%5Futv%2Ejs&amp;evtr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecompromisedsite%2Ecom%2Flile  e%2F&amp;client=chrome&amp;appver=&lt;chrome version e.g. 2.0.158-2&gt;    evths=malblhit - just tells us that this was a hit against the malware  black list.  evtd contains the url that was found on the black list.  evtr is the referer url.    You do not want to send a report if the referer url is already on the   blacklist.    This kind of data is extremely helpful to us as it gives us data  faster. Ping niels if you need more info.   </pre>
