<title>Issue 9018 -   chromium -    When closing the browser  remaining downloads should be minimized in the system tray - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We shouldn't stop downloads when closing the corresponding tab/window. Initially we will implement the solution Brian outlines in:    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1028#c49">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1028#c49</a>    At some point we should implement the following:    * When a tab/window/chrome is closed with ongoing downloads  minimize the   downloads to the taskbar tray. We could pause it  but I think most people   would prefer it to continue in the background.  * Right-clicking the chrome icon in the tray  the user can see the progress   of the downloads  as well as pause &amp; quit  cancel &amp; quit  or open the   downloads page.  * When no more downloads are active  we silently shut down (alternatively   we could display a notification  but I want this to be unobtrusive).    We should also find some graceful way to handle the &quot;dangerous file&quot;   notification in this flow. </pre>
