<title>Issue 10494 -   chromium -    Linux anchor navigations don't repaint correctly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a page that uses anchors (like the gtk docs).  Navigate to an anchor    and we don't invalidate the whole page like we should  so the drawing is all   messed.  I think this is probably a common scroll issue (so this bug is   probably a dup)  as I've seen issue with hitting end to go to the bottom of   the page  etc. </pre>
