<title>Issue 16611 -   chromium -    Make better use of vertical space with a widescreen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  URLs (if applicable) : N/A        Firefox 3.x: OK  with the Vertigo extension.    Since most web pages require vertical scrolling rather than horizontal  and  since most screens have a smaller height than width  especially with  widescreens  it would be good and more efficient to have a mode that moves  the tab bar and bookmarks bar to the left of the window rather than the  top. This is possible on Firefox with Vertigo (  <a href="http://learnfirefox.cybernetnews.com/2007/07/07/vertical-tabs-vertigo/">http://learnfirefox.cybernetnews.com/2007/07/07/vertical-tabs-vertigo/</a> )  and similar extensions.   </pre>
