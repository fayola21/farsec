<title>Issue 16897 -   chromium -    File:Close Tab menu item and Command-W keyboard shortcut stops working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   I don't know what the exact steps are  but after I've been using the   application for a while  I notice that command-W no longer closes tabs.    The Close Tab menu item in the File menu is grayed out.  It is still possible   to close tabs by clicking on their close box.  Close Window (command-  shift-W) remains viable.  Once Close Tab stops working  it is broken for all   tabs in all windows  even new tabs and new windows.      I expect File:Close Tab and command-W to always function.        3.0.192.0  (and this bug may be new in 191 or 192.) </pre>
