<title>Issue 3610 -   chromium -    Perf plots don't use accessible colors for traces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The perf plots don't use a clearly distinguishable set of colors in their   traces. With more than two traces  they're hard to tell apart even with   normal vision; I can only imagine they're worse with a color deficiency.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-</a>  core/startup/report.html?history=50    The set of colors used by the plotter should be selected from the examples   at <a href="http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/html/manuals/pdf/color_blind.pdf">http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/html/manuals/pdf/color_blind.pdf</a> (slide   15) or a similar reference. </pre>
