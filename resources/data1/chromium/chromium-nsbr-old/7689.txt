<title>Issue 7689 -   chromium -    Cookie Search - Cursor Bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.162.0      1. Go to &quot;Options&quot; in the Google Chrome toolbar.  2. Go to Under the Hood and select &quot;Show cookies&quot;.  3. In the search box  search for what you're looking for.      It should be no problem to find what you're looking for.      The cursor becomes hidden  as well as the mouse pointer  and it can become   very difficult to search and edit the search. (This is actually very   similar to the searching bug when using Ctrl+F)   </pre>
