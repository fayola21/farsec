<title>Issue 1347 -   chromium -    Erratic text selection behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : Youtube          Firefox 3: Not great behaviour but looks better.           IE 7: Best behaviour in my opinion.    The attached screenshot shows a comparison when I tried to select the same   text  between Internet Explorer/Firefox/Chrome.  The Internet Explorer behaviour seems the best  doesn't select what doesn't   matter. Firefox doesn't allow the selection to go outside the container    which is annoying when wanting to copy/paste text that is in more than one   container. Chrome seems to select also the container in which the text is   even though it doesn't matter.   </pre>
