<title>Issue 21653 -   chromium -    Worker layout test (use-machine-stack.html) crashes/hangs on the mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable worker_uitest.cc in src/chrome/chrome.gyp (it needs to be removed   from the sources! group right around line 3868)  2. Build the &quot;all&quot; target and run worker tests like so:  xcodebuild/Debug/ui_tests --gtest_filter=WorkerTest.WorkerFastLayoutTests  3. Note the failed use-machine-stack test.    You can probably also repro this in a regular browser by opening the file   src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/fast/workers/use-machine-stack.html in   Chrome.   </pre>
