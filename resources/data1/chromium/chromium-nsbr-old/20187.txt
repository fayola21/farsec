<title>Issue 20187 -   chromium -    scrubbing low quality - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> scrubbing doesnt work as well expected.  When you drag the time bar it shows frames  but not the right ones.  While still holding the mouse button down  if you stop moving for awhile  the   position jumps elsewhere.  This is more evident on MP4 which seeks to   keyframes.    Internally we're flooding the pipeline with too many seeks and some are   dropped and others are respected roughly a second late  which is why   inactivity finally catches up with the timebar and updates it to where it   actually went.    The expected behavior is the time bar should not jump around  and releasing   it should behave the same as clicking that location on the time bar. </pre>
