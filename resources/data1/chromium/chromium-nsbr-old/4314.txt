<title>Issue 4314 -   chromium -    --clobber doesn't work with the scons build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Linux%20(dbg)/builds/1801/steps/compile/logs/stdio">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Linux%20(dbg)/builds/1801/steps/compile/logs/stdio</a>    --clobber removes the Hammer directory after  /Hammer/.sconsign_linux2.dblite is created.  This causes problems when we  later try to read that file during the build.   </pre>
