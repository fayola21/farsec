Open the attached URL  2. Activate full-screen      All browsers I know (except Chrome) open a windows media video by starting   the media player. This way the media player has greater control over the   PC  for example  it can disable the screen saver when in full-screen mode.       The video is embedded within Chrome. Consequently  even in full screen   mode  eventually a screen saver is activated. It is also difficult to   control the playback as Chrome offers less video controls.       </pre>
