<title>Issue 2934 -   chromium -    Chrome should provide auto detection by language group - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1082811&gt;    FF can auto detect by language group (Chinese  East Asian  Japanese   Korean  Russian  Simplified Chinese  Traditional Chinese and Ukrainian)   which means it is easier for user to get the correct page  for example   when the pages saved as Shift-JIS  use can just select East Asian or  Japanese to get the page displayed correctly instead of try the native  Japanese Encoding one by one when the override is needed.    IE only provides language group detect for Japanese.    Please refer to picture attached.    </pre>
