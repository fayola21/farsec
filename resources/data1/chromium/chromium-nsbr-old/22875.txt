<title>Issue 22875 -   chromium -    Investigate NavigationController::ClassifyNavigation negative page_id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/210043/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/210043/show</a> removed a DCHECK that was being   hit after I committed my Mock LinkDoctor change. It makes the error page   load much faster  because no network request is made and makes it more   likely to trigger some race conditions etc.    Generally after a talk with Brett the conclusion is that a cross-site   navigation which triggers a process swap may trigger this condition.    Changing the DCHECK to GetLastCommittedEntry didn't make a difference. It   was still being hit.    The issue reproduced reliably on an XP try bot (--  gtest_filter=ErrorPageTest.* --gtest_repeat=-1 --gtest_break_on_failure and   let it iterate a few times; for me it always failed within 10 iterations).   On the buildbots  it also reproduced only on XP  never on Vista  Linux  or   Mac.    Now  before trying to reproduce on XP  be sure to remove my blocks of code   effectively disabling the test on XP.    Darin asked me to file a bug to further investigate the issue  so here it   is. If I should add more info to this bug  please let me know. </pre>
