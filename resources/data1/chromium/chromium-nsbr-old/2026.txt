Firefox 3: Fail           IE 7: Fail      1. Go to URL  2. Press Download  3. See &quot;Problem&quot;.      The picture to be rendered within the window.      It opens a &quot;Save as&quot; window.    Note:  This is possibly  even probably  not a bug. But I'd rather see the picture   rendered in the window instead of being asked for a place to save it to and   then having to open it. </pre>
