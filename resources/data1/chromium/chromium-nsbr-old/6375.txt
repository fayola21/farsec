<title>Issue 6375 -   chromium -    Regression: gears.dll not loaded as an NPAPI plugin anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following checkin caused this regression:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7907">r7907</a> | jam@chromium.org | 2009-01-12 16:54:21 -0800 (Mon  12 Jan 2009) | 2   lines  Fix layout test failures.  Looks like keying the plugins based on   OriginalFileName didn't work  since different filenames might still have   the same value (i.e.  QuickTime).  Instead I did what Firefox does  which is collect the list of   directories in one pass  then crawl them in another.  Review URL: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/17367">http://codereview.chromium.org/17367</a>    This is because we no longer load &quot;path/to/gears.dll&quot; explicitly  but   instead add &quot;path/to&quot; to the list of directories to scan  and only check   &quot;np*.dll&quot; files in that directory. </pre>
