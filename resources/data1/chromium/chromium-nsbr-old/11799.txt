<title>Issue 11799 -   chromium -    Include JavaScript libraries in Google Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today I check is there any possibility to use jQuery (and I think others   JavaScript libraries) in contente script extensions. Full success   (<a href="http://dziubdziub.blogspot.com/2009/05/rozszerzenia-w-google-chrome-">http://dziubdziub.blogspot.com/2009/05/rozszerzenia-w-google-chrome-</a>  framework.html) there is no problem to include and load jQuery as first   JavaScript content script and use their syntax later.    If many user extensions use jQuery and each include jQuery code in extension   Google Chrome load this same JS code (for example jQuery code) few times.    Solution isinclude jQuery  MooTools  Dojo  Qooxdoo  Prototype and other JS   libraries in Chrome. For example create some folders where user can upload js   scripts files available global for all extensions in Chrome. </pre>
