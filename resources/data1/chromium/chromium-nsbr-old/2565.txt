<title>Issue 2565 -   chromium -    Default browser setting is incomplete  leaves DDE entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have IE or Firefox as your default browser (This is on XP  might have  different issues under Vista  where default browser stuff works differently)  2. Tell Chrome to be the default browser        It should replace all of the keys under HKEY_CLASS_ROOT/http/shell/open  (and https)         The DDE stuff in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/http/shell/open/ddeexec is left there  from the previous browser  but if a program tries to use it  they will  either end up opening stuff in a running instance of some other browser  or  it just won't work.  It not working is generally ok  since that is what  happens when the other browser isn't running  but it working means that the  user's browser preference isn't obeyed.      Please provide
