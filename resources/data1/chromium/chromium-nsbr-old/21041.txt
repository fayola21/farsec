<title>Issue 21041 -   chromium -    Linux: Renderer using 23GB of virtual memory  6GB of resident memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My friend (googler  running on ghardy workstation) was complaining to me that his chrome (4.0.203.2) was sucking up his memory  so I took a look:    jyasskin 15127  4.6  0.4 572948 39236 ?

It looks to be one of his gmail tabs.  He   notes that he had an unanswered IM in the gmail tab for a few days  so the username would flash in the tab title.  Not sure if that has anything to do with it.    I've attached his /proc/15159/maps file which he cat'd out for me.  It's got a ton of huge anonymous mmap regions.  I don't know where these guys are   coming from...v8 perhaps?  I also see lots of mmap regions without any permissions.  Sometimes these regions are 4MB  or 64MB or what not.  It seems   strange that we have so many of them and they're so large.    My gut instinct is v8 is leaking  but I dunno. </pre>
