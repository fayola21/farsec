<title>Issue 16512 -   chromium -    logging.cc uses OFFICIAL_BUILD CPP symbol which only windows builds sets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you look in src/base/logging.cc you'll find a use of OFFICIAL_BUILD in a CPP   check  window seems to define this in one of it's vsprops files  but mac and   linux don't have this defined  so we're probably including a bunch of logging   we don't want in official builds. </pre>
