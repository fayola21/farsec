<title>Issue 22028 -   chromium -    On resizing Chrome window  only show full bookmark button in RHS  not the trimmed one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 4.0.209.0 SVN Revision: 26105  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32.18      1. Have 10-12 bookmarks in Chrome.  2. Press cmd+shift+b if BMB is not visible.  3. Resize Chrome window slowly and verify RHS bookmark buttons in BMB.    Expected result:  3.1 On resizing  Chrome should show only full bookmark buttons. (as Windows  Chrome does)    Actual result:  3.2 On resizing  Chrome also shows bookmark button which can not fit fully  in BMB.    Note:  - We should always show 'Other Bookmarks' menu in RHS all the time in BMB  even when resizing the Chrome window.
