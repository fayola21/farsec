<title>Issue 12660 -   chromium -    Allow all text to be dropped onto the tabstrip  not just URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.181.1    Currently  if you highlight some text and drag it onto the tabstrip  Chrome   checks if the text is a URL and if it is  does a &quot;paste and go&quot; into a new   tab or the tab that you dragged the text onto. It would be far better to be   able to do the same with any text; i.e. to drop it would execute either   &quot;paste and go&quot; or &quot;paste and search&quot; depending on what the same text would do   if in the clipboard when you use the context menu for the omnibar. This would   also extend some uniformity in behaviour between the tabstrip drag-and-drop   interface and the omnibar. </pre>
