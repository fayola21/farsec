<title>Issue 4220 -   chromium -    download dialog doesn't show in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch Chrome in a new tab  2. Go to a URL where you can download a file i.e. http://tswinappserver/chrome/chrome-win32.msi  3. When the download status bar appears on bottom of page  close the bar by   clicking on the &quot;X&quot; next to the &quot;Show all downloads&quot;  4. Enter the same URL of the file download in the URL      The &quot;save or discard&quot; box dialog should show up on bottom of page.      The &quot;save or discard&quot; box dialog doesn't show up sometimes.  In other tabs (not new tab)  if you try to attempt reloading the URL  there   is a dialog that comes up with the message &quot;This site is attempting to   download multiple files. Do you want to allow this?&quot;    Sometimes also  you get two of the dialog boxes as in the screenshot.    Please provide
