<title>Issue 12126 -   chromium -    Implement alert()  prompt()  and confirm() for extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  these methods are not implemented and fail silently. Darin has   requested that we attempt to implement them asynchronously instead of the   standard synchronous versions.    So  the signatures would look like:    // The alert is non-blocking. If callback  is specified  it gets called  // after the alert is dismissed.  alert(message  [callback()])    // The alerts are non-blocking and the callbacks are required.  prompt(message  default  callback(result))  confirm(message  callback(bool_result)) </pre>
