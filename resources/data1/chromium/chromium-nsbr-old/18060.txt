<title>Issue 18060 -   chromium -    No way to change google's domain in &quot;Edit search engines&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to &quot;Edit search engines&quot;  2. Edit google  3. Notice that &quot;URL&quot; is not editable and it looks like   &quot;{google:baseURL}search?  {google:RLZ}{google:acceptedSuggestion}{google:originalQueryForSuggestion}s  ourceid=chrome&amp;ie={inputEncoding}&amp;q=%s&quot;  4. There is no way to edit &quot;baseURL&quot; also  5. So when you search  the search might go to some random local Google   instance e.g. google.pl      1. There should be a way to choose between which local Google or google.com   I want to use.      1. No way to choose  and sometimes it sticks with some random regional   Google domain in quite inexplicable way.    <b>Please provide
