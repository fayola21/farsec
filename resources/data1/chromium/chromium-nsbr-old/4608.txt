<title>Issue 4608 -   chromium -    The flag &quot;Open when done&quot; is carried to &quot;Open&quot; option in download shelf (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.23(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5672">r5672</a>)      1. Start downloading a file.  2. While download is in progress and click on drop-down list in download  shelf and select &quot;Open when done&quot;  3. Let download completes.  4. Again click on download shelf's drop-down list.    Notice the option &quot;Open&quot; is enabled to ON in the list.    I'm not sure  why we carry this flag from &quot;Open when done&quot; to &quot;open&quot; and  user can't get ride of this flag (can't disable the flag at all).    Screenshot attached. </pre>
