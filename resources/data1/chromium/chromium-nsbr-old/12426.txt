<title>Issue 12426 -   chromium -    Navigating away from Remove Thumbnails UI saves changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.181.1 (Official Build 16409)        1. In NTP  click &quot;Remove Thumbnails&quot;.  2. Click on the 'x' on one or more thumbnails to remove.  3. Navigate to another site in the same tab.  4. Go back to New Tab page.    Changes made in Remove Thumbnails UI are saved and UI is exited.  Just  wanted to make sure this is intentional. </pre>
