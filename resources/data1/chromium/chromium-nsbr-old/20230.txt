<title>Issue 20230 -   chromium -    double copies of images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the pak files carry all the images needed for the windows ui.  it looks like   we've manually added some of these images to the resources entries of the   GYP files  we really should just get back to a single copy of the images to   reduce our download footprint.  since the images can be used by html ui    leaving them in the pak files seems like the better choice. </pre>
