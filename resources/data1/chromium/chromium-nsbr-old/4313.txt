<title>Issue 4313 -   chromium -    Resize of full-page flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : listen.grooveshark.com        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open listen.gooveshark.com and let it load  2. Stretch the window vertically  either using the mouse or by using the   window title menu-&gt;Size option.       The Flash content should resize to fill all the available space  as it does   on the other browsers.      Flash does not resize until the Chrome window is resized horizontally    meaning either the white background is displayed or part of the flash gets   clipped by the window and is not displayed.     </pre>
