<title>Issue 19931 -   chromium -    The ResourceDispatcherHost class does not honor the full contract of the deferred flag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the deferred flag is set for a request  then the ResourceDispatcher object  needs to ensure the following:-    1. Subsequent responses are queued until the deferred flag is turned off.  2. If the deferred flag is turned on in the context of a dispatched message     it should not dispatch further messages to the listener.    The ResourceDispatcher object implements #1 correctly. However it does not   honor #2. Our plugin implementation uses the deferred flag to prevent   reentrancies  which does not work as expected as a result. </pre>
