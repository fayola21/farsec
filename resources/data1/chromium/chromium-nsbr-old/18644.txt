<title>Issue 18644 -   chromium -    Cursor should be placed at end of URL if clicking into empty space after the URL in Omnibox  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22005">r22005</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu  window manager : Whatever comes with Gnome    Chrome selects the entire URL when you click in the address bar. Firefox   just puts the cursor wherever you clicked.    I can see the merit of either of these  but there are a few things which   could be much better.    I often happen to have to &quot;add&quot; things at the end of an URL  e.g. an   additional query parameter or maybe extend a path.    If the current URL is longer than the address bar  then this requires a bit   of extra work (i.e. mark the URL and then use the keys to go to the right   etc.)    If the URL is *shorter* than the address bar - i.e. if there is &quot;white   space&quot; to the right of the URL  then I would like to just click into that   white space and get a cursor at the end of the URL  without any text   selection.    Currently  what I get is a fully selected URL. If I wanted that  I would   have clicked *on* the URL.      1. Navigate to any page which does not have an excessively long URL.   Something like www.google.com will do fine.  2. Click in the address bar *after* the URL  i.e. on the &quot;white space&quot;        The URL is not selected and the cursor is after the URL.        The URL is selected. </pre>
