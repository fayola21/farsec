<title>Issue 5083 -   chromium -    High browser process CPU usage from Flash on Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chrome  2. Navigate to a page with Flash?  3. Browser process CPU usage remains high  even though the user isn't doing   anything.    The original report came from a system running 154.25 and Flash 10 on Vista   Ultimate SP 1.    From the original reporter:  I ran Sysinternal's Process Monitor to try to find out what Chrome is doing   when CPU is high.  What I found was that Chrome does a  successful  &quot;QueryNameInformationFile&quot;   operation on C:WindowsSystem32MacromedFlashNPSWF32.dll	  about 500-600 times a second! I guess this could account for the high CPU   load.  I've reinstalled the Flash player a couple of times but that didn't help.
