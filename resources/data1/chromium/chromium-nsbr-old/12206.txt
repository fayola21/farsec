<title>Issue 12206 -   chromium -    Color depth 24 without xrender has red and blue flipped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a follow-up to [1] I'm filing a separate bug for this.    1. Start vnc with depth 24: vncserver :3 -geometry 1024x768 -depth 24  2. Then connect to it: vncviewer localhost:3  3. On Chromium startup  the stop sign is blue and not red. (FF and other  apps work fine)    In BackingStore::PaintRectWithoutXrender()  it is going through the  pixmap_bpp_ == 32 block rather than the pixmap_bpp_  == 24 block. Perhaps  the latter is just dead code?    [1] <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10616#c8">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10616#c8</a> </pre>
