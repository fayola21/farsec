<title>Issue 9880 -   chromium -    A client socket is not recycled if a response body is 0 bytes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug was discovered by Jim.    If a response body is 0 bytes  for example  a 204 &quot;No Content&quot;  response  HttpNetworkTransaction::DoReadBody returns 0 without  reading from the socket  and the next state   HttpNetworkTransaction::DoReadBodyComplete  cannot distinguish  that 0 byte count from an actual socket read call that returned  0  so we mistake it for an EOF and close the socket.    This bug causes us to close keep-alive connections under that  condition. </pre>
