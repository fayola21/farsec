<title>Issue 19778 -   chromium -    many conflicting changes (Moving Parent to Child and Vice versa on second client) can cause divergence  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/2050998    Chromium        4.0.202.0 (Developer Build 23070)    Not sure about complete repro steps  but did lots of moving around of   folders before I got into this state.    Steps:    1) Client A and B - both are connected to sync using same account  2) A had lots of bookmarks (around 200)  then both clients got the change   and they were in sync. Then I just kept moving various bookmark folders   from parents to children and vice versa from another client.  3) I saw that sync was working fine for long time and got couple of crashes   as I was making these conflicting changes. Chrome restarts fixes the crash   issue and sync works fine  but once I got chrome in stuck state  there was   no way out  no matter what I do.    Actual:  Eventually Both clients got into UnSynced State (i.e. Bookmark Models are   different and they are not syncing with each other anymore). about:sync   falsely claims to be in READY state on both clients but 'Invalid Store' was   found TRUE  which seems like an error state to me.    Expected:  Chrome should not crash due to conflicting changes. Also  Sync should not   get into wrong state eventually where it can't make any progress.    Note: I tried restarting Chrome on both clients but Sync was in same stuck   state. No changes are getting synced from both clients.     This bug is very difficult to repro and also doesn't represent   normal/common user scenario   so I think it's not that severe of a bug. But   still possible that some users may get into this state if they use it for   extended amount of time or try to make conflicting changes. </pre>
