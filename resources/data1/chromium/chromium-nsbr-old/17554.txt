<title>Issue 17554 -   chromium -    1) gmail unable to open.... 2) chrome crashes  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com      1. opening gmail after switching accounts or just logging out and relogin   or even when i click inbox from gchat options.        The expected result is to get gmail opened      The chrome goes into multiple redirections loop and ultimately i resolve   issue by clearing chrome cache.     Also every now and then the chrome crashes.  3-4 times in 1hr of surfing.   Just wanted to let the team know      thanks..   ometalink@gmail.com </pre>
