<title>Issue 9060 -   chromium -    Should ResourceMessageFilter::OnGet(Root)WindowRect be sent null windows or not? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're constantly getting null window references in the  ResourceMessageFilter::OnGet(Root)WindowRect functions. It seems like the  Windows code accidentally handles it due to Windows being very lax in what  it accepts as parameters.    Are null window refs expected values for those functions to handle?    If so  the Windows version should explicitly check for null rather than  relying on the fact that the Win32 APIs happen to handle that case by accident.    If not  we need to figure out why those null window refs are coming through. </pre>
