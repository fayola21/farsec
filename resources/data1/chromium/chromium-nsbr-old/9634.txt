<title>Issue 9634 -   chromium -    FindInPageControllerTest.FindCrash_Issue1341577 fails on official builder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FindInPageControllerTest.FindCrash_Issue1341577 is failing on the official   builder. I don't know why it doesn't fail on the Vista test bot on the   waterfall.    See src/chrome/test/data/find_in_page/crash_1341577.html    Ctrl+F then Alt+&lt;numpad&gt;3404 correctly finds the glyph on XP.    On the official builder (Vista 64)  the cursor is in the middle of the glyph   and there are 0 find results. If you then press space  it finds 1 result.    I'm not sure if this is a configuration problem with the builder. </pre>
