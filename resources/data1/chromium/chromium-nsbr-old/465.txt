<title>Issue 465 -   chromium -    change start page of new tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. create a new tab (+ or ctrl-T)  2. it will use the history overview and most visited sites      Is there a way to add an option in the options window where you can change   the default homepage for new opened tabs (current page  blank page  same as   homepage  ...) ? I like my tabs completely blank when opening to reduce   load when a lot of tabs are already open.   </pre>
