<title>Issue 324 -   chromium -    Cannot &quot;Open With&quot; for a download file like in Firefox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I have a file that is a .asx stream but to play it from Mythtv (local   server) I need to open it with a batch file smp.bat.  In Firefox  I can   just select &quot;open With&quot;  In Chrome  I need to &quot;show all downloads&quot; then   &quot;Show in folder&quot;  then I can select &quot;open with&quot;.  IE can't do it either so   maybe it is a feature request and not a bug but Firefox can do it.        I expect to see an option to select the program I use to open the file.      I just get the open with the default (WinAmp) which does't play the file.    Please provide
