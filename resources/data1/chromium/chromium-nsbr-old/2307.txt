<title>Issue 2307 -   chromium -    Javascript Date Layout tests are failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the jail these 2 tests are failing:  V8 # LayoutTests/fast/js/date-DST-time-cusps.html = FAIL | PASS  V8 # LayoutTests/fast/js/date-big-setdate.html = FAIL | PASS    Maybe this is because the jail is on the east coast (bios clock)  but   windows is configured to be PDT. Not sure why it would matter though. </pre>
