<title>Issue 21657 -   chromium -    tab flashes when you start dragging it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> case 1:  1. start dragging a tab within the tabstrip (don't drag it out of the   tabstrip)  2. When the drag initiates the tab flashes (i.e. it appears that it fails   to paint right away)  3. this doesn't happen on windows.    case 2:  1. drag a tab down  out of the tabstrip  2. notice that you can see the tab being painted over the course of ~300ms   or so (instead of all appearing at once  you see the tab first  then the   main window area later). We maybe need to double-buffer?  3. this doesn't happen on windows.  4. I can't see this on my warp station  but it is noticeable on slow   computers.    related (?): sometimes you can also see a flash in the upper left corner of   the screen </pre>
