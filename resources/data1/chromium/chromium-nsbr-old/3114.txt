Click 'Try Sample User!' by the Login button  3. Click Edit on the first Orb        The two Range setting arrow icons can be dragged left and right to set the  lower and upper values of the range. They are prevented from ever crossing  (or from even being less than 4% apart).        The upper arrow works fine. The lower one doesn't move. It thinks it's  being selected (it highlights) - seems to ignore the cursor:move attribute.   </pre>
