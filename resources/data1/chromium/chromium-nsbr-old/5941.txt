<title>Issue 5941 -   chromium -    haaretz.co.il: Homepage is left aligned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Works in:  FF3: OK  IE7: OK    Bug description:  The text of the main page is left-aligned in Chrome  it should be centered   this looks correct in FF.  The main issue here is that the left alignment  causes Flash ads on the page to draw on top of text or not align correctly  with the page.    Discussion:  * Looking at the style in the top of the main HTML document:  html  body { overflow: hidden; height: 100% width:100%;}  #content {height:100%; width:100%; text-align: -moz-center;     overflow-y:scroll;}  The problem is the -moz-center tag which isn't supported in WebKit.    Solution:  Replace with the following:  html  body  {height: 100% width:100%;}  #content {width:760px; margin: auto; text-align: center; overflow:hidden}    This formulation works fine in Firefox &amp; WebKit-based browsers.      </pre>
