<title>Issue 17421 -   chromium -    Page-up/down in the find field should apply to the document. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In most browsers  certain movement keys (page-up/down  home  end  perhaps  others) apply to the main document when you're in the find field.  This  seems to be the case for Firefox and Safari.  Not for IE (there it seems to  do nothing).    I can see leaving home/end to operate in the field itself  but page-up/down  operating on the document seems like a good idea. </pre>
