<title>Issue 13548 -   chromium -    Gmail Checker Extension Enhancement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)    This is just an enhancement to the Gmail Checker Extension that uses the   background_page option to manage the checking of the atom feed  and allows   you to change the label you are checking.    I switched it to using the background_page for the checking since none of the   examples I could find used that option and I figured it would be helpful to   others if there was at least once example that used it. </pre>
