<title>Issue 17944 -   chromium -    too much spacing on new NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the top of the new NTP there's an extra line of whitespace causing the   thumbnails to appear lower than they should. It seems like this may be a side   effect of the new shorter logo replacing the taller one on the page.     The logo and the widgets should be on the same line.     </pre>
