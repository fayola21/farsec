<title>Issue 13542 -   chromium -    edited omnibox contents are lost on tab switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.183.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17570">r17570</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : ion3 20080825-1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Edited location bar contents are   preserved when switching back to a tab  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Unknown      1. Create a new tab.  2. Type a few characters into the omnibox.  3. Click into the tab contents to dismiss the omnibox's suggestion window   (or not; it doesn't seem to make any difference).  4. Click on a different tab in the same window or create a new tab.  5. Click back on the original tab.      I expect omnibox contents to be preserved when a tab is deselected.  This   just bit me as I was attempting to search for a street address in a new tab   -- I typed part of the address and switched back to refer to the original   page containing the address.  When I switched back  the typing I had   already done was gone.      Omnibox contents aren't preserved when I switch tabs.  When I switch back   to the original tab  its current location is displayed in the omnibox   instead. </pre>
