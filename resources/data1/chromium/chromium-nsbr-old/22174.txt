<title>Issue 22174 -   chromium -    Need to enable new worker and message port tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a set of new worker layout tests that aren't currently included in   WorkerTest.WorkerFastLayoutTests and WorkerTest.MessagePorts.    We need to update those test cases to include the missing tests. In fact  we   might want to change those tests to use wildcards so tests added in the   future are automagically included.   </pre>
