<title>Issue 6441 -   chromium -    Regression: navigation control disappears on flickr map - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome version: 2.0.157.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=8008">r8008</a>      1. Sign into flickr.com  2. Click on the down arrow of the &quot;organize&quot; menu  3. Go to &quot;Your Maps&quot;   4. Zoom in and out to some area in the map and do some scrolling to the   left and right    What is the expected output?   The navigation control on top right corner of the map should consistently   show.    What do you see instead?  The navigation controls as well as the &quot;map&quot;  &quot;hybrid&quot; and &quot;satellite&quot;   buttons disappear. Sometimes  the controls don't appear even if you don't   go through step 4.  See screenshot.    FF3: ok  Safari 3.1 nightly webkit 39853: ok  IE7: ok  Chrome 1.0.154.43: ok  Chrome 2.0.157.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7888">r7888</a>: not ok         </pre>
