<title>Issue 2388 -   chromium -    Window can be moved independently of tab during tab animation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. In 152.1  create a new tab in a window already containing tabs.  2. Drag the tab to the left or right  not so far that it rearranges the   strip.  3. Release the mouse  and before it has finished animating back to its   resting position  drag the window (be quick).    &gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    The window moves  but the tab stays affixed to the screen coordinates    leaving a blank tab in the window. The tab snaps into place about a second   later.    </pre>
