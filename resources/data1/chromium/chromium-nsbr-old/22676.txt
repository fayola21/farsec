<title>Issue 22676 -   chromium -    Spell checker shouldn't mark capitalization issues in input boxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4    In many input boxes (such as search boxes)  'correct' capitalization is often intentionally not used since   it's unnecessary.    Therefore  to mark capitalization issues (e.g. a proper name like 'Canada' or 'Britney') in input boxes is   probably too aggressive and shouldn't be done.  It would be okay to continue to do this in textareas though.    By comparison  other browsers don't face this issue since none of them currently do any spell checking in   input boxes. </pre>
