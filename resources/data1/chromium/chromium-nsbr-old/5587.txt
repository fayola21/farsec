<title>Issue 5587 -   chromium -    all dns errors hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try navigating to a page that has no dns  e.g.  www.google.xom  2. Throbber starts  but nothing ever loads.  3. If you close the browser in this state  we crash in safebrowsing code.    This happens with --winhttp as well.    It looks like in resource_dispatcher_host.cc  the request is getting caught   by SafeBrowsingEventHandler::OnResponseCompleted which says:    // Got a DNS error while the safebrowsing check is in progress or we  // already know that the site is unsafe.  Don't show the the dns error  // page.    It seems like we never then complete the request  causing it to hang.  This   code works on the release branch  so maybe it's the new http refactoring? </pre>
