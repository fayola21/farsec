<title>Issue 14827 -   chromium -    Scrolling with mouse while page partial loaded scrolls too far - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On both Linux dev version and Windows stable version   if I load a web page and then try to scroll down exactly one  page by clicking on the scroll bar below the thumb   the result depends on whether the page has totally finished  loading.  If it has finished totally  all is well  and the  window scrolls down one page as expected.    But if anything is still pending  a bad thing happens: the  window scrolls by more than one page  often much more   and in fact it seems to lose the &quot;mouse up&quot; click   and follows the mouse around to some extent.    This was a bit hard to figure out; it took me a while to  notice that this only happened on first read of a page   and then a while more to figure out that it was only  while the page was still loading.  Thus it will affect  impatient fast readers more than people who tend to  not scroll until the whole dang page is there.   </pre>
