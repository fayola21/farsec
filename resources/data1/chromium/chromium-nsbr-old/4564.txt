<title>Issue 4564 -   chromium -    Initialize breakpad synchronously. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Getting the file version information is slow  but we also don't want to   block breakpad initialization until after chrome.dll is loaded.  Carlos   suggested using a dummy version until we get the information and can   updated it.    This means:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/10300">http://codereview.chromium.org/10300</a>    Will be dropped  and should be implemented differently. </pre>
