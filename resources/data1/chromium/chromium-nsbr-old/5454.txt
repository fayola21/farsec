<title>Issue 5454 -   chromium -    Enabling &quot;Block all insecure content&quot; should prevent request from being made on network. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Enable the &quot;Block all insecure content&quot; option  2. Open &quot;about:network&quot; in a tab and start recording network traffic  3. Go to a page which includes mixed HTTPS and HTTP content (gmail   connected to AIM is one I've tried)      When the &quot;some elements came from an unverified source and were not   displayed&quot; message comes up  the network request also should be stopped.        A notification is shown saying the unverified content was not displayed    but the request is still made.    I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation  but I would imagine that if   browsing a secure site  no requests should be made to insecure elements if   the option is enabled. It could potentially open up some serious security   risks. </pre>
