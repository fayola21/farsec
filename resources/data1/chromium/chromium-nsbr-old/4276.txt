<title>Issue 4276 -   chromium -    painting is still glitchy in linux test shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To repro  just launch test shell and then focus on a different window (so test_shell no longer has   focus).  This causes some of the button text to disappear and the links to the right of the search   box to disappear.  This is annoying.    This also repros on the windows test shell.  Darin suggested it might have to do with the repaint   logic in webwidget_host.cc.  He says it's broken and chrome does it correctly so it wasn't worth   fixing.  One suggestion was to just remove all the logic involving scroll rect.  We're not currently   using scroll rect or doing scrolling optimizations on linux  so it's unclear whether that's the cause   or not. </pre>
