<title>Issue 7038 -   chromium -    The tabs are broken in the latest development version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	2.0.158.0 (Official Build 8360)    In some cases the tabs before &quot;minimum-width&quot;  and only resolution is to   create a new-tab  and close it with a mouse-click. because closing with   ctrl-w does not work.    And resizing the chrome window to be sqeezed does not sqeeze the tabs    instead tabs just disappear behind the &quot;plus&quot; button.    And many more issues with the tabs that just go crazy from time to time. </pre>
