<title>Issue 12266 -   chromium -    altering the url # component moves the focus to the omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 2.0.182 (182.0) (Mac nightly)    Other browsers tested: doesn't happen in FireFox  Safari4.        visit mail.google.com with keyboard shortcuts turned on  enter a conversation from a threadlist  watch the focus go from the   browser window to the omnibar.    essentially  gmail's keyboard shortcuts are totally useless with current   build. This is the only aspect of chrome mac that precludes me being brave   and using it day-to-day.    my hypothesis: programmatic setting of the URL via window.location is   moving the focus and it ought not to.        focus stays in browser window.      </pre>
