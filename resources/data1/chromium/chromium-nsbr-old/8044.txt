<title>Issue 8044 -   chromium -    Make a &quot;helper&quot; app bundle that has the LSUIElement set  splitting it from the main browser app bundle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In WebKit  Chromium uses Cocoa rendering when possible for UI elements (e.g. &lt;input   type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;clickme&quot;/&gt;).  To use Cocoa rendering  we need an NSApplication.  If we have   an NSApplication  we have a dock icon.    We don't want a dock icon for the render processes.  Currently  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/27108">http://codereview.chromium.org/27108</a> works around this by disabling dock icons en masse  then   enabling them only for the browser.  This has problems; e.g. the dock bounce while waiting for an   app to launch is now completely gone.  Nevertheless  things &quot;work&quot; enough to continue.    The right answer  probably  is to eliminate use of Cocoa in Chromium's WebKit theme.   This bug   will track such efforts.       </pre>
