<title>Issue 20831 -   chromium -    white or black flashing if many tabs are loading in the background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Got to igoogle.com (or other site with many links)  2. Middle click a bunch of links  at least 6 so they start loading in   separate tabs in the background  3. Don't do anything else  after a few seconds observe the igoogle page flash   white or black. By flash I mean it paints the whole tab white for a split   second.      The igoogle page should not flash       </pre>
