<title>Issue 7065 -   chromium -    Need to cache the intermediate CA certificates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are only caching the leaf certificates now.  This  causes the following problems:    1. When we invoke the certificate viewer dialog  the  certificate chain may be missing the intermediate CA  certificates.    2. EV status may not be displayed if the cached resource  (a main frame) is still valid and is used (<a title="No EV Indication" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3154"> issue 3154 </a>).    We should cache the intermediate CA certificates. </pre>
