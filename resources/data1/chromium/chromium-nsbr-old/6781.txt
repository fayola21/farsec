<title>Issue 6781 -   chromium -    Focus traversal order in task manager is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - Open the task manager  - Select a process in the list (so the End Process button is enabled)  - Move the focus by pressing tab    Expected: the focus should go from the table to the link  to the button  Actual: the focus goes from the table to the button then the link    The fix is trivial  we just need to add the link view to its parent view   after we added the button (so it is traversed before the button).    Note: a more evolved fix would be to link views for focus traversal not   based on their insertion order  but on their location in their parent view   (as part of the layout).     </pre>
