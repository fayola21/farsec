<title>Issue 23147 -   chromium -    Deadlock with windowed plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Al hit this deadlock with O3D:    1) plugin (using wm_timer or plugin async callback) calls into renderer to   put up an alert dialog  2) right after  the browser calls ShowWindow on the plugin  which hangs on   the plugin  3) the ViewHostMsg_RunJavaScriptMessage msg from the renderer never gets to   execute on the UI thread  and so the global pump_messages_event never gets   set to cause the renderer/plugin to run a nested message loop  resulting in   deadlock </pre>
