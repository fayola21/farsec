<title>Issue 7280 -   chromium -    Security/feature: Show form action when hovering submit buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://qd9.co.uk/temp/ClickJackEg.html">http://qd9.co.uk/temp/ClickJackEg.html</a>           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL    The above demonstrates a fairly straightforward exploit that allows   &quot;clickjacking&quot; to interact in unsolicited ways with Twitter.   Vulnerabilities like this would be reduced if  like when hovering over a   hyperlink  hovering the submit button for a form like this showed the URL   that it's about to submit to. </pre>
