<title>Issue 13436 -   chromium -    OSX UI glitch: Push button caps are flipped vertically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;3.0.184 (184.0)&gt;    OS version               : &lt;OSX 10.5.7&gt;    UI glitch: push buttons caps are flipped vertically. as I have my system themed  that's more visible   (see attachment)  the same buttons are drawn correctly by Safary and firefox and anywhere else in the system  so it   must be something within Chromium    k. </pre>
