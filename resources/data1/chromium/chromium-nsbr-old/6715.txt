<title>Issue 6715 -   chromium -    1.0.154.3 problem with web based email - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> since the last update I can't do a new message  reply/forward a message and   no header material is visible or when it might periodically show up  it is   not the correct info for the email being read and then the same info stays   for all emails. Have posted about this in Forums with no answers that made   sense.    Please provide an update or a patch so that I can use email with Chroms. I   like the program but it is beginning to bother me with problems being   created.    I also have noticed that since the last update  the speed has reduced   considerably when browsing although downloads are still fast. </pre>
