<title>Issue 3624 -   chromium -    'Mouseimp' scrolling does not work in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2.149.30  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.mouseimp.com/">http://www.mouseimp.com/</a>           Safari 3: unknown.      Firefox 2 &amp; Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    MouseImp Pro lets one scroll the windows of most applications using only a   conventional mouse (w/o a wheel) in MS Windows OSes.       1. install and run MouseImp Pro (per above URL). In settings  ensure   'directScroll' is enabled.  2. launch Chrome. Display a web page featuring a vertical scroll bar.  3. Try scroll the window up/down using the no-wheel mouse (or a wheel-  mouse  without using the wheel) : depress and hold right button  move mouse   in the up/down direction.       Tab should scroll up/down following the mouse movement.      No scrolling : the MouseImpPro hook is not honoured.          </pre>
