<title>Issue 3691 -   chromium -    The plugin hang monitor should kill all plugins when we're exiting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user exits when a plugin is hung  we'll wait for a timeout (I think   30s) and then offer to kill the hung plugins  just like we would any other   time a plugin is hung.    It seems like when we're exiting  we don't need to bother asking since the   user wants to exit. We should set some kind of flag so we know we're   exiting (maybe this already exists?) and then the hang monitor can check   this and skip the prompting before killing the plugin. </pre>
