<title>Issue 4572 -   chromium -    Input caret does not indicate the language direction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.22  URLs :   <a href="http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/710/chromecaretpv1.jpg">http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/710/chromecaretpv1.jpg</a>        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. In IE the carret always shows the direction of the next string to be   entered= RTL caret or LTR caret.  2. In FF  if the language is English the default caret is plain  once you switch languages (to an RTL one) it will change to a special RTL caret  if   you change back to English it won't go back to the plain caret but switch   to a special LTR caret.        1. Look at this compassion picture i made:  <a href="http://img209.imageshack.us/my.php?image=chromecaretpv1.jpg">http://img209.imageshack.us/my.php?image=chromecaretpv1.jpg</a>  2. Put you caret in some input box (for example the search box of   google.com )  3. Switch between LTR/RTL languages in the keyboard.  4. Observe  the caret will not morph.    Chrome caret is always plain. and does not show the direction of the next   string to be entered.    Note: As you can see from the picture i made of the behavior of other   browsers  the caret should relate to the language type of the string as set   in the tray  not to whether the input box is actually set to RTL/LTR (in   all of the screenshots i made it is set to LTR  it looks the same when   moved to RTL just in the right corner...).     </pre>
