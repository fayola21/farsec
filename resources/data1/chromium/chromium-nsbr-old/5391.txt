<title>Issue 5391 -   chromium -    Drag and drop to bookmarks shouldn't close the menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29        1. Click and hold the starred portion of the omni bar    2. drag the url over to &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; folder ...   3. Wait for menu to fly out and drop bookmark in folder you want      Menu should remain open and show newly added bookmark so you can move it   around as you like  or otherwise have visual confirmation that the drop was   successful. FF3 does this.      Menu closes immediately  you have to mouse over to it again to confirm that   the drop actually works.    Thanks for all the good work guys!  This is my main browswer now  all I need is rss feed notification and I'm   golden :D     </pre>
