<title>Issue 5213 -   chromium -    BUG: Closing two tabs will not close the second tab until the first one is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.31      1. Close a tab.  2. Close another tab quickly.      The tab will close.      It does not close until the other tab is closed and another mouse click will be   committed.      Of course  it only happens if the first tab is not immediately closed. </pre>
