<title>Issue 19582 -   chromium -    Grammar error: Only install extensions you trust - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1    Install an extension and this message pops up:    Only install extensions you trust    It contains a grammar error that 99% of people get wrong  but in my   experience  it's especially prevalent amongst programmers.    It should be:    Install only extensions that you trust.    The word 'only' qualifies the verb or noun that follows it.  In the first   instance you're qualifying the word install  implying that you're not   allowed to do anything else than installing the extension; you may not   delete it; you may not update it.  That was obviously not the intention.    Also notice the inclusion of the word 'that'. </pre>
