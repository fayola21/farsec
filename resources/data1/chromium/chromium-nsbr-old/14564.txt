<title>Issue 14564 -   chromium -    downloads in downloads bar shouldn't have a fixed width - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0    On my 1024x768 screen  a maximum of 3 downloads are shown in the bar. Taking   just about 4 pixels from each would create enough space for a fourth   download. We should take the number that is currently used as the fixed width   for downloads  use it as a maximum width and additionally define a minimum   width. The behaviour would be the same as it is now with sizing the tabs. </pre>
