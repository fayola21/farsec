<title>Issue 2847 -   chromium -    Images saved on Chrome don't save in the regular format - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed in the last few days that when I save an image in Chrome by   right-clicking on it  it puts &quot;jpg&quot; in the file name instead of &quot;.jpg&quot; and   my computer doesn't recognize the file type.    -geoffrey1986@gmail.com </pre>
