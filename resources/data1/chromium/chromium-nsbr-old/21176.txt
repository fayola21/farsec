<title>Issue 21176 -   chromium -    Status text on download items is not themed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Select the grass theme  2.

Instead    it's not: <a href="http://imgur.com/fOFKB.png">http://imgur.com/fOFKB.png</a>    That's because that color is hardcoded and not theme-dependent. It is not   clear which theme color should be used  though.       </pre>
