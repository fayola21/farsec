<title>Issue 12561 -   chromium -    Location bar steals focus in Google Reader - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 182.0 (Developer Build )  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">https://www.google.com/reader</a>         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to a Google Reader account with unread items in more than one folder/tag.  2. Go to the first folder/tag and go through the unread items using the space bar.        Once all the unread items are marked read  Google Reader should go on to the next folder/tag with unread   items.          The location bar steals the focus and I end up prepending a bunch of spaces to the current URI.    It's a real bummer  since I'm a big Google Reader user and would love to use Chromium as my full-time   browser. </pre>
