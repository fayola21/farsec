<title>Issue 17325 -   chromium -    unsafe javascript attempt to access frame not caught with try catch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0             Safari 4: Not Tested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Have an &lt;iframe&gt; in an html document with a domain  protocol  or port   mismatch  2. accessing the location.href of the iframe within a try catch does not catch   a thrown error. Example:    try{alert(frames[0].location.href)}catch(err){alert('hi')}        Any error thrown by trying to access the iframe's href within a try catch   should be caught in order to be properly processed.      An error will be thrown and frames[0].location.href will return an unexpected   result.   </pre>
