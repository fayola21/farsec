<title>Issue 21856 -   chromium -    Lost access to extensions bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21       Not relevant      Start Chrome...      Extensions bar is visible  extensions are operational      Cannot see extensions bar  cannot use extensions  &quot;chrome://extensions/&quot;   page says &quot;No Extensions Installed&quot;.    This happened yesterday  with no provocation on my side. I assume this has   something to do with the new update posted(?)    avishayshahar@gmail.com     </pre>
