<title>Issue 22645 -   chromium -    Left click does not select item from drop down list item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4  URLs (if applicable) : Any           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Any standard drop down box will select a clicked entry  but the drop   down box itself does not close.      The dropdown box should close  leaving the selection in the box.      The clicked item is selected  but the dropdown box stays dropped down   instead of closing. </pre>
