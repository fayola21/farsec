<title>Issue 6602 -   chromium -    100% idle after few minutes  missing 2d icons  missing flash gif after running once - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Left it idle and found task manager 100% load  2. After loading a flash gif  the animation will run once and disappear   3. Noticed several 2D icons disappeared  not even a red cross failed   loading indication        Appears that Chromium version from 7799 onwards have a variation of such   bugs. Disappointing as it seems newer Chromium is un-useable.       Please provide
