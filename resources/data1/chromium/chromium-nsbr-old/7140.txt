<title>Issue 7140 -   chromium -    Display issue in the Resources tab of the inspector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43      1. Go to www.code.google.com in Chrome  2. Rightclick anywhere and start the inspector (click 'Inspect element')    then click the 'Resources' tab  3. Switch focus back to the web page and click the 'APIs &amp; Tools' link on   the left  4. Go back to the inspector  and click the first resource (should be called   'more')  5. Now click 'Time' (just above) and you will see even though the time   graphs are shown  the code isn't hidden.      The previously showed HTML code should be hidden when i want to see a   graph.        The code can still be seen  under the graphs.    This doesn't happen for every site  but it seems it does for quite a few. I   've attached a screenshot.   </pre>
