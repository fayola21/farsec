<title>Issue 11111 -   chromium -    Proxy config gconf fetch needs to be thread safe wrt glib main loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Gconf  used in net/proxy/proxy_config_service_linux.cc  is not  thread-safe against itself  and it's meant to be used from the thread  running the glib main loop. The proxy configuration is being fetched  from the I/O thread  while the glib main loop runs in the UI  thread. gconf has callbacks  timeouts and idles that will be  dispatched from the glib main loop.   </pre>
