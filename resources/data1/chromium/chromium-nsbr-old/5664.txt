<title>Issue 5664 -   chromium -    Omnibar suggestions  having typed one word + space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33      1. Type foo + a space in the Omnibar  2. Watch the suggestions that show up.      Suggestions list should show suggestions as if I entered several words    i.e. suggestion row 2 which shows &quot;foo/&quot; should go away.      Suggestion &quot;foo/&quot; stays visible  even though any further typing would   guarantee that it goes away.    Possibly people type a word and a space by habit  and those would loose out   on the &quot;foo/&quot; option?  But it's a very discoverable loss  so they can learn to avoid the extra   keypress (saving the earth a little by not replacing keyboards for broken   space-keys!).     </pre>
