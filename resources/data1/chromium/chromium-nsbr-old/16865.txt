<title>Issue 16865 -   chromium -    local layout_test loader tests are failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since we moved the LayoutTests directory from webkit/data/LayoutTests to   third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests  the following files fail in the regression:    /LayoutTests/fast/loader/local-CSS-from-local.html  /LayoutTests/fast/loader/local-JavaScript-from-local.html  /LayoutTests/fast/loader/local-image-from-local.html    test_shell_win.cpp has a hardcoded transform of the URLs that points to the   wrong place; if you still have the old directory populated  the test will   pass  but if you have a clean tree  it won't. </pre>
