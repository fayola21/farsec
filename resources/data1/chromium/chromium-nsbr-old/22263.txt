<title>Issue 22263 -   chromium -    Find bar should use system colors  not hardcoded ones - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The find bar looks very strange when the system window color is not white    because it has a white background bitmap  so you get a chunk of different   color where the textfield is instead of a contiguous appearance.    The right way to do this is to replace the background images with ones that   use alpha  and have the find bar view paint its background with the system   window color.  The colors for the &quot;matches found&quot; and similar texts will also   have to be made to either use system colors or use the color_util facilities   for picking readable colors.    The main blocker here is getting the images  so assigning to Glen initially.    He can punt to me when he's got them.   </pre>
