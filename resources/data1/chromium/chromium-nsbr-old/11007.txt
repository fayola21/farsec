<title>Issue 11007 -   chromium -    [regression] we should have a timeout for naviigating away from an unresponsive renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new tab   2. Type in about:hang  3. Now  open a new tab and navigate to a site (i.e. www.google.com)      As soon as you type the URL in the 2nd tab that you just opened  the URL   disappears and the page doesn't load.    intermittently  sometimes the page loads after some time.    Checked this against Chrome 1.0.154.59 and the page loads right away.      Chrome stable 1.0.154.59: ok  Chrome dev build 2.0.176.0: not ok  Chromium 2.0.177.0 (14436): not ok  </pre>
