<title>Issue 2553 -   chromium -    sort of error after clicking 'About chrome' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click 'about Chrome'      expect it to tell me if chrome is up to date or not        hangs on &quot;checking for update&quot; and nothing happens  and after closing the &quot;about chrome&quot; window and closing the browser itself    the next time you want to launch chrome  it never appears but instead I   have to end it in Taskmanager and start chrome again.  But If chrome   successfully launches  without the need of ending the (sometimes already   existing) process in the taskmanager  it will report of chrome crashing or   not being shut down properly.      Please provide
