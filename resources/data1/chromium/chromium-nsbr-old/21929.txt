<title>Issue 21929 -   chromium -    add consume to a step in the tab-switching tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need some ways of simulating a heavily loaded machine (bonus points for   doing it in a way that can be used by other tests) and running tab switching   tests there.  We need tests that give us slow numbers now  to reflect the   poor experience that some users see.  Also we need to measure white-out   duration  and even how long it takes to respond to user input. </pre>
