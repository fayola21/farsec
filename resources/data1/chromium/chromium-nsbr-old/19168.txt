<title>Issue 19168 -   chromium -    Connecting to a port when there isn't a background page kills Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553)      1. Create an extension with a manifest with a content script but no  background page.  Have the content script call chrome.extension.connect();  2. Go to a matched URL      Extension has internal error or is disabled.  Generally  the error is  swallowed by Chrome somehow (perhaps with a useful notification to the user)      Chrome crashes </pre>
