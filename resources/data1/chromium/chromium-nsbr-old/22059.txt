<title>Issue 22059 -   chromium -    Regression - Target not shown when mousing-over link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (26382)  OS version               : 10.6  Behavior in Chrome nightlies from last week:    When mousing over a link (A HREF) the HREF value was shown in a grey   overlay in the layer left-hand corner of the screen.      1. Go to a site (cnn.com for example)  2. Mouse-over a link  3. Notice no target information is displayed in the lower left-hand corner      A grey overlay should appear with the target in the lower left-hand corner   of the screen during mouse-over.      Nothing    (This used to work  but upon installing the build mentioned the behaviour   is no longer working.) </pre>
