<title>Issue 2893 -   chromium -    CSS system colors are hard-coded and wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)         Safari 3: Not tested.      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK          Opera: OK    CSS 2 defines various system color names  like ButtonFace or InactiveCaptionText. These can be used to give web applications a more   native look'n'feel  and can be used to respect an accessibility color   scheme that might be in effect for the visiting user:    &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html#system-colors">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html#system-colors</a>&gt;    These color names are not handled correctly by Chrome  as they are all   hard-coded (in CSSStyleSelector.cpp?) instead of being fetched from the   operating system as seemingly all other browsers do.    The result can be seen in the attached color chart  which compares Chrome   to IE7. On a Vista machine with classic theme enabled  all colors are   wrong  and some are even missing.     </pre>
