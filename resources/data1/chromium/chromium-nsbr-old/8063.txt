<title>Issue 8063 -   chromium -    Find-in-page box remains open on History/Downloads page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.167.0 (Developer Build 10305)    This is a regression  which occurred between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10179">r10179</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10305">r10305</a>.        1. Open a web page  e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>   2. Ctrl+F to bring up Find-in-page box.  3. Ctrl+H to open History tab (or switch to already-open History tab).    What is the expected output?     Find-in-page box should not be open in History tab.    What do you see instead?    Find-in-page box remains open in History tab.  Page Menu &gt; Find in Page is  disabled (correctly).  Furthermore  if you try to search for a string  it  searches the previous page you had open  not the History page.    This also applies to the Downloads page.   </pre>
