<title>Issue 13215 -   chromium -    inconsistency with regards to download &quot;progress pie&quot; in RTL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.0 (17405)        download any file (preferably big so you can see it happening)    look in the download shelf  and in the download page  at the progress pie      they both should &quot;fill&quot; in the same direction      the shelf one fills CW  the download page is CCW    Summary:  i personally prefer CW  but anyways it should be consistent </pre>
