<title>Issue 18861 -   chromium -    Main Window loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I experience this with Google Reader:      1. Open reader.google.com and sign in  2. Navigate over stories with the 'j' key          Every once in a while  the main window loses focus. Though this doesn't   happen with every story  I see this every time with a story that contains a   Google display ad (not text ad). Slashdot feed is a good source of these.        Chrome 3.0.197.12  Leopard 10.5.7 </pre>
