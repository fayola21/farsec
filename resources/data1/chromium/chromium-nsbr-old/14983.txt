<title>Issue 14983 -   chromium -    [sourceforge.net]: Some project page text is not visible on SourceForge.net - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/meld">http://sourceforge.net/projects/meld</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?    Some data is not visible in Chrome in the project page. The text can only   be seen with default settings when selecting it.          What is the expected result?    The text is always visible.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to the URL above. Wait until the layout is completed.  2. Look at the project details. The tab/view should be opened by default   and take most of the center of the page.  3. If you see Project Admins: steve9000  reload. If you see Project Admins:   and nothing to the right  you've hit the bug. The same applies to all other   fields  as well as fields in other tabs. Click on Freshmeat.net  for   instance; if the bug has been triggered  you'll see some statistics;   normally you'd also see a link to the Freshmeat page for the project as   well.      Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  I tested with Firefox 3.0.11 and couldn't reproduce the bug after a few   tries.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
