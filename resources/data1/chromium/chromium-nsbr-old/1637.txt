<title>Issue 1637 -   chromium -    No UI to show existance of RSS feeds in page or allow subscribing  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a web page contains RSS feeds other browsers provide a button or some   sort of UI which makes you aware of the feed and allows you to subscribe to   it using whatever RSS reader you use.    This is a separate issue to whether Chrome should actually be/contain an   RSS reader itself. (It should! Its about 100 frikin' lines of code.).     </pre>
