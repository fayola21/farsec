<title>Issue 6177 -   chromium -    Tab docking glitches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * When dragging to a screen edge with an existing maximized window  the   docking choices toggle unpredictably between &quot;window edge&quot; and &quot;screen   edge&quot;  the former of which is drawn half-offscreen.  We should pick one   (window edge?) and be consistent (and draw it onscreen).    * In Vista Aero (did not test on XP)  when docking to the side window edge   of a maximized window  the newly-created full-height windows are a little   too tall -- the top and bottom edges of the frame are both slightly   offscreen  making resizing the window later a bit tricky (and looking   glitchy in the meantime)   </pre>
