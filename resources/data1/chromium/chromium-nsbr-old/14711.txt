<title>Issue 14711 -   chromium -    Absent green button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.carsbuysell.ru/">http://www.carsbuysell.ru/</a>           Safari 3: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    2 green buttons are absent on this page. They must be below comboboxes which are below   horisontal banner. You'd bettes to see this page in Firefox to get know where green   buttons must be. This bug appears only in Chrome 2.    Also there is the third green button in the right white block on this page. And it is   displayed in Chrome but without top and bottom (see it in Firefox to compare). This bug   presents almost since I begin using Chrome (0.x versions). And also it presents in   Safari 3 (don't know about Safari 4). Other browsers displays this button correctly.     </pre>
