<title>Issue 8786 -   chromium -    Inconsistent cursors on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our code pretty much assumes that the user's default arrow is GDK_ARROW.  For me  this is not actually the case: my system default cursor is a larger  arrow. When I mouse over chrome for the first time  it doesn't change the  cursor until I hit some sort of content and webkit triggers a cursor  change  at which point it changes to a hand or a text selector. Only after  mousing back over generic content does it change to GDK_ARROW. This is also  visible in the toolbar. The cursor used for the toolbar is always my system  default cursor. It seems strange that the cursor should change when going  between toolbar and render area.    I took a survey of my open programs and it seems there is no consistent  behavior between apps. Firefox always sets the cursor to GDK_ARROW. Gnome  terminal only sets it to GDK_ARROW for the content area; tabs and menus are  system default. Xchat never sets GDK_ARROW  only toggling between special  cursors (e.g. resize arrows) and system default.    This is a very easy fix. I just want to make sure everyone agrees that  firefox is doing it right. </pre>
