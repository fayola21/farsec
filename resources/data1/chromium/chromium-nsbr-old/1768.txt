Set program language to Hungarian and restart  2. Copy an URL to the clipboard   3. Right click the location bar    Note that the &quot;Beilleszt��_��_s&quot; menu item appears to be present twice.  In fact   the same text was used for the translation of &quot;Paste&quot; and &quot;Paste and go&quot;.    &quot;Paste and go&quot; needs a proper translation  e.g. &quot;Beilleszt��_��_s ��_��_s ugr��_��_s&quot; </pre>
