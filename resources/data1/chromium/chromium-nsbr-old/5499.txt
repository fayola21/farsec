<title>Issue 5499 -   chromium -    Textboxes are not displayed properly when &lt;span&gt; is used; you can type over yourself and not see the changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open notepad. Toss the following code in there -     &lt;html&gt;   &lt;body&gt;      &lt;span&gt;      &lt;textarea rows=&quot;15&quot; cols=&quot;80&quot;&gt;   &lt;/textarea&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;      &lt;/body&gt;   &lt;/html&gt;  2. Save it as a .html file and open it in Chrome. Type anything in the text   box  arrow left  and type something else.     3. What you had previously typed is 'overwritten' in that you can't see it   anymore. Resizing the text box or moving the mouse in and out of it will   'fix' it  in that it properly updates with the text.      I expect the text after the cursor to move as I add new text.      Instead  it 'overwrites' what I had typed after it; not literally  it just   covers it up. Makes it rather annoying to figure out where you're typing.    Please provide
