<title>Issue 6365 -   chromium -    Tab detaches when focus is intended - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a few tabs and load something laggy (e.g. a PDF) into one  2. Give a different tab focus  3. Mouse down on the laggy tab  4. Quickly move the mouse enough to trigger the dragging animation  but not   far enough that releasing it should do anything to the tab  5. Quickly release the mouse button  6. Quickly move the mouse to the middle of the screen      The laggy tab gets focus but stays where it is.      The tab detaches and moves to where you moved the mouse to  even though you   moused up well before reaching this location.    Please provide
