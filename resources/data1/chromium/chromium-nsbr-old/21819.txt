<title>Issue 21819 -   chromium -    can't enter one-character url - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	4.0.207.0 (Official Build 25617)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.9  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.207.0 Safari/532.0    URLs (if applicable) : m           Safari 4: ok    Firefox 3.x: ok            IE 7: ok           IE 8: ok      1. type a one-character url  like &quot;m&quot; or &quot;a&quot;  2. press enter        go to that url          nothing.  the enter key seems to be ignored.    The drop-down shows something highlighted like &quot;m - Google Search&quot;  but   enter won't select that either.  I can't get it to either do a search or   navigate to that url.  Putting &quot;m/&quot; works as a workaround.    I believe this problem started very recently. </pre>
