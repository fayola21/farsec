<title>Issue 18226 -   chromium -    Feature request: back button (active) on page opened with (open link in new tab) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested      1. Clink on a link with right button and go to (open link in new tab)  2. As you can see the new page opened with (open link in new tab) option   doesn't show the back button (active)        I think could be better if when we open a page clicking on (open link in   new tab) the page opened should show the back button active. So if I click   on back button the paged opened will be closed and the user will be   redirected to the page he was browsing (the page where he did the action:   open link in new tab)    Understand? </pre>
