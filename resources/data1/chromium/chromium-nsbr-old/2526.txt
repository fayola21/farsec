<title>Issue 2526 -   chromium -    Regression: Find-In box hides my mouse pointer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Revision: 2367  -Start Composing an email in google internet email a/c.  -Ctrl+F to Find-in box and type foo  -Set key board focus to *compose box.    As long as Find-in box is not dismissed  you don't get back your cursor   pointer. BUT still you can type in *compose box as a blind man :)    I believe  this is broken few times and we have fixed it. </pre>
