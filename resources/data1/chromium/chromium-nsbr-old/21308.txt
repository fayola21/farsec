<title>Issue 21308 -   chromium -    Improve affordance for popup blocker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you go to a site that blocks a popup  the current popup blocker has nothing   on it to indicate that you can click it to get a menu to unblock popups. It   needs some affordance otherwise the user will have no idea this functionality   exists.    Ideas? </pre>
