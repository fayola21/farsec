<title>Issue 15407 -   chromium -    Favicon images with partial transparency grow shadows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To repro:    - Go to twitter.com/something  - Click the &quot;following&quot; link  - Watch the shadow around the &quot;t&quot; darken  - Reload to reset    Something is causing the image to be drawn onto itself each access. The  code to reset the view looks clean  so I suspect it's something deeper. </pre>
