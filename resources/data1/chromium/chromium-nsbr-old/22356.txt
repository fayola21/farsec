External application attempts to implement the   RenderViewHostManager::Delegate interface and does not wish to depend on   GTK or OS-dependent GUI interfaces      I want to be able to implement a clas that implements the following   Interfaces          public RenderViewHostManager::Delegate           public RenderViewHostDelegate           public RenderViewHostDelegate::Resource           public RenderViewHostDelegate::View  without being required to return a TabContents or TabContentsView  using the RendererHost interface (blue) as in   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/displaying-a-web-page-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/displaying-a-web-page-</a>  in-chrome      I am required to return a NavigationController which is required to return   TabContents and TabContentsView in a number of places in the code instead   of accessing it through *ForRenderManager *FromRenderManager functions    I have a patch to resolve the issue that I will submit for code review.   </pre>
