<title>Issue 18232 -   chromium -    [Linux] Menu key doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The menu key (this one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key</a>) doesn't work   in Linux. Shift+F10 also doesn't. Both should emulate right click.    * If focus is in a text field  it should be the same as right clicking where   the text cursor is (this currently DOES work in the omnibox  but not other   text fields)    * If focus is on another element (like a link) it should bring up the   context menu for that next to it.    * If text is selected  Firefox brings up the context menu for that text in   the upper right hand corner of the page  but I think it would be better for   it to appear next to the selected text. But that might be hard.    * If focus is not on anything else  it should bring up the page's context   menu in the upper left hand corner of the page    I think that's all. </pre>
