<title>Issue 15691 -   chromium -    EULA outer frames do not have correct encoding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open up chrome/installer/setup/eula/oem_ru.html with any browser  2.  Observe that the Russian characters look garbled.    Adding a &lt;meta&gt; character encoding tag to the page makes the characters   render correctly.  The eula outer frames just need character encoding meta   tags.   </pre>
