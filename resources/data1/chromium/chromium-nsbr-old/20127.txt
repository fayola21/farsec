<title>Issue 20127 -   chromium -    Stalled event always fires - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use events.html and load any video  http or file  2. Watch the events... after 3 seconds you see 'stalled' because WebKit  thinks we haven't progressed since bytesLoaded() hasn't changed      We should see 'progress' events  perhaps a 'suspend' if we set our network  state back to IDLE.  'stalled' shouldn't be firing. </pre>
