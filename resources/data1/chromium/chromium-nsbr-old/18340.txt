<title>Issue 18340 -   chromium -    Use themed warning icon when using GTK theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.197.0 (Developer Build 22263)  OS + version : Linux  Other browsers tested:    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. activate GTK theme  2. download an extension file (this file can harm your computer...)  or go to an SSL page without valid certificate      I would expect to see the same warning icon as used elsewhere in the   desktop.      Chrome's own warning icon is used.      There's a freedesktop spec icon for this: &quot;dialog-warning&quot;. I will attach a   preview of this icon from GNOME.   </pre>
