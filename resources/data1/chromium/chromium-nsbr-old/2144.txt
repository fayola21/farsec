<title>Issue 2144 -   chromium -    Add ability to reopen closed tabs from the context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open up multiple Tabs.   2. Close one of the Tabs.  3. Right click on the tab bar  and look for an Undo option for tabs that   have been closed.      This is a feature request for the ability to open tabs that have already   been closed. Expected result is to either reopen the last tab that was   closed or to display a list of recently closed tabs  and one can be   selected to re-open.      Nothing. The feature does not yet exist. Right clicking on the tab bar at   the top only has the additional option of opening the task manager.    Please provide
