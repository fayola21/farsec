<title>Issue 18662 -   chromium -    &quot;Downloads&quot; finder window appears beneath Chrome as a pop-under - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Downloads&quot; finder window appears beneath Chrome as a pop-under    Observed in 3.0.196.0 (Official Build 22005)    To repro:  1- Download a .zip file  e.g.:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/LATEST/chrome-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/LATEST/chrome-</a>  mac.zip  2- When the download completes  click on the entry in the download shelf.  3- Notice that an unzipping progress meter appears.  4- Notice that when that progress meter disappears  you are left starring   at Chrome.    It turns out that if you move the Chrome window aside there is a finder   window beneath it that shows the Downloads folder. </pre>
