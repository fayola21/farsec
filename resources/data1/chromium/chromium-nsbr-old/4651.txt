<title>Issue 4651 -   chromium -    Cannot launch user level chrome from user1  if user2 installs system level chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Login as user1 (admin) and Install 0.4.154.23. This gives a user level   install. Should be able to launch chrome from all places.  2. Login as user 2(admin)   install chrome 0.4.154.23 as system level.   Should be able to Launch chrome from all places.  3. Switch user and login as user1.  4. try to launch chrome from desktop/startmenu/quick launch.    What is the expected output?  Chrome should be launched.    What do you see instead?  As expected a message pops up saying &quot;the system level install with replace   ur user level install now&quot;  but nothing happens. Automatic uninstall never   happens. Chrome is not usable at all.. We keep on getting the pop  with the   above mentioned message  and chrome doesn't get launched.   Also  Add remove panel shows two entries of chrome. please see attached   screenshot.       </pre>
