<title>Issue 2908 -   chromium -    Immediate shut down after boot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Starting the browser and immediately clicking a bookmark on the bookmark   toolbar before the homepage (iGoogle  in this case) has time to load  or   while it is loading. Basically redirecting the page as soon as the browser   starts  like within 1 second.          The bookmark selected would load properly.      The browser shuts down. No error report  no hassles. It just shuts down as   if you pressed the close button. It opens again without problems. But the   same glitch persists indefinitely.    Please provide
