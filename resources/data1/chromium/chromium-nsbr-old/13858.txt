<title>Issue 13858 -   chromium -    Application shortcut fails to create if there is a non-square favicon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use a non-square favicon. (mine was 16x12)  2. Try to create an application shortcut.  3. Nothing happens. The dialog closes and the shortcut isn't created. It  does create folders in your profile directory  (%USERPROFILE%AppDataLocalGoogleChromeUSERDA~1DefaultPLUGIN~1GOOGLE~1&lt;site  name&gt;&lt;http or https&gt;icons#desktop) but the icons directory is empty.       The application shortcut is created and the favicon is stretched to fit and  the 32x32 icon is created anyway.      It fails to create an icon for the application shortcut and stops.    <b>Please provide
