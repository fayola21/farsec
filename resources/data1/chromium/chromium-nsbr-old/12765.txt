<title>Issue 12765 -   chromium -    Top of window cut-off when using Magnifier - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.??? (latest stable as of 5/27/09...I just   switched to dev version 3.0.182.2  bug is in both versions)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: none    OS: Windows XP sp3      1.  Make sure Chrome is NOT running  2.  Start Windows Magnifier (Start/All   programs/Accessories/Accessibility/Magnifier)  3.  Make sure Magnifier is &quot;docked&quot; by dragging it to the edge of the   screen (on top  in my case)  4.  Start Chrome    The top of Chrome appears underneath (behind) the Magnifier instead of   appearing immediately below it as it should.  You then have to undock the   magnifier and redock it for Chrome to appear correctly.     </pre>
