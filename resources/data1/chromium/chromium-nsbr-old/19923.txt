<title>Issue 19923 -   chromium -    [HTML5-Video] Many layout tests fail because video's addEventListener method is missing when assigning a video variable to another variable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issue:    Currently many layout tests fail to run in 4.0.202.0 (Official Build  23673)  they give a &quot;FAIL: timed out&quot; message and could not run properly.    After investigation on layout test script video-test.js  I find the problem is:    When assigning a video variable &quot;video1&quot;  to another variable &quot;video2&quot;  the  addEventListener() method is missing from variable &quot;video2&quot;  this is the  cause of failure on layout tests    A simple reduction case below:    http://go/html5media/video-pass-variable.html    In above reduction case  variable video is referring the real video  element  then it is assigned to variable media  then media.addEventListener  is called to do something  however it fails  in chrome' console it gives an  error like &quot;Uncaught TypeError: Object #&lt;a Media&gt; has no method  'addEventListener'&quot;    This should be a regression issue  because in earlier chrome build  this  issue doesn't happen.     </pre>
