<title>Issue 11690 -   chromium -    Incognito mode remembers file selection dialog location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1      1. Open an incognito window  2. Open a page with an input type=&quot;file&quot; element on it (e.g. reply to this   bug and add an attachment)  3. Click &quot;Choose File&quot;  navigate away from the default folder that appears    and select a file. You don't have to upload the file.  4. Open a regular window  5. Navigate that page to a page with an input type=&quot;file&quot;  6. Click &quot;Choose File&quot;      The dialog should open in the same location as the first one did.      The dialog opens in the new folder selected from within Incognito mode.   This means a crude level of uploading history is preserved while in this   mode. Activity with this dialog should be forgotten by the browser in   Incognito mode.   </pre>
