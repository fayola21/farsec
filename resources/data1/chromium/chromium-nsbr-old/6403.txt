<title>Issue 6403 -   chromium -    Implement RenderTheme::paintCapsLockIndicator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Implement RenderTheme::paintCapsLockIndicator    RenderThemeChromium{Win Gtk}.cpp should implement this method so that   &lt;input type=password&gt; will show a caps lock indicator when the caps lock   key is down.  We may also need to adjust our implementation of PlatformKeyboardEvent::currentCapsLockState() to work properly in the   sandbox. </pre>
