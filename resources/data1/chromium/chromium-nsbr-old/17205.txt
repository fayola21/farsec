<title>Issue 17205 -   chromium -    WISHLIST: search in the page should be near to the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I know that chrome as a minimal interface... but I also know that search in   the page is a very useful feature that not all user know is implemented. This   is just a suggestion... I think that maybe the search in the page box should   be near the omnibox  like the jpeg attached. I use often the search in the   page and it would be more quick if that box where always visible. and the   look of the browser in my opinion would be better. </pre>
