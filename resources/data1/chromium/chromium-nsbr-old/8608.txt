<title>Issue 8608 -   chromium -    History pegs CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Start chromium  2. From new tab page  click &quot;show all history&quot;    Expected:    History page  0% CPU after it's done loading    Actual:    History sometimes loads  but sometimes gets stuck at &quot;Loading...&quot;.  Regardless  it runs at about 50-80% CPU executing the same JS over and over  again to update the data.    Happens on all platforms. </pre>
