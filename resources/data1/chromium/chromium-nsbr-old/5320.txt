<title>Issue 5320 -   chromium -    Utest Browser Bug Battle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Website: <a href="http://www.utest.com/bug_battle/">http://www.utest.com/bug_battle/</a>    &quot;Over 1 330 uTesters from 68 countries competed to see who could find bugs in three of the top web browsers ��_��_��_ Internet   Explorer 8  Firefox 3.1 beta and Google Chrome. During their days of testing  they found a total of 672 bugs. The uTest   community identified 101 of those bugs as ��_��_��_showstoppers ��_��_��_ which are defined as flaws in need of immediate attention. The   final Bug Battle results included:    356 uTesters evaluated Internet Explorer 8 and found 168 bugs  including 9% that were deemed showstoppers.  514 uTesters evaluated Firefox 3.1 beta and found 207 bugs  including 24% that were deemed showstoppers.  461 uTesters evaluated Chrome and found 297 bugs  including 12% that were deemed showstoppers.&quot;     The competition and judging for (valid and unknown) bugs has completed and their website said they were reporting back all   bugs to their respective companies. I would just like to know if Google has received the bugs for Google Chrome yet?       </pre>
