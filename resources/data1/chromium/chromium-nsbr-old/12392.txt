<title>Issue 12392 -   chromium -    Find bar's highlighting of initial text shouldn't update PRIMARY X selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When text is selected  but was not explicitly selected by the user  it   should not touch the clipboard. Examples:    - clicking in the omnibox selects the text.  - in the render view  when you navigate to facebook.com  it auto-selects   the contents of the email input box.    In both of these cases the PRIMARY clipboard is claimed  but since the user   didn't explicitly select the text  it shouldn't overwrite what they already   have on the clipboard.    I tested on linux firefox  and this type of thing does not claim the X   clipboard. (For example  tabbing to the search field that is next to the   renderer selects the text  but doesn't touch the clipboard.)    I would categorize the fix as &quot;most likely hard&quot;. </pre>
