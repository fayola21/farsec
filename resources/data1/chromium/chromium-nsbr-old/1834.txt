<title>Issue 1834 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Spell-checker should automatically detect the language to use. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    It would be nice if Chrome checked which language the current website is in   in order to select the language to use for spell-checking and just used the   default setting if the website's language cannot be determined (ie. no HTML   tag or HTTP header available). That way  one would not have to switch back   and forth when writing on different websites. Make an option for it   anyways.   </pre>
