<title>Issue 16766 -   chromium -    Stop button usability issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Load a slow web page  2.Click on Close icon on right side of omnibox      Expect omnibox or window to close.  Instead  the loading  of the slow pafge stops.    Well  that's the bug I would file if somebody hadn't explained  to me that the Close 'X' icon to the right of the omnibox  is a Stop icon.  Boy  y'all fooled me.    Actually what happened is I wanted to stop loading of the  current page  and I looked and looked and couldn't find a   stop button.  I finally had to ask someone who already knew.    Worse  when I tried to use it  it changed to the Go button again  just before I clicked so instead of stopping the page from loading   I loaded it twice!  GAAAH!    So the Stop button is currently a clusterf*ck usability-wise   at least for somebody who hasn't had enough coffee. </pre>
