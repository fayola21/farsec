<title>Issue 9537 -   chromium -    User should not be allowed to have two words for a &lt;keyword&gt; ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12774">r12774</a>).    I remember in olden days may be pre-beta  user is not allowed to have two  words for a search keyword.     I mean for google search engine: if user tries to add two words (say g g )  as a keyword  then I remember the &quot;ok&quot; button on &quot;Edit Search Engine&quot;  dialog was disabled.     But when I checked now  it allows to add two words for a keywords but it  does not enter in to Search UI mode with tab. Screenshot attached.     </pre>
