<title>Issue 12075 -   chromium -    Tab crash with too many feeds on a page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This affects 172.x builds.    <a href="http://www.standaard.be/">http://www.standaard.be/</a> causes a tab crash.    The problem is that the page exposes 52 feeds  and our (unused) feed handling   code hits a NOTREACHED() if the number is more than 50.    I'm just going to remove the feed handling code. </pre>
