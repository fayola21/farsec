<title>Issue 468 -   chromium -    Clicking enter in a form field has a strange behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. create a form with several text inputs  and attach a keypress event to   all text input to catch &quot;Enter&quot;  2. on &quot;Enter&quot;  launch an asynchronous AJAX request. After the AJAX request   has been sent  we display an animated gif to show the user we are waiting   for the server.  3. Once the AJAX request comes back  we immediatly hide the animated gif    then display a new div with information built from the request's result    but in Chrome  this div is never shown and the form is submitted to the   server        The expected result would be first to not submit the form  and at least    to submit the form immediatly  not after the AJAX request has come back!        The form is submitted after the AJAX request has come back (we suspect it   is submitted after the animated gif is hidden).    Please provide
