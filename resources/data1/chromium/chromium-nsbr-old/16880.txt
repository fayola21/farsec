<title>Issue 16880 -   chromium -    set up a web server where project members upload test cases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because this bug tracker does not allow opening an attachment in a browser   without downloading it first  it's not so pleasant to test a html   attachment here.     Moreover  even if it does (unless we use 'data:' url or other machineries)    a multi-file test case (made of html  css  javascript files) cannot be   tested 'in place' unless it's put up somewhere on the web.     So  I'm suggesting that we set up a 'web server' (virtual or physical)   where project members can put test files. Internally  there's such a web   server  but it cannot be accessed externally. And  some project members   including me put up test files on their personal web servers.    In case of a single file test  just changing the behavior of this bug   tracker to allow the in-line opening of a file attached by a project member   would be good and of much less work.         </pre>
