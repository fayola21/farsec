<title>Issue 22706 -   chromium -    Chromium sends If-Modified-Since headers for objects which it has failed to load in the first place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : google-chrome-unstable 4.0.211.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26474">r26474</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : Compiz  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/images/osm_logo.png?">http://www.openstreetmap.org/images/osm_logo.png?</a>  1218150545          1. Browse the web with a lousy internet connection  2. Visit a webpage that includes a PNG image  3. Successfully load the webpage but not the image. At least I'm pretty   sure this is what happened. Maybe the reason is that it got as far as the   HTTP headers before losing the connection?        When Google Chrome fails to load an object *comptetely* it shouldn't send   If-Modified-Since headers on subsequent requests. That's silly.        After failing to load the image Google Chrome will send If-Modified-Since   when I go to the URL for the image and press Shift+Refresh.
