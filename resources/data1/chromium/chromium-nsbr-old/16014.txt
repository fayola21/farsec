<title>Issue 16014 -   chromium -    Seeking in audio/video should be an asynchronous event - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently media::Pipeline assumes seeking is an synchronous event  even   though the individual media filters treat it as an asynchronous event    leading to all sorts of issues.    This is a refactoring task where we introduce a new asynchronous &quot;sync point&quot;   event that allows the entire pipeline to flush their buffers and preroll to a    new sync point  whether it's for initialization or seeking somewhere. </pre>
