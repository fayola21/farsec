<title>Issue 3911 -   chromium -    Dragging the new tab button should create a new tab that is being dragged - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes I want to make a new tab in a new Window. One cool way to do this   would be to allow the new tab button to be dragged just like a normal tab.   Dragging this button would start a normal tab drag with a new tab. </pre>
