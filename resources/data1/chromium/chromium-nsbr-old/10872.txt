<title>Issue 10872 -   chromium -    version.bat uses an internal version of svn - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From src/chrome/tools/build/win/version.bat:    :: Determine the current repository revision number  set PATH=%~dp0........third_partysvn;%PATH%  svn.exe info | grep.exe &quot;Revision:&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2- | sed &quot;s/(.*)/set   LASTCHANGE=1/&quot; &gt;&gt; %VarsBat%  call %VarsBat%    This calls trunk/deps/third-party/svn/svn.exe  which is not the same   version as svn in depot_tools.    Result?    Generating version template file  svn: This client is too old to work with working copy '.'.  You need  to get a newer Subversion client  or to downgrade this working copy.  See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change">http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change</a>  for details.        My preference would be to remove svn from the tree. We require you to use   gclient to pull the tree  so you already have svn in one place. If it's not   in your path  I think it's OK for this step to fail (modify the bat file to   point to your copy of svn).     For most users and the buildbots  svn will be in the path.    So just calling svn.exe means version.bat will use the same version that   gclient used to check out the files.    Any objections to     1. Pulling deps/third_party/svn out of the tree?  2. Changing version.bat to just call 'svn' (expecting it in the path)? </pre>
