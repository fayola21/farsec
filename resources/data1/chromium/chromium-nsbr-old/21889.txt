<title>Issue 21889 -   chromium -    Strange CPU consumption pattern - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0    OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Hard to say the exact cause  sometimes happens after using flash.      When I start up Chrome and load up gmail  corp mail  calendar  and corp   calendar  the CPU usage of chrome in total idles at around 4 or 5%.      One of the chrome processes starts taking 13% cpu and staying there.  It   doesn't seem to be attached to any tab. </pre>
