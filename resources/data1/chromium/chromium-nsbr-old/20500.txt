<title>Issue 20500 -   chromium -    &quot;View full history&quot; link should always be in the same place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the old NTP  the recently closed list was a vertical list where the distance between the first entry and the last entry was always pretty small    In the new NTP  that list is horizontal  -When empty  the &quot;View full history&quot; link will appear in the left part of   the screen  -When full  the &quot;View full history&quot; link will appear in the right side of   the screen    This is pretty far away places to find the exact same link.    For some reason I tend to go to the history page from the NTP  and in the   new NTP I feel like I waste valuable seconds on deciding whether I should   move my cursor to the left or to the right </pre>
