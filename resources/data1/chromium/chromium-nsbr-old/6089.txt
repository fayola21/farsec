<title>Issue 6089 -   chromium -    Once OnDemand update fails with full installer  user can't update unless Chrome is closed and relaunched - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome 1.0.154.39   2. Try to update to 1.0.154.42(using full installer) going to about   box(Wrench &gt; About Google Chrome) and clicking on Update now button  3. Terminate the installer process from Windows Task Manager  4. Click on OK in the about box and open it again.     What is the expected output?   To see the update now button again    What do you see instead?  It checks for updates forever. Closing Chrome will show a zombie.  Restarting Chrome and going to about box shows that there is an update   available.         </pre>
