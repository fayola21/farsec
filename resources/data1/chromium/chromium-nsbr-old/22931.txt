<title>Issue 22931 -   chromium -    OS X: No way to check Hebrew spelling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install the Hebrew spelling service from here: <a href="http://www.mitzpettel.com/software/hspell.php">http://www.mitzpettel.com/software/hspell.php</a>  2. Open Chrome  3. Navigate to a page with a textarea.  4. Try to enable Hebrew spelling (see bellow).  5. type _��__��__��_   (a misspelled Hebrew word) in a text area and press space.      Red underline should appear under _��__��__��_ after pressing space.    Discussion:  The &quot;Spelling-checker&quot; submenu contains a list of languages  none of which are Hebrew.  The only way to select Hebrew is to select &quot;Show Spelling Panel&quot; and select the Hebrew spelling service there.    Unfortunately doing so causes the spelling panel not to work. </pre>
