<title>Issue 17155 -   chromium -    Date() object in javascript not working correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	3.0.193.1 (20697)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://pcki11.farx.ru/sm/k1/cl_test.htm">http://pcki11.farx.ru/sm/k1/cl_test.htm</a>         Opera 9.51: OK           IE 8: OK      1. make a javascript that fetches time from the Date() object  2. move your windows clock back a few minutes        The output of the javascript should reflect the changes on-the-fly.        Time stays the same  like it was not changed.  If you move the windows clock forward  the change is reflected right away.  The sample javascript can be found in the link above  attaching the same   file in case the host will go down =)   </pre>
