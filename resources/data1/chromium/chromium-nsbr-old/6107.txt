<title>Issue 6107 -   chromium -    Right click in a text area selects empty space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When writing a comment in an issue in chromium  for example  and you right   click in front of a word  it takes up all available space between that word   and the word after it. If there is no word after it (and no symbol of any   sort)  it selects the word before the cursor. If there is a symbol after   it  it just selects the symbol. In Firefox  when you right click in the   previously mentioned cases  it doesn't select anything. Google Chrome's   behaviour is extremely annoying and can cause problems. This should be   fixed ASAP. </pre>
