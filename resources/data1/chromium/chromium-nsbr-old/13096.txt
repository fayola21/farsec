<title>Issue 13096 -   chromium -    Support desired_tld in Linux omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.4 (Official Build 17248)      Open a new window  and in the URL bar type gmail&lt;Ctrl-Enter&gt;.  On windows   chrome (and all ff) this takes you to www.gmail.com.  On linux it does a   search for gmail  the same as pressing enter would.    &lt;Shift-Enter&gt; should add www. and .net to the word  and &lt;Ctrl-Shift-Enter&gt;   should add www. and .org.  These all work on Windows Chrome and Firefox.   </pre>
