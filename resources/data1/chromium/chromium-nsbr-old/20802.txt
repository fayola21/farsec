<title>Issue 20802 -   chromium -    keyword search doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> from denis:    my custom keyword search engines seem to have died in 4.0.203.2 ..     For instance  I have a shortcut with 'cs'  so normally i type 'cs hello' and   I go to the custom search page (cs/) which searches for 'hello'. Now I am   taken to the google.com for this search. I just tried adding a different   custom search engine and see the same symptom.   </pre>
