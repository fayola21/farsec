<title>Issue 12276 -   chromium -    Inconsistent checkbox behavior in Hotmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 1.0.154.65  Chrome 2.0.172.28  Chromium 2.0.182.0 (Developer Build 16414)    IE 7/8: OK  FF3: OK  Safari 4: OK        1. Go to Hotmail Inbox.  2. Check the checkboxes  starting at the bottom message on the list.  3. Go up the list  checking the boxes.    What is the expected output?    Checking a checkbox won't uncheck other checkboxes.    What do you see instead?    Checking a checkbox unchecks other checkboxes (like radio buttons  but  inconsistent).  You may have to play around with it a bit to get this to  happen  but it repro's pretty reliably.   </pre>
