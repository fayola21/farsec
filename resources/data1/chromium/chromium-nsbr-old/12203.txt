<title>Issue 12203 -   chromium -    &quot;Location in signature&quot; gmail lab causes gmail to not load its text editor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Enable the above lab.  2) Check the box in the settings page to turn it on.  3) Try to compose an email.    You get stuck in &quot;loading rich text editor...&quot;    It *might* be because we have enough of Gears integrated that we report it's   available but not enough to get this piece to work; the fix *might* be as   easy as disabling Gears harder  but I'm not sure.    CC'ing Amanda as this likely affects Mac as well. </pre>
