<title>Issue 19659 -   chromium -    Need to check if ThemeProvider has changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> brace yourselves  brain dump coming:    there are a number of places in the linux code where we assume the   ThemeProvider won't change. For example  in NineBox  when we get a   BROWSER_THEME_CHANGED notification  we still use the old ThemeProvider* and   just reload new images from it. Glen claims that it is possible for the   ThemeProvider to change  but that we don't do so currently.    BrowserWindowGtk also assumes that the theme provider won't change (and in   fact is shared by the entire process  which seems a fair assumption given   that both a ThemeProvider and the process are tied to a single  unchanging   profile... usually. This isn't the case during testing.) If we do start   switching out theme providers I predict we will break horribly. Hopefully   there will be a notification we can observe called THEME_PROVIDER_CHANGED   or some such. </pre>
