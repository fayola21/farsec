<title>Issue 20118 -   chromium -    Typing a colon (:) into the address bar causes the browser to freeze - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Built from svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24090">revision 24090</a> (according to the   about screen)  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : fluxbox  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested      1. Start Chrome  2. Type a colon into the address bar (e.g.  type &quot;about:&quot;)      The browser should show that colon in the address bar  and perhaps search   the Omnibar database for previous pages which match what has been typed.      The browser does not display the colon  instead freezing. Interestingly    the drop-down showing things which match the current contents of the   Omnibar (in the above example  showing things matching &quot;about&quot;) does not go   away  and in fact remains on the screen even when switching to a different   workspace. Even though Chromium was started on the command line  no error   is produced.    I know this isn't much to go on  but I'd be glad to perform whatever tests   are necessary on my end to figure out what's going on. </pre>
