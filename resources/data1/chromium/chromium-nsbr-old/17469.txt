<title>Issue 17469 -   chromium -    2 problems with extensions auto-update request parameters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When generating the url to do update checks  the code used to do:    v=VERSION&amp;id=ID    at some point I arbitrarily decided id should come first and changed this to    id=IDv=VERSION&amp;    Oops! The &amp; should be between the parameters  not stuck at the end.    The other problem is that the extensions gallery code was expecting a &quot;uc&quot;   parameter to indicate that this is an update check.    </pre>
