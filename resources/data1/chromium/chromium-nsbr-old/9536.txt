<title>Issue 9536 -   chromium -    HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError checks for ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED is one of the errors  on which HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError will call  session_-&gt;proxy_service()-&gt;ReconsiderProxyAfterError().    However  we only call HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError  after host resolution or TCP connect failures.  This means we're not  passing ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED to  HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError.    Should we remove ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED from the switch  statement in HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError   or should we also call HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError  after tunnel connection failure? </pre>
