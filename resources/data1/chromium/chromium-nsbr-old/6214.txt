<title>Issue 6214 -   chromium -    Docking broke drag-and-drop tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  2. Open more than one tab  3. Drag one tab out of the main window.       When dragging tab back to main window  it should drop back between tabs in   said window.        It attempts to drop back in but seems incapable. Other tabs look to move   aside  the isolated tab window flickers  and may or may not expand   depending on where you are on screen when trying to drop it back in to the   main window.      Please provide
