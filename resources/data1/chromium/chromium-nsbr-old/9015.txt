Go to &quot;Google Chrome Options -&gt; Minor Tweaks -&gt; Change font and language   settings -&gt; languages&quot;  3. Observe string &quot;Change the language used in Google Chrome menus  dialog   boxes  and tooltips.&quot;    Result:  After translated to Arabic  the string is longer  so the text is showing   with ellipsis  but string &quot;Google Chrome&quot; is broken  it shows as &quot;Google C&quot;   with ellipsis    Expected:  Hmm  I think it is fine we show ellipsis for long text  but &quot;Google Chrome&quot;   is a brand name  so probably it is better don't break it?
