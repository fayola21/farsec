<title>Issue 14936 -   chromium -    Define manifest format for NPAPI across platforms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Extensions can currently include NPAPI plugins. Once Chrome runs on  Mac/Linux  extensions will have to include several versions of their NPAPI  plugins. This is probably already the case for Windows XP vs. Vista.    We need to change the manifest format for NPAPI plugins to allow defining  different plugin versions for different OS flavors. </pre>
