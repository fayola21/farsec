<title>Issue 15719 -   chromium -    Win32Socket::Send in v8 should have better protections against negative byte lengths - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Win32Socket::Send in src/v8/src/platform-win32.cc should probably check that   len is negative since some platforms apparently interpret the length as an   unsigned.    Either that  or callers should ensure they're not passing in a negative   number.
