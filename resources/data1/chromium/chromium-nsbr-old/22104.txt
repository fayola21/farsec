<title>Issue 22104 -   chromium -    File input loose value when trying to overwrite a value  but the process is canceled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0  OS + version : Linux Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture 32-bit  window manager : gnome    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works as expected        1. Go to a URL that has a form with a input file field  2. Select any file from the disc  clicking on the &quot;Choose file&quot; button  3. Note that the file name appears instead of previous &quot;No file chosen&quot;   text  4. Click on &quot;Choose file&quot; again  5. On the File Upload window press &quot;Cancel&quot; button      My expected result is to still have previous selected file in the input   field      Previous file is not selected anymore  and &quot;No file chosen&quot; text appears   beside the input file again     </pre>
