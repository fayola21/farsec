<title>Issue 4826 -   chromium -    webkit/port/platform/image-decoders should be merged back upstream - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have our own copies of the files in WebCore/platform/image-decoders that   we've modified.  Dimitri and I spent a while looking at these and concluded   that eventually we should get back to a state where we're using the   upstream versions of these.  Tasks involved:    * Merge some changes/fixes upstream as-is -- e.g. Vector&lt;char&gt; -&gt;   SharedBuffer (probably)  using oracle functions instead of member variables   in a few places  setting m_failed more appropriately  etc.  * Abstract the backend-specific image storage class that for now lives as   RGBA32Buffer (but means different things to us versus Cairo).  * Convert directly memory-twiddling in decoders to use above abstraction   layer.  Need to be careful not to lose performance while doing this.  Side   benefit: Cairo will get our BMP/ICO decoders for free.   </pre>
