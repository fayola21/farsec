<title>Issue 1133 -   chromium -    Chrome suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Beta version  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.funender.com/finalfantasy/forums/here-">http://www.funender.com/finalfantasy/forums/here-</a>  vp739280.html#739280  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE        Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.    I couldn't find a section to post suggestions so hopefully this message   will go to the right people.  I noticed in chrome that when you try to   edit an existing textarea field  the text is overwritten instead of   inserted.  I noticed the mousewhell button is used to click links but it   would be great if we could configure its function such as calling up the   autoscroll arrows.  It would be great if they add a &quot;remove this site&quot;   button on the history page so you can easily remove sites one by one.   Thanks for your time :)  </pre>
