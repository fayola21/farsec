<title>Issue 10058 -   chromium -    external gmail compose windows don't close after sending - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version: 2.0.173.1    Not sure if this is a gmail or chrome bug  but I now see the following bug   a few times per day:    1. click reply to an existing message in gmail  2. click the little icon that pops it out in to a separate window  3. finishing the response  4. click send    At this point nothing will appear to happen -- the message will still be in   the external window -- but gmail will have actually sent the message.   Clicking send again will also result in nothing happening.   </pre>
