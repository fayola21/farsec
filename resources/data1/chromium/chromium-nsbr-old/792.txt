<title>Issue 792 -   chromium -    TRACKING: Chrome does not implement the Webkit 10ms setTimeout clamp. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Some have noticed that Chrome does not implement the 10ms setTimeout clamp.    This is particularly noticeable when you run this test:      <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/analyzing-timer-performance/">http://ejohn.org/blog/analyzing-timer-performance/</a>    A few notes:  A setTimeout clamp can help avoid browser un-responsiveness for some   browsers.  Some browsers may be unable to service UI events if the JS code   is allowed to spin.  Chrome is less vulnerable to this due to separation of   browser and renderer.    A setTimeout clamp is like the old PC's &quot;Turbo button&quot; to change it from   66MHz to 33MHz.  This button was provided for compatibility with legacy   apps that were hard coded to render based on the speed of the clock.  Some   websites may depend on the 10ms clamp in order to paint properly; however   this comes at the expense of any other applications which want a faster   clock.    This bug is for tracking any websites which have CPU spinning due to   Chrome's fast timers.  We'd like to converge on a common answer for both   webkit and chrome timer behavior if possible.     </pre>
