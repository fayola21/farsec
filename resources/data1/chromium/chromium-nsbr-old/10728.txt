<title>Issue 10728 -   chromium -    Organize History - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Official Build 13645)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.         Safari 4: n/a    Firefox 3.x: THERE IS NO           IE 7: IDEM           IE 8: IDEM    First  it is necessary to clarify it is not a bug report  but a valuable   suggestion.    1. Open the History's page (Ctrl+H);  2. The URLs accessed are bad organized. They are simply placed one after   the other;  3. The history should be organized as the &quot;Web History&quot; offered to all   users who have a Google account.      The Chrome team could use the design and technology of &quot;Web History&quot; that   screenshot example is attached. Your organization is very practical because   we can easy delete the items and easy access to desired dates and trends. Could add the &quot;trends&quot; and &quot;interesting items&quot;  adapting the technology   already available in the &quot;Google Web History&quot;.   IT WOULD BE A STEP AHEAD OF OTHER BROWSERS.      Instead  the only practice that is existing in the search. But even the   exclusion items or search for a specific date is messy.    Run  before they copied this idea!  Anyway  good work to all! </pre>
