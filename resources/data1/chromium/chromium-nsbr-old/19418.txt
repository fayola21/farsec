<title>Issue 19418 -   chromium -    Tabstrip doesn't update when switching between the maximized windows of Chrome and Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This happens to me a lot.  I have both chrome dev channel build and some ToT chromium build opened and   maximized.    After using chrome for a while I switch to the chromium window using a   mouse click on the taskbar    often enough to happen about once a day  I see the tabstrip of chrome on   the chromium window.      using windows xp and chrome 3.0.197.11  but this isn't new  happening for months already    might be related to <a title="Alt+Tabbing away from Chrome occasionally leaves parts of Chrome window still visible"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18825">Issue 18825</a> </pre>
