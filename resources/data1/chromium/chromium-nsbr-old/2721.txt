<title>Issue 2721 -   chromium -    Pass CSS encoding determination tests at w3.org - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> see &lt;b1316854&gt;    <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-encoding-detection-6">http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-encoding-detection-6</a>    has 10 test cases on the encoding determination of CSS stylesheets.    I have an issue with case 5  but others we have to pass. I'm aware that  Webkit's CSS pageloading code already takes care of many of them (if not all).  (at least  webkit is better than IE7). Somehow  w3.org server is rather  slow at the moment and I haven't tested them all.      If there's a failure  we have to report upstream and fix Webkit.    </pre>
