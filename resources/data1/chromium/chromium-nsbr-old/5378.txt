<title>Issue 5378 -   chromium -    Regression: Maximized Chrome window sometimes resizes to leave empty space along taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Occasionally when switching back and forth between my maximized Chrome   window  it will become resized so that there is a gap between it and the   task bar.  This gap is about the size of the task bar.  Unlocking the task   bar usually fixes the issue.  See screenshot.    Note: I have the task bar oriented vertically along the left-hand side of   my monitor.  My monitor is oriented in portrait mode.    This doesn't happen with 0.4.154.29  so I'm marking it as a regression.
