<title>Issue 7523 -   chromium -    Windows unable to hibernate when chrome is running (not always repeatable) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use Chrome to open some web pages  let it run for a while.  2. Try to hibernate windows.      Windows should go hibernate regardless Chrome is running.      Windows doesn't go hibernation.  If I close all chrome windows (and use task manager to kill all chrome   processes if necessary).  Windows will start to hibernate.    **NOTE**  This bug is not always repeatable.  Generally  the more chrome windows are   opened and the longer time chrome has been running  the higher chances that   Windows refuses to hibernate.  There is a similar bug related to this as I noticed when using Thinkpad   dock station.  When the chrome is running (for a long time)  and I put the   thinkpad onto the dock  windows can't notice it's being docked  the LED   indicator on the dock doesn't change to docked state (State 1).  And   windows can't detect the LAN cable connected to the dockstation.    I know this bug may be related to other peripheral and/or software defeats.    But it's great that you can help to take a look.    Please provide
