<title>Issue 21603 -   chromium -    Adjust update-alternatives priority so we can become default x-www-browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Ubuntu 8.04  we have the following priorities:  /usr/bin/konqueror 100  /usr/bin/seamonkey 80  /usr/bin/firefox-3.0 40  /usr/bin/firefox-2 30    PPA chromium-browser installs at 40.  We currently install at 10.  I think 10 is probably no longer what we want  but it's not at all clear   what it *should* be. </pre>
