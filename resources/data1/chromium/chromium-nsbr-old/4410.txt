<title>Issue 4410 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: http://ads.youtube.com doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ** Repro **  1. Goto <a href="https://ads.youtube.com/">https://ads.youtube.com/</a>  2. Click on &quot;How does it work?&quot;  3. In recent builds of chromium nothing happens (get a javascript error).  Same thing happens in nightly Safari builds  so it is probably something   that changed in WebKit.    ** Tested using **  - Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5105">r5105</a>  - Webkit nightly WinXp <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38240">r38240</a> </pre>
