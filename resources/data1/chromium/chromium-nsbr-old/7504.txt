<title>Issue 7504 -   chromium -    Feature request: Need &quot;display image&quot; option in right click menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now  if you right click on an image in Chrome  there are options like &quot;open   picture in new tab&quot;  &quot;copy image&quot; and so on. There needs to be another   option: &quot;display image&quot;. It is useful when the server is too slow or there   are too many images on the page that the images don't all load properly.   One can choose &quot;display image&quot; to try to load/reload the image. All other   major browsers such as IE  Firefox has this option. Chrome should have it    too. Many thanks to your developers. </pre>
