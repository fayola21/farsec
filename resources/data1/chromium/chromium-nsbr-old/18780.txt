<title>Issue 18780 -   chromium -    Need different bookmark bar rendering on new tab page for &quot;don't always show&quot; state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  the bookmark bar is rendered with rounded corners on the new tab   page if you don't have it set to always show.  There's also a fancy   animation to transition between the two states.  It would be nice to match   the rounded corners so it's clear to the user if &quot;always show bookmarks&quot; is   enabled or not. </pre>
