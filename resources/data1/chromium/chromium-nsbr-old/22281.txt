<title>Issue 22281 -   chromium -    'Clear browsing data' button should gain keyboard focus on lunch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26565">r26565</a>)    -Ctrl+Shift+Delete to Clear Browsing data.    Notice keyboard is no where after the dialog is launched.    Expected:  Clear browsing data button should gain keyboard focus after launching the dlg.     I know  it's a minor  but a regression  so bumping. </pre>
