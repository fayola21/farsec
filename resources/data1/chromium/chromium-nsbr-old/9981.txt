<title>Issue 9981 -   chromium -    Drag and drop of download causes renderer hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Download an invalid ttf file in chrome. Drag it from the shelf to the  windows fonts control panel.  Windows brings up dialog about  installing as well as a &quot;error installing font&quot; modal dialog.  As long  as that dialog is up  Chrome is partially hung: renderers don't  repaint  nor does the text of the url bar  but the rest of the ui  does.  Right-clicking on its task bar entry causes it to repaint but  still be hung in the same way.    Idle speculation: the drag and drop is running nested message loop   and we don't expect it?  Tony mentioned something about explicitly  needing to set the &quot;allow recursive message loops&quot; thingy when  dragging from web contents.    If this only affects fonts  then I don't think we care too much.  It would   be interesting to see if it repros for other drop targets. </pre>
