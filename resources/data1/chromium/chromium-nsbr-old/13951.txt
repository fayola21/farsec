<title>Issue 13951 -   chromium -    Pages containing applets seem to be loaded twice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31    <a href="http://www.microcosm.co.uk/dwebtest/test/sessiontest.php?email=xxx@xxx.com">http://www.microcosm.co.uk/dwebtest/test/sessiontest.php?email=xxx@xxx.com</a>            Safari 4: OK  Firefox 3.0.10: OK      Opera 9.64: OK            IE 6: OK            IE 7: OK            IE 8: OK        1. Go to the above URL and enter your email address instead of xxx@xxx.com  2. The page will load and you'll see a Java applet load too which displays   &quot;Hello there!&quot;          You should get one email containing the randomly created session ID along   with a time stamp when the email was sent from the server.          You get TWO emails each with a different session ID and a time stamp 1-2   seconds different; therefore I believe the page is being loaded twice. If   you remove the applet from the page it works find and only loads once. </pre>
