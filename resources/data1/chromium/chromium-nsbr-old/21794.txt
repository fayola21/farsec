<title>Issue 21794 -   chromium -    Reduce checkout time for tester buildbots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Testing buildbots don't need to check out everything. Give them custom   .gclient files that only have what they need  to speed checkout.    Maintainability may be problematic (the need to add files to the .gclient   each time a new type of test is added). </pre>
