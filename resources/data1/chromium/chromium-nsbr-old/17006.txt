<title>Issue 17006 -   chromium -    Can't rename bookmarks on the bookmark bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a bunch of bookmarks on my bookmark bar  all with fairly similar   names because of the page titles. However  I can't edit them in any way in the   UI  nor can I edit the bookmark file because of the checksum. Greatly reduces   the usefulness as well as making me hit the wrong URL more often than not.    How about a sheet for editing just the title in the short term? </pre>
