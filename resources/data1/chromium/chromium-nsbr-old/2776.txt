<title>Issue 2776 -   chromium -    IDNs show in punycode for accept-languages Chrome is not localized to - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1292367&gt;     Even though a user may set something like Belarusian as an accept-language   unless that language is one of the languages Chrome is localized to  we do  not include the ICU locale data for that language  and hence that  accept-language setting has no effect on determining whether to show IDNs  in punycode or not.   </pre>
