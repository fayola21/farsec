<title>Issue 10486 -   chromium -    Add histogramming data for http prioritization - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to analyze the effects of http prioritization.  Get some histogram   data for the transaction latency of certain http requests.  Ideally  we'd   target the PageTransition::LINK frame/subframe requests  since this   optimization should mainly be helping when you click on a link while the   page is already loading. </pre>
