<title>Issue 23080 -   chromium -    right click on anchor and open in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)  URLs (if applicable) : any           Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Right click on any ANCHOR/LINK  2. choose &quot;Open link in new tab&quot;      It should open the link in new tab first time you click on that menu.       I need to click (left) few times before it accepts mouse click  or close   that context menu and right click again to make it to work. This does not happens every time.        </pre>
