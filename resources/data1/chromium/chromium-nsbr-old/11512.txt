<title>Issue 11512 -   chromium -    HTTP auth dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to bring up a username/password dialog when a site needs HTTP auth.    Be sure to consult the behavior on Windows to get this right.  For example    the dialog needs to not be modal -- it should only cover the tab.    One UI idea is just to center it over the tab contents  rather than open the   &quot;what should the window border and dragging behavior be&quot;.  You could also   imagine it hanging off the top of the page like the find bar. </pre>
