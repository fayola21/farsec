<title>Issue 13688 -   chromium -    New Tab button disappears (gets pushed) off to the right when resizing browser beyond 2000 pixels in width - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use dual monitor setup that exceeds 2300 pixels at least (might be less   or more  not sure). I have dual 24&quot; that each are 1920 wide.  2. Make the Chrome browser window almost the size of a full single screen   (on the left screen)  3. Open at least 15 tabs (can occur w/ less  but easiest to see w/ 15 or   more)  Expand the right side of the window into the 2nd screen/monitor and you   will see a point where the width of each tab is increasing but quicker than   it should to where the right side of the farthest tab &amp; the &quot;+&quot; sign for a   new tab is pushed off the visible browser window.      '+' for opening a new tab &amp; close 'x' for the last tab should remain   visible at all browser window widths (accounting for large multi-monitor   setups) &amp; supported # of tabs.      The '+' button disappears off the visible browser window    <b>Please provide
