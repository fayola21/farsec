<title>Issue 9152 -   chromium -    Feature request: Allow &quot;close window&quot; to behave like &quot;close tab&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: none    The paradigm of Google Chrome appears to be that the tab  not the window    is the atomic element of the browsing experience.  Tabs can be moved   between windows  and windows can be separated and combined.  New users can   come away with the impression that these windows simply act to organize or   group these tabs  rather than constraining them.  In my opinion  this is a   perspective to encourage  not inhibit.    With this in mind  it would be useful to provide an option allowing the   &quot;close window&quot; functionality (e.g. clicking the red X) to instead close   only the active tab.  This would more closely match the expectations of   users accustomed to working with non-tabbed  multi-window interfaces  and   gels the notion of the window as an organizer rather than a controller.    Keyboard shortcuts and menu options can remain unaffected  so power users   would still be able to do things quickly.    As an additional benefit  this provides a non-modal method to resolve <a title="Feature request: Display confirmation dialog when closing Chrome with more than one active tab" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1820"> issue   1820 </a>.  Accidentally clicking the close button would not bring down the   entire window. </pre>
