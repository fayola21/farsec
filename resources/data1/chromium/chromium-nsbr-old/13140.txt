<title>Issue 13140 -   chromium -    OSX: Windows can be resized without upper limit. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.4  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works      1. Open the broswer  2. Grab by the corner to resize  3. Move the mouse pointer past the screen boundaries (right and bottom)       The windows should resize (following the pointer) but its   vertical/horizontal size should stop increase when the mouse pointer   reaches the bottom/right edge of the screen.      The mouse pointer doesn't go past the edge of the screen but the window   continues being resized. Amongst other issues  this yields to a situation   where the resize corner of the window cannot be reached.  An easy way to visualize the issue is to open a page whose content   dynamically resize itself horizontally without limits (like the chromium bug   listing page) and attempt to resize is wildly horizontally.   </pre>
