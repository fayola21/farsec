<title>Issue 18888 -   chromium -    Drag instead of selecting (skips mouse button release before movement) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. (specially) when lots of tabs are loaded/processor is in full use.  2. click and release the mouse button to select a different tab and move   the mouse to any direction after that.      The tab should be selected  just it.      Chrome selects the tab  but instead of getting the mouse button release   before the mouse movement  it &quot;drags&quot; the tab  resulting in a very annoying   behavior that re-orders the tab or creates a new windows when the user is   just selecting a tab.    The bug is present since the first Chrome public release.  It probably happens because of the way Chrome handle clicks in the tab bar   and doesn't really register the mouse button release before the mouse   movement when it's busy rendering the new selected page. Should not be   something hard to fix. (probably easier to spot this bug with several tabs   and old PCs or laptops  but still happening in more powerful ones when   rendering  several tabs open or even when selecting tab that is allocated   in virtual memory.) </pre>
