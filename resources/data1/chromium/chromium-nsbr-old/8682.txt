<title>Issue 8682 -   chromium -    At joins.co.kr and zillow.com  layout around text field is broken because 'display: none' for legend is ignored.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to <a href="http://www.joins.co.kr">http://www.joins.co.kr</a>   2. The search box at the top of the page (just below 'Jo!ns' logo) is   misplaced.     Firefox 3.0 on Win : It's even worse than Chrome  Safari 4beta with webkit trunk on Mac : ok  Opera/IE 7 on Windows : Ok    The other issue at the front page is that one of flash ads cannot be   closed. Firefox  Opera and Safari have the same issue. In IE7  that   particular flash ad does not come up at all. (I thought I had filed a bug   about this issue before  but I couldn't find it).     The layout at <a href="http://news.joins.com/article/3527008.html?ctg=1000">http://news.joins.com/article/3527008.html?ctg=1000</a>   is even more broken in Chrome  but ok in Firefox3.     We may have to split this into 3 or more bugs because they're likely to   have different causes.       joins.co.kr is the web site of one of the most popular newspapers in Korea.  </pre>
