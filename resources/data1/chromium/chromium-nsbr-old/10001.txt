<title>Issue 10001 -   chromium -    Chrome forgot my Download location preference? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Downloaded a .csv file from my Gmail account  2. Instead of saving to the expected location  it saves to a newly created   folder in My Documents.        Chrome appears to have forgotten my Preferences related to downloads.    Chrome used to save downloads to a folder I created on my Desktop; suddenly   tonight  it started saving to a newly created Downloads folder in My   Documents.        Instead of downloading to my Desktop/chromedl folder like it has been    Chrome started automatically saving my downloads to this seemingly newly   created folder in My Documents (My Documents/Downloads). My   Documents/Downloads is the path identified in Preferences  but I did not go   in there and change it myself.  Is this intentional? I was a bit puzzled   when I couldn't find my downloaded files...Is this due to some kind of   update Chrome did in the background?      <b>Please provide
