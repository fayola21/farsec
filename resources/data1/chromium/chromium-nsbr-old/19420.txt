<title>Issue 19420 -   chromium -    Mouse gestures to increase and decrease font/layout size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1    OS version               : 10.5.7            1. enter in any website you wish;  2. try to resize the font size using the famous to fingers movement over   the trackpad;        Resize the font/layout size. As we know in native Apple OSX applications    livre Preview.          Nothing. I tried to figure out what's missing in source code and rapidly I   verified that actually we don't have any event handlers to manage it.   </pre>
