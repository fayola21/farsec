<title>Issue 6022 -   chromium -    Windows title bar elements showing through - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 1.0.156.0 (Developer Build 7554)    Finding reliable repro steps has been elusive  but the following works  consistently for me:    Note that the Chrome window title bar must be COMPLETELY covered  then  uncovered  and the window maximized to put Chrome into the state where this  problem starts to occur.    Repro  -----  1. Cover Chrome window title bar completely with another window.  2. Drag other window off to uncover Chrome window.  3. Double-click on title bar to maximize.  4. When maximized  single-click on title bar.    Note Windows title bar elements showing through.    5. Double-click on title bar to restore.  6. When restored  single-click on title bar.    Again  note Windows title bar elements still showing through.    ==============    There have been a few similar bugs filed.  I believe that all of the cases  have been covered  except for this last corner case.    I think that <a title="standard window controls and grey line rendered when right clicking on caption area" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3264"> issue 3264 </a>  <a title="Title Bar is not painted well  If the top level window is minimized" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2456"> issue 2456 </a>  and <a title="[magic_browzR] Windows title shows through on Title Bar when New Tab opened" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4042"> issue 4042 </a> are different cases.  <a title="default windows maximize/restore button shows through" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=133"> Issue 133 </a> is similar and could be the same case.   </pre>
