<title>Issue 18635 -   chromium -    in %temp% there are some folders called Chrome_[number]. Why are they not deleted? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Go to %temp% (folder)  2. Notice the folders called Chrome_[NumberBetween1000and99999]      I guess these files are temporary files used by chrome's update mechanism.   Why aren't they deleted automatically? I have deleted my full %temp% folder   8 days ago  and now already I have 6 of these folders with files between   the 750 B and the 1 MB large.     OS: Vista </pre>
