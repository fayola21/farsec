<title>Issue 11321 -   chromium -    Allow user to set global default page zoom level  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This comes from <a title="should only have one font-size preference  instead of one for normal text and one for monospace text"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10524">issue 10524</a>.     Now that we have a full-page zoom  it might be a good idea to have a   preference for the default zoom level for a11y (and other concerns).      </pre>
