<title>Issue 18762 -   chromium -    Find-in bar does not work with prepopulated search term. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works - finds next term  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):  works - finds next term  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:  works - finds next term      1. Go to any URL (example <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/</a> )  2. Cmd-F  enter a term (example &quot;beta&quot;)  3. Click the right arrow icon in the find bar (find next). This time it  works as expected.  4. Next  click a link to another page.  5. Cmd-F  and without changing the search term  click the right arrow icon  in the find bar (find next)      Clicking the right arrow icon in the find bar (find next) should highlight  the first occurrence of the search term on the page.      The click does not activate the button in the find bar  rather it clicks  the HTML document underneath. If there happens to be a link in the  upper-right corner  that link is clicked  and you go to a new page. </pre>
