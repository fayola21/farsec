<title>Issue 402 -   chromium -    unclickable links  Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> small thing i noticed when browsing (the new) facebook. Im not neither   technical or good in english so ill try to explain as simple as i can. in   the bottom of facebook you have a bar and to the very right on that bar   there is a icon called chat. clicking on this gives you option to go online   or offlnie on chat  change status and so on.. well  to say it simple  the   windows appears but the links there does not click at all. i also noticed   this with several applications on facebook  the links just become useless   for some reason  ie the game&quot;Dope Wars&quot; was impossible to play  no link   worked       </pre>
