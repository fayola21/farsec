<title>Issue 21847 -   chromium -    Canvas drawn with data URL image raises SECURITY_ERR when toDataUrl() called. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1 (Official Build 25376)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/briantclee/canvas.html">http://members.shaw.ca/briantclee/canvas.html</a>           Safari 4: FAIL.     Firefox 3.x: OK       Opera 10: OK           IE 7: FAIL. Canvas not supported.           IE 8: FAIL. Canvas not supported.        1. Have a webpage:     1. Create an Image from a data URL.     2. Create a canvas.     3. Draw the image to the canvas.     4. Call canvas.toDataURL().  2. Launch the webpage.        toDataURL() returns a data URL for the image drawn to the canvas.      Error in the console: &quot;Uncaught Error: SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18&quot;.     Drawing from an image with source being a data URL seems to set the  origin-clean flag false. I don't think this should be although it doesn't  explicitly mention this in  <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html</a>       </pre>
