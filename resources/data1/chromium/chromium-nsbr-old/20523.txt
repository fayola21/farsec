<title>Issue 20523 -   chromium -    try making the info bubble a POPUP rather than a TOPLEVEL window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The info bubbles are currently a TOPLEVEL gtk window.  From the commit    here are some tradeoffs:    This ended up being implemented as a toplevel instead of a popup  to handle things like virtual desktop switching.  I imagine there are some other   problems we might hit  like the window getting decorated  etc.  Although I   think the shape mask might prevent decorations from being visible.    --    It turns out that ion3 still shows a window decoration and metacity/compiz   show an entry in the task bar for info bubble.  There's also a bug where   moving the window causes the info bubble to stay open in the old position   (closes on windows).    derat suggested making it a popup and hiding the bubble on configure events   (map/unmap  move)  I think. </pre>
