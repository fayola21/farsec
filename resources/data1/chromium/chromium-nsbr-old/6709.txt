<title>Issue 6709 -   chromium -    URL sometimes not updated after HTTP redirect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs                 : <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2tx">http://tinyurl.com/2tx</a>      Enter a URL that will result in an HTTP redirection.      The URL in the address bar changes to that of the destination page.      The originally requested URL remains (as far as the address bar and   bookmarking system are concerned).  The new destination page is rendered   properly.  Entering &quot;document.location.href&quot; in the js console shows the   new  correct URL.    I think I've only seen this behaviour after requesting the original URL   multiple times in the same tab.  Once the bug's triggered  the bad URL   stays put no matter how many times you try again  unless you reset it by   visiting something else.    Put the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2tx">http://tinyurl.com/2tx</a> example in your bookmarks toolbar and click   it a few times  at varying intervals.   :-) </pre>
