<title>Issue 5906 -   chromium -    chrome can't find the network - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Louis:    version 1.0.154.36    Attached a screenshot. Happens more often lately. Chrome times out on Web   pages (after about a minute or so)  but connectivity seems fine for all   other apps.    After Chrome times out  a reload on the tab typically gets the page back.   Very annoying. Let me know what other information you want to get.     </pre>
