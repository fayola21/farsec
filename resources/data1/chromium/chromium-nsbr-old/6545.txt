<title>Issue 6545 -   chromium -    Tabstrips are weird with drag and drop on Trunk. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk: 2.0.157.0 (Developer Build 8179)    -Create 4 or 5 tabs.  -Drag and hold a tab below the address bar and drop it back to its original  location (PLS don't create a new window.)  -Repeat step2 for few times.    For how many times you repeat the step2  that much small are your Tabstrips  and that much far away of your + button( New Tab) from tabstrips.    Screenshot attached.       </pre>
