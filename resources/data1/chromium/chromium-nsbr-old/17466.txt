<title>Issue 17466 -   chromium -    [Linux] Double clicking on calendar's next button advances three months - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to calendar.google.com  2. Double click on the &quot;next&quot; button (rapidly).        Calendar advances by three months instead of two  skipping the second. It's   like the second click of the double click is counted twice. Same thing   happens with previous button.    (linux only) </pre>
