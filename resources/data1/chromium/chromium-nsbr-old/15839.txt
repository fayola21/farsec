<title>Issue 15839 -   chromium -    Reopen tabs after closing unexpectedly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the app crashes  we should behave like WinChrome and re-open the tabs  that were open at crash time. Lots of folks have requested this.    Not sure how win restores the session. Is there UI? An infobar?    This is related to <a title="Implement restart-on-crash functionality on OS X" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9231"> bug 9231 </a>. </pre>
