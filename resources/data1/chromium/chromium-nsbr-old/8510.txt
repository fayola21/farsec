<title>Issue 8510 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] Prevent script execution easily using user scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0        Using user scripts  it is currently impossible to prevent a Javascript from  being executed because as the page loads  it is executed. Opera has added a  feature to their user script framework to watch Javascripts and to  intercept them before they are run. Here is how it looks like:    window.opera.addEventListener ('BeforeScript' function (e) {if  (e.element.src.match (/ad-server/) || e.element.text.match  (/http://ad./)) e.preventDefault ();}  false);    It allows you to select all javascripts that match specific sources or  content and to abort execution using the preventDefault() method. This  feature is very handy to stop some nasty scripts if you want to use user  scripts. More info here:  <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/userjs/examples/">http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/userjs/examples/</a>  What I would like is the same feature in Chrome's user scripts implementation.  Thanks. </pre>
