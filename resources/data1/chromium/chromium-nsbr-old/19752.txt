<title>Issue 19752 -   chromium -    stopping the syncer thread can take a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you Stop Syncing (or in the wizard case  dismiss the dialog) after   authentication has succeeded but before initial_sync_ended  the UI becomes   hung for ~8 seconds. The block occurs courtesy of the pthread_cond_wait in   SyncerThread::Stop. I'm not sure what's causing this hang up.     </pre>
