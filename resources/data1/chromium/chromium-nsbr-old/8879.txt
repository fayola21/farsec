<title>Issue 8879 -   chromium -    Make a way for perf tests to specify different reference builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we change the automation IPC  we currently have to re-baseline all the  perf tests  because we change testing executables.  Instead  we should let  each test specify the reference build it wants to use  and save both the  test executable and the tested app to run each time. </pre>
