<title>Issue 5220 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager and bookmark timestamps  sort  and more... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create one or more bookmarks  2. Open Bookmark Manager   3. PROBLEM: there are no timestamps listed for bookmarks shown in the   Bookmark Manager and timestamps are a very important part of user bookmark   management  4. PROBLEM: if you drag one of the bookmarks to your Desktop (or another   Windows folder)  the timestamp of the dragged shortcut is UNKNOWN (Windows   XP will give it the current time; to see that the timestamp is UNKNOWN try   dragging the bookmark to the Desktop a second time and look at the   information Windows XP provides when it asks if you want to overwrite the   Desktop bookmark)  5. PROBLEM: if you CTRL-select MULTIPLE bookmarks in the Bookmark Manager   and try to drag them as a group to your Desktop (or another Windows   folder)  you cannot; it appears dragging only one bookmark at a time is   allowed; it would be very useful to be able to drag out a group of selected   bookmarks.        Timestamps are a very important part of user bookmark management and should   be shown in the Bookmark Manager and kept when Bookmarks are dragged to the   Desktop or other locations (e.g. Windows Desktop folder  Windows Favorite   folder  etc.)        Timestamps are not shown and not associated with bookmarks in the Bookmark   Manager.    Please provide
