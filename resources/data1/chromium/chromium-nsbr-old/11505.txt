<title>Issue 11505 -   chromium -    Tabbing is broken on SSL error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on 2.0.172.18 and ToT.    -Make sure you have thumbnails in NTP  -Navigate to any SSL error page.  -Do tabbing to on the page.    Expected:  Buttons and link on SSL error page should get keyboard focus.    Result:  Thumbnails and links in NTP will get keyboard focus (to notice this  hit  return key after step 3).  This is weird. </pre>
