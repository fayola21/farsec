<title>Issue 1677 -   chromium -    FEATURE: Improve Spell-check plus &quot;No Suggestion&quot; display. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Improve spellcheck within Chrome. Many words that are figured out with   Gmail or Firefox's Auto-checker are not figured out with Chrome  such as especelly.    Furthermore  when Chrome does not have any suggestions for mis-spelled   words  perhaps include a &quot;No Suggestion&quot; grayed-out option  where the   suggestions usually appear... for clarification.  Or a simple &quot;search&quot; this   word (if no suggestions are found)... where the search engine  such as   google  usually can figure out what you really are searching for.    Finally  when right-clicking a word  Chrome highlights the word  and the   space behind it  if there is one. Why highlight the space as well  we are   just spell checking the word  so just highlight the word alone. </pre>
