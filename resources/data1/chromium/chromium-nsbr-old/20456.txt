<title>Issue 20456 -   chromium -    It takes very long time to clear out the browsing data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : stable build (e.g. 2.0.172.43) and latest trunk        1. Use Chrome for a little long time  maybe one month  2. Try to clear browsing data by using chrome's menu/button      The operation should be done soon      The operation takes really long time. Last night it took me about 10  minutes to finish  while I did previous clearing operation two months  before. I've experienced this for several times. My home laptop is Vista 64bit.    I also often experience this on my working machine  my working machine is  xp sp2.   </pre>
