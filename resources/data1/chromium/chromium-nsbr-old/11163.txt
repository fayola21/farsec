<title>Issue 11163 -   chromium -    encoding of ed2k's links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install an emule/edonkey client.  2. Open the URL and click any link of file on the page to begin a download.   Typically  the emule/edonkey client is launched automatically.        The ed2k's link is added to the emule/edonkey client  and the download   begins.  (for example  the link is  ed2k://|file|%5B%E5%88%AB%E5%AF%B9%E6%88%91%E6%92%92%E8%B0%8E.%E7%AC%AC%E4%  B8%80%E5%AD%A3%5D.Lie.to.Me.S01E01.Pilot.HDTV.XviD-  2HD.avi|365401378|dcc12d0bcd496a4db1efbf3a37aa8f1a|/)      The link is encoded in another way and thus the emule/edonkey client fails  to recognize it.  (for example  the link above is encoded as  ed2k://xn--%7Cfile%7C[-p28rw33h92rzsi228n.xn--]-  zn6a714b534a.lie.to.me.s01e01.pilot.hdtv.xvid-  2hd.avi%7C365401378%7Cdcc12d0bcd496a4db1efbf3a37aa8f1a%7C/)    Further  the capitals are not kept.      <b>Please provide
