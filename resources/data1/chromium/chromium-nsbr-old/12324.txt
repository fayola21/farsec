<title>Issue 12324 -   chromium -    Mac: Popup shows tiny before resizing when you start typing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to omnibox and start typing.  You'll see an initial very short popup which basically looks like a   dithered gray  followed by the full thing.    Marking this MacDev because it may not just be a visual glitch.  How it happens is that on the first   pass the popup has empty bounds so the calculations to figure out the right size are wrong.  But   intercell spacing causes the incorrect &quot;right size&quot; to be non-empty  so on the second pass it gets   things right.  So the fact that it quickly fixes itself is a side effect of async autocomplete providers   delivering  so there might be cases where the first incorrect size sticks. </pre>
