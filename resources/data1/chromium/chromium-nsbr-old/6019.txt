<title>Issue 6019 -   chromium -    Crash while clicking on Other bookmarks folder with dcheck - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.42 (Official Build 7335)    I don't have the stack trace handy  to make sure it is not a dupe of any  existing crashes. I  will update the bug with stack trace  once it is  available on Crash server.       1. Launch Chrome with --enable-dcheck  2. Click on Other Bookmarks folder on the bookmarks bar.    Chrome will crash.    Report ID: d0d457b9cd2722c7   </pre>
