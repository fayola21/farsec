<title>Issue 8429 -   chromium -    Open application window links in the same application window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1      1. Create an application shortcut for gmail  docs  etc.  2. Open the application shortcut  3. Select an element within the shortcut that would open another tab.        For these application shortcuts it would make sense that anything opened   within these would open new tabs within the same application window.  That   way related tabs are kept together as opposed from separated in different   windows.         For instance with Google Docs as a shortcut  you have you list of   documents.  When I click on the document it opens a new tab.  However  that   tab is not related to the google docs application window. If there is not   another instance of Chrome running  a new one will have to start up or if   there is it will add a tab to the other instance.  The tab between Google   Docs and the document I opened are now located in two different windows.     </pre>
