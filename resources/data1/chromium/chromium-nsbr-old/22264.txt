<title>Issue 22264 -   chromium -    Cache AuthOrigin(target) in a local variable in HttpNetworkTransaction::HandleAuthChallenge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ignoring logging messages  I found six calls to AuthOrigin(target) in   net/http/http_network_transaction.cc.    We should cache the result of AuthOrigin(target) in a class member so that we   don't reconstruct the string again and again. </pre>
