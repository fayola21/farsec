<title>Issue 9083 -   chromium -    Regression: Scrolling not taken into account when showing dropdowns on code.google.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open crbug.com (I'm on Vista x64  but I don't think that is relevant)  2. Sign in with your Chromium account  3. Click on any bug that has lengthy comments in the details  4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the &quot;Edit form&quot;  5. Try to change Status or Owner for the bug    When entering values for Status and Owner I expect the suggest dropdown to   appear below the field. However  it draws higher up (even outside of view)   because it does not seem to take scrolling into account when displaying the   dropdown.    This is particularly frustrating when the scroll amount is either very low   or very high  because then the dropdown is either obscuring the textfield   or completely out of view (respectively). </pre>
