<title>Issue 348 -   chromium -    can view old incognito cache if main process left running. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Google Chrome  2. Open New incognito window  3. Visit any webpage  4. Close incognito window  5. Leave main chrome.exe process running  6. Open New incognito window  7. Go to view-cache: or about:cache to see old incognito web cache        I think that the cache should be deleted after closing the incognito  window  regardless of whether the main Google Chrome process is running.  The old incognito cache should not be viewable.          As long as the main chrome.exe process is running  one can see the cache of  old incognito sessions.    Please provide
