<title>Issue 11982 -   chromium -    No tab title in Dock when window is minimized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a window  - minimize it to the dock  - roll over the window's icon in the dock    Expected:  - should see the window's title above the icon    Actual:  - only see &quot;Chromium&quot; because we don't have a window title.    mikesmith wanted this as a &quot;nice to have&quot; on the MacDev milestone  so  sticking it there with a P2. It doesn't block anything but helps adoption. </pre>
