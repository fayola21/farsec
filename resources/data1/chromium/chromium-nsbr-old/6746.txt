<title>Issue 6746 -   chromium -    The filesystem policy rules do not consider case sensitivity [Sandbox] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [oct 01 2007]    The file policy rules are hardcoded to be case insensitive. This covers a   lot of common cases but there is a chance we hit a case sensitive file   request.    Note that the machine has to have case sensitive enabled. See:   <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;817921">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;817921</a>    And  the request must have the proper flag in object attributes. This can   be achieved from win32 with the posix semantics flag.       </pre>
