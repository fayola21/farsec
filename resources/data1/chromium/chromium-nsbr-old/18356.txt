<title>Issue 18356 -   chromium -    Find box should capture keystrokes between ctrl-f and it opening - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/</a>.  Immediately after   the throbber stops spinning  press ctrl-f and begin typing.    The find box takes a while to show up (which is annoying)  and any keys you   pressed before it came up are discarded.    I don't know if the first delay is due to message loop backlog or something   else.  Either way it seems like something should capture the keystrokes after   pressing ctrl-f  so your input isn't discarded. </pre>
