Need VMWare Server Web version installed : https://5mv-1948020:8333/ui/# Browser: Chrome 3.0.189.0 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.189.0 Safari/531.0] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?    VMWare virtual machine webconsole fails to launch as the plugin cannot be   installed.      What is the expected result?    The virtual machine console should be launched allowing the user to login   and work on the Guest operating system running on the virtual machine.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  The process is a little involved  but easy to replicate :   1. Install VMware Server (Free edition)  2. Verify that the VMWare Infrastructure webaccess is accessible  3. Install a guest operating system on the virtual machine (Ubuntu 9.04 in   my case)  4. Start the Guest OS via the Infrastructure Web access  5. Once the Guest OS is up and running  goto the Console tab in the VMWare   Infrastrure webaccess and try to launch the console. It asks the plugin to   be installed from VMWare. When you try to install the plugin it fails with   the message shown in the attached screenshot.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes. It works properly on the following browsers  1. IE 7  2. Firefox 3.0.11    Please provide any additional information below.  1. Had trouble installing certificates on Chrome for the VMWare   Infrastructure web access. Found an indirect way to fix this by installing   certificated via IE. This process should be simplified in Chrome  </pre>
