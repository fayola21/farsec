<title>Issue 18103 -   chromium -    app mode/popup window throbbers only spin in one direction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open an app mode window or a popup window.  Load a web page and notice that   the throbber only spins clockwise.  On tabs  we get the anti-clockwise spin   while waiting for a response and clockwise spin once we're loading.    I'm not sure if it's intentional  but it seems like it would be nice if the   app icon would also spin backwards. </pre>
