<title>Issue 22717 -   chromium -    Open infobars jank up tab switches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trigger an infobar in one tab.  Signing into gmail to get the password save infobar is a good choice.    Then switch to a different tab.  Notice the flash  where the content appears to resize twice.    What's happening is that on the tab switch  we're removing the infobar  swapping in the new web   content  and then adding the infobar back.  Swapping in the new web content triggers a renderer   resize  and then the infobar comes in and triggers another renderer resize.    It should be possible to do all this with no resizes.  I need to figure out how and fix.    Marking as a beta blocker because this looks awful when it happens. </pre>
