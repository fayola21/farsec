<title>Issue 5611 -   chromium -    Wrong window size when maximizing in multiple display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Configure a multiple display desktop. Mine are a small one (1024x600)   and a larger one (1280x1024)  2. Open Chrome (opens in small display)  3. Create a new windows and move it to the large display  4. Maximize it      The browser maximizes size to the extent of the large display.      The browser changes size without covering all the display (it seems a size   similar to the small display) and aligns top-left of the display.    Attached there is a screenshot of both displays. Big black area  in the top   left doesn't exists (is an effect of windows screen capture when display   sizes doesn't match)    OS: Windows XP Home      Asus EeePC 1000H      1GB RAM      Small display: laptop screen (1024x600)      Big display: external monitor (1280x1024) </pre>
