<title>Issue 22145 -   chromium -    about:extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions  Other browsers tested: n/a    on top of 'chrome://extensions' is written: 'about extensions'.   This does give the idea that the page is also 'about:extensions'. This isn't.   Can one of these things happen:  1. change the text on top of chrome://extensions  2. make about:extensions redirect to chrome://extensions.    (currently about:extensions is an empty page) </pre>
