<title>Issue 6666 -   chromium -    Chrome not passing proxy authentication details - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Be behind a proxy server that requires authentication (in this case   I'm using ISA 2006)  2. Set Windows' Internet Options to 'Automatically detect settings' for   proxy (ie. use wpad file)  3. Attempt to load any external webpage (ie. a page that must go via   the proxy)      Chrome passes proxy authentication details and requested URL to proxy.   Proxy then returns requested page.      Receive proxy error  &quot;407 Proxy Authentication Required. The ISA Server   requires authorization to fulfill the request. Access to the Web Proxy   filter is denied.
