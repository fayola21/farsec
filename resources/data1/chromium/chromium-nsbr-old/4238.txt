<title>Issue 4238 -   chromium -    Pasting large content into omnibox makes unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought my clipboard contained a URL  but instead it contained a   javascript application.    I proceeded to paste into the omnibox (expecting to paste a URL).  This caused chrome to hang for about 20 seconds which is bad  since I had   to wait half a minute before correcting my mistake.    Reproduced in both:  - 0.3.154.9 (Official Build 4058)  - and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=4974">r4974</a>    The data in my clipboard can be approximated with:    $ curl   '<a href="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z1F89/lpkg/41wt8o9p/en_US/141/130696/j">http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z1F89/lpkg/41wt8o9p/en_US/141/130696/j</a>  s/ccwsorvq7cgskos0.pkg.js' | putclip    Which is 184k    $ getclip | wc -c  189374   </pre>
