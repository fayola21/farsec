<title>Issue 10709 -   chromium -    Should provide checks while loading bookmarks (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing this after talking to Mark  though it is not a high priority bug.    -Open Bookmarks file from your profile directory in a editor.  -Delete any &quot;url&quot;:  line for any one of the Bookmark.  -Restart Chrome.    All the bookmarks fail to load. i.e empty bookmarks show up in Chrome.    It would be nice  if we provide checks @ the time of loading url so that it   does not effect the entire bookmarks ??           </pre>
