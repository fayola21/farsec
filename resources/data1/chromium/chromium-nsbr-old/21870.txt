<title>Issue 21870 -   chromium -    waterfall needs to better show offline bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> console view and waterfall?failures=1 mode both make it very easy to miss   that a bot is not only.    This morning we got 3 bots with &quot;setupBuild exception&quot; showing up  even the   waterfall page shows the header on each column as green!    All display modes of the waterfall should clearly show that a bot is offline for   any reason at all. </pre>
