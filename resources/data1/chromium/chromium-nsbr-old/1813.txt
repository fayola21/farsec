<title>Issue 1813 -   chromium -    Unique Identifier generated for each installation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : chrome    chrome seems to generate a unique identifier (uniqueid) for each  installation instance. So the browser instance can be identified uniquely  by a server or other programms.  I think the id should be generic and unique only over the code module  itself. In Eclipse such ids are also used but only for a single plugin  (PluginID). This is in general very useful to identify the program module.   Also in Maven generates uniqueIDs for each specific fragment.    So there should no unique id available for each installation.   How can I change this?    thanks   ralph </pre>
