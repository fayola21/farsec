<title>Issue 15199 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Position always off-screen when starting up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Version information at the bottom)    When starting up Chromium  it always appears very far off to the right of   the screen. Very much off screen. I have to set the window to &quot;Move&quot; and   use the arrow keys to get it visible on the screen again.    Position does not seem to be remembered for windows. When I close the only   open window and open another  it does not remember its last location.
