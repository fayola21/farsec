<title>Issue 14510 -   chromium -    [launch.rosettastone.com]: Rosetta Stone online learning site reports that Chrome is not supported even though it is - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://launch.rosettastone.com/en/system_check/rs3?FLTBrand=rosettastone">http://launch.rosettastone.com/en/system_check/rs3?FLTBrand=rosettastone</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?      The Rosetta Stone online learning site reports that Chrome is not a   supported browser. The site reports that it requires IE6  FF2  or Safari 2.    One      What is the expected result?     Chrome is supported. I have tried the online learning site with it and it   works as expected. The online learning uses a Flash site in conjunction   with an installed piece of speech software.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. I think you need to have a Rosetta Stone account to be able to start the   online learning portion. I have one from Google and login at <a href="http://google.onlinelanguagelearning.com/en/">http://google.onlinelanguagelearning.com/en/</a>.    2. Visit <a href="http://launch.rosettastone.com/en/system_check/rs3?">http://launch.rosettastone.com/en/system_check/rs3?</a>  FLTBrand=rosettastone. That is the page that normally launches the online   learning site.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    I tested and it works in FF3 and Chrome.    Please provide any additional information below.   </pre>
