<title>Issue 12132 -   chromium -    Implement chromeless windows for extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the feature previously known as &quot;popouts&quot;.    It would be very useful for extension developers to be able to open windows   with no chrome to be able to draw into. This could be used to have additional   UI for toolstrips  or to hover UI over the content of web pages. </pre>
