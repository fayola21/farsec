<title>Issue 16920 -   chromium -    HP printer driver download (FTP) fails on Chrome  works on Firefox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The HP printer driver download pages have a download button which redirects   you to an FTP site for the actual download. Here's an example page:    <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?</a>  lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1140783&amp;prodNameId=1140778&amp;swEn  vOID=228&amp;swLang=8&amp;mode=2&amp;taskId=135&amp;swItem=ja-35999-15    Clicking the Download button on Firefox initiates the download. Clicking   the Download button on Chrome fails. I've reproduced this both on the corp   network on my XP laptop  and also on my XP netbook on my home network so   it's not a machine/network-specific issue.    I've attached a network trace - looks like midway through the file transfer   we reset the TCP connection. </pre>
