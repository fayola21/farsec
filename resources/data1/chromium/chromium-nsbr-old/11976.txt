<title>Issue 11976 -   chromium -    Scrollbar doesn't implement middle-click as GTK+ does - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load page large enough and/or shrink window small enough to give some   decent scrolling to test with  2. Middle-click the &quot;body&quot; of the scrollbar  3. Observe behavior for a few seconds  4. Move mouse up and down        GTK+ style behavior        When you middle-click  the page scrolls very slowly as the thumb moves   toward your cursor.  Once it gets there it stops  as expected.  Then you   move the mouse  expecting the thumb to move with you  but it only moves in   the direction the thumb was originally travelling; you can't move it in the   opposite direction.    <b>Please provide
