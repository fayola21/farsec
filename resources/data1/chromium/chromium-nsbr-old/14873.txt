<title>Issue 14873 -   chromium -    chrome/chrom.sln VS solution file appears missing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Download the tar ball   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium_tarball.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium_tarball.html</a>  2.Fix the extension to be .tgz open using winzip  3.Observe the missing chrome/chrome.sln file refered to in the build   instructions.    Any clues about why this file was not in the tarball. I'm fighting with   SVN and my firewall as we speak but the tarball is documented as a copy of   what is in SVN. Any clue would be appreciated.
