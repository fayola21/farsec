<title>Issue 20266 -   chromium -    ui_test JavascriptHistory occasionally hangs on XP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5-10% of the time  I've observed the ui_test   SessionHistoryTest.JavascriptHistory seems to be hanging on XP Tests (dbg) on   the builders.    For example:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Tests%20(dbg)(1)/b">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Tests%20(dbg)(1)/b</a>  uilds/11216/steps/ui_tests/logs/stdio    I haven't been able to reproduce this locally yet. </pre>
