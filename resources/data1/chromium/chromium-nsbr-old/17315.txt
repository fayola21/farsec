<title>Issue 17315 -   chromium -    Window width incorrect in gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.194.3 (Official Build 20926)    When accessing gmail  the width is just slightly off when the page is   rendered  enough to have a small horizontal scroll. I suspect it is   reporting the width without accounting for the scroll bar. I also suspect   this has something to do with gmail's use of frames  or else it would happen   elsewhere. See screenshot.    In the screenshot  the top image shows gmail after resizing the window    which forces it to adjust and corrects for the offset. The bottom image is   without resizing the window. </pre>
