<title>Issue 4076 -   chromium -    acrobat plugin can't display some PDFs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use the URL above. Alternatively  go to springerlink.com  choose an   article with Full Access (marked with a solid green rectangle) and click on   the PDF icon/link (pointing to the PDF version of the fulltext article  a   fulltext.pdf file).          Acrobat pugin should display the PDF file within the browser client area.      First the browser client area grayed out  then it seems to be frozen for a   while (shitching task/tab then refocusing on the fulltext.pdf tab  the   client area shows the last displayed screen section of that area; see   screenshot attached). After some (~4-5) minutes (!) (when I don't close the   .pdf tab) the Acrobat Reader window comes up with an error message &quot;A file   I/O error has occured&quot; or &quot;The file is damaged and could not be repaired&quot;   (see attached screenshots).
