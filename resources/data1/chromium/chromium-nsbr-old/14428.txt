<title>Issue 14428 -   chromium -    TabRestoreService doesn't update the command_updater object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The TabRestoreService never updates the command updater so instead of being  able to ask it for the current state  everyone has to go directly to the  TRS. This makes is so that you have to hard-code the command id in many  places as well as not allowing us to query the state of the command from  the UI tests. </pre>
