<title>Issue 9031 -   chromium -    Popup blocking UI should special-case the &quot;one popup&quot; case - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our old popup blocking UI would allow you easy titlebar access to a popup   in the case where there was one  but was a bit much when there were   multiple popups. The new UI makes it harder to access a popup if there's   only one. We should use the old UI in the case where there is one popup    and segue to the new UI in the case of multiple popups.     The popup menu in the new UI should also have a 'show all' item added.    Bonus points for a smooth transition between the two popup UIs.    Open question over whether/how we should allow access to the 'never notify'   menu item in the one-popup case  though I don't think it's a blocker. </pre>
