<title>Issue 12674 -   chromium -    Update Chromium copy of the V8 Benchmark Suite to version 4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version 4 of the V8 Benchmark Suite includes the new Splay benchmark in  addition to some other small changes (see  <a href="http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v4/revisions.html">http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v4/revisions.html</a>).    The Chromium copy  which is used for performance tests  should be updated  to this new version.  It's currently at version 3.  That copy is stored  under: src/chrome/test/data/v8_benchmark.  Note that some minor  modifications have been made to the benchmark suite to allow it to run as a  UI test that reports back timing results (see README.chromium in that  directory).    Also  I believe the performance test framework should seamlessly handle  generating graphs for the new Splay benchmark. </pre>
