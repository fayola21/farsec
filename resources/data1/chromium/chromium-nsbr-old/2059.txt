<title>Issue 2059 -   chromium -    Improve usability of POST interstitial - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)    Working on a MediaWiki 1.12.0 site  the &quot;Confirm Form Resubmission&quot; comes  up far too often  the resubmission form is blank and disorienting  and I've  lost many edits as a result.        1. click &quot;edit&quot; to edit a page  2. add text to the composition box   3. click &quot;preview&quot;   4. add more text to the composition box   5. hit &quot;preview&quot; again   6. click a link to navigate away   7. press &quot;back arrow&quot; to return to 2nd preview   8. chrome puts up the resubmission form   9. press &quot;back arrow&quot; again to return to the 1st preview    10. chrome puts up a resubmission form again  identical to the one  previously viewed     Numerous problems:   1) there is no indication navigating away from the preview page that  returning to the preview page will be burdensome  2) the drop down page history provides no menu highlighting to determine  which pages will require a resubmit  3) all the resubmission pages look the same  so if you have many stacked  up  you quickly become disoriented; as a power editor  I'm often navigating  away from edits in progress  esp. to &quot;recent contributions&quot; to grab links  to recently composed pages to add to the page currently under composition   that's even before I recurse into a sub-edit task  4) it ought to offer the option to view the page in its last state  without  demanding a resubmit (none of the other browsers asks for a resubmit to a  MediaWiki preview page to begin with  so maybe that's too aggressive by  half  or maybe it's just more responsible security)    Other factors severely hampering adoption for power editing in preference  to Firefox.     * composition box spell checker: no &quot;ignore&quot;  no &quot;add to dictionary&quot;  no  &quot;check spelling&quot; option for the edit summary box  no concurrent maintenance  of the Firefox spelling dictionary (I certainly don't want two dictionaries  to maintain in parallel  and yes  I know that some Linux distros are  beginning to centralize the personal spell checker  for Chrome  supporting  this should be a priority  because I intend to use both  and failure to  centralize user prefs is a twenty year old embarrassment to the profession)    * page search does not search in composition box   * middle mouse click does not work on history drop down to open a  historical page directly into a new tab (this works on FF3  and I use it a  lot)   * page zoom does implement a proper pin; if you zoom around in/out  you can  end up in the same magnification  scrolled to a much different position;  also violates fixed-point theorem: at least one visible line of text should  stay at the same place (this also sucked under FF2; FF3 recently fixed this)     Had one full-on Chrome crash with 50 tabs open; each tab was a page  requiring cleanup  and I was working through the list.      Pretty good for a beta  I must add.    </pre>
