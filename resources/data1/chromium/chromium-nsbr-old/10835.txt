<title>Issue 10835 -   chromium -    HWNDView not getting its size set properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We ran into a bug recently where tooltips weren't working in ExtensionView (a   subclass of HWNDHtmlView).  It turned out that GetClientRect in   RenderViewHostView was returning 0 0 for size.  Looking through how   WebContents handled this  it was calling SetSize() explicitly on this view   (from a number of different entry points).  RenderViewHostView should be   updating its size automatically rather than SetSize having to be called   explicitly. </pre>
