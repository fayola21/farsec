<title>Issue 20924 -   chromium -    Need a way to optionally archive layout test results on try bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout test try bots do not archive.  This seems like the right default    but I'd like a way to optionally get archives.    Motivation:  This allows you to generate baselines on all platforms when new   test is added  by just grabbing them from try server BEFORE checking in and   making things red. </pre>
