<title>Issue 5201 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data should clear the downloading history. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.31(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)    This is interesting to know.      1. Downloaded the two zip files from <a href="ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo/">ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo/</a> webpage  COUPLE OF TIMES and canceled few of them.   2. Clear Browsing data for *everything.  3. I will notice the download history is empty in downloads page at this time.  4. Close and restart Chrome. I will notice the history for canceled files  still exist in the downloads page. (It is demonstrated twice in the video)     I'm able to reproduce the issue in both XP/SP3 (Physical machine) and  Vista/sp2(VMWare image).    Observation:  ############  In XP machine  Once I delete all the files manually in the downloads page  (using right click context menu)  then I can't reproduce the issue in XP.  SO  I preserved the profile for at least on Vista machine for debugging  purpose.
