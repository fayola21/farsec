<title>Issue 4458 -   chromium -    No right click menu on history page + scrollbar resets when some link is visited - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;        1. Open history.  2. Scroll down some 100 lines below.  3. Ctrl + Click a link. Go and see in that tab if you have got correct item   history  (suppose you didn't)  4. Come back to history tab  and you will see scrollbar is reset.      Scrollbar stay where it is at least when link from history was not opened   in same page  rather used ctrl + click to avoid this problem. </pre>
