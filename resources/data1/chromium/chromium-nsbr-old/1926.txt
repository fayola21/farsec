<title>Issue 1926 -   chromium -    Poor Interface Design: Meaningless tabs under options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)    When you open options you get three tabs: &quot;Basics&quot;   &quot;Minor Tweaks&quot; and   &quot;Under the Hood&quot;.  Each tab name is cute  but meaningless.  How about using   the tabs to group similar settings and giving them meaningful names?    I would suggest:    Tab: Browser Behavior  Content: On startup  Home Page  Default Search  Default Browser  Download   Location  Fonts and Languages    Tab: Security  Content: Passwords  Pop-Ups  Security    Tab: Under the Hood  Content: Auto-open  Crash reports  Network  Google Gears     </pre>
