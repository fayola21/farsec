<title>Issue 10820 -   chromium -    Omnibox autocompletes &quot;/&quot; to &quot;///&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/87048">http://codereview.chromium.org/87048</a>   you can now load &quot;/&quot; in the   omnibox on POSIX to browse your root directory.    After doing that once  &quot;/&quot; now inline autocompletes to &quot;///&quot;  which is pretty   weird.    Peter says: &quot;TBH I'm not sure precisely how to fix that. I know why that is   happening but no step in the process jumps out as wrong.&quot; </pre>
