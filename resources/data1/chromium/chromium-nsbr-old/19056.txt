<title>Issue 19056 -   chromium -    Right-Click &quot;Copy link address&quot; should be same as copying from address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39  (on Win7)      1. Open a web page with links on it  2. Right-click a link and choose &quot;Copy link address&quot;  3. Paste link to a Google App like gmail      Pasted text is immediately identified as a URL      Pasted text is pasted as plain text    Notes: When copying a URL from the address bar  there is additional   information placed in the clipboard so that when the user pastes into Gmail   (or other apps) the text is pasted as a URL.  When using the right-click   'copy link address' this is not the case.  The two should be the same. </pre>
