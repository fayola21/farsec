<title>Issue 15905 -   chromium -    System uninstall fails after dev channel install attempt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps reported by jarbon:    1. Have system-level Google Chrome installed (Stable channel).  2. Try installing a Dev channel release from   <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?extra=devchannel">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?extra=devchannel</a>  3. Step 2 fails (expected).  4. Uninstall Google Chrome.  5. Repeat step 2: it continues to fail.    The install in step 4 continues to fail until you remove   HKLMSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463C-AFF1-  A69D9E530F96}    I haven't reproduced this  but my theory is that we fail to remove that key   if it has an unexpected value in it (the ap value for the channel). Then   the &quot;is there already a system-level install?&quot; check is failing because of   the existence of the key.    I could be way off. We need to reproduce this so we can examine the state   of the system at step 5. </pre>
