<title>Issue 9562 -   chromium -    View Source for non-text pages just renders the page again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://khaaan.com/">http://khaaan.com/</a>           Safari 4: Partial pass (View Source menu item is enabled but does nothing)    Firefox 3.x: PASS (menu is disabled)           IE 7: Partial pass (renders source passed to rendering engine  enabled but does nothing if rendered by a plugin such as Acrobat)           IE 8: The IE8 installer FAILs on my system - does that count?      1. Visit a URL such as the one above  2. View Source (e.g. Ctrl+U)    The content-type of the above URL is application/x-shockwave-flash. The same happens when viewing images directly.      One of the following should happen:  - Option is disabled/nothing happens (Firefox and sort of Safari 4)  - New tab opens with source of markup passed to Webkit in order to render the non-html content (not applicable for content such as PDF) (IE7)  - New tab opens with blank page  - New tab opens with information about content-type or similar      New tab opens and renders same content as the generating tab. This is not helpful  and is confusing on pages such as the example because one   may expect the content to be wrapped in some container markup if the file extension isn't in the URL.     </pre>
