<title>Issue 7142 -   chromium -    Have the png decoder return a pointer to an array  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the png decoder fills in a vector that you supply. This is   convenient but is not what we want in some cases. For example  in the   resource bundle code  it requires a copy. The png decoder should be able to   return an array that it allocates. </pre>
