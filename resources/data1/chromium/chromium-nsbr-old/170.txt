<title>Issue 170 -   chromium -    Can't login to some sites.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to the site <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs">http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs</a>  2. click on &quot;Sign In&quot; in the upper right hand corner  3. enter the details      It is supposed to refresh the page  but i should see that im logged in this   time.      The page refreshes  but im not logged in.  After 3 unsuccessful logins  it's supposed to lock my account  but that   doesn't happen  so im guessing there's a problem with how it saves the   cookie or temporary file of some sort.  I know my details are correct since i can login with FireFox.    Please provide
