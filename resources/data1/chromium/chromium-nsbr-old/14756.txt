<title>Issue 14756 -   chromium -    update hunspell to the latest stable version to use the latest dictionary format - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> spun off <a title="Crash - ~AffixMgr()" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8551"> issue 8551 </a>.    Our copy of Hunspell is based on 1.1.5 but is rather heavily modified to   support the bdict format among other things.    In <a title="Crash - ~AffixMgr()" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8551"> issue 8551 </a>  it's found that the latest French dictionary (and perhaps   dictionaries for other languages) for Hunspell does not work with Hunspell   1.1.5. To update our spellcheck dictionaries  we need to upgrade hunspell to   1.2.8 with our locale changes adapted to it.      </pre>
