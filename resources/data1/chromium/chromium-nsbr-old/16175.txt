<title>Issue 16175 -   chromium -    There is no the Search Box on the &quot;new new tab page&quot;. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0 (Official Dev Build 20134)  Other browsers tested: No  because this is a peculiarity of Chrome.    The new tab page of Google Chrome has been reformulated and excluded a very   useful feature: The ability to search directly from the new tab page.    Before the reform  was possible to the user  for example  perform searches on   Youtube  directly from the page. The most used search engines were arranged in   this pleasant and extremely helpful feature.    It is not understandable why Chromium team withdrew the utility  although the   &quot;new new tab page&quot; is not yet available  it will offend a lot of users.   So  how the searches is the power of Google  the feature should be maintained.    As the objective of the browser is to facilitate the life  remove this function   would be the same as not allowing the custom searches in omnibox. </pre>
