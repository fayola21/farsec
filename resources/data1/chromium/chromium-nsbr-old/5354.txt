<title>Issue 5354 -   chromium -    Feature: Copy Link Address for Bookmarks in UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a Feature Request for adding an option when Right-Clicking a   Bookmark (in the UI  not in Bookmark Manager) to 'Copy Link Address' or   'Copy'. I'm thinking this would be more user-friendly than having to go to   Bookmark Manager first  or click 'Edit' on the UI.    There would not be a need for 'Cut' or 'Paste' since that will exclusively   be handled by the Bookmark Manager. But 'Copy' really has a use in the UI.   </pre>
