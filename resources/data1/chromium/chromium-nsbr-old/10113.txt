<title>Issue 10113 -   chromium -    5 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   Accessibility is off in the browser  and accessibility is not a priority  for the current release.  Border radius not anti-aliased.  New test. We should fix it  but it doesn't need to block the current release  Linux pixeltest failure: radial gradients don't have offset focal point  Linux pixeltest failure: radial gradients don't have offset focal point  New test. We should fix it  but it doesn't need to block the current release  This test isn't hanging  it just takes 12-13 seconds to run  which is more  than test_shell allows. However  we shouldn't look into the speed of the test  until we have reached PASS status.
