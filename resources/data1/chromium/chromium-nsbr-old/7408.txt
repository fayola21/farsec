Note: IE and FF treat &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; differently and therefore there  is a difference seen in alignment of images in center column. Chrome/Safari  behave similar to FF.    Bug filed upstream: <a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17801">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17801</a>    2nd issue: misalignment of headings of the column (where smaller images are  placed in left column and text in right column). It is partially seen.
