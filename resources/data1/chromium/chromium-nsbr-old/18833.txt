<title>Issue 18833 -   chromium -    Reset button stays down on form with JS onReset/confirm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22780) on Mac and some recent dev channel on   Windows  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/_FORM_onReset.html">http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/_FORM_onReset.html</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Go to a web page with a form such as the following (from the above web page):  &lt;FORM      ACTION=&quot;../cgi-bin/mycgi.pl&quot;      onReset=&quot;return confirm('Do you really want to reset the form?')&quot;     &gt;  &lt;INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=&quot;query&quot;&gt;  &lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT&gt;   &lt;INPUT TYPE=RESET&gt;  &lt;/FORM&gt;  2. Press the reset button.      Reset button should go to its &quot;up&quot; state before confirmation dialog box appears (or at least while   it is appearing).      Until the confirmation dialog box is dismissed  the reset button stays in its depressed state. </pre>
