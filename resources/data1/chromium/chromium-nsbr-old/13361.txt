<title>Issue 13361 -   chromium -    TaskManager object lifetimes are very weird - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The task manager view and other objects live beyond the lifetime of the Task   manager window. This is very odd. It doesn't seem worth keeping the view   around if the user has closed the window. It makes the code relating to view   cleanup very complicated too. We should move to a model where the task   manager view is thrown away when the window is closed and re-constructed when   the window is opened.    I think this has become somewhat weirder with the porting  so I'm giving it   to Pawe��_��_ to look at. </pre>
