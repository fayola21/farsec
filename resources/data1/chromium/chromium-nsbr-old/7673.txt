<title>Issue 7673 -   chromium -    Sad face not displayed after a plugin crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.163.0 (9655)      1. Go to a page using a plugin i.e. http://go/compat/plugins_testing/QT_HTML_param_testcases/AutoHREF_True.html  or youtube.com   2. Bring up the task manager and end the process for the plugin    What is the expected output?   A sad face should be seen. In case of youtube  the main video using flash   doesn't show the sad face but the ad on side shows the sad face.    What do you see instead?  Nothing         </pre>
