<title>Issue 22837 -   chromium -    V8 defines HTMLAudioElement and HTMLVideoElement even though feature is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Rename/move the FFmpeg binaries so Chrome cannot find them  2. Launch Chrome  3. Verify video is disabled by running the attached HTML file      typeof(HTMLVideoElement) should return undefined  instead it returns   function    I think the culprit is here somewhere:  /WebKit/WebCore/bindings/v8/V8DOMWrapper.cpp </pre>
