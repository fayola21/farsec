<title>Issue 12547 -   chromium -    Extensions auto-update should show somewhere in UI if an update requires a new chrome version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the initial implementation  if the update manifest indicates a chrome   version higher than the running browser  we log but that's it. Erik had the   idea that we might want to bubble this up into the extensions UI somehwere. </pre>
