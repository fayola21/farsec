<title>Issue 22040 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Bring back Common Search!!! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The nntp is great  but there is one feature that has been removed since the   old ntp that i really miss - Common Searches. This was one of the best things   about the old ntp  and a feature i used to use extensively in the older   versions of chrome (and chromium). It was a great and very useful feature.   Please bring it back (this can't be very difficult  as the SVN must still   have the code for it buried somewhere in old revisions). If you think it   confuses some users  could it perhaps be off by default? Pleeeeeeeeeease...?   :D </pre>
