<title>Issue 6882 -   chromium -    autocomplete should use omnibox style inline autofill - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From BenG:    &quot;I go to craigslist and search for the same string (&quot;S2000&quot;) every few  days. having to arrow into the drop down is annoying when if it  behaved like the omnibox it'd autocomplete inline and I could just  press enter.&quot;    There are some security concerns with filling in the value automatically  since the page could   harvest values using js. We would have to be tricksy and make it look like the value was there    without actually giving it to the page till the user presses enter. I'm not sure how much work that   would entail. </pre>
