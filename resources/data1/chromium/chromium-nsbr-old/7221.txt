<title>Issue 7221 -   chromium -    When network is down  we should throw appropriate message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1072204&gt;  Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8889)    When network is down or cable is unplugged  we should throw appropriate  message  if user tries to navigate a webpage.    Right now It always says &quot;This web page is not available&quot;    If we add one more bullet some thing like &quot;check for your internet  connection&quot; --that will be more helpful to the user.    Comments from mal  #################  For the Beta release  I think we can get by with what we have now.    If we decide this is useful from a UX perpsective  we'd need to update our  backend net code to detect this condition. </pre>
