<title>Issue 605 -   chromium -    proposal: add an indicator of downloading a web-page to the Chrome's User Interface - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello!  I'm a usability specialist from Russia.  Thank you for Chrome =) you've made great work.    I think it'd be good to add an indicator of downloading a web-page like in  FireFox 3 (e.g. like in FireFox 3 - or in Mac OS X - icon of a clock or  rounds...) Because after click on the link - nothing occurs... and you just  wait... without knowing for how long.    Thank you    Best regards   Baykov Alexey  (bifurcation.point@gmail.com)     </pre>
