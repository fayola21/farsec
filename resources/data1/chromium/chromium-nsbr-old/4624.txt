<title>Issue 4624 -   chromium -    WebFrameImpl::SpoolPage not functioning right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5691">revision 5691</a>      1. call WebFrameImpl::GetPageRect(int page  gfx::Rect* page_size)  2. call WebFrameImpl::SpoolPage(int page  gfx::PlatformCanvas* canvas)      The size of the canvas SpoolPage()'s paint should be the size set by  GetPageRect().      &quot;ScrollView::paint(GraphicsContext* context  const IntRect&amp; rect)&quot; calls    IntRect documentDirtyRect = rect;    documentDirtyRect.intersect(frameRect());  which will default to painting to the size associated with  &quot;FrameView::m_size&quot; which in turn is set in &quot;FrameView::layout(bool)&quot; via  &quot;m_size = IntSize(visibleWidth()  visibleHeight())&quot;.  I think the problem  is that &quot;FrameView::m_size&quot; is never reset when &quot;int  WebFrameImpl::ComputePageRects(const gfx::Size&amp; page_size_px)&quot; is called.   Though  I'm not exactly sure how to go about solving this nor the reason  why this whole thing was recently re-written.  I just thought to bring this up. </pre>
