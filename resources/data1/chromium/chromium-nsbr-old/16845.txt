<title>Issue 16845 -   chromium -    Wishlist: In order to change the browsing experience you must provide a solution for the pathetic flash plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL    The performance of flash plugin is pathetic  especially in linux. In order  to change the browsing experience you have to either cooperate with adobe  in order to provide an optimized flash plugin for every platform chrome  targets  or choose one of the open source alternative (gnash  swfdec) and  optimize it  make it compliant with adobe flash (reverse engineering flash)  and embed it to chrome.    Finally you must support html5 video tags. :) </pre>
