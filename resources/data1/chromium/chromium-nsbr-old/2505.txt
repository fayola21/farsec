<title>Issue 2505 -   chromium -    Chrome needs to follow long established CUI standard for User Ergonomics - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                  1. Look at all the configuration dialogs  2. See BUTTONS        Well  the long documented established CUI for GUI designers is to use a   &quot;...&quot; in buttons if the BUTTON action will display another dialog with more   user input.  Its not a &quot;final action&quot; per se.        Well  users are lost at the Chrome Buttons because you are not show if its   going to do something or ask you for more information. The problem is that   for certain critical actions  you don't know if the BUTTON is going to do   something user did not want to do. The visual cue of &quot;...&quot; tells users that   MORE is coming in the usage of that item.    There is really no need to justify it.  Follow the CUI standard long   established for nearly 25+ years is highly recommended - users will be less   confused.  This is especially the case since Chrome is targeting Windows   and it needs to comply with CUI standards.     </pre>
