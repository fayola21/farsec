<title>Issue 22522 -   chromium -    Chrome Not Displaying Menu Bar of Web App - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  This is an internal application used at by Company for Helpdesk tickets      but is a commercial product from Computer Associates (CA) called   Unicenter Service Desk.        I am not sure if this is a Chrome issue  since the same thing occurs in   Safari.      Within the Web Application  is a Menu Bar that is displaying on IE and   Firefox  but not on Safari and Chrome.    See attached screenshots  upper left under the tab labeled &quot;Service Desk&quot;.    In IE and Firefox  there is a menubar with: File  View  Search  Window  and   Help.   This menu bar does not appear in Chrome or Safari.            <b>Please provide
