<title>Issue 21823 -   chromium -    Can't navigate to themes gallery page in ZoneAlarm Firewall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT and 3.0.195.21  OS: XP/SP2 EN with ZoneAlarmFirewall.    -Navigate to the themes gallery page.  <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>    Result:  SSL error page shows up. Clicking on 'Continue' on the interstitial error  page  user is thrown with page not found (error 404)    I don't think it is chrome specific issue  as IE also has the same behavior  as Chrome.   </pre>
