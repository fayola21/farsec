<title>Issue 22754 -   chromium -    HTML select elements (drop-downs) broken in latest builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.0 (26911)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?</a>  filename=tryhtml_option (for example)  OS version               : 10.6.1      1. Visit a website with drop-down (select) elements in a form (see example   above)  2. Select an option that is not the default selected. For instance  select   &quot;Saab&quot; in the example website      The drop-down should display &quot;Saab&quot; as being selected and the selection   should be changeable.      The drop-down still displays the original (default) selection as currently   selected  and the drop-down is &quot;locked up&quot; (that is  a mouse-down does   not cause the menu to be displayed).    Also  I have noticed that the option that was selected is still posted   through if the form is submitted  so this seems to be a UI issue - the   underlying selection still takes place. </pre>
