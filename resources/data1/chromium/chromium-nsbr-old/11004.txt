<title>Issue 11004 -   chromium -    Disable RTL accelerator if not using RTL somewhere. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type a long message on a text box (like this one).  2. Press a key combination that switches the text to RTL  3. Panic  try to re-use the magic key combination that you didn't know   existed (or know what it is).  4. Lose all the text of step 1.    This particular accelerator should not be enabled unless I set my locale to   an RTL language  or something like that. I can see users leaving the product   when they discover the feature by accident. </pre>
