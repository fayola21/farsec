<title>Issue 14137 -   chromium -    Fix handling of file descriptor exhaustion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We use a file descriptor for every SharedMemory  and there's no limiting on   how many we create at a time  so it's possible to exceed the fd limit and fail.   Failure isn't handled particularly gracefully (it will generally cause a renderer   crash).    We need to make it possible for SharedMemory creation to return a &quot;try again   later&quot; response  and have clients respect that.      1. Launch Chromium with --file-descriptor-limit=&lt;a very low number&gt;      It should be slow  but still render the page correctly. </pre>
