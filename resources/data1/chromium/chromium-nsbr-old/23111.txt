<title>Issue 23111 -   chromium -    In-page search box shouldn't be placed in the top right corner - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The in page search box (the one that appears after Ctrl+F) is placed in the   top right corner of the browser. I think it would be better if it was in   the bottom or top left corner.    When I browse the web I usually look on the left part of the screen  that's   because page's content is usually on the left  tabs are on the left and   bookmark bar is left oriented too. So when I search something on a page   it's very unpleasent to move my eyes from  the left where the content   usually is to the top right  where the search box is. I have to do this   &quot;eye travel&quot; many times during search  to check if I'm entering correct   text and to check if there are any matches. This is especially true with   widescreen monitors (which I have).    Other good reason to move the search is for consistency's sake - IE and   Firefox users are used to search box on the left.    I have been using Chrome for 2 month and still can't get used to the search   box placement. </pre>
