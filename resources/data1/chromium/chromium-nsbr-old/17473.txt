<title>Issue 17473 -   chromium -    Strange tab-open-location heuristic result - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Copied from old internal bug #1075942)    Take the following steps:  * Open a new Chrome window and navigate its tab to www.google.com  * Middle-click &quot;Maps&quot; link  * Change to newly opened Maps tab  * Middle-click &quot;Images&quot; link  * Change back to first tab    ---STOP!  At this point  you have a Google tab  which is the parent of a   Maps tab to its right  which is the parent of an Images tab to its right.    Where would you expect a new child of the first tab to be opened?  Once   you've answered  move on.    * Middle-click &quot;News&quot; link.  Be shocked that it opened between the Maps and   Images tabs.    I think this is the source of confusing cases where tabs don't end up where   I can predict.  For reference  my answer to the &quot;STOP!&quot; question was &quot;to   the right of my current tab&quot;; &quot;at the far right edge of the strip&quot; would be   a better answer than what we do now  but IMO suboptimal  since changing   away from and back to the first tab should make it reset the pointer of   &quot;where do I open children?&quot; back to &quot;to my immediate right&quot;  forgetting   about the &quot;Maps&quot; child tab. </pre>
