<title>Issue 18259 -   chromium -    Match patterns are kinda lame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Match patterns always seemed a bit overcomplex to me  and now that I've   been away from them for awhile I have an alternate idea.    In reality  people almost always use content scripts one of two ways:    a) Modify or interact with a particular site  b) Modify or interact with every site    In the case of a) it is very rare (I can't really even think of a case)   where the author wants to modify on the http:// pages and not https://   It's also very rare to want to modify only file:// URLs.    With that in mind  I think we could simplify things by doing something   like:    content_scripts: [    {      &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;*.google.com&quot;       &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;/some/glob.*&quot;       &quot;regex&quot;: &quot;/some/regex.*&quot;       &quot;js&quot;: [&quot;foo.js&quot;  &quot;bar.js&quot;]       &quot;css&quot;: [&quot;foo.css&quot;  &quot;bar.css&quot;]    }  ]    Some notes:    - The domain matching would have the same behavior as we have currently: an   asterisks can match any subdomain or no subdomain at all. So in the   example  &quot;<a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>&quot; matches.    - Domains match all schemes (http  https  ftp).    - The domain &quot;*&quot; actually matches all allowed schemes  including file://.    - It would be easier to allow regex matching (a commonly requested   Greasemonkey feature).     - We don't really need the domain and match properties to support lists   since developers could just create more than one content script entry.      Thoughts? This is obviously low priority  but just something I wanted   feedback on. </pre>
