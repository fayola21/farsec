<title>Issue 9047 -   chromium -    show URL in focused tab on first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many distribution partners have expressed interest in controlling the first   page that is seen on the first launch of Chrome.     Currently  we can only set Chrome to a special home page and then open that    home page. Instead  we'd like to be able to specify the first page to load   when chrome opens via a command line flag WITHOUT affecting the homepage or    &quot;On startup&quot; settings.   </pre>
