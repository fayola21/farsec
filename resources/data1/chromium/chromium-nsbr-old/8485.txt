<title>Issue 8485 -   chromium -    &quot;word&quot; operations in address bar don't work for CJK  Thai  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Moved from internal bug b/1391886.    In the address bar there are 3 &quot;word&quot; operations:    1. Press Ctrl and the left arrow together           &gt;&gt;Jump to the previous word in the address bar    2. Press Ctrl and the right arrow together          &gt;&gt;Jump to the next word in the address bar    3. Press Ctrl+Backspace             &gt;&gt;Delete the previous word in the address bar    This apparently does not work correctly for languages in which words are  not whitespace delimited tokens (e.g.  Chinese  Japanese  Thai).   </pre>
