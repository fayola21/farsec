<title>Issue 13261 -   chromium -    DEP crash  possibly caused by plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3    Twice today I've had Chrome go &quot;not responding&quot; for a while and then   continue working.  Looking at the Vista Problem Reports and Solutions   console  both times seem to have been DEP crashes.    As Chrome didn't get shut down by the DEP crash  I assume that this is to   do with a plugin  so Vista terminated the plugin process but the rest of   Chrome kept going.    Here are the details from Problem Reports:    Product  Google Chrome    Problem  Stopped working    Date  6/3/2009 9:54 AM    Status  Report Sent    Problem signature  Problem Event Name:	APPCRASH  Application Name:	chrome.exe  Application Version:	0.0.0.0  Application Timestamp:	4a1e33fb  Fault Module Name:	chrome.dll  Fault Module Version:	3.0.182.3  Fault Module Timestamp:	4a1e33dd  Exception Code:	c0000005  Exception Offset:	0060a2a8  OS Version:	6.0.6002.2.2.0.256.1  Locale ID:	1033  Additional Information 1:	8c92  Additional Information 2:	d8c6c559f7e4d620021431e6b5cc36f7  Additional Information 3:	8b91  Additional Information 4:	68e6cb07f7bcc64dbb5acab8c3bbabd8    Files that help describe the problem (some files may no longer be   available)  Version.txt  AppCompat.txt  minidump.mdmp    Extra information about the problem  Bucket ID:	1296355799    and the second time:    Product  Google Chrome    Problem  Stopped working    Date  6/3/2009 1:24 PM    Status  Report Sent    Problem signature  Problem Event Name:	BEX  Application Name:	chrome.exe  Application Version:	0.0.0.0  Application Timestamp:	4a1e33fb  Fault Module Name:	StackHash_6d8e  Fault Module Version:	0.0.0.0  Fault Module Timestamp:	00000000  Exception Offset:	00000000  Exception Code:	c0000005  Exception Data:	00000008  OS Version:	6.0.6002.2.2.0.256.1  Locale ID:	1033  Additional Information 1:	6d8e  Additional Information 2:	d6fec1ad10a00987dfc2460af41d0e2f  Additional Information 3:	09d1  Additional Information 4:	5db16679fd0ba35d0360cd4a16feb49b    Extra information about the problem  Bucket ID:	593554800   </pre>
