<title>Issue 4107 -   chromium -    min/restore/max buttons don't properly handle mouse-leave events from second monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9 (Official Build 4058)         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Have two monitors  2. Run windows Vista  3. Maximize Chrome on the left/primary monitor  4. Place the mouse near the midpoint of the top edge of the left monitor  5. Slowly move the mouse along the top edge past the minimize  restore  and   maximize buttons  6. As you pass over each button  the buttons will light up on mouse-enter   and dim on mouse-leave  7. When you push your mouse past the red close button onto the second   monitor  it will not react to the mouse-leave event!        The close button should dim out.        The close button stays bright.       </pre>
