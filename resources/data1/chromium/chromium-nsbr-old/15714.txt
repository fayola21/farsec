<title>Issue 15714 -   chromium -    Download shelf should dismiss itself after a certain period of time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Feel free to punt this)      Download shelf lingers on the screen after I've done a download and continue   browsing.      It would be nice if bar would dismiss itself after a certain period of time   (say 2 minutes) of no interaction w/ the bar.   </pre>
