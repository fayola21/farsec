Try to get About Google Chrome    What is the expected output?  About box/version    What do you see instead?  Aww Snap.    This is on Vista  The DLL is loaded by the public chrome  The built chrome.exe loads the wrong dll and this somehow confuses it.  If you dont have public chrome running  the about says Chromium </pre>
