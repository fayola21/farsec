<title>Issue 9363 -   chromium -    NOTREACHED When Chrome Is Minimized While Windows Explorer is Dead - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Kill Windows explorer in a way that it does not come back.  2. Minimize Chrome  3. Place your cursor over the minimized window.        Nothing should happen.    Instead Chrome triggers a breakpoint by calling NOTREACHED() in   Rect::set_height which is called by BrowserView::NonClientHitTest.  Because there is no space for the toolbar in this mode  the   calculation creates an area of negative size.       </pre>
