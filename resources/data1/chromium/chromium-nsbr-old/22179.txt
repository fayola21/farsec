<title>Issue 22179 -   chromium -    Mac about box has blinky stuff in it and uses the wrong font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26482">r26482</a> about box has some problems:    - The legal text is selectable and should not be.  - There's a blinking insertion point in there.  - It's possible to edit the legal text with the about box open.  (Oh my.)  - The font is Helvetica but should be Lucida Grande.  - The left margin of the legal text might be wrong. </pre>
