<title>Issue 11046 -   chromium -    Need to back out hbono's test fix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.8    Steps to reproduce:    1.  Click desktop shortcut to launch     Expected result:    2.  See a working UI.  ;-)    Actual behavior:    2.  Immediate &quot;Whoa!  Google Chrome has crashed.  Restart now?&quot;  3.  Send error report to Microsoft  4.  To loop back to step 2  click OK  5.  When you've annoyed Redmond enough  click Cancel    Note that clearing the user profile doesn't help  nor does trying a fresh   beta channel download off the Google site.      Is there a registry setting I should tweak to make sure you guys are   getting the crash reports directly?  Anything else you want to know while   I'm still in a reproduceable state? </pre>
