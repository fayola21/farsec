<title>Issue 18224 -   chromium -    Ctrl+backspace in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type &quot;goog&quot; in the omnibox (I'm assuming this autocompletes for you :-))  2. Press ctrl+backspace      Ctrl + backspace should delete previous word. It deletes the user inserted   text but doesn't delete the suggestion portion of the URL (highlighted in   Linux  not in Windows).    I was expecting it to delete everything -- the suggestion as well as the   part I'd typed.    Additionally  if I had typed:    google.com/rea  and it suggested  google.com/reader  and I pressed ctrl+backspace  I would expect:  google.com/  currently I get:  google.com/der </pre>
