<title>Issue 8659 -   chromium -    Accelerator handling Linux problems. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our current accelerator handling seems to be having two problems:    - We are starving individual widgets of the keystrokes.  For example  try   to ctrl-v in omnibox  and you get:    [15596:15596:2322206833223:WARNING:browser/browser.cc(1252)] Received   Unimplemented Command: 36003    We are eating that keystroke  and it's never getting to the Omnibox widget.    This means copy/paste via the keyboard is completely broken for Omnibox.    - The page doesn't get the key.    Go to the bottom of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html</a> and check   'keydown'.  Hit ctrl-l.  On Linux  the page only sees the ctrl key  it   never sees the l key.  On Windows  we correctly give the page a chance to   handle it.  The correct output should be:    keydown  keyCode is 17  charCode is 0    keydown  keyCode is 76  charCode is 0    The 76 is the page getting a chance to handle the l keypress. </pre>
