<title>Issue 6 -   chromium -    Chrome treats links in frames differently than Firefox does. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Other browsers tested: Firefox         Safari 3: Not Tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: Not Tested        I have a webpage that I use for monitoring my network using Nagios   (nagios.org).  It is composed of three frames. Each frame is a different   nagios installation webpage monitoring the network from outside  inside and   under special circumstances respectively.      Using Firefox when I click a link (to a .cgi generated report page) in any   frame it takes me to that .cgi generated reporting page inside that frame.      Using Chrome it behaves properly in the top frame of the frameset  but in   the lower two frames when I click a link with the exact same .cgi code and   link properties it opens the page in a new tab instead of in the frame.        </pre>
