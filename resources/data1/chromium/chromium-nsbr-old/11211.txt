<title>Issue 11211 -   chromium -    OWA right click context menu does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Select email from queue and attempt to mark it as unread with right   click.  OWA context menu options are not available.  2.  Recommend allowing right click context menu for specific sites.  3.  I need to access and use OWA with Chrome  without the right click   context menu I am significantly hampered.    What is the expected result?  Context menu allowing specific email actions.      What happens instead?  Cut - paste - copy options come up instead.    &gt;&gt;&gt; I know this has been addressed before  but I must add my vote that   right click context menus are required to use Chrome in my work   environment.    <b>Please provide
