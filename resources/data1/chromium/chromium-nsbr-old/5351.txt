<title>Issue 5351 -   chromium -    Bookmark bubble - keyboard focus on Remove invisible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33      1. Open the bookmark bubble (click star)  2. Press tab 4 times. Now the link Remove is focused  but it's not visible.  3. Press Enter now closes the dialog  while Space activates the Remove   link. Two strange problems  in one bug report (sorry)      Remove would somehow show when it's focused and available to the keyboard.   </pre>
