<title>Issue 6816 -   chromium -    Header/footer placement when printing RTL pages					 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;b/1126503&gt;    From Jeremy:    a few of us were discussing the correct placement of headers &amp; footers when   printing RTL pages  we just wanted to post the question here to open up the   discussion.    I've attached a scan of how we currently print a webpage  we put the date &amp;   page title in the header and URL &amp; page number in the footer with the page   number on the right side.    The issue is under what circumstances to flip the header and footer so the   page number and date are on the left side of the page.  This is useful if   you print a few RTL pages  bind them together and expect the page numbers   to be on the opposite side from the binding.    IE &amp; FF appear to always print the header and footer the same regardless of   page directionality or UI language (they never flip).    From some internal discussions we were thinking of flipping ONLY if the   following two conditions are true:  1. Chrome's UI language is RTL.  2. The page's directionality is RTL (it doesn't ever seem to make sense to   flip the header &amp; footer for an English page).    Does anyone have any input on this proposale?   </pre>
