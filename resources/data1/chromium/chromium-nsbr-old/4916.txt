<title>Issue 4916 -   chromium -    Find bar tooltips can get stuck and fail to disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Show the find bar (Ctrl+F)  2. Hover over one of the Find bar controls (Previous  Next or Close find   bar)  3. Move the mouse to somewhere outside the Chrome window fast enough that   no intermediate mouse motion frames cause a mouseover within the Chrome   window      The associated tooltip that appears should disappear.      The tooltip remains. It also doesn't disappear when the mouse returns to   the Chrome window  unless the mouse touches the Find bar itself. Other   tooltips appear independently of the stuck tooltip. The Find bar can also   be closed with the keyboard but the tooltip stays there  now until the Find   bar is reopened and hovered over.    Please provide
