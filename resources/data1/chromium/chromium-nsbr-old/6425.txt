<title>Issue 6425 -   chromium -    Make UniscribeStateTextRun::nextWinFontData work with SegmentedFontData - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Address a FIXME that was added to UniscribeStateTextRun.cpp during webkit   merge 28723:29478    Webkit@<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29250">r29250</a> refactored FontData into a base class for SimpleFontData and   SegmentedFontData.  This was done to support the unicode-range property in @font-face rules.  What was formerly FontData became SimpleFontData; SegmentedFontData was   introduced for obtaining different SimpleFontData at different character   ranges.    webkit/port/platform/UniscribeStateTextRun.cpp needs to be reworked so that   it gets the proper SimpleFontData out of a SegmentedFontData  (the current hack only works if the FontData !isSegmented()).   </pre>
