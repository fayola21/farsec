<title>Issue 6139 -   chromium -    RTL: Mixed-direction text in select controls should match direction of items in menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Test URL:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=14607&amp;action=view">https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=14607&amp;action=view</a>    Open the test URL in ToT build  there's a popup with two items. In the menu  that pops up  both items have the word &quot;English&quot; on the left and the Hebrew  word on the right. However  when the second item is selected  the popup  button shows the words in reverse order: Hebrew on the left and English on  the right.      1.

Webkit bug: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13775">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13775</a>     However  I cannot reproduce it on Webkit nightly build and Safari 3.2.1    3. On Chrome branch 1.0.154.42 (Official Build 7335)  the word order even  reversed on the pop up menu  Firefox and IE7 is doing the same as Chrome  branch.         </pre>
