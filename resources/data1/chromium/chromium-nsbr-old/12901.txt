<title>Issue 12901 -   chromium -    Taskbar flickers in vista when chrome is maximized and loading new website  gmail  pandora - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Open chrome and maximize the window  browse from google.com to cnn.com   and watch the task bar immediately after you hit enter. It will flicker   white once.  2. Load gmail as an application shortcut in chrome that loads maximized.   The task bar will flicker repeatedly as the page loads (~ 5 times). This is   assuming chrome has your gmail account settings saved already and the   application shortcut is loading fully  logging you into your gmail account.  3.Open pandora.com as an application shortcut  maximized. The taskbar will   flicker multiple times as the site loads. This also assumes your account   user and pass is saved and that the page is loading fully.        The start menu task bar (bar along the bottom of the screen that's part of   the OS) should not flicker when when you load a new webpage.        The task bar is flickering when chrome is maximized and a new webpage is   loaded. If I already have chrome maximized and one web page is already   fully loaded  when i go to the address and bar and type a new web site   address (i.e. going from cnn.com to msnbc.com) the task bar will flicker   once. Flickering occurs repeatedly if i load a website that appears to be   using ajax  like pandora.com or gmail.com    <b>Please provide
