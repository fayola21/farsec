<title>Issue 16387 -   chromium -    Need an NSS change to read system-wide SSL root certificates on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NSS currently does not have the ability to read system-wide root  certificates from /etc/ssl/certs. I believe  it does have the ability to  read per-user certificates from the user's home directory.    (N.b. this is based on my experience dealing with NSS in Firefox  I haven't  actually looked into how this is currently set up in Chrome)    For system-wide certificates  you have to recompile libnss.so with a new  set of certificates  each time you want to add one:    <a href="http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/gsec/4088.php">http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/gsec/4088.php</a>    This is a problem for corporate environments  where IT departments would  want to deploy root certificates to the entire fleet of machines.   </pre>
