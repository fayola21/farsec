<title>Issue 8915 -   chromium -    Download folder can not be opened if downloaded file has already been deleted (Need a way to open downloads folder) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : ALL    Download Area is not opening if there exists no download.      I want to look into the download area  if I saved an e-book.        for example  saving is realized through the pdf-plugin   but if Chrome does not saved something &quot;official&quot;   there exists that file in downloads but you cannot open it   through Chrome. You must go extra into &quot;my own files&quot;...       </pre>
