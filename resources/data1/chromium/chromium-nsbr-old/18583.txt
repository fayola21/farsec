<title>Issue 18583 -   chromium -    Tweaks to bookmarks.create API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  not specifying a parentId causes an error. Instead  the bookmark should get added to a   default location (presumably &quot;Other bookmarks&quot;  though possibly the last used location).    It would also be nice to provide constants for the Bookmarks Bar and Other Bookmarks   (parentId:&quot;BOOKMARKS_BAR&quot;).    Finally  the API returns an error if you supply an integer for the parentId instead of a string. Can we   just convert integers into strings for this?    -Nick </pre>
