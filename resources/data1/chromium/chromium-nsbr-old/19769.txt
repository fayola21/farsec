<title>Issue 19769 -   chromium -    Duplicate bookmark is created when editing bookmark URL by Client A and B at the same time.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1956259    [Environment]  Chromium: 3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19432)  WebKit: 531.2  V8: 1.2.9  User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.2 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.191.0 Safari/531.2    [Step]  1) Chrome installed on client A &amp; B - Both clients online and connected to   sync server with same account  2) Client A add 1 bookmark on Bookmark Bar 'Google' with URL   'www.google.com'  3) wait for sync to complete syncing  4) Client A right click on the bookmark created at step 2 and select   'Edit'  change the URL to www.cnn.com  5) Client B right click on the bookmark created at step 2 and select   'Edit'  change the URL to www.cnn.com  6) Client A and B hit 'OK' button at the same time    [Actual Result]  Duplicate bookmark (Name 'Google'  URL 'www.cnn.com') is created    This is almost certainly an effect of the fact that renames are implemented   as delete+recreate in the bookmark model.  This could be fixed cleanly by   changing the BookmarkModel to support actual URL updates.   </pre>
