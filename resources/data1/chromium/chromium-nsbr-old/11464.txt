<title>Issue 11464 -   chromium -    We don't repeat thead elements correctly when printing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> IE7  IE8 and FF3 reportly handle table-header-group correctly and print it  at the top of each page which the table spans:    &quot;table-header-group  (In HTML: THEAD)      Like 'table-row-group'  but for visual formatting  the row group is  always displayed before all other rows and row groups and after any top  captions. Print user agents may repeat header rows on each page spanned by  a table. If a table contains multiple elements with 'display:  table-header-group'  only the first is rendered as a header; the others are  treated as if they had 'display: table-row-group'. &quot;    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html</a>    See the original report for a testcase:    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=2661c0ad29650d42&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=2661c0ad29650d42&amp;hl=en</a> </pre>
