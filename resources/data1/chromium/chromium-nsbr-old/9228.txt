<title>Issue 9228 -   chromium -    revert.py is really half baked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. It fails when there is one file modified in one root subdirectory  2. It fails on svn &lt; 1.5  3. It fails on a normal gclient checkout      &quot;Should just work&quot;  I think the best way would be to create a partial checkout in a temporary   directory and revert from there.  If it doesn't support svn 1.4  it should at least correctly barf an error   on it. </pre>
