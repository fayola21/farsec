Open &quot;my google&quot; home page with the layout like attached screenshot.  2. Open combobox  3. Drag scrollbar using mouse      Scrollbar displayed correctly and moves to the bottom.      Scrollbar moves a little  and after that it is getting cut on the bottom.   Visual reaction on the mouse-over become incorrect  like all the regions   are cut from the bottom. The cut coordinates are all different.    I've verified this on two different machines.   </pre>
