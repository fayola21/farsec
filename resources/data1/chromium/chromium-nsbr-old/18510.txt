<title>Issue 18510 -   chromium -    Single automated sign-in when using a proxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Opening Google Chrome Browser.  2.Chrome then asks you to type your User Name and Password if you are using   a proxy  if not it continues.        If the User Name and Password are the same as previously used  then it will   just use the previously cache one and continue. If the password has   changed  then it will first ask for an updated password and then continue   to open the pages it needs to. So it therefore does a check that the   authentication is correct  if it is  then it continues with the following   actions.

So if 5 tabs were open the last time you closed Chrome  then 5 tabs   will open and each individually ask for User Name and Password.      <b>Please provide
