<title>Issue 13926 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Cursor flickering over omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Move the mouse back and forth across a non-empty omnibox.  The cursor   flickers between a pointer and an i-beam.  Most noticeable on slow systems.    This may be because we are setting a default window cursor as one of the many   arguments to creating windows  and we can just stop setting it in WindowWin   or WidgetWin or whatever.   </pre>
