<title>Issue 19979 -   chromium -    task manager entry points broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right clicking on the title bar and choosing &quot;task manager&quot; no longer seems   to actually start the task manager. Additionally  if you're in gmail and the   focus is anywhere on the page  shift+esc doesn't bring up the task manager   anywhere. Not sure if the two are related or not. </pre>
