<title>Issue 9041 -   chromium -    Able to drop a tab onto a Chrome app - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch a web page as an app in Chrome  2. Launch a web page in Chrome  3. Create a new tab  4. Drag the new tab over to the app window        I'm not sure what we want to happen here  but the result currently is a bit   weird. The tab animates as if dropped into a tabstrip  then disappears and   the only way to get back to the app that was originally open in the app   window is to press Ctrl+W to close it (Back is not enabled).   </pre>
