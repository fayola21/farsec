<title>Issue 16809 -   chromium -    JavaScript console dock to window hides it forever - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	3.0.195.0 (Developer Build 20726)    [confirmed in unstable package as well]      1. Start fresh Chromium 20726 (latest)  2. Click the &quot;Control the current page&quot; icon  3. Choose Developer &gt; JavaScript console  4. Click &quot;Dock to main window&quot; icon at bottom left of JavaScript console  5. JavaScript console disappears  6. Repeat 1-3: JavaScript console will not load      JavaScript console should dock to the main window (honestly  don't even   know what that means  I just got click happy and then I couldn't get it   back).  If this functionality is not available on Linux  or will take a   while  it would be nice if the functionality was simply disabled until it   was working.  But it's understandable that this is an unstable build and   things are expected not to work.      JavaScript console disappears and doesn't come back.   </pre>
