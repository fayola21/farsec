<title>Issue 751 -   chromium -    Suggestion : Add an option for title bar in maximised mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      It should be possible to add space above the tabs when in maximised mode    same as there is when in windowed mode. Ideally the space could be set to   whatever height  as there being an invisible border that can be dragged to   give more or less space above the tabs.    First  it would be useful for some  like me  that use to have Winamp on the   top of the screen  usually obscuring a useless part of the window. I   believe that it was a good choice to delete that wasted space but I would   like to at least have the option to change that.    Also  it would be useful if the titles could be bigger in some way  as many   titles do not fit on the tabs even when there are only a few of them    because sometimes relevant information is displayed in the titles and it is   bothersome to have to hover to see the full title. Having an option for a   title bar would be a possible alternative remedy to that (possibly having   the title only display when the space above tabs is sufficiently big).    Thanks. </pre>
