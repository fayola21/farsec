<title>Issue 20176 -   chromium -    SSL errors from XHR in workers should result in failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An XHR from a worker that results in an SSL error (even one previously   accepted by the user  such as a CN mismatch) should be treated as a Network   Error (e.g. silently fail). This is in the spec for XHR everywhere  it's not   clear if we can do it everywhere (may break some existing use case  need to   be sure)  but certainly for workers where there are no existing use cases we   should adhere to the spec here. Also avoids some nasty UI issues - if there's   no window  what UI would you visibly degrade? (Certainly a nightmare for   shared workers).
