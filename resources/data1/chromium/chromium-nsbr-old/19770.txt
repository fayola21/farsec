<title>Issue 19770 -   chromium -    download dialog can't fit small windows/popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php</a>    (just one of many...)      1. make Chrome window really small or go to a download site that will open   a small pop-up for confirm the download  2. click the file to be download that requires confirmation (like a .exe)      The download bar shows up with some sign of the file to be   downloaded/confirmation dialog.      The download bar shows up  but it is blank until the window is resized.   Some users many not guess that the window needs to be horizontally expanded   to see the dialog. </pre>
