<title>Issue 8116 -   chromium -    Not working while playing FlyFF. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Startup FlyFF  2. Startup Chrome        That the &quot;New tab&quot;-page will be shown  and the correct site will be shown   while browsing.      When starting up the &quot;New tab&quot; page aint shown as its supposed to. No page   at all is loaded  its all blank (1 on picture).  Then  when I try to browse to any page  whichever  I'm redirected to   about:blank and get the following message (roughly translated from   swedish): &quot;An error occured while the site was shown. Continue by click on   Reload or visit another site&quot; (2 on picture).  When I try to hit reload or F5  nothing happens.  Any other shortcut combinations (Ctrl + W  Ctrl + T etc) is also not   working but while focusing the address field the shortcuts works again.  Everytime after this when I try to browse to another site it gets blank   again  but the address is filled with the correct address.    Please provide
