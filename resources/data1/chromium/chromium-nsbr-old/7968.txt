<title>Issue 7968 -   chromium -    Running reliability_tests.exe on Vista with --list doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I run    Debugreliability_tests --list=C:tempchromebugs7951urls.txt --  iterations=1 --timeout=1200    The urls.txt file has one url.  Running it on Vista always brings up Chrome   with about:blank and it never navigates to the urls. </pre>
