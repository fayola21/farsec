<title>Issue 14334 -   chromium -    [www.iaa.gov.il]: TLV's airport official landings and takeoffs page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.iaa.gov.il/RASHAT/he-IL/Airports/BenGurion/informationForTravelers/OnlineFlights.aspx?AorDFlight=A">http://www.iaa.gov.il/RASHAT/he-IL/Airports/BenGurion/informationForTravelers/OnlineFlights.aspx?AorDFlight=A</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?  The list of landings/takeoffs sometimes does not show  and sometimes takes the user to <a href="http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/he-IL/Rashot/BrowserSystemMessage.aspx">http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/he-IL/Rashot/BrowserSystemMessage.aspx</a> where it says the site   only works on IE.          What is the expected result?  To see the landings/takeoffs list.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to the above URL  2. Switch between takings/landoffs.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  It works in IE8. On FF3 I get to the &quot;wrong browser&quot; page.           </pre>
