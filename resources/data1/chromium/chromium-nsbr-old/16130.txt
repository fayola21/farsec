<title>Issue 16130 -   chromium -    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list keeps reappearing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19935">r19935</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04    I think it's neat that Google Chrome automatically adds the Google   Repository whenever it is run. However  some people like to keep their apt   sources organized. If anything  the apt source should only appear on first   run  and never again.    I suggest making a separate package called &quot;google-keyring&quot; or similar    like some other repositories do  such as Medibuntu. The package installs   the apt source into /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  and also the keyring for   Google's packages  then the user is free to rearrange their apt sources.    Hopefully  if Canonical will implement repository addition in apturl  this   problem will be a moot point. There have been many ideas about it at   brainstorm.ubuntu.com  but Canonical has not said anything yet. </pre>
