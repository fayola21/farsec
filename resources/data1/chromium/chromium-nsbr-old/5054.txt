<title>Issue 5054 -   chromium -    [magic_browzr] Window frame drawn incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Vista  Glen tells me we use a trick for maximized mode where we leave   the frame border intact but size the window such that it's outside the   visible screen.  With magic_browzr  we appear to be doing something like   this on XP as well  and it's resulting in noticeable glitches.  Several   pixels on each edge of the titlebar are cut off (noticeable on tab tops and   caption buttons)  and the status bubble  which due to <a title="Status bubble at wrong x-coord in maximized mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4373"> issue 4373 </a> should be   erroneously inset by (width of frame) from the screen edge  is lined up   with the screen edge. </pre>
