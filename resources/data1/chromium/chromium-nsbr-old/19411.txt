<title>Issue 19411 -   chromium -    resize image of 100% takes on containers size not images  also with div  span - sometimes?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.size a div using px - say 500px x 500px   2.put an image inside it - set by style of say 50% (image was say 100px x   100px)  3.view image - will be 250px x 250px!!      the image to be 50px x 50px      An image appears to take on the height of the containing object not the   image itself!!  if you have a container of 500px x 500px and set the internal image (was   say 100px x 100px) and you ask to resize to 50% the images size will now be   250px x 250px - ooops  (it also appears to do the same for other objects - div  span etc)  good luck!  ps. I've been looking at net for solution and a number of people seem to   have similar problems - most haven't yet figured it out - their still   trying workarounds -     <b>Please provide
