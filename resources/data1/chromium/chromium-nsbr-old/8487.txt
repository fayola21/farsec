<title>Issue 8487 -   chromium -    The SpellcheckWordBreakIterator class should use ICU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Moved from internal bug b/1224367.    The current SpellcheckWordBreakIterator class does not use ICU because its  character attibutes does not match with the one of hunspell and this  inconsistency causes a problem in filtering out non-word characters.  On the other hand  ICU implements an excellent algorithm for word  segmentation of internationalized texts and we should use it to improve the  quality of the spell checker.      Comments from Jungshik:  -----------------------------  Hironori   it might be better to change WordAwareIterator in Webkit (and  pass it along to the upstream) than making a change on our side. If I  understand correctly   for a &quot;word&quot; (passed from webkit to us) actually  made up of multiple words  we can only check the spelling for the first of  them.  By modifying Webkit to pass a real single word   we can avoid that  problem  I believe.    BTW  I realized that it's a little tricky for Thai because Thai segmenter  is based on dictionary.   And  I'm not sure how ICU word-break behaves  coming across misspelled words.     </pre>
