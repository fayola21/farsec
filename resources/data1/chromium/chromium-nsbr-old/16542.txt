<title>Issue 16542 -   chromium -    thumbnails titlebar shows too soon on NNTP passing hover over with the mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> in my personal opinion there should be a delay btw passing hover over   thumbnail with mouse and the titlebar appearing. at the status quo if i pass   to a thumbnail to another quickly with the mouse the titlebar shows up for   every thumbnail that I pass hover with the mouse... This behaviour for me is   quite annoyng... In my personal opinion is more frequent using thumbnails   only for reach the site  instead removing or pinning it  so the titlebar   should show up after a while (i dont know  4 example 2 second)only if I have   my mouse on it and not interacting for a while </pre>
