<title>Issue 6732 -   chromium -    Wrong Chrome path association when trying to set it as the default browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I try to set Chrome as the default browser without administrator   privileges  when other browser is the default.  2. I get the usual error  but now it's a window that says &quot;This file does   not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an   association in the Set Associations control panel&quot;.  The title of that   window must be Chrome install path  but I can see that when my profile   folder is composed by two (or more) words separated by a space (e.g.   &quot;C:UsersFirstWord SecondWordAppData...&quot; etc)  the path title of that   window is only 'C:UsersFirstWord'.  I think there is a problem related to   it.                  Please provide
