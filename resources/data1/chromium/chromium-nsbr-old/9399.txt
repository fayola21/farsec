<title>Issue 9399 -   chromium -    Win7: &quot;Browse for folder&quot; repaints options tab couple of times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12555">r12555</a>).  OS: Win7 Ultimate - 32-bit.  Happens only in Win7 only.    -Go to Chrome Options/Minor Tweaks tab  -Click on &quot;Browse...&quot; button to show 'Browser for folder' dialog.    Before &quot;Browser for folder&quot; dialog is displayed  the minor tweaks tab is  repainted couple of times that makes the displaying the dialog ugly. </pre>
