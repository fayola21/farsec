<title>Issue 5077 -   chromium -    Add more LoadState values to load_states.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add more LoadState values to load_states.h to reflect the   additional load states we have access to in the new HTTP stack    specifically the following states of HttpNetworkTransaction:    STATE_INIT_CONNECTION (waiting for ClientSocketPool)  establishing_tunnel_  STATE_SSL_CONNECT_OVER_TUNNEL    Question: should we refine the LOAD_STATE_SENDING_REQUEST state into two   states  to reflect these two states of HttpNetworkTransaction?    STATE_WRITE_HEADERS  STATE_WRITE_BODY   </pre>
