So this is the bug for this cleanup. I have a few ideas and few questions.    First  I thought about making a constant kNewline  in base/basictypes.h or   base/string_util.h (which one would be better?). It would be rn on   Windows and n on everything else.    Which occurences should be replaced? It looks to me that in base/ this   would be safe  but in net/ not so (in HTTP protocol handling for example). </pre>
