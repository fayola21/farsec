<title>Issue 19533 -   chromium -    Cmd+Left/Right arrows don't work for back/forward - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make sure a text field isn't focused on a web page  and that you have some   back/forward history in this tab.  2. Press Cmd+Left/Right arrow.        Expected: page should navigate back/forward.    Actual: nothing.     </pre>
