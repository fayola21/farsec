<title>Issue 7556 -   chromium -    Debugger: improve plugin interaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To avoid browser hangs  we're now ignoring plugin messages when the   javascript debugger is attached.  This means you can't debug interactions   with plugins at all.  While this may be hopeless to fix  it may be an   improvement to at least selectively enable these messages while the   debugger isn't paused.  (issue converted from internal bugs db) </pre>
