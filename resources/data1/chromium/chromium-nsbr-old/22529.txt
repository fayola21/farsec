<title>Issue 22529 -   chromium -    Auto-refresh pages cause Spaces to switch to that window's space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure offhand if this is 10.6-specific      1. Enable spaces  2. Open a page with auto-refresh (e.g.  the Chromium waterfall with a   refresh= argument) in space A  3. Open a Chrome window in space B  and leave it active    As soon as the refresh happens  you are switched to space A. Interestingly    this *only* seems to happen if Chrome is the active application.    I think we really need to fix this for beta. </pre>
