<title>Issue 9711 -   chromium -    Mismatched comments inside javascript block changes page rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.173.0 (Developer Build 13084)        1. Download and open the attached web page reduction.htm  2. Note that the text is invisible in Chrome (and Safari 4)  but not in FF3  or IE7.    3. Download and open the attached web page reduction2.htm. The difference  is that a closing comment has been added to the second block of javascript.  4. Note that the text is now visible in Chrome.    The other browsers are able to handle the missing comment. It looks like a  javascript issue  but the fact that Safari has the same problem is also  suspicious.   </pre>
