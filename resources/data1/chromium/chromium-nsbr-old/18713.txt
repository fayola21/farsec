<title>Issue 18713 -   chromium -    New Chrome windows should not open beyond the dock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 3.0.197.12  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open multiple Chrome Windows in your primary monitor.    Expected:  Chrome should not open a new window which touches the dock.  The new windows position should shift when it starts getting into the dock area like in Safari.    Actual:  Chrome launches new windows till it hits the deck and continues opening new ones at the   bottom of the screen.      Screenshot attached.     </pre>
