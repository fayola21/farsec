<title>Issue 11953 -   chromium -    Unable to locate applet - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  Google Chrome	1.0.154.65 (Official Build )  WebKit	525.19  V8	0.3.9.4  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.65 Safari/525.19            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Find a page that uses a java applet as a broker to communicate with the   server without requesting the whole page  similar to XML http request.  2. Try to use any of the webpages Web 2.0 functionality  ie: any of the   things that would normally be implemented with an XMLHttpRequest.          Usually a dynamic change to the web page content without a reload.        You should get the error 'Unable to locate &lt;appletName&gt; applet'.    I'm sorry I can't provide a web site example  the site that gives me this   problem is an intranet site :(     </pre>
