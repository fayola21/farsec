<title>Issue 12802 -   chromium -    Chrome window doesn't show  until maximized via taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.2  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Start Google Chrome      The Google Chrome Window shows      Chrome is only available in the taskbar  but no window shows up. When right   clicking on the Chrome entry in the taskbar  and selecting maximize  the Chrome   window shows up.    I think this happens after a new version is installed (it seems chrome is   restarted non-maximized).    Another piece of info: at home I've got a 20&quot; external monitor on my 15&quot;   laptop  so the window is probably outside the screen area. I also confirmed   this with the test (moving the window by keyboard shortcuts): select chrome    press alt+space and then M  and press arrow left and arrow up. </pre>
