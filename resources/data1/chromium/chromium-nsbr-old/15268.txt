<title>Issue 15268 -   chromium -    NNTP: Action buttons should listen to return key events. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Filing this  as the <a title="Implement keyboard navigation for the options menu of the new new tab page" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14959"> issue 14959 </a> does not cover this.    In NNTP  Action buttons (Show/Hide Thumbnails  Show/Hide the list) should   listen to return key events.    They do listen for 'Space bar' events.    PS: I'm not talking about options drop-down menu.   </pre>
