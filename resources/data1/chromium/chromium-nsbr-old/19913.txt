<title>Issue 19913 -   chromium -    Breakpads missing from browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Google Chrome.app from the command line.  You must be using   a Breakpad-enabled official release build  and you must have consented to   crash reporting.  This bug is only present in Breakpad-enabled official   release builds since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23686">r23686</a>  and there has been no dev channel release   matching that description yet.  And hopefully there never will be.      This message is produced:    [0820/205231:WARNING:/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/app/breakpad_mac.  mm(58)] Breakpad disabled    It only appears once.  It's coming from the browser process.  Breakpad is   enabled in the renderers.    We enable or disable Breakpad based on this code in   chrome/app/breakpad_mac.mm:      bool enable_breakpad =        is_browser ? GoogleUpdateSettings::GetCollectStatsConsent() :                     CommandLine::ForCurrentProcess()-&gt;                         HasSwitch(switches::kEnableCrashReporter);    In the browser process  we call   GoogleUpdateSettings::GetCollectStatsConsent() in   chrome/browser/google_update_settings_posix.cc.  It does this:      FilePath consent_file;    PathService::Get(chrome::DIR_USER_DATA  &amp;consent_file);    consent_file = consent_file.Append(kConsentToSendStats);    and then enables or disables Breakpad based essentially on the presence of   the file.    At the point in the browser process startup where we call PathService::Get    it returns false without setting consent_file.  The Chrome path provider has   not yet been added to the path service. </pre>
