<title>Issue 10988 -   chromium -    closing an unresponsive tab takes more than one click at times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.175.0      1. Go to some page where there is a confirmation dialog to delete something  - which hangs Chrome (i.e. twitter.com and delete an update)  2. Try to close the tab by clicking on the 'X' button of the tab       Clicking on the X takes more than one click ..sometimes a few to close the  tab... or sometimes  you have to kill the process thru the activity monitor        </pre>
