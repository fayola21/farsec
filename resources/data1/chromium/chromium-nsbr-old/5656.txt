<title>Issue 5656 -   chromium -    allow standard buttons for window actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.39    Need an option to show window buttons (Minimize-Maximize/Restore-Close) in   a standard MS Windows way. Presently they are sized and positioned   differently  which makes  difficult to mass minimize windows  if Chrome and   other programs (especially other browsers) are used together  especially if   trackpoint is used. </pre>
