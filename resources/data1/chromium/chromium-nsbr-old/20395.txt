<title>Issue 20395 -   chromium -    Tab is removed from the main window after switching to it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43      1. Open gmail.com in tab_1.  2. Open google docs in tab_2.  3. Switch from tab 1 to tab_2 by clicking a tab. Move the mouse downwards   right after clicking.      Tab_2 opens successfully      Sometimes tab_2 gets removed from main chrome window into separate one.  I suggest that there should be a small timeout after selecting a different   tab  before user can move the tab outside the window.   </pre>
