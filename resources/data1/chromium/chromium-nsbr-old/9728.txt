<title>Issue 9728 -   chromium -    Download confirmation dialogue is wrongly displayed full screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0  may happen in 2.0.172.2 also (please   test)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      0. This was tested on Vista Ultimate 64-bit with all patches/updates   installed.  1. Right-click Chrome shortcut in Windows.  2. Click Properties.  3. In the &quot;Run&quot; drop-down menu  set to &quot;Maximized.&quot;  4.  Click OK.  5.  Run Chrome. (Open by clicking the shortcut).  6.  Download any file.      It should stay &quot;small&quot; at the bottom of the current window  just like if   Chrome is started from a shortcut where &quot;Run&quot; is set to &quot;Normal&quot;  the   &quot;Maximized&quot; setting should only apply to the browser itself  not sub-  contained notifications/dialog boxes  etc.      The &quot;Do you want to save this file  Yes or No?&quot; download confirmation   dialog box will be maximized and take up the entire area of the window.    This is incorrect behavior. </pre>
