<title>Issue 15703 -   chromium -    Download bar does not close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I am not able to reproduce it. I just noticed at some point in time that   the bar was partially hidden behind the window's contents and not   closeable. Clicking on the small x on the right does not close the download   bar. However  the bar is fully functional (starting downloaded files and   &quot;Show all downloads&quot; work).  Downloading a new file in any tab will bring to front the download bar (or   a new one  I don't know). Assuming it is a new one  this one is closable.   But behind this one rests the lower half of the &quot;old&quot;  unclosable one  but   updated with all the new downloads in it.  Other than with the working download bar (Screen 1)  the page extends   straight to the bottom  being partially covered by the download bar (Screen   2).    <b>Please provide
