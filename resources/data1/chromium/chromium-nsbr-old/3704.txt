<title>Issue 3704 -   chromium -    IdleTimerTest.RepeatNotIdle and IdleTimerTest.NoRepeatNotIdle in base_unittests are very flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test accounts for ~50% of the redness in the modules builders. Would be great if someone   familiar with it could take a quick look at making it more stable. </pre>
