<title>Issue 168 -   chromium -    Excessive hard disk activity every 10-20 minutes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Just use Chrome normally during a long period (more than 30 minutes)  2. Every 10-20 minutes (I have not timed it) a lot of HD activity starts    If I use File Monitor (filemon.exe) to see what it's going on  I can see   hundreds of thousands of writes to 'Safe Browsing' and 'Safe Browsing-  journal' files during about a minute. It's not very annoying by the moment    but I am not sure if this is normal.    Furthermore  the 'Safe Browsing' file is 40 MB  and growing.    I am using XP SP3. </pre>
