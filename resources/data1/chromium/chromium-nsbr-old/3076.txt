<title>Issue 3076 -   chromium -    Remove iphlpapi.dll from the dependencies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This DLL slows down startup. It is used in NetworkStateNotifierWin which we   don't really need very much right now. We can do an alternate   implementation of this in the future that goes through the browser process   to avoid loading this DLL in every renderer.   </pre>
