<title>Issue 12676 -   chromium -    Fetch NTP thumbnails for imported history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Let's look into fetching thumbnails that are missing (because they were   imported  for example). The key is to do this in a way that doesn't hurt  performance. This should be doable  since:  * we fetch pages in the background all the time when loading multiple tabs.  * if these pages are frequently visited  they're likely to be top-level  pages  and not likely to have side-effects.       </pre>
