<title>Issue 13325 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar should be shown by default when Chrome is installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28    Have Chrome installed with the bookmarks bar shown by default. Most users  do need it  and are hesitant to play with the setting in order to get it shown.      One has to muck with the menus in order for this to show.   </pre>
