<title>Issue 22077 -   chromium -    WMP's NPAPI plugin installer fails if Firefox isn't installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I found that if Firefox is not installed  then the Windows Media Player   Firefox plugin installer won't install the np-mswmp.dll.   This is a problem   for Chrome and Safari users who don't have Firefox installed.  This document   describes the standard way that NPAPI plugins register themself in case   they're installed before the browser:   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Plugins/The_First_Install_Problem">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Plugins/The_First_Install_Problem</a>    Ideally  the installer would always copy the dll to a specific location   (Program FilesWindows Media Player) and then just set the MozillaPlugins so   that browsers can find it.    I've sent emails to WMP developers  waiting to hear back. </pre>
