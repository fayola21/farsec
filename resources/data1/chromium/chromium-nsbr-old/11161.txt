<title>Issue 11161 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Allow Tracking of Web-history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Toolbar in other browsers allows the tracking of web-history when the   Google Toolbar is logged-in to a Google account.    There is no Google Toolbar for Chrome and thus it is a much needed feature in   Google Chrome for an option to allow tracking of websites visited and save   them onto a logged-in Google account.   </pre>
