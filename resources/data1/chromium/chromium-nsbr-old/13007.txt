<title>Issue 13007 -   chromium -    Amazon UK Segmentation Fault in SkScalerContext_FreeType::generateFontMetrics - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 17294  OS + version : Fedora 8/9  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001T8W2LW/">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001T8W2LW/</a>    Chrome works fine  except for Amazon UK which causes an Aw Snap. The   frontpage <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">http://www.amazon.co.uk</a> doesn't  but selecting any item does.    The URL is just an example. It does briefly display the rendered page   before the Aw Snap. It happens with and without msttcorefonts  but the   backtrace is without them.          <a href="http://pastebin.com/m436897d2">http://pastebin.com/m436897d2</a>   </pre>
