<title>Issue 6794 -   chromium -    History URL Provider needs to use prefix list when checking for exact matches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit https://internalsite/ successfully once  and type &quot;i&quot;  and you'll get   inline-autocompleted to &quot;internalsite/&quot;  with the match being to the https   site.  Good.  Now visit internalsite/page several times  and type &quot;internalsit&quot;.  You get   inline-autocompleted to &quot;internalsite/page&quot;.  But when you type &quot;e&quot;  you're   still inline autocompleted.    The reason is because when the History URL provider does the override check   to see if the current input is an exact match  it doesn't use the prefix   list the way we do in the main autocomplete loop.  Since the input is   &quot;internalsite&quot; it doesn't catch the https match.    This can cause users to type an exact location they've been before and yet   have inline autocomplete override (and frustrate) them. </pre>
