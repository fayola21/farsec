<title>Issue 12678 -   chromium -    Drawing artifacts when scrolling in Google Docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested with a ToT Release build:      1. Open a Doc for editing that's longer than will fit in the window  2. Scroll up and down        The content bleeds up over the toolbar and header area  sometimes only   partially drawing so that it causes vertical tearing.    May be a dup of <a title="Painting Windows with Frames Results in Artifacts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12365"> issue 12365 </a>; the symptoms are very similar. </pre>
