<title>Issue 13505 -   chromium -    link rel prefetching should be implemented to reduce page load latency - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mozilla has a cool feature that allows content to *suggest* that an   additional URL be prefetched.  As an example  this is used by some search   vendors to cause a browser to prefetch the highest ranking content when the    content author (search vendor) believes there is a high probability that   the user will soon click on the indicated link.    This is nicely described in:  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Link_prefetching_FAQ">https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Link_prefetching_FAQ</a>    Note that the hooks are almost already in place in Chromium  as we need to   parse out this &lt;link rel=&quot;prefetch&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt; tag at the same time as we   parse out &lt;link rel=&quot;dns-prefetch&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;. When this parsing was   upstreamed to Webkit  a change was made in   HTMLLinkElement::tokenizeRelAttribute() in HTMLLinkElement.cpp  but we   didn't also include the corresponding parsing of the plain  &quot;prefetch&quot; tag.    We need to upstream that plumbing to WebKit  and then implement the backend   prefetching of the content (...in the background... and to the extent to   which we think it is reasonable for a user).       </pre>
