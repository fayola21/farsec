<title>Issue 15745 -   chromium -    Chrome does not support the HTML EMBED tag &quot;pluginspage&quot; attribute - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Produce an .XPI or .CRX file that contains an NPAPI plugin.  (Whether     to use an .XPI or .CRX file or even some other format depends on what     mechanism the Chrome Team decide to use for downloading).    2. Produce a test HTML file that references the file to be downloaded     (need to modify the type and pluginspage attributes):        &lt;html&gt;      &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;      &lt;body&gt;        &lt;embed id=&quot;MY_PLUGIN&quot; type=&quot;application/vnd.my-plugin&quot;         width=640 height=480         pluginspage=&quot;<a href="http://mysite.com/test/npapi/chrome/myplugin.crx">http://mysite.com/test/npapi/chrome/myplugin.crx</a>&quot;&gt;        &lt;/body&gt;      &lt;/html&gt;    3. Invoke the HTML file under the dev-channel Chrome browser         If the NPAPI plugin is not already installed  I expect the URL     referenced by the pluginspage attribute to be downloaded and installed.       Ideally  Chrome would support downloading Firefox .XPI files via the     EMBED pluginspage attribute.  Then developers can use the same file     for both Chrome and Firefox.       If that is not feasible  the next best thing would be to be able to     download Chrome .CRX files via the EMBED pluginspage attribute.
