<title>Issue 18523 -   chromium -    Linux: Bookmark bar folder does not disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Add a folder with some bookmarks to the bookmark bar.  2. Click on the folder (it will expand with a drop down menu)  3. Right-click on an entry in the folder to bring up a context menu.  4. Click somewhere else to get rid of the context menu.    The folder dropdown still sticks around (in Windows it disappears when the   context menu disappears).  Clicking elsewhere will not make it disappear.    You need to click on the folder button to bring focus back to the bookmark   bar button  and then click elsewhere to make it disappear.  It's also   interesting to note that clicking on the folder again does not make it   disappear when it's already selected.  Button down will make it disappear    but button up will reopen the drop down menu. </pre>
