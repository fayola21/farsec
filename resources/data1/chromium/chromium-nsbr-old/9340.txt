<title>Issue 9340 -   chromium -    New folders in the bookmarks bar are created at the end of it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (Build oficial 12323)      Firefox 3.x: OK    (Other browsers like IE7 or Safari 4 don't seem to allow creating folders in the bookmarks toolbar with   right-click)      1. Right click on any part of the bookmark toolbar to open the contextual menu  2. Click on 'Add folder'  3. The folder is created at the rightmost part of the bookmarks bar  instead of being created just where   you clicked.    This causes that if you have tons of bookmars in the bar  you have to 'rescue' the folder at the bottom of   the bookmarks menu and drag it back to the bookmark bar.      The new folder should be created just in the place where the user right-clicked.      The folder is created at the end of the bar  or all the way down of the bookmarks if you have enough   bookmarks for it to appear.    I think that this behavior was there since the first public version of Chrome. I am attaching a screenshot   because I know I didn't explain very well :)   </pre>
