<title>Issue 17334 -   chromium -    mime_util - chrome claims support for types that it doesnt support. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome doesnt actually support mpeg  as in mpeg2  mpg and transport streams    but it claims to for layout test reasons.  chromium doesnt support mp4  mp3 and m4a mimetypes  but claims to for layout   tests as well.  the layout tests should be switched to supported media types  which may have   to be ogg for chromium purposes  which will require a branch from safari's   media types which are mp4.   </pre>
