<title>Issue 22198 -   chromium -    Status bubbles can overlap download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a download bar by downloading something.  2. Be on some page scrolled vertically so that there's a link at the very   bottom.  Google searches work well.  3. Hover over the link at the bottom.      Expect: status bubble to not overlap the download bar.  Observe: overlap.  The overlap is kind of ugly  because the download bar   and status bubble are sort of the same &quot;class&quot; of visual element  and they   aren't really intended to be displayed one on top of the other.    This happens when the status bubble gets positioned below the content   area because it would conflict with the mouse cursor.  Maybe when this   happens we should put the status bubble below the download bar?  Not   show a status bubble in this weird case at all?      4.0.207.0  and  trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26488">r26488</a> </pre>
