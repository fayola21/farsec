<title>Issue 7874 -   chromium -    Collect UMA counters/histograms for JS and HTML errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As we start to look more and more at site compatibility  we should start to   look at more automated ways to detect compatibility errors.  While many   compatibility errors require a human to detect  often the presence of JS   and HTML errors are enough to indicate that there's a problem that should   be looked at.    We should collect counters for each occurrence of a particular error   message. Even though we can't collect associated URLs with these errors    simply the raw count of each type of JS exception and HTML parse error can   help us prioritize work.  For example  we know that the use of the IE-  specific &quot;attachEvent&quot; function is an issue  but we don't know how commonly   this error is hit in the field.  Perhaps we'd find that it's the #1   occurring error by an order of magnitude  or perhaps we'd find it wasn't   even in the top 100.  Getting concrete data would allow us to make informed   decisions.  </pre>
