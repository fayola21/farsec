<title>Issue 11172 -   chromium -    Pixels missing from New Tab bookmarks bar border - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0      1. Open a new tab  2. Maybe resize the window a bit      The bookmarks bar is surrounded by a 1px darker-blue border      One pixel on the top and bottom sides of the border is an off-white light   shade of blue. The two pixels are horizontally aligned. Where they appear   seems to change depending on the exact window width and sometimes   everything renders fine. In the given screenshot they are 378 pixels from   the left.   </pre>
