<title>Issue 20409 -   chromium -    Descenders (tails of letters) cut off from titles in tab bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24608">revision 24608</a>)  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : fluxbox  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Visit <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>  2. Look carefully at title (&quot;Google&quot;) in the tab bar.      The second g (the lower-case one) should have its descender (the part that   hangs down below the baseline of the rest of the text).      The font is cut off  showing only the bubble part of the g.    This doesn't just happen on google.com  but applies to all page titles   which include descenders. </pre>
