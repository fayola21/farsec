<title>Issue 8662 -   chromium -    Enable/disable renderer-state-dependent menu items (e.g. copy/paste/undo) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copy/paste are always enabled in the menus (Windows: page menu  Mac: Edit  menu). This isn't good UI practice. WebCore supports can* functions to  allow asking about the current state. However  we can't block the UI on a  request to WebCore for the state  so the renderer will need to be changed  to provide updates to the browser as to what should be enabled. </pre>
