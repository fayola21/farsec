<title>Issue 18969 -   chromium -    Unsupported media should have disabled UI appearance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Use &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; to play some unsupported media (i.e.  divx  mkv files     rtsp:// sources)    There should be a visual cue that something bad has happened.    This should probably coincide with the error attribute being set. </pre>
