<title>Issue 9617 -   chromium -    Import bookmarks and settings dialog accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>               Issues:  1. The labels connected to the form fields are not programmatically connected to the corresponding   field. Expected behavior: get_accName for each form field will return the label string.  2. MSAA focus cannot get to the checkboxes.     </pre>
