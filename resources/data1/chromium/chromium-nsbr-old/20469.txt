<title>Issue 20469 -   chromium -    Limit the length of the words we send to Hunspell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hunspell  especiall the new 1.2.8 that we're currently syncing to  uses   some fixed-length buffers for some things.    I don't know if they properly check the length in all the places  but it   would be nice to check that the length isn't beyond the &quot;max word length&quot;   to try to prevent problems.    This goes mostly for new words that are added  which will be added to the   internal structures of Hunspell.    This should be limited at a lower-level  but I would feel better if we   also checked the length of the word with this limit before spellchecking   or asking for suggestions in spellchecker.cc </pre>
