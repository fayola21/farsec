<title>Issue 9447 -   chromium -    Cannot Open Different Type Of Window in Single Process Mode in Debug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start chrome.exe --single-process  2. Open a new Incognito window (CTRL-SHFT-N or via the Wrench Menu)        Expect it to work. Actually triggers a breakpoint.        The single-process mode is great for simplifying debugging but it  does not work since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10144">r10144</a> because class ChildProcess can only  have one instanciation at a time and it uses DCHECK to validate  this. Since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10144">r10144</a>  RenderProcess is not a ChildProcess which  means that only one is supported per process. </pre>
