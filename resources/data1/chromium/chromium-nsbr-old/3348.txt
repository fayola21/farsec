<title>Issue 3348 -   chromium -    getYear() works only in IE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30                     IE 7:OK         1. I have code like this in my javascript.  var curDate = new Date();  var curYear = curDate.getYear();    Here curYear is coming as 108 instead of 2008.    I am using wndows-Xp with all latest updates in my system.          Expected result should come as 2008 for current year.      browser is returning value as 108 which is wrong.         </pre>
