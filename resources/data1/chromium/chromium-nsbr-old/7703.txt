<title>Issue 7703 -   chromium -    p1000.co.il: site layout piles elements on top of each other in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. go to <a href="http://www.p1000.co.il/shop/Templates/searchresults.aspx?">http://www.p1000.co.il/shop/Templates/searchresults.aspx?</a>  searchkey=hp%20pavilion%20dv5%201160ej    The page layout is completely wrong in Chrome  looks OK in IE &amp; Firefox.    Analysis:    This looks like a useragent detection issue  setting the Chrome user agent to claim it's IE causes   the site to render fine.    You can do this by creating a shortcut to chrome.exe  selecting properties  then adding the   following text after &quot;chrome.exe&quot; in the &quot;Target:&quot; field:     &quot;--user-agent=Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; GTB5; .NET CLR 2.0.50727;   .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)&quot;    including the quotes. </pre>
