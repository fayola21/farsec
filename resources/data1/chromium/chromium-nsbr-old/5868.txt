<title>Issue 5868 -   chromium -    Browser freezes with flash content when tabs are closed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42  URLs (if applicable) : tested <a href="http://www.covers.com">http://www.covers.com</a>  but problem repeats on  numerous websites  any website should do.          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    REPRODUCE PROBLEM:    1. Open a tab with flash ads/content.  2. Close tab quickly as soon as the page starts to load.  3. Repeat if browser did not freeze.    EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:    Page should load fine  flash ads  videos  animations should work. Tab  should close fine  even when flash content did not completely load.    INSTEAD:    After a few repeats  you should have a frozen browser. Content in all tabs  stops working. You can still switch between tabs  open new tabs  close  tabs  view menus  etc. but you may not interact with the web pages  can not  load new pages  can not refresh pages etc. The browser essentially stops  responding. No CPU is used.    After a while  you may get the 'aww Snap!' window in the tab  but browser  remains otherwise unresponsive.    Closing the browser window does not close the processes. The processes hang  until killed manually.    OTHER:    My system is Windows XP  2 Gig memory  Flash plugin v.10.0.12.36    This problem has persisted since the beta launch. Flash plugin version does  not matter. Chrome version does not matter.    Usually the problem does not occur during regular browsing because people  wait for the page to load  but sometimes  seemingly randomly the browser  will freeze due to this problem on about any website that serves flash ads  or content.   </pre>
