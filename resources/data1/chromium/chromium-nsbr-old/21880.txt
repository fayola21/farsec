Launch chromium and open few tabs on it  2. Drag a tab from the window to get a new tabbed window  3. Open Find bar in the tabbed window    Actual: Find bar UI is not visible on new tabbed window. But we can see a Blinking cursor.   Note: Go Full screen and come back Find bar UI will be retained.      Find bar should display properly.    Note: This is not related to themes. Can see the issue on default theme.           </pre>
