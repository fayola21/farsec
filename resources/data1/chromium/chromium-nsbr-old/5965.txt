<title>Issue 5965 -   chromium -    Bookmarking a titleless page should be given some meaningful title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium build 7477  URLs (if applicable) : NA  Other browsers tested: NA      1. Navigate to a page that doesn't have a title  2. Press the star icon to bookmark the page  3. The &quot;name&quot; field is empty        It would be nice if the name was populated with the URL  or better with a   suggestion. For example Chromium could look for H1 tags to guess a title.        The name field is blank  so if click &quot;close&quot; you end up with nameless   bookmarks (just an icon).   </pre>
