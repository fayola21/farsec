<title>Issue 5282 -   chromium -    Hotmail Does Not Funcation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33  URLs (if applicable) : hotmail.com          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Log into Hotmail      You can navigate messages and between folders.      Clicking on items does not do anything.  It treats the site as text.  I am   not sure if I am the only one with the problem  but if not  this is a major   problem.  It is similar to <a title="Cannot compose email in Hotmail (requires spoofing as Safari's UserAgent string)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4111"> issue 4111 </a> but only worse.  At least before  you   couldn't compose.  Now navigation does not work.   </pre>
