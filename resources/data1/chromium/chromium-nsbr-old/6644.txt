<title>Issue 6644 -   chromium -    Incorrect box rendering on cw.dk (regression in 2.0.x) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.cw.dk/">http://www.cw.dk/</a>           Safari 3: &lt;not tested&gt;      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK     Chrome 1.x: OK (as far as I remember)      1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.cw.dk/">http://www.cw.dk/</a>.      The borders of the boxes to the right of the page (&quot;SENESTE NYT&quot;  &quot;MEST   L��_��_STE SENESTE UGE&quot;  etc.) should be aligned and visible to make it look   like a box with rounded corners.      The left borders of the boxes are misaligned and the right borders are   invisible. Furthermore  the left borders jump around when I move the mouse   cursor over seemingly unrelated UI elements of the page  like the headlines   just below the banner ad at the top of the page (Forside | Nyheder | Debat   | Blogs | Web-tv | Brancheguiden | Whitepaper | Job | Event | Mere  Log   ind). Pretty jarring.   </pre>
