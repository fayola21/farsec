<title>Issue 11841 -   chromium -    Make chromium robust against Linux distribution autoupdaters  probably by never opening files after startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chromium via a Linux package manager  2. Be using Chromium while the distro updates it  3. Try to do anything after the update    You expect the browser to continue functioning normally   but it probably won't  because its files have been changed  out from under it.  (Firefox certainly doesn't handle this well.)    One proposal to solve this is called zygote mode  in which chromium  initially opens all files it will need before it spawns any threads;  the main process then does nothing but fork children on demand.  Since the children never need to open files  they are insulated  from this problem.  This might be a painful change.   </pre>
