<title>Issue 978 -   chromium -    Hovering dragged tab over minimized app in task bar does not restore that app to the foreground - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: NA           IE 7: NA      1. If you drag a tab off Window 1  so it creates its own Window 2  with it   maximised you cannot drag the tab to the taskbar  hover over Window 1  and   have it open.    In Windows Explorer  if you have a file in one window  you can drag and   hover over another Explorer window  and it will open it up (it will   actually open any application you hover over  but obviously you can only   drop the file in an Explorer window)      Open the Window      Nothing  you can hover all you want and nothing happens  regardless of what   you hover over.    </pre>
