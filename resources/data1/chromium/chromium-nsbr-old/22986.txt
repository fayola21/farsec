<title>Issue 22986 -   chromium -    Open Apple - Q quits when there are multiple tabs open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 4.0.211.2    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): dialog with 'Are you sure you want   to quit Safari?'  X tabs are open in Safari. Do you want to quit anyways?   [checkbox] Do not warn me when closing multiple pages [cancel] [quit]  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Quit Firefox  Do you want Firefox to   save your tabs for the next time it starts?  [check] Do not ask me again   [quit] [cancel] [save and quit]  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Ctrl-Q does nothing.      1. Open two tabs.  2. Open Apple-Q on the keyboard  3. Chrome quits.      Chrome should display the same dialog as Safari and Firefox. I am also not   a fan of modals... but in this case there is serious risk to the user. The   preference option enables power users who find this dialog annoying to   disable it.      Chrome quits. </pre>
