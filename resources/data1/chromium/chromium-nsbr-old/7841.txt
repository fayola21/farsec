<title>Issue 7841 -   chromium -    Apply Fullscreen Mode to Maximized Screen incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 2.0.165.0 (Developer Build 9992)    OS: Windows XP 32bit    Theme: Windows Classic    Taskbar Settings that I tried:   - locked / unlocked   - single row / multiple rows   - Quick launch added / removed      What happens?  The Taskbar appears still overlapping the fullscreen mode.    Normal Mode (restored state) works great. Take a look at the attached   screenshot.      Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.   </pre>
