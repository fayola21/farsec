<title>Issue 2797 -   chromium -    SecurityOrigin::canRequest grants local URLs universal access - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the merge  we picked up SecurityOrigin::canRequest  which lets local   files (those from file:// URLs) request any URL (e.g.  via XMLHttpRequest).    Our policy is not to grant file:// URLs this universal access.    To fix this issue  just remove the lines:        if (isLocal())          return true;    from the function.    I'm working with upstream to have this controlled by a pref so we can   unfork this file.     </pre>
