<title>Issue 11720 -   chromium -    Problem with the &quot;Recently Closed&quot; feature o the &quot;New Tab&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open several tabs   2. Close the tabs one by one (until the whole window is gone).  3. Open a new window and look at the new tab (notice the tabs you closed on the   bottom right corner)   4. Close the window with the new tab and open it again (now notice that all your   tabs and windows that were closed are gone).         The tabs and windows that I closed should stay there until I close more tabs and   windows (in which case the last closed tab or window will be moved down the list   until it leaves the list at the bottom).         All tabs and windows are gone.     <b>Please provide
