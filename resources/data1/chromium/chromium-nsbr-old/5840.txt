<title>Issue 5840 -   chromium -    Recently closed tabs: default favicons don't help identify History  Downloads  about: pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 1.0.156.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7453">r7453</a>)    1. Open History and Downloads tabs in a browser window.  2. Click on Close button on title bar to close window.  3. Open New Tab.    Note that the Window( ) entry in the Recently Closed section has 2 generic  favicons (generic page icons) that don't convey any information about the  pages.  It might provide a better user experience if History  Downloads   and about:pages had identifiable favicons (like 'H' and Down-Arrow  etc.). </pre>
