<title>Issue 17702 -   chromium -    Mac PlatformContext for video causes extra copy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> skia::PlatformContext  when created with a backing CGBitmapContext should   avoid creating a second bitmap context.    Currently  the platform context always creates a second context.  For video   rendering  this causes each frame to be memcopied twice which is a   significant performance degredataion. </pre>
