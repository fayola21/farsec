<title>Issue 8326 -   chromium -    Clean local #if out of ColorMac.mm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We added platform/graphics/mac/ColorMac.mm to the Mac webkit build to bring   in its focusRing support without needing to follow the Windows codepath    since the latter has problems with the sandbox. But we also still need   platform/graphics/chromium/ColorChromium.cpp for other methods.    The focusRingColor() method is duplicated between the two  so as a   temporary measure the copy in ColorMac.mm has been surrounded with an #if   !PLATFORM(CHROMIUM). This is a local forking we don't want to maintain.   </pre>
