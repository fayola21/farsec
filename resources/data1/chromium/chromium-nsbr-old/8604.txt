<title>Issue 8604 -   chromium -    Fix focus problems / omnibox focus with Linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our Focus should match Windows.  Here are some things we get wrong:    - On a navigation  we should put focus to the web contents  now it stays on   the URL bar.    - We have some painting problems  we still paint a focus ring in the web   contents  even when the focus is in the URL bar.    - When we start  focus is in the URL bar even though a page is loaded.    This is probably the same as the first issue.    - Tab order is strange  you would expect to be able to tab from the omnibox   into the web contents  and then back with shift-tab.  However  when you tab   from the omnibox into the web contents  you aren't in the first element of   the web contents.  I think this maybe matches Windows though. </pre>
