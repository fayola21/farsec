<title>Issue 17699 -   chromium -    Warn user when download is to an invalid location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux  the options dialog has a pull down list with possible download   locations. One of the default entries is &quot;Filesystem&quot;  which appears to   refer to &quot;/&quot;. That is a completely pointless option as the user will never   have write access to it (unless they are foolish enough to run Chrome as   &quot;root&quot;).    We should remove this entry. Instead  we might want to always offer &quot;/tmp&quot;    which is a reasonable choice but currently has to be explicitly added by the   user. </pre>
