<title>Issue 7091 -   chromium -    Flickr photo view page rendered mostly blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to flickr links above  no additional steps needed      Page should load with a photo as the main element in the center of the page and   buttons above it to add comments  see more sizes  etc.      Photo and options above it not visible (just white). Right clicking seems to   bring up the proper context menus showing the page did load. Clicking in the   area where the buttons should be sets off the proper action so they are there    just not visible.    Please provide
