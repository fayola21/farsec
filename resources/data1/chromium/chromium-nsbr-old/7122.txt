<title>Issue 7122 -   chromium -    text-align:center defined for the body is causing the misalignment  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8729)  URL:  <a href="http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=715&amp;collection=localwxforecast&amp;from=36hr_outlet_video">http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=715&amp;collection=localwxforecast&amp;from=36hr_outlet_video</a>        1. Go to  <a href="http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=715&amp;collection=localwxforecast&amp;from=36hr_outlet_video">http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=715&amp;collection=localwxforecast&amp;from=36hr_outlet_video</a>  2. Note layout problems with text box &quot;Enter zip  US city or keyword&quot; and  &quot;Go&quot; button in top navigation menu (see picture).  3. Select &quot;Safety &amp; Prep Tips&quot; from top menu.  4. Pass mouse cursor over top menu.  Note that &quot;oscillation&quot; occurs during  mouse movement as menu is repeatedly redrawn (incorrectly).    IE7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari3: NOT OK    Both Chrome and Safari have the same problem =&gt; probably WebKit.    Has reduction for problem in step #2.  Could use another reduction for problem in step #4. </pre>
