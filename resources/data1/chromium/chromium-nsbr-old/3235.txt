<title>Issue 3235 -   chromium -    SSL Bad certificate interstitial page background drag not ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200) on Windows Vista  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Go to a page with a bad SSL certificate (self-signed for instance)  2. On the warning page  click-drag on the red background      nothing  click is ignored      Unexpectedly redirects to a data:/.. url that I suppose is a picture   containing the red background color. Clicking 'back' navigates past the SSL   warning page to the page I was looking at before that.   </pre>
