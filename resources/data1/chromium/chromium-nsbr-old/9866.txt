<title>Issue 9866 -   chromium -    Breakpad change seemingly causes lots of extra crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like reverting back to http://google-  breakpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src@285'  dropped our crash rate on the   Chromebot run from 131 to 21 w/ no other changes.      I only reverted on the 173 branch  so my guess is that we probably want to   roll this back on trunk as well.    That said  I know the Mac release is going to be dependent on a more modern   release of breakpad so we are going to have to merge at some point and I'd   like to understand what's going on.  Could you guys take a look? </pre>
