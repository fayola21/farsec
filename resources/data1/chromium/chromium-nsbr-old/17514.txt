<title>Issue 17514 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't remember passwords of forms submitted with Ajax  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0 (0)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">http://www.hulu.com/</a>           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Create an account  2. Login        Chrome should ask to remember the password so that next time I log in  it  automatically fills the login form.        It doesn't ask to remember login and password and doesn't fills the form  next time I login.    This happens with all login forms that use AJAX to submit. I posted a bug  on webkit given that the same bug happens with all webkit browsers but they  told me it's not related to WebKit  so I'm posting the bug here. Here is  the rejected bug on webkit's bugzilla:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27590">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27590</a>   </pre>
