<title>Issue 15411 -   chromium -    New NTP: Don't hide the dropdown menu for 'recently closed tab' when you mouse-over on it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open New 'New Tab' page.  2. Under 'Recently Closed' hover the mouse over the '1 Tab' item  and wait   for the dropdown menu to appear.    At this point I thought I could click on the items in the menu  but when I   quickly moved my mouse and clicked the menu closed (just before I clicked)   and the click resulted in a navigation to something random because my mouse   was now over another item in the Recently Closed section.    I think this will cause confusion since people will expect the menu not to   disappear when you hover over it.   </pre>
