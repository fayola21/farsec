<title>Issue 9856 -   chromium -    Text alignment reverses when highlighting with key combo. Curious but very annoying! ;-) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Press the RIGHT CTRL+SHIFT keys simultaneously  2. Press the LEFT CTRL+SHIFT keys simultaneously to rectify      Text entry as normal  left-to-right. CTRL+SHIFT (plus an arrow key) should  allow highlighting of whole words for editing functions such as Cut/Copy/Delete      All text in the box becomes right-aligned and further text entered comes  from the right - but all the right way round (i.e. it doesn't reverse the  direction of the text  just the alignment).    Oddly  punctuation marks of any kind always still appear on the left end  (before the beginning of the current line of text) UNLESS (until) followed  by an alphanumeric character  in which case it conforms to expected placing.    Pressing the LEFT CTRL+SHIFT keys resolves the issue  switching back to  left-aligned.    <b>Please provide
