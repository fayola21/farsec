<title>Issue 746 -   chromium -    View background image - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    It should be possible  as in Firefox  to right click somewhere and select   &quot;View background image&quot; to display the background image (possibly in a new   tab like the &quot;open image in new tab&quot; does now).    It also should be possible to choose whether to focus on the new tab   directly as it can get tiresome to have to navigate to the tab each time   especially when wanting to view many images (this applies also to the   existing &quot;open image in new tab&quot;). For example  if pressing Ctrl or   (preferably) Shift while selecting &quot;Open image in new tab&quot;  to agree with   the behaviour of pressing Control Shift to get a link in a new tab    automatically focused. </pre>
