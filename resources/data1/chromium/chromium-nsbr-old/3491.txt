<title>Issue 3491 -   chromium -    Browser crashes when using the del.icio.us bookmarklet (9 times out of 10!) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to <a href="http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets">http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets</a>  2. Ensure that the bookmark bar is visible (Always show bookmark bar on the  customise and control menu/spanner).  3. Drag the &quot;Bookmark on Delicious&quot; link to the bookmark bar (item 2).  4. Drag the &quot;My Delicious&quot; link to the bookmark bar (item 3).  5. Navigate to a page or stay on the del.icio.us site  I chose  amazon.co.uk. There were other tabs open at the time.  6. Click the &quot;Bookmark on Delicious&quot; button.  7. Enter appropriate tags in the new Save a bookmark window  TAGS field (I  chose &quot;amazon books electronics&quot;).  8. Click the green save button.        Should return to the main browser window.        Browser hangs and &quot;Chromium has stopped working&quot; dialogue appears. Attached  files have been created plus a memory dump which I've not included as I'm  not sure exactly what it will contain in addition to info relevant to this  problem.    Please provide
