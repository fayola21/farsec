<title>Issue 18566 -   chromium -    consider flipping background and overlay image in themes in RTL mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently always draw the background image and the theme overlay image   based in the top left corner of the browser.  It's unclear if we should   flip the image in RTL mode.    Options:  1) Don't flip the image and always have the image drawn the same.  Might   look funny if the theme assumes tabs in the top left instead of the   min/max/close buttons.    2) Flip the image.  Wouldn't work for themes that have text or other   directionality in the background image.    3) Allow the author to provide 2 sets of images and fallback to not   flipping?  Seems like a waste of file size.    4) Provide a bool in the manifest json that the theme author can specify   flip or no flip for the background.  Or maybe an enum: flip  no flip    alternate image.   </pre>
