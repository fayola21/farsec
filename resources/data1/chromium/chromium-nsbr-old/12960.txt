<title>Issue 12960 -   chromium -    Developers should have to opt-in to having plugins accessible to content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  if an extension includes a plugin it is accessible to content.   This is not a typical need. Usually you want NPAPI because you have some   native code you want to use in your extension  not because you want to expose   it to content.    It's still useful to expose a plugin to content  but this should not be the   default. </pre>
