<title>Issue 14184 -   chromium -    Menus open upward with vertically stacked monitors (and get truncated at the boundary) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 18497 daily build  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : fluxbox      1. Stack two monitors vertically.  2. Move Chrome to the lower monitor.  3. Open the page or settings dropdown.        The menu opens downward.        The menu opens upward. This is especially problematic if your Chrome window   is against the top boundary of your lower monitor  because it won't draw   the menu crossing the monitor boundary  so it scales the menu against the   transition point (see the attachmend marked cutoff).    I'd be willing to accept the upward opening of the menu if there's vertical   space available above the Chrome window  but if that's going to be in   there  it has to draw correctly across the monitor boundary  as the   compressed menu is difficult to use.    I downscaled the attachments to save space  let me know if you want the   original size ones. </pre>
