<title>Issue 21363 -   chromium -    tab-to-search broken for news.cnet.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1 (Official Build 25376) (Windows)             Safari 4: NA    Firefox 3.x: NA           IE 7: NA           IE 8: NA      1. put cursor in address bar/omnibox  2. type &quot;news.cnet.com&quot; then &lt;tab&gt;      The browser should produce a &quot;search news.cnet.com&quot; notice in the omnibox   and let me enter search terms. This has worked for weeks and still works   with some other searchable domains including amazon.com  google.com    yahoo.com (though never to my knowledge for bing.com).        Focus moves to browsing window. </pre>
