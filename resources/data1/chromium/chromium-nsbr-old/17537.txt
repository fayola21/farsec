<title>Issue 17537 -   chromium -    &quot;open link in new tab&quot; should let me stay at the current tab.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.right click an a link  2.select in open link in new tab        Well its just a suggestion. Whenever I do right click on a link and select   &quot;Open link in new tab&quot;  chrome will take me to the new tab. Instead of   that  chrome should let me stay on the old tab page and new tab should open   in backgroud.Generally when I read my google reader feed  every time I   click for the orignial blog or link  the focus changes to the new tab. I   want the focus should stay at google reader tab.            <b>Please provide
