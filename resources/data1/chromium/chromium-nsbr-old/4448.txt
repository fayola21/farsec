<title>Issue 4448 -   chromium -    Relative URLs inherit the embedded username:password in the original URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature.    Using Google's internal SVN site as an example  if I enter the URL      https://wtc:password@foo.bar.google.com/x-product/  in the location bar  and then browse around  all the subsequent  requests sent to the network layer inherit the embedded wtc:password  in the original URL.    The links in question are relative URLs such as      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;trunk/&quot;&gt;trunk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  So when we convert a relative URL to an absolete URL  we must be using  the full original URL  with any embedded username:password intact.    Is this the right thing?    Note that our UI does not reveal the embedded username:password  either in the location bar or when I mouse over a link  except  in the tab's title  which displays something like this when the  tab displays a source file (as opposed to a directory listing):      https://wtc:password@foo..   </pre>
