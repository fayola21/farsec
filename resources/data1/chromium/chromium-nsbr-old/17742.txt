<title>Issue 17742 -   chromium -    You cannot highlight text by holding shift + page down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. Go to a editable text box on sites.google.com. For example  make a new   &quot;html&quot; front page.  2. Type a lot of stuff.  3. Select a few words  then hold shift key and page down.       It SHOULD select/highlight a large portion of the text  see IE or Word for   an example.      No more text is selected  it just pages down.  Interestingly  this function   actually DOES WORK int his text box that I am currently typing in!  Just   not on google sites...and other various sites.       </pre>
