<title>Issue 3734 -   chromium -    Tabs disappear but pages are still active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2.149.30  URLs (if applicable) : NA      1. Rearranging tabs swiftly or slightly carelessly        Expectedly  we should see all tabs which are open on the tab bar.  Also only those tabs which we can see should be the ones which are shown in   the task manager.           Instead  some tabs disappear  leaving gaps/voids in the tab bar  where the   tab should have been.    Not only that  but the pages corresponding to the aforementioned tabs use   up resources just like any other open page  as we see in the Task Manager    Some screen shots have been attached.     </pre>
