<title>Issue 15335 -   chromium -    Highlight color in completion popup menus is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Go to a website with a textfield that remembers input (e.g. crbug.com)  2. Type in a character to open the completion popup        The highlight color should be a dark blue  like in the rest of OS X   (`alternateSelectedControlColor`  I believe).        It's light blue (`selectedTextBackgroundColor`?)  which looks out of place   and makes the white text hard to read.    Screenshots of chrome and safari attached. </pre>
