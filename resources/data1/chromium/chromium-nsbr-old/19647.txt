<title>Issue 19647 -   chromium -    Finder opened for downloads instead of Path Finder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (202.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): opens file in Path Finder  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): unknown  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. download a file  2. for downloaded file  select option &quot;Reveal in Finder&quot;        That instead of Finder  the application Path Finder is opened to the   directory the file was downloaded to.        Finder opens instead.    Not sure exactly how  but Path Finder is able to install itself as the   preferred &quot;Finder&quot; for the system  which many apps  including Safari (!!!)   respect.  Chromium does not respect this. </pre>
