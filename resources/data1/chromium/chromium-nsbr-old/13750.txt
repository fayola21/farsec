<title>Issue 13750 -   chromium -    applet tag causes second request to source url - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Ensure you have the Java Plugin installed on your local machine  I have 1.6.0_11   installed and it is available to Chrome.  2. Add the attached appletBug.jsp and Hello.class to a servlet container such as   Tomcat <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi">http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi</a>.   2. Request the appletBug.jsp page via Chrome  3. You will see the Hello World applet loads and also a counter showing the Request   count as 1.  4. If you now re-request the page  you will again see the Hello World applet  but the   request count will now show as 3. This proves that a second request was made of the   appletBug.jsp resource. Further requests will show the count increasing by 2  rather   than 1.      A single request should be made for the appletBug.jsp resource when the browser first   loads the page. The Java applet embedded in the page should download and run without a   further request going to appletBug.jsp      A single request is made for the appletBug.jsp when the browser first loads the page.   A second request is made for appletBug.jsp as the Java applet within the page loads.    This causes problems for our application which uses a token to prevent multiple   submits of the same web form. On a form which contains a Java applet  the token is   given for the first browser request. This token is stored in the web form. The applet   then makes a second request of our servlet which invalidates the first token and   creates a second token. When the original form is submitted back to our application    the form contains the first invalid token.    <b>Please provide
