<title>Issue 5620 -   chromium -    Search for text when I start typing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     Just a small feature request: on Firefox  there is this feature that I  really like and use all the time: &quot;Search for text when I start typing&quot;.  You don't have to first press Ctrl+F to search on the page.  Do you plan to add that to Chrome as well?    Cheers     Aurelien   </pre>
