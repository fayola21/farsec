<title>Issue 17794 -   chromium -    crash reports should include an UMA trace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Users who send crash reports are also collecting UMA data.  We should try to   package up the last n UMA events with the crash report.  This way  a crash   report would also tell us what the user was doing most recently when the   crash happened (e.g. just switched tabs  browser was idle  just typed in an   URL  etc.).   </pre>
