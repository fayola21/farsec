<title>Issue 20644 -   chromium -    Wrong tab bar repainting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 24854)      1. Open Chromium.  2. Open two or more tabs.  3. Switch from active tab to one another.      Previous active tab in tab bar should be &quot;shadowed&quot;. New active tab in tab   bar should be painted as active.       Previous active tab in tab bar is not &quot;shadowed&quot;. Two tabs in tab bar are   displayed as active in same time.     This happens in all themes (default  GTK+ and custom themes).   Tabs are repainted correctly only after mouse moves over the tab in tab bar. </pre>
