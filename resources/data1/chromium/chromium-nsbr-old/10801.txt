<title>Issue 10801 -   chromium -    Caret disappears in an RTLed textarea/div with 0px right padding after text is deleted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  2.0.176.0 (14039)      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open the test case  2. Enter some text  3. Delete the text      The caret should still be seen even if there is no text in the textarea/div   when it is focused      The caret disappears    Additional information:  Note that even before writing any text  the caret has no right margin at   all (while if it was an LTR one  it would). it looks weird because of that   and of course unique to webkit (which obviously was invented before the RTL   languages existed ;) )    This issue is related to <a title="RTL: Cursor is invisible inside textarea if the direction is set to RTL" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2777"> Issue 2777 </a> which Xiaomei recently fixed   </pre>
