<title>Issue 11983 -   chromium -    Chromium not working on https sites with invalid certificates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	181.0 (Developer Build )  WebKit	530.10  V8	1.2.3.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.10 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.181 Safari/530.10    URLs (if applicable) : Any https url with invalid certificate    OS version               : MacOS X 10.5.6    Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK      1. Go to any https site that has invalid certificate  2. Once you go to it  the RED page comes up saying &quot;This site's security   certificate is not trusted&quot;  3. There are two buttons  one says &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; and the other says   &quot;Back to safety&quot;.      I should be able to click on &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; and go to the site anyway if I   want to.      NOTHING!  If I press any of those two buttons nothing happens.  When I   press &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; it does not take me to the site.  The button appears   to be completely dead.  It just stays on that page.  Same goes for the other   button &quot;Back to safety&quot;.  For all intensive purposes Chromium on Mac is not   working with any https sites that have invalid certificates. </pre>
