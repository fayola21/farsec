Launch Chrome  2. Sign in Gmail  3. Compose a new email  4. Type some mis-spelled words into &quot;Subject&quot; field  5. Right click inside this field  6. Select &quot;Spell-Checker options -&gt; Check the spelling of this field&quot;     &gt;&gt;It is off by default  7. Observe    Result:  Nothing happens    Expected:  Spell-checker should work immediatly after clicking &quot;Check the spelling of   this field&quot; and mark the mis-spelled words with red underline    Notes:  1. As mentioned in <a title="spellcheck is not supported in &lt;input&gt;" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5574"> issue 5574 </a>  we disabled spell-checker for single line   text box by default  so it is important to do spell checking immediately   after clicking &quot;Check the spelling of this field&quot;  other wise  I have to   double click the word one by one in my email title to make sure that I   didn't mis-spell any word    2. Safari recently implement &quot;Checking Spelling While Typing&quot;  and it works   for single line text box by default   </pre>
