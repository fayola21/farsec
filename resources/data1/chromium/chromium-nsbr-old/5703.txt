<title>Issue 5703 -   chromium -    Issue with OnSelectedIndexChanged firing under Microsoft ASP.Net AJAX UpdatePanel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    URL:  <a href="http://www.wilmingtonskateproject.org/Donate">http://www.wilmingtonskateproject.org/Donate</a>  When choosing an amount  the page should partially post back and update the  text on the button at the bottom. Not the most efficient way to accomplish  that but it does illustrate the bug.           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 6: OK      1. An UpdatePanel with a RadioButtonList with AutoPostBack = &quot;true&quot;      The event should initiate a partial post back.      A partial post back is not fired.
