<title>Issue 20298 -   chromium -    Chrome goes fullscreen at start and cannot be resized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome  2. See that it takes all the screen  so neither desktop panels are visible   or any other part of desktop.  3. Alt-Tab to other application  so chrome gets into background (note  this   step is not possible if you enable &quot;always on top&quot;)  4. Try to &quot;unmaximize&quot;  &quot;move&quot;  &quot;resize it&quot;      It should be possible to unmaximize chrome  so it fits into resiziable   window. Chrome should not start fullscreen by default. There should be some   option to disable fullscreen.      None of the &quot;unmaximize&quot;  &quot;move&quot;  &quot;resize it&quot; buttons work  chrome simply   does not react. It is not possible to unfullscreen chrome  so it is hard to   navigate to other applications or use chrome in parallel with e.g.   terminal.    <b>Please provide
