<title>Issue 11919 -   chromium -    Handle LoadLibrary failures more gracefully - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've had many cases where people report crashes on every Chrome startup.   Some of those  are probably due to failures to delay load system DLLs (such   as the case I was dealing with today that was solved by simply running the   Microsoft System File Checker (sfc.exe) to replace a corrupt imm32.dll).    Now  Microsoft provides failure hooks that we can use to detect when   LoadLibrary fails:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sfcfb0a3(VS.80).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sfcfb0a3(VS.80).aspx</a>    We should consider using this hook to provide a more informational message   than &quot;Whoa!? Chrome crashed!&quot;   </pre>
