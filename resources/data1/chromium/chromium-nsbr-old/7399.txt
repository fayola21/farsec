<title>Issue 7399 -   chromium -    tab goes dead. Had to forcefully terminate chrome  inorder to close the application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>         this exact problem happened just once. previously it occured sumtimes  but   on clicking close 3-4 times  the tab used to get closed.      As it happens in Chrome  closing the last tab should close the application.   But In this case  neither clicking on the close on tab nor clicking close   on application top right hand side would close the application.      Chrome dosent close. and after sometime  websites stop opening on that   page.    Please provide
