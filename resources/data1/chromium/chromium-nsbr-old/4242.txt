<title>Issue 4242 -   chromium -    Javascript BUG in popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    I belive I found a bug when using javascript in Popup windows.    I open a new window by clicking a link that uses window.open to open the   new window.    The newly opened window has one javascript function and a button.    If I click the button in the popup after the popup has been opened using   the window.open then the button (javascript) does not work.    If I just open the same window by typing the URL in the address field then   the javascript work as it should.    Tested in Chrome version 0.3.154.9    Test using attached documents (zipped):  Load the start-chrome-popup.htm first and follow instructions for how to   reproduce:  start-chrome-popup.htm  test-chrome-popup.htm   </pre>
