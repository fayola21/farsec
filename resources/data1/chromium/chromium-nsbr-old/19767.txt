<title>Issue 19767 -   chromium -    wrong text displayed in about:sync if server unreachable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [copied from http://b/1958948    When the server is not reachable  the &quot;Last synced&quot; string in about:sync is   &quot;Just now&quot; instead of &quot;x minutes ago&quot;     1) Client is already connected to sync server with valid GAIA account  2) Add few BMs and BM Folders  3) Simulate a scenario where sync server is not reachable or not responsive    4) Sync server becomes responsive or reachable now (this can be done by   reversing what we did in step-3)    Expected:  about:sync should show correct status for &quot;Last Synced&quot; as 1 min ago or 5   min ago  as server was not reachable for last several mins.    Actual:  Server was not reachable for last few mins and &quot;Last Synced&quot; was reporting   it to be &quot;Just Now&quot;. Strangely Summary was showing &quot;OFFLINE_UNSYNCED&quot;   </pre>
