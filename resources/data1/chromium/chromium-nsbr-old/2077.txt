<title>Issue 2077 -   chromium -    Ctrl-V + Ctrl-Enter does not behave like Ctrl-Enter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Copy &quot;example&quot; to the clipboard (without the quotes).  2. Focus the address bar.  3. Ctrl-V to paste &quot;example&quot;.  4. Without releasing Ctrl  hit Enter (so Ctrl-Enter).    What is the expected output?  Adds www. and .com  and opens address www.example.com.    What do you see instead?  Does a search for the term &quot;example&quot;.   </pre>
