<title>Issue 18596 -   chromium -    Restored windows do not go to correct workspace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open two chrome windows  2. Move one to a different workspace  3. Turn on options &gt; basics &gt; Restore the pages that were open last  4. Close Chrome (wrench &gt; exit)  5. Reopen chrome        Expected: Windows go back to the workspace they were on when Chrome closed.   Maybe if I'm on a workspace that didn't have any windows before  a new   window opens in the current workspace (otherwise I might think chrome is   still starting up or failed to start up)    Actual: All windows appear on the current workspace. </pre>
