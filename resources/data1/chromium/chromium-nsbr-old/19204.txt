<title>Issue 19204 -   chromium -    OS X: Breakpad not initialized for non-browser processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since Chrome was split amongst several separate apps  Breakpad has stopped functioning in   non-browser processes.    The reason appears to be that Breakpad is only turned on if the user has consented and this   pref is stored in the defaults system which is keyed by the Bundle ID.    The Bundle ID of the helper process seems to be reported differently so it can't read the value   from defaults if the user has consented and therefore disables breakpad.    I looked into using the same system as the other ports where a sentinel file is stored in the user   data directory  this approach has the advantage of being x-platform but the moving parts   involved require some setup (PathServices needs to be initialized etc).    The other ports therefore only init Breakpad in BrowserMain and the like.    Using defaults means there is no setup required and we can initialize breakpad immediately   upon startup which provides better crash protection. </pre>
