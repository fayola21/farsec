<title>Issue 9777 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Autofill (?) causing double-click to fail? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure what the problem is here  I'm hoping it's actually not our fault and   rather GAIA's JS.    Visit any GAIA login page with a saved login (e.g. log out of some existing   logged-in site) and try to double-click the username field.  The second click   is silently eaten. </pre>
