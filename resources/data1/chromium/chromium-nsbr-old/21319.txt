<title>Issue 21319 -   chromium -    Intermittent: Updater fails some times at System level - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 3.0.195.17  OS: Vista/Sp1    Filing this as tracking purpose.    -Install 3.0.195.10 at system level and DON'T launch Chrome.  -Launch the updater 195.10_195.17 [at system level]  -Before the updater finishes installing  Launch Chrome for 195.10 and  respond to FRUI.  -After the updater completed  Exit Chrome.    Chrome exits cleanly  there are no background processes running  but I will  notice chrome.exe and chrome_new.exe and two values (pv  opv) in registry  too.  Waited for long time  BUT they never were renamed.    It happens most of the time  but can't reproduce consistently. </pre>
