<title>Issue 16495 -   chromium -    Histogram data in a renderer should be uploaded to the browser before the renderer process is terminated. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm starting a new browser and following the data collected by *.Renderer4   histograms and I'm seeing that a good part of the navigations are missing.    Even after the browser has started and it is measuring for instance   StartToFinish  I've seen it totally miss a new tab + all navigations from   that tab  including more tabs that should end up running in the same process.   I have not verified yet if the problem is related with the command line or   not  but basically all of the StatToFinish histograms had the same number of   navigations at any point  so if it was a problem with the command line  the   list of tests would have to be empty for that renderer. I know that   statistically we could be loosing most of the navigations and still have   useful data  but that's besides the point.   </pre>
