<title>Issue 9240 -   chromium -    Unable to open &lt;select&gt; drop down menu using [Alt]+[Down Arrow] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1             Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to any website with a one line select control.  2. Focus select control without opening it (using keyboard or mouse).  3. Press Alt+Down arrow to open menu.      The drop down menu should open and the current selection should be highlighted.      The selection in the control is changed to the next item suggesting that  Alt+Down is interpreted as just pressing the down arrow key.   </pre>
