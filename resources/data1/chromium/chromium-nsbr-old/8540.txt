<title>Issue 8540 -   chromium -    Obey system focus ring color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Jeremy wrote:  &quot;In platform/graphics/chromium/ColorChromium.cpp we currently hardcode the  value of focusRingColor on OS X &amp; Windows.&quot;    We currently use an arbitrary color on Linux as well.  We should obey the  system one.    (Setting all the OS-specific flags independently because fixing this will  require separate fixes on each OS.) </pre>
