<title>Issue 3975 -   chromium -    sometimes instead of rendered page only white screen is seen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9              Firefox 3: OK        Sometimes  when you open a page in the background  and ctrl+tab to it    instead of a page you see completely white tab. It looks similar to <a title="Brief strong and blinding white flash when switching between tabs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=311"> Issue   311 </a>  but the page doesn't show anything in the end  no matter how long you   wait. &quot;View page source&quot; shows that there is a lot of HTML in the source    so the page should not be blank. JavaScript Console also doesn't suggest   that there is any bug.    Refresh fixes the problem.    Unfortunately  there is no clear sequence of steps to reproduce it; it is   always by surprise  but happens quite regularly (once in a few days?). It   is not introduced recently - it has been happening for a while already.    I believe it more often happens when you navigate to pages under <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">http://habrahabr.ru/</a> - e.g. today it happened at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/43607/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/43607/</a>.    Interesting bit: I tried to save the source to attach it to the bug. Right-  click  Save as  chose &quot;Web Page  HTML Only&quot;  given a name  clicked &quot;Save&quot;.   The file name appeared in the download bar with the status &quot;Cancelled&quot;   right away; next try  with another name  gave &quot;Cancelled&quot; again. Though    &quot;Web Page  Complete&quot; saved something - I attach it under &quot;saved_page.htm&quot;.    Unfortunately  &quot;view source&quot; window doesn't have any &quot;Save As&quot; capability   (should I file it separately?)  I had to copy-paste the contents to   notepad.    Apparently  the files look different. Therefore  there seem to be several   issues:    1. May be  that's habrahabr.ru sending the unfinished page. Did anyone   experience this in other browsers? May be  Chrome can show more prominently   that it has actually rendered everything and there is nothing left to wait?   Because right now completely white screen looks as a reason to wait for the   finish of rendering (see <a title="Brief strong and blinding white flash when switching between tabs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=311"> Issue 311 </a>).  2. &quot;Save As&quot; for &quot;HTML Only&quot; doesn't work.  3. &quot;Save As&quot; for &quot;Web Page Complete&quot; produces different source from what we   can see in &quot;view source&quot;. Does it mean that view source does additional   fetch of the page instead of showing the source of actual page visible?  4. &quot;View source&quot; window doesn't have &quot;Save as&quot; feature.  5. Also  &quot;View source&quot; window title is &quot;Loading...&quot; which is some what   strange. It would be nicer if it was &quot;Source of the page at &lt;&gt;&quot; or   something like that. </pre>
