<title>Issue 10826 -   chromium -    SQLITE_LOCKED errors when restarting too quickly -- possible NFS interaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I close and restart Linux Chrome too quickly  I get an error in this code   on startup:      int rv = sqlite3_exec(db_  &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;  NULL  NULL  NULL);      DCHECK(rv == SQLITE_OK) &lt;&lt; &quot;Failed to begin transaction&quot;;  Debugger shows me that rv is SQLITE_LOCKED.    Scott  could this be related to how SQLite handles locking  perhaps with some   interaction with NFS?  Can we tell SQLite that we'll promise to be careful   and that it doesn't need locking? </pre>
