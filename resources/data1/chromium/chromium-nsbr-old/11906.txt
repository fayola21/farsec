<title>Issue 11906 -   chromium -    PageActions API probably wants a way to update fields temporarily - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  the PageActions API lets you register permanent page actions and   enable them temporarily (for the lifetime of a document).    We probably want to extend this so that additionally  you can override the   default tooltip  icon  etc. Overriding the callback would also be useful  but   that may require additional plumbing. </pre>
