<title>Issue 12977 -   chromium -    Netbanking in Crome not possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://netbank.danskebank.dk/html/index.html?">https://netbank.danskebank.dk/html/index.html?</a>  site=DBNB&amp;secsystem=E2           Safari 4:fail    Firefox 3.x:fail           IE 7:ok           IE 8:ok      1.Trying to logon to netbanking          A logon screen where a mst key file is fetched       You get redirected to a &quot;logon with active card&quot; page which is useless.    This issue will cause heaps of users to be forced to use ie  as it is too   danmed clumsy to shift browser when netbanking. I��m thoroughly fed up with   ie so I was hoping that the chromium could handle this issue :-)    With respect for your work  Jakob   </pre>
