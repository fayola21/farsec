<title>Issue 18511 -   chromium -    PAC Proxy dnsDomainIs() function doesn't return the correct path - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Be at work behind a web proxy to go out to the Internet.    2. Use a PAC proxy configuration with the following setup:  if (dnsDomainIs(host  &quot;.ad&quot;)) { return &quot;DIRECT&quot;; }  else { return &quot;PROXY 1.2.3.4:8008; PROXY 5.6.7.8:8008&quot;; }    3. Go to the URL: www.adobe.com        www.adobe.com isn't a subdomain of .ad  so Chrome should use the proxy.        www.adobe.com does contain &quot;.ad&quot; so Chrome tries DIRECT and fails.    <b>Please provide
