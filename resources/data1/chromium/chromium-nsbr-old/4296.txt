<title>Issue 4296 -   chromium -    Form state is not saved when it should be - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the user changes a form value  we should periodically sync that form   state to the browser for session restore and crashed tab recovery. This is   done in a timer in RenderView as long as the form state has changed.    This was broken several WebKit merges ago and we'll no longer save this   state when the user changes form fields. We should still change it when   they scroll  however.    RenderView::OnNavStateChanged kicks this off. The function that used to get   called was webkit_glue::NotifyFormStateChanged. This was in turn called by   the StateTrackingString which we hacked into HTMLInputElement to tell us   whenever an input element's value changed.    We need to find a cleaner way to implement this than the state tracking   string  which was a hack. Probably there should be some &quot;official&quot; callback   on either the frame or view clients. </pre>
