<title>Issue 12496 -   chromium -    Chrome hangs on http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit <a href="http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide/">http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide/</a>  2. Click on any TV show to bring up additional information about that show.  3. Try closing the info box by clicking the top right 'x' of the info box.  4. This page freezes for a long period of time before Chrome asks if I want   to kill the page or keep waiting.  Sometimes the page starts working again    other times I just have to close it.        The info box should close almost immediately and I should be able to   browse the rest of the page without any freezing/hanging.        The info box stays up and the page freezes/hangs for a very long time.    Sometimes the page starts working again (only after 30+ seconds) or   sometimes it doesn't work again and I have to close that tab.    <b>Please provide
