<title>Issue 8307 -   chromium -    notes.co.il: captcha link not displayed for posting replies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.notes.co.il/yaelsela/53630.asp">http://www.notes.co.il/yaelsela/53630.asp</a>  2. Response form at bottom of page is missing the captcha image so it's not possible to post a   response.    Analysis:  This is a very simple bug in the website code and not a bug in WebKit  the fix is very easy - an   explanation follows:    If you click the _��__��__��__��_ _��__��__��__��__��__��_ link then the captcha image appears.    The original intention was for the response form to be hidden when first loading the page and   for the _��__��__��__��_ _��__��__��__��__��__��_ link to make it visible and show the captcha.    The method used to do this is that the form is wrapped in a :  &lt;span style=&quot;display:none;&quot; id=&quot;replyDiv1&quot;&gt;  &lt;form name=&quot;replay&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/inc/reply_submit.asp&quot;&gt;  ...  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;    In WebKit the form is visible from the start since it's a block level element and span is an inline   element so the above code is illegal.    Proposed fix:  Changing the code to use a div rather than a span should fix this.    So instead of the above code  you would have:  &lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot; id=&quot;replyDiv1&quot;&gt;  &lt;form name=&quot;replay&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/inc/reply_submit.asp&quot;&gt;  ...  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   </pre>
