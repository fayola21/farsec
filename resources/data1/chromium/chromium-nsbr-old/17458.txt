<title>Issue 17458 -   chromium -    Linux: chrome://history/ fails in the sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21281">r21281</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE 3  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://history/  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): don't know      1. Run with a sandbox according to the instructions at   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment</a>  2. Open a new tab page  3. Click on &quot;view full history&quot;  4. Tab crashes    (Alternately just type chrome://history/ into the omnibox in place of steps   2 and 3.)      The history tab does not crash.      The history tab crashes. It briefly shows the history logo at the top of   the page  but crashes shortly thereafter presumably while populating the   list.    While trying to get a backtrace for this  I disabled the PR_SET_DUMPABLE   bit in sandbox/linux/suid/sandbox.cc. Doing so makes it not crash. Weird. </pre>
