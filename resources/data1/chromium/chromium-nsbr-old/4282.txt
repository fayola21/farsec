<title>Issue 4282 -   chromium -    64-bit: Caret should blink in Omnibox/Find-In box. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.16 (5039)      1. Noticed  Mouse cursor does not blink at all in Google Chrome in 64-bit  vista machine. (No idea in 64-bit XP machine)      Is it a known issue (?)    What is the expected output?   Should blink.    What do you see instead?  Please note:  FF2.x  Safari 3.x: works fine.  IE7.x: Same issue as Chrome.  FYI: Set as high blinking rates in settings  but no use. </pre>
