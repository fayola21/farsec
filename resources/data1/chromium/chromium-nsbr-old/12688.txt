<title>Issue 12688 -   chromium -    chromium linux startup test regression - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looking at the graph  it looks like we regressed 5-6ms around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=16565">r16565</a>-16566:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release/startup/report.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release/startup/report.html?</a>  history=150&amp;graph=warm    The graph's a bit noisy  so it's hard to tell.  It's a small enough change   that it doesn't show up in the cold start graph.    I just checked in a new reference build  so going forward  the lines should   converge  but we should try to get those 5-6ms back. </pre>
