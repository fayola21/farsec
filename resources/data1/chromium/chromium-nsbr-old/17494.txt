<title>Issue 17494 -   chromium -    about:plugins shows up in history  but links to wrong place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you visit about:plugins  then hit ctrl-h  you see an entry for it  and it   has the right link when hovered  but clicking opens about:blank instead.    This is probably due to security restrictions preventing pages from linking   to about:*.  I'm not sure what to do about this. </pre>
