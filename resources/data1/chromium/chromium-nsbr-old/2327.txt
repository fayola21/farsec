<title>Issue 2327 -   chromium -    Missing allow scripts and trusted sites security feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Similar to the post I made earlier in Chromium-dev group  IE6 (and probably   IE7) has a security feature to browse unknown sites with added safety   without having to use another browser like Firefox with completely disabled   Javascript  etc.  I've heard that it seems like everyone is getting   infected with the fake AV XP 2008 scam/trojan that gets through with   scripts.  I got stung twice with numerous defenses on a test partition. In   IE6  you can put all trusted sites into a list (Tools | Internet Options |    Security | Trusted Sites | Sites | &lt;enter a site&gt; | Add | OK | OK) which   will be fully functional and turn disable Javascript  etc. for the rest of   the world until you gain their trust (Tools | Internet Options | Security |   Internet | Custom Level | (Reset to: ) High (or select your own options   from a list) | Reset | Yes | OK | OK).      See: <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=162515">http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=162515</a> for information   about why this is so important because it's becoming harder to verify sites   as safe.    </pre>
