<title>Issue 20238 -   chromium -    OSX Omnibox text cursor does not match text editing area. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> AutocompleteTextFieldCell adjusts the field-editor's editing area by a pixel or two  but doesn't   adjust the cursor rect.  So if you move the mouse pixel by pixel  there are spots where the i-beam   cursor appears which do not correspond to the text-editing area  and spots where the arrow cursor   appears which do correspond to the text-editing area.    I believe the solution is to override -resetCursorRect:inView:. </pre>
