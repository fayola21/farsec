<title>Issue 20151 -   chromium -    Paste and go/Paste and Search is bizarre on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT(r 24120)    -Copy a URL in to clipboard.  -Right click on Ominibox - Notice you will see 'Paste and search' instead  of 'Paste and go' and say 'Paste and search'  -Repeat step2 - This time you will notice 'paste and go' - you are good for  time beeing :)  -copy 'foo' in to clip board and repeat step2.    Expected: Paste and search should show up in the Omnibox context menu.    Result: Its previous options (Paste and go) shows up.      Basically  you will get the correct context menu option  only after  executing it for one time.         </pre>
