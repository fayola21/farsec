First you need to click for the catalog  which loads a flash app  THEN    when you try to click on items from the cattalog  you are not taken to them   (although you get a pop-up). It's a bit subtle  as if you go straight to   the URL (<a href="http://qiero.blaetterkatalog.de/qierosommer09/blaetterkatalog.php?">http://qiero.blaetterkatalog.de/qierosommer09/blaetterkatalog.php?</a>  jsessionid=ABF217DA4BAAA386C57AC7414E3E9BE0.HYBRIS_APP_52)  it appears to   work.          What is the expected result?    click opens up page with product.          What steps will reproduce the problem? (See above)  1. Select Url  2. Select Sommer 2009 katalog  3. Highlight some item and click    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  yes  FF 3.5  Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
