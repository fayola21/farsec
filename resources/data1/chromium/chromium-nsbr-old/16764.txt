<title>Issue 16764 -   chromium -    Mac L10N: Need a way to generate localized resources  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As far as I know  we don't yet have a way to generate localized versions of   Google Chrome for Mac.    I think this will involve some experimental hackery to get nibs (or something   from which we can easily get to nibs) from the grit output  so it's something   we should start early. </pre>
