<title>Issue 5313 -   chromium -    Any HTTPS site gets the &quot;Server's certificate cannot be checked&quot; error on one Windows laptop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On one laptop owned by Google Chrome QA  when we visit any  HTTPS site  we get the &quot;Server's certificate cannot be checked&quot;  error.  There is an infobar that says &quot;Unable to check whether  the server's certificate was revoked.&quot;  The location bar shows  the &quot;https&quot; of the URL in red  with a red line across it  and  a triangular warning icon.  When I mouse over the warning icon   I see the &quot;Server's certificate cannot be checked&quot; bubble.  Clicking on the warning icon  I see the Security information  dialog that says &quot;The identity of this website has not been  verified.&quot;    These error messages all describe the same error:  net::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION.  This error means  we cannot download the CRL or talk to the OCSP responder.    This laptop is running Windows Vista Enterprise Service Pack 1.  I have reproduced this bug with 0.4.154.29 (which uses WinHTTP)  and a recent trunk Developer build <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6164">r6164</a> (which uses our new  HTTP stack).    Using Wireshark  I found that Firefox 3.0.4 does OCSP on this  laptop  but Google Chrome and IE don't do OCSP.  I don't know  why.    Another issue to look into is why Google Chrome shows &quot;https&quot;  in red with a read line across it.  This particular certificate  error is supposed to be a benign condition that won't change  the location bar's security style. </pre>
