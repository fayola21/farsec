<title>Issue 6802 -   chromium -    Criteria checker should add API to choose when flag is set - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The criteria checker code once had support for setting a flag to indicate   that it had been run in the past six months.  We took out this   functionality but it is needed once again  in a new incarnation.    Along with the support to set this flag  the criteria checker should be   modified to accept a boolean that indicates whether the flag should be set   or not. </pre>
