<title>Issue 2387 -   chromium -    Add an option to enable ClearType if available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 149.29             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: fail           IE 7: OK    This is an enhancement request rather than a bug.    It would be nice to enable ClearType in Chrome  when it's available  like   does MSIE. IE7 renders with ClearType even if it's disabled system-wide.    I don't like ClearType in general  so I have it disabled system-wide. But   in a web browser it is desirable since it increases the speed of reading.  I don't think there's going to be a patent issue  since I'm not asking it   to be bundled with Chrome  but instead simply turned on if already   installed.     </pre>
