<title>Issue 11155 -   chromium -    Shouldn't draw focus rects for controls until the user presses tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It turns out that Windows (XP and up I think) won't paint a focus border for   controls at all until the user presses tab. Just clicking on the item isn't   enough to draw the focus border. Note that the item still has focus (and can   be manipulated using the keyboard  e.g. space bar for checkboxes) but just   isn't drawn as focused. I think this was part of a move to reduce the visual   noise of the UI  in similar vein to not showing underlined key accelerators   by default until alt is pressed. </pre>
