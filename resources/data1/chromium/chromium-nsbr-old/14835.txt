<title>Issue 14835 -   chromium -    Browser cuts off bottom portion of page viewport - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install Chromium from the daily builds Ubuntu PPA  2. Open FaceBook; you will see that the bottom menu bar has been lopped off   and no amount of scrolling will help you see it.  3. Open Google Reader; you will see that the &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; item   buttons at the bottom of the screen are again missing.  4. This introduces rather troublesome usability issues.         That I see the page in its entirety.        A small amount of the bottom of each page gets cut off. Like the   calculation for the view port has gone slightly screwy. I noticed that this   started happening with the daily builds since about beginning of the week   of 15th June.    <b>Please provide
