<title>Issue 20073 -   chromium -    Horizontal scrollbar in Gmail with Right-side Chat - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable Right-side Chat in Gmail.  Settings:Labs:Right-side Chat.  2. Visit Gmail inbox.      Expect: Chat moves to the right side of the window  and no horizontal   scrollbar is added.  Observe: Chat moves to the right side of the window  and an unnecessary   horizontal scrollbar appears.  The scrollbar is not removed when the   window is resized.    I'm splitting this off from <a title="Unneeded horizontal scrollbar in Gmail" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7976"> bug 7976 </a> because it's a distinct issue.  <a title="Unneeded horizontal scrollbar in Gmail" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7976"> Bug 7976 </a>   involves a horizontal scrollbar that appears when Gmail loads even when   Right-side Chat is disabled  and in that case  the horizontal scrollbar   disappears when the window is resized.    This bug occurs in Chrome regardless of OS.  It also occurs in Safari.    This may be a bug in the Right-side Chat Labs feature.  It has been   reported.    4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23673">r23673</a> official </pre>
