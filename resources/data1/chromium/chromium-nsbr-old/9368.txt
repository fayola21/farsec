<title>Issue 9368 -   chromium -    Going back to the new tab page doesn't focus the location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This sounds similar to <a title="URL field not focused by default when creating a new tab" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9352"> issue 9352 </a> but is different. This bug is with some   more upper layer: even if WebContents always says to focus the location bar    the upper layers don't do this when you go back. Fixing <a title="URL field not focused by default when creating a new tab" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9352"> issue 9352 </a> will only   fix the first navigation case. </pre>
