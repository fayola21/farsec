<title>Issue 9080 -   chromium -    Bug with scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0 (Vers��_��_o do desenvolvedor 11321) --   Portable version  URLs (if applicable) : I belive reader.google.com  Other browsers tested: FAIL to all      1. I belive that is caused by &quot;overflow resize&quot; (to scrollbar)  this is   much common on Reader.      Scrollbar is croped. Separated in 2 parts. The left-side is the correct   position  and the right-side is the last position (incorrect).    Screnshoot. </pre>
