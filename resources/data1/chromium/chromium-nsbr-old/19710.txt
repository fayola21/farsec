<title>Issue 19710 -   chromium -    SyncWaiter (base/waitable_event_watcher_posix.cc) condition variables can be destroyed during a broadcast - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've found that in an official release build with DCHECKs optimized away  it's   possible for the SyncWaiter condition variable to be destroyed during a   broadcast.  That's bad.  On the Mac  this can cause pthread_cond_broadcast   to hang (and trash its stack.)  It's easy to imagine that this can cause all sorts   of other bad behaviors as well  including crashes.    This is the true cause of the deadlock experienced in bug 16871. </pre>
