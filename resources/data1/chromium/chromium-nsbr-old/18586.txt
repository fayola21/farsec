<title>Issue 18586 -   chromium -    Add an error code for SSL connection closure without a close_notify alert - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add an error code  equivalent to the errSSLClosedNoNotify result  code of the Secure Transport library on Mac OS X  that indicates the peer  closes the SSL connection without sending an SSL close_notify alert.    When an SSL connection is closed without a close_notify  we're potentially  vulnerable to a truncation attack if the protocol running on top of SSL  doesn't have a way to determine the length of the data (such as the  &quot;Content-Length&quot; response header or chunked encoding of HTTP).    For site compatibility  I'm afraid that Chromium will have to ignore this  error  but it would be nice for SSLClientSocket to report this error. </pre>
