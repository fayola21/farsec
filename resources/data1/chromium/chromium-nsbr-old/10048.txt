<title>Issue 10048 -   chromium -    cancelling UAC prompt partially makes Chrome as default browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Login to a standard user account in Vista   2. Fresh install Chrome.  3. In the FRUI  click on &quot;Start Chrome&quot; (which means that the &quot;Make chrome   as default is checked)  4. Now you will see the UAC dialog to enter admin password comes up.  5. Click on Cancel  in the UAC dialog      If you go to the options tab in Chrome  it shows that it is default.  But if you type &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&quot; to the run prompt  Chrome is not   started (that's why it is not made default completely) or when you try to   open a link in an application  it may / may not open Chrome but instead   open the default browser set in the past.       This affects all builds.    Here's the detailed explanation from Rahul:    There are the two parts to setting Chrome as default browser. The first   part normally referred to as browser registration requires admin rights.   The second part if just changing user preferences to use Chrome as the   browser for the protocols/file extensions that it supports (this doesn't   require admin rights).     So if user fails the UAC credentials (or simply cancels the dialog box) we   fail to do the first part. This means Start Menu-&gt;Internet shortcut can not   be tied to Chrome  Google Chrome browser option will not show up in Default   Programs list among other things. But we still try to do the best we can    which means we will try to bind only the http and https protocols to Chrome   which sometimes succeed.     When you go to Chrome Options dialog box  it only checks whether we are   registered as handler for http/https protocols and hence thinks Chrome is   default browser. Now when I think about it this probably is not the right   behavior (since now the button is disabled and user can not try to set it   default again with proper UAC credentials). I think we should file a bug to   better check for default browser. This probably would need some feedback   from UI team as well since they will have to decide what to do for the   partial default browser case.   </pre>
