<title>Issue 11521 -   chromium -    NTP gets sad tab icon on crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a lot of new tabs  2. about:crash one of them    That tab goes from having no icon to (briefly) having a default favico  (piece of paper with dog-eared corner) which swaps out with sad tab favico.  The other NTPs don't get any favico  but do get sad tab contents. </pre>
