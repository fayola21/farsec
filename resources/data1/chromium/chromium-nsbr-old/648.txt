<title>Issue 648 -   chromium -    Feature Request: View Downloads in Browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to have an option to view basic text files (txt/log/etc)   and possibly picture files (png/jpg/gif/etc) in the browser rather than   opening another program; possibly implemented as a menu option when the   downloaded file is right clicked. Firefox currently opens .txt and .log   files within the browser  but I think this feature should be an option not   a default behavior.    On a side note  if this is not the correct place to request features  I am   sorry but I was unable to find another method. Please move this discussion   as needed. Thanks. </pre>
