<title>Issue 4479 -   chromium -    Need localized strings for bookmark manager 'Files of type' descriptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This applies to the bookmark manager importer File Open dialog.    I don't know if these are typically localized in Windows (should be easy to   find out)  but we should use a resource for       &quot;HTML files&quot;    instead of          &quot;*html&quot;    in this call        static const wchar_t KFilterString[] = L&quot;*.html0*.html0&quot;;        </pre>
