<title>Issue 21326 -   chromium -    Leak in Totem on dlopen() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25665">r25665</a> made the builders able to load the totem plugin  which brought up a   valgrind leak.  I suspect this is just Totem  but I should follow up to see   if it occurs in newer versions and file a bug upstream if necessary. </pre>
