<title>Issue 12040 -   chromium -    Modify repository configuration to allow WebKit upstream workflow in our tree. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The goal here is to allow engineers contribute to WebKit and Chromium from   the same checkout.    This implies that we should be able to:    * use WebKitTools (create patches and commit patches  etc.)  * build WebKit/DRT and run WebKit layout tests    A bonus goal would be to do this using git :) </pre>
