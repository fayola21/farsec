<title>Issue 4934 -   chromium -    Suggested filename for &quot;Save As&quot; poor if page has no title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The default filename for a webpage to be saved as is based off the title.    This is fine if the page has a title  but if it doesn't  the suggested   filename will be e.g. &quot;http  www.foo.com  path  query1=2 query2=3.html&quot;.    Instead  the filename in this case should be the original file name  e.g.   &quot;index.html&quot;. </pre>
