<title>Issue 18709 -   chromium -    Importing previous home page blocks on Firefox exit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the user has Firefox set as the default browser  and we attempt to   automatically import the user's previous home page  our code blocks and waits   for Firefox to close before it can import.  (I believe the first-run UI   handles this gracefully now.)    However  when automatically importing  there is no UI to tell the user that   is what is happening... so Chrome sits in the background  happily waiting for   the user to close Firefox  and the user is left wondering what happened.    We should automatically return / break / etc. If importing the home page is   blocked on another browser being open.  Ideally  we'd find a way to import   that doesn't require blocking and waiting. </pre>
