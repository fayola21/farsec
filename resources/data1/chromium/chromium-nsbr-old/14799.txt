<title>Issue 14799 -   chromium -    Unresponsive tab watchdog triggers when page is showing long modal alert() dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0 (Official Build 18043)  Linux  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://billpay.wallsfargo.com/">https://billpay.wallsfargo.com/</a>      1. owe friend money  2. visit Wells Fargo bill pay site  3. send money  4. go make breakfast  5. come back        One dialog box from Wells Fargo: &quot;Your session is too old so we're logging   you out because we're paranoid and think you're at a library!&quot;        Two dialog boxes.  One from Wells Fargo  and one from Chrome saying that   that following page(s) are unresponsive:  Bill Pay.  Because the modal   alert() dialog box is blocking the watchdog probably.
