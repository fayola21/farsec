<title>Issue 3230 -   chromium -    Crash while composing gmail and using undo (control-Z) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Press reply to existing email  2. type a line of text  and then two carriage returns  3. paste in a single line of text which uses HTML markup  such that it   induces a vertical bar at the left edge of the text (like an HTML quote)  4) type a few more characters at teh end of that markup line  then hit   several carriage returns  5) press several cntrl-Z (undo) characters  6) when the undo finally reaches the paste insertion point  the renderer   will crash.    I'll try to get a stack trace by running single-threaded         </pre>
