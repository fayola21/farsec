<title>Issue 5266 -   chromium -    Import IE7.x Passwords broken or ever worked ? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.33 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6493">r6493</a>)    I've been noticing this issue quite a long time  but It was over insight  that  the problem is only on my machine (As there is no way to view all the  stored passwords in IE7.x. At least for me  &quot;Store passwords&quot; in IE7.x  really sucks)    Today I got some time to look more into this. Surprisingly I noticed  we  don't import passwords from IE7.x at all. Confirmed this  by demonstrating  the issue in more than 4 local machines in both XP and Vista.      0. Have some UserID/Passwd stored in IE.  1. Perform imports for Saved Password from IE (It does not matter if you  import * everything)  2. You don't notice any credentials stored in Chrome Password Manager.      Observation:  ############  I've userID/Passwd saved for google internet email a/c. rediff.com   optionsxpress.com in IE.  After importing Profiles from IE  nothing stored in Chrom��_��_��_s Password Manager.  Go to login page of Optionsxpress.com[PLEASE note  I'm not logging to the  page]  surprisingly  I will notice  userID/Passwd are pre-populated in the  input boxes. NOW go to password manager  You will notice userID/Passwd for  this page stored.    Finally  I'm sad to say  at least for me  this behavior is demonstrated  even in 149.30 build also.       </pre>
