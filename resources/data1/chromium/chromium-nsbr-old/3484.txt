<title>Issue 3484 -   chromium -    Back button not clickable from left-most pixels - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I have Chrome maximized on my laptop  it's a lot harder to click the   back button because its target area doesn't extend to the leftmost pixels   of the screen.  Firefox lets me click the leftmost pixels to hit the back   button.  I mentioned this to Glen in email and he thinks we should fix   this.   </pre>
