<title>Issue 13805 -   chromium -    Abnormal termination with text form field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load a page with at least one text form field.  2. Paste in a really long string (tested with string about ~6K characters   long).  3. Navigate away from the form (e.g. by submitting it).  4. Bring up the same form again.  5. Type the first character of the previous long string.  6. An autocomplete dropdown usually shows up here  but instead  chrome on   linux consistently terminates suddenly.  The console says:    The program 'chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.    (Details: serial 59875 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()   function.)    (the 59875 number varies  but the other text stays the same)          chrome should not terminate.          chrome exited abruptly.      <b>Please provide
