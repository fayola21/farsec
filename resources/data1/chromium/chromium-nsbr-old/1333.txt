<title>Issue 1333 -   chromium -    &quot;Esc&quot; key does not work on Omnibox  if [New Tab] is set as  home page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have repro steps right now. It mostly to deal with hitting Tilda   key couple of times on the page.  I installed Chrome on my personal laptop. After using for a while...when   Navsuggested drop-down list is visible  Hitting &quot;Esc&quot; key did not close the   drop down list. I thought the &quot;Esc&quot; key is gone on my laptop. Created new   window  Esc key works fine as expected.    Observations:  -Can't cancel the drop-down list.  -Can't cancel the edits in the URL  -Happens on all the tabs of the same browser window.  -If a tab is drag and dropped to new window -- Then I can't repro this.  -Can cancel Context menu    This is happened today also on my work machine and showed demo to Mark.     </pre>
