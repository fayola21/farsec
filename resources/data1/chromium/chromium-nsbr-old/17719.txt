<title>Issue 17719 -   chromium -    Improve tab closing animation (tab shrinks to zero width) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tab animations that involve the new tab button are really janky. Cole says   the new tab button is the root of all evil somehow.    e.g. Mash down Cmd+T... note how janky the insertion animations are.  compare to dragging around a tab towards the start of the tabstrip - smooth   animations. </pre>
