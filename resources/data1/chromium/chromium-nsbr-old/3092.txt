<title>Issue 3092 -   chromium -    Forward declaration of WebCore::SharedBuffer fails with gcc 4.3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build fails using g++ 4.3.0 on fedora core 9:    In file included from  /home/craig/chromium/src/webkit/port/platform/graphics/AffineTransformSkia.cpp:36:  /home/craig/chromium/src/webkit/port/platform/graphics/SkiaUtils.h:17:  error: declaration 'class WebCore::SharedBuffer' does not declare anything  scons: *** [Hammer/webkit/port/platform/graphics/AffineTransformSkia.o] Error 1  scons: building terminated because of errors.    Including SharedBuffer.h and killing the offending line makes things  compile again. Another option is to do  namespace WebCore {    class SharedBuffer;  }    I have not tested if the windows build is happy with either of these options. </pre>
