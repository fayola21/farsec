<title>Issue 9069 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Edited offline tag in docs doesn't go away even after going online and syncing is done - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to docs.google.com and turn on offline mode  2. Once syncing is done  disconnect the network connection and reload the   docs tab  3. Open a document and edit it  4. Click on save and close  5. Enable network connection  6. Reload the tab again    What is the expected output?  After enabling the network connection  once the sync is done  edited   offline tag should go away.    What do you see instead?  Edited offline tag still appears   </pre>
