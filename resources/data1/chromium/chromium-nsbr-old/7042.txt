<title>Issue 7042 -   chromium -    Problem typing username manually on some sites when a username/password is autofilled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (was bug b/1270914)    [Original Steps] (see reduced test case)  1 Log in to <a href="http://www.taobao.com">http://www.taobao.com</a> and save the credentials in Chromium.  2 Log out and revisit the login page  3 Start typing a different username starting with the same letter    [Result]  Chromium doesn't let you because the autofilled value clobbers your typing.   (seems to work if you type the first letter twice).    Similar to <a title="Password manager autofill does not kick in when replacing existing autofilled name" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3385"> issue 3385 </a>.    The problem is with some JS on the page that does  // ... usn = username input element  usn.onfocus = function(){usn.select();usn.style.color = &quot;#000&quot;;};    so that whenever a DOMFocusIn event fires for the element the text is   selected. I overrode this by using the js console to do 'usn.onfocus =   function () { };' and from that point on the AC worked  so I attached a   reduced test case (Enter a login and save  go back to the page and try to   type it in. You'll see the same behavior).    The extra JS is conflicting with some work-arounds for   <a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169769">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169769</a>.      </pre>
