<title>Issue 2750 -   chromium -    Fix problem with CONSOLE MESSAGE line numbers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to revert commit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2575">r2575</a>.    There is some weirdness with line numbering on the output of CONSOLE  MESSAGE output  where the line numbers are off by one. Attempting to do the  naive thing and simply add or subtract one breaks other tests. This is  compounded by some of the layout tests from webkit already being off by one  (and I suspect that that's related to webkit <a title="RegExp whitespace character class ignores 'xA0' (non-breaking-space)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5206"> bug #5206 </a>?). There is most  likely a bug in our binding code and when fixed  we may need to fork a  different set of test cases.    Theories:  1) This is a weird parsing problem in v8 or the code binding v8 to webkit.  2) This is a manifestation of <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5206">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5206</a>   but the details appear to be behind Radar so I'm not sure. </pre>
