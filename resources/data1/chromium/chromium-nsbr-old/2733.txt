<title>Issue 2733 -   chromium -    Cannot set as default browser in Vista 64bit. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Vista 64bid installed.  2. Open Options on Chrome  3. Click the Make Chrome My default Browser.  4. Nothing happens.  Confirmed it is NOT the default by opening links.  Ran   as Admin  tried the same thing  still nothing.    Chrome isn't even listed as a browser option from Default programs list   within Vista.    Kinda puts a damper on heavy use of the browser not to be able to open   links from an email with it.                Please provide
