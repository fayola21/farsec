<title>Issue 19391 -   chromium -    base/ should get a reader-writer lock implementation (for use by sync) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should implement a general purpose reader-writer lock in base/    The sync engine code (not yet open sourced) has a usage-specific   implementation of a reader-writers lock  but it has shortcomings: it's not   reusable  it depends heavily on pthread thread-local storage  and it leaks   memory in the common case.    We could hack on this one impl to fix the leaks (harder than it looks -- TLS   is tricky)  but the effort would be better spent on writing or porting a   general-purpose impl for chrome/base. </pre>
