<title>Issue 3654 -   chromium -    Bound maximum memory used for headers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe there is currently no bound on |header_buf_| in   http_network_transaction.cc.    This means an evil site could keep sending headers and eventually chromium   would run out of memory.    Probably reasonable to bound the maximum size of headers to something like   1 megabyte. </pre>
