<title>Issue 20493 -   chromium -    links in mac about box don't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/173606">http://codereview.chromium.org/173606</a> lands  the about box has the   links for the licenses  but following   <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2006/qa1487.html">http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2006/qa1487.html</a> I wasn't about to get   them to work.  Some with better UI foo then I needs to take a look and get the   links clickable.  It's worth noting we don't want the links to go to the default   browser  but we need to handle them ourselves because some are about links    so we need to show our pages. </pre>
