<title>Issue 8207 -   chromium -    Gears startup should always be slower than regular startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A couple days ago we regressed pretty much every perf test (except DHTML)   pretty noticeably.    CCing random people.  Finnur's find bar change landed around here  as did a   WebKit merge from eseidel; dglazkov was looking at effects of cache   accounting changes  but that should only have affected the intl cyclers (he   says). </pre>
