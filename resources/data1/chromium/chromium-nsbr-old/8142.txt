<title>Issue 8142 -   chromium -    Do we un-maximize the widow first  each time before entering/exiting Full screen mode ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.167.0 (Developer Build 10506)    This is interesting !!    I noticed  every time we enter full screen mode/exit full screen from  MAXIMIZED WINDOW  we first resize the window to un-maximized mode  then  replace it with the original activity (either full screen mode or  maximized-mode)    -Resize the window to smaller size (the smaller you can  will be the better  to repro)  -Maximize the window.  -Enter Full Screen mode (you can notice the window 1st flashes to  un-maximized mode and then immediately switches to full-screen mode.)  -Exit Full screen mode (you can notice the window 1st flashes to  un-maximized mode and then immediately switches to maximized mode.)     </pre>
