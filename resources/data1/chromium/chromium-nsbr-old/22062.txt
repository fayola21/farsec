<title>Issue 22062 -   chromium -    Find markers in scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apple's FileMerge utility displays markers in the scrollbar indicating the   position of diffs in a document.    Yaar suggested it might be nice if the contextual find option in Chrome   displayed similar markers presenting a visual indication of where the matches   are in the document. </pre>
