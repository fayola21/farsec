<title>Issue 10671 -   chromium -    Clicking html buttons on certain sites require a refresh of the page for you to activate the buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   This website is from Site Build It  it is used to create your own websites.   And up until I think version 173  there were no problems and I havent   experienced it in any other sites. But the problem is  is that when I am   editing a page and I click a button to finalize the page  a dialog box   appears normally and you click ok. But then nothing happens  I have to   refresh the page and click the finalize button again for it to actually   load.     When I click the finalize button it should load a new page.    You click the button and no pages load.    <b>Please provide
