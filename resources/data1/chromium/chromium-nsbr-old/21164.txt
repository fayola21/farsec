<title>Issue 21164 -   chromium -    Autofill breaks Craigslist email-a-friend feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (25570)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://losangeles.craigslist.org/">http://losangeles.craigslist.org/</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK        1. Take any posting and use the &quot;email a friend&quot; option. Use autofill to fill   in your email address (you may have to do this a couple times for that   option to be available)      You get an email      About 1 out of 3 times  it will show you a message that says &quot;You did not   specify a posting ID  so we don't know what to send you.&quot; Clicking back   and then pushing submit again fixes this.    It seems to only be intermittently reproducible...so feel free to mark   worksforme if you can't reproduce it. </pre>
