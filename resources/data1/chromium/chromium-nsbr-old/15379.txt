<title>Issue 15379 -   chromium -    The BlockedPopupContainer uses hard coded values instead of BrowserThemeProvider - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of asking the ThemeProvider for the two colors that form the   gradient  BlockedPopupContainer (both platform versions) use hardcoded   values. They should read the two values from the ThemeProvider.    I'm willing to do the legwork on this  but I'm not sure where to start since   none of the theme colors in BrowserThemeProvider match the hard coded values   in BlockedPopupContainerView*. </pre>
