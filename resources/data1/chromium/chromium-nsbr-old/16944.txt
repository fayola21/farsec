<title>Issue 16944 -   chromium -    Cannot open or copy file while downloading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. I am downloading a file  2. I want to preview it while downloading  so I try copy the partial file   to another folder  3. An &quot;access denied - file is in use&quot; error appears.      I should easily copy the file being downloaded  like in Firefox I can copy   the *.part file.      An error appears in Windows XP SP3. </pre>
