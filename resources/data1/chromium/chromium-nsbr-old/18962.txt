<title>Issue 18962 -   chromium -    middle click anywhere send window to background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.0~svn20090810r22916-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Kubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE            1. open a page with links  2. click on the link with middle mouse button  OR  1. middle-click anywhere in the window (except address bar      Open link in new tab      The link indeed opens in a new tab  but the window is sent to background   (which is the expected behavior -- at least from my KDE configuration --   when middle-click on the window title bar)    It seems that middle-click ANYWHERE on the window send it to background    which is also very annoying when using the middle click copy/past feature   of Linux.    NB: I have disabled the window-manager windows decorations for chromium-  browser from the KDE settings menu  which seems equivalent to disable   system title bar and borders from right-click on the chromium-browser title   bar. </pre>
