<title>Issue 3315 -   chromium -    regression: encoding override does not work  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In 0.3.15[34].0  encoding override does not work any more.     It may or may not be a regression due to webkit merge. I'll figure out when  this regressed  by trying builds at     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/</a> </pre>
