<title>Issue 21827 -   chromium -    Potential race condition while registering the UMA histogram AsyncIO.IPCChannelClose - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Not easy to reproduce. Can be reproduced with multiple automation  client connections. As per discussion with jam  the Channel::ChannelImpl::Close can be called from multiple threads  which  causes a DCHECK to fire when we try to register the above histogram.   </pre>
