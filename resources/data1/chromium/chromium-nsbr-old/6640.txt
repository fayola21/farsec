<title>Issue 6640 -   chromium -    USAA Banking Website Won't Give Overview of Accounts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.usaa.com/inet/ent_logon/Logon?">https://www.usaa.com/inet/ent_logon/Logon?</a>  redirectjsp=true           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to the above-listed website and log in. Logging in IS required.        It appears that some AJAX coding is supposed to populate a list of accounts   and balances  then display them.        Loading continues indefinitely; 5 minutes +. It should take &lt;2 seconds.    Pictures of the loading screen in chrome (usaa.jpg) and the way it should   be (usaa_ff.jpg) in firefox are attached.   </pre>
