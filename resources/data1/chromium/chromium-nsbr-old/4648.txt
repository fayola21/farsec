<title>Issue 4648 -   chromium -    Chrome fails launch  provides no feedback. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.23  URLs (if applicable) : NA           Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: NA           IE 7: NA    I'm sorry  I can't write a reproducible bug. But here is what I saw:    I closed Chrome completely. No error or issue preceeded this program close;   I just needed to close it. Later  all attempts to start it again failed. I   tried from Start menu  from another shortcut I had  and from cmd  providing   full path to chrome.exe. I also tried with the &quot;--no-sandbox&quot; directive.   Always the same result. No hourglass  no error  no indication I had even   tried to launch the app. I rebooted the (Vista SP1 with all current   updates) system. Same result.    I tried going to the Chrome installer page (from IE) and reinstalling   Chrome. The installer did appear to run but did not complete by starting   Chrome. Subsequent attempts to start Chrome failed as above.    Finally I used &quot;Programs and Features&quot; to uninstall Chrome  then   reinstalled. This put me back on the 0.3.154.9 version which did start and   run correctly - even to the extent of opening all tabs from my prior closed   session. So that's a good thing!          I would have expected some sort of error or crash report to pop up on   screen each time Chrome failed to launch.            Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.  After the reboot  I did find this one error in Vista's Application Log.   Please note  I found ONE INSTANCE of this error; it does not repeat on each   attempt to launch Chrome. I found no other errors.    --event log quote---  Fault bucket 1000282336  type 1  Event Name: APPCRASH  Response: None  Cab Id: 533438076    Problem signature:  P1: chrome.exe  P2: 0.0.0.0  P3: 4906bcbc  P4: chrome.dll  P5: 0.3.154.9  P6: 4906bc12  P7: c0000005  P8: 00522507  P9:   P10:     Attached files:  C:Usersbryan.PURGATORYAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWERReportQueueRe  port1fecf632WER8D66.tmp.version.txt  C:Usersbryan.PURGATORYAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWERReportQueueRe  port1fecf632WER8D67.tmp.appcompat.txt  C:Usersbryan.PURGATORYAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWERReportQueueRe  port1fecf632WER8F99.tmp.hdmp  C:Usersbryan.PURGATORYAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWERReportQueueRe  port1fecf632WERF419.tmp.mdmp    These files may be available here:  C:Usersbryan.PURGATORYAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWERReportArchive  Report0c254765  --endquote--    I will attach these files.
