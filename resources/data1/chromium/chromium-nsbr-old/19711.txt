<title>Issue 19711 -   chromium -    Resource handlers require unittests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Most of the resource handler classes in chrome/browser/renderer_host/ do   not have unittests. This makes introducing serious bugs quite easy  as the   code paths between the network stack  ResourceDispatcherHost and the   various ResourceHandler subclasses are very complex.    We should enumerate as many scenarios as we can think of (pausing    canceling  deferring  downloading  safebrowsing checks  etc) and write unit   tests for them.   </pre>
