<title>Issue 12694 -   chromium -    Dialog size differences between XP and Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Consider the following screenshot comparing two XP dialogs (xp and classic   theme) and a Vista dialog. All screenshots were taken with dialog height=16   in en-us locale.    Notice the whitespace between the combobox and the buttons. It seems a little   different between themes on XP and a *lot* different when comparing XP to   Vista.    This makes it hard to size dialogs so that it looks good on all platforms --   you have to err on the side of too much whitespace (as in the Vista dialog).    Can these metrics be made to work more like the same on both platforms? </pre>
