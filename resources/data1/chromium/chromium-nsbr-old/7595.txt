<title>Issue 7595 -   chromium -    Double-clicking in address bar appears to select word+non-word char; writing keeps non-word char - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0  URLs (if applicable) : *      1. Double-click a string of alphanumeric characters in the address bar that   is followed by a non-alphanumeric character.  2. Note that the whole string of alphanumeric characters was selected    along with the non-alphanumeric character.  3. Type something.  4. Note that the non-alphanumeric character was not replaced  even though   it was selected.      Only the alphanumeric characters should be selected  to avoid implying that   the non-alphanumeric character will also be replaced when typing.      The non-alphanumeric character is kept  despite being selected.    This appears to be some kind of special behavior for typing  as   copying/cutting/deleting/pasting includes the non-alphanumeric character. I   personally find the behavior misleading and keep adding the character I   thought would disappear when typing. </pre>
