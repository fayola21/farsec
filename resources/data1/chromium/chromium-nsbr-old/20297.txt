<title>Issue 20297 -   chromium -    Typing backspace while in a form field causes the browser to go back in its history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24425">revision 24425</a>)  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : fluxbox  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list</a>  2. Type &quot;test&quot; into the search box  3. Without refocusing the cursor  press the backspace key      The last character of &quot;test&quot; should be deleted      In addition to the above happening  the browser moves back one page in that   tab's history.    This works on any page with any form field (both text boxes and text   arrays)  I just thought I'd pick a test case I know you all have open right   now. </pre>
