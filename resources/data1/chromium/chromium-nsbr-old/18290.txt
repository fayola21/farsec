<title>Issue 18290 -   chromium -    Ability to create a custom browser window (for developers) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3    This is more of a suggestion than anything.    I think that it would be fantastic if there were some sort of factory   interface for creating the main browser window so that specialist   applications can provide a custom user interface (BrowserView) without having   to modify the internals of the Chromium source.    Unless I am mistaken  I have not been able to find anything like this within   the Chromium sources.    This would be great for creating specialized applications such as:    - Web-oriented multimedia players (like Spotify  and Songbird)    - Reference material that is distributed on discs (like Microsoft Encarta) </pre>
