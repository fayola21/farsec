<title>Issue 10049 -   chromium -    Linux: get icon filename from file filename - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Basically  you would go from &quot;~/Downloads/file_i_just_downloaded.extension&quot;  to &quot;/usr/share/blablabla/program_icon.png&quot;. We need this for the icon  loader  which is used in the download shelf. Not sure if it's used anywhere  else.    Luckily the xdg standard does touch on this:  &lt;<a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html">http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html</a>&gt;  What we need is something similar to what we have in  chrome/test/xdg_user_dirs/*. We suspect that this would be useful for many  projects besides just chromium. Lei has volunteered to look into this for us. </pre>
