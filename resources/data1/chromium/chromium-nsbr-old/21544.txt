<title>Issue 21544 -   chromium -    View:Make Text Bigger/Smaller and Page:Zoom:Larger/Smaller should be disabled when zoomed to the limit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   (On a Mac  because there's a menu bar)  1. Go to a web page.  2. Press command-= (equals/plus) a bunch of times to zoom in.  3. After reaching the maximum zoom  keep pressing command-=.      Expect: the command should become disabled when reaching maximum   zoom.  Observe: the command is not disabled  so the View menu keeps blinking   with each command-= keystroke.    Firefox  Camino  and Safari get this right.    The Page:Zoom:Larger/Smaller items are not disabled at zoom limits on   Windows either  but it's less of an issue there because there's no menu bar   to blink.      Mac 4.0.207.0 official release (207 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25617">r25617</a>)  Mac 4.0.208.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25938">r25938</a>  Windows 4.0.206.1 official release </pre>
