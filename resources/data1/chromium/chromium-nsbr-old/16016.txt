<title>Issue 16016 -   chromium -    Entering an audio/video URL into the omnibox should open with HTML5 audio/video - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For Chromium  Ogg+Theora/Vorbis URLs should open with HTML5 audio/video    similar what entering an image URL would do.    For Chrome  MP3 and MP4+H264/AAC content should also open with HTML5   audio/video.  Otherwise the default/current behaviour would take over   (delegate to plugin or download the file). </pre>
