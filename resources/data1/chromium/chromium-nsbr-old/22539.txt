<title>Issue 22539 -   chromium -    Bazaar icons do not appear beside Launchpad blueprints - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://blueprints.launchpad.net/">http://blueprints.launchpad.net/</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL    Steps to reproduce:   1. Browse Launchpad blueprints to find a list of blueprints (e.g.  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/launchpad">https://blueprints.launchpad.net/launchpad</a> or  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/pype">https://blueprints.launchpad.net/pype</a>)    Expected result:   * Certain blueprint entries should have icons beside them to indicate  various states  such as &quot;Branch is available&quot; or &quot;Mentoring offered&quot;. See  the file blueprints-firefox.png for example.    Actual result:   * No icons are display beside any of the blueprints. See the file  blueprints-chrome.png for example.      I believe that I know the cause of the issue; the Bazaar icon is generated  (in Firefox  anyway) by the following line:    &lt;span alt=&quot;branch&quot; title=&quot;Branch is available&quot; class=&quot;sprite branch&quot; /&gt;    Enabling resource tracking in Chrome developer tools  I see several errors  popping up that read:    XML self-closing tag syntax used on &lt;span&gt;. The tag will not be closed.    I tried saving the source of the blueprints page to my desktop and manually  modifying one of these span lines to read like the following:    &lt;span alt=&quot;branch&quot; title=&quot;Branch is available&quot; class=&quot;sprite  branch&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;    When I load this test page  the Bazaar icon shows as expected (see attached  screenshot blueprints-chrome-working.png). I'm not sure that this is the  best solution  but I believe that it determines the source of the issue:  self-closing tags on span are ignored by Chrome. I'm not sure what the  (X)HTML spec says about self-closing spans -- this could be a WebKit bug or  a Launchpad bug. </pre>
