<title>Issue 2264 -   chromium -    Youtube bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>       Sometimes  if i begin to play a youtube video (other pages like that do the   same thing  so the problem is perhaps with the Chrome)  the Chrome begins   to play it  for a few second (3-4 sec) without sound  and than stop it. If   i shut down the whole Chrome  then it will be good. But it's a bit   annoying.                Please provide
