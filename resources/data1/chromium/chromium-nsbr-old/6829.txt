<title>Issue 6829 -   chromium -    Should we call SetICMMode() when printing? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With a virtual printer  I realized that IE7 calls SetICMMode(context    ICM_OFF); but Chrome doesn't. It may explain the difference in the image   output. Need to decide what's the best decision for the user across   different printers: photo inkjet vs B&amp;W laser. </pre>
