<title>Issue 11048 -   chromium -    Report Bug or Broken Web Site Window can't be closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.59  URLs (if applicable) : any    1. sometimes when you try to open the browser it show the window &quot;Report   Bug or Broken Web Site&quot; and you CAN'T close it. Even if you stop the   process with ctrl-alt-supr when you try to start it again you will receive   this message and you can't do anything about it. You CAN'T close the alert   window or the main window. If you click on the Cancel button the alert   window still there  if you click on Send Report the alert window is still   there. Its really annoying! A few hours later something happened and you   can work again.  2.If you open a second window you can work on this window  but the window   showing the alert message will be there for ages! You can't do anything   about it.        The expected result should be that when you click on the cancel button the   alert window disappear  or if you click on Send Report button the alert   window go out and you can work again  but no. That is some kind of immortal   alert window!    Attached is a screen shot </pre>
