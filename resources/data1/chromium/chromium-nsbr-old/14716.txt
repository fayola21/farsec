<title>Issue 14716 -   chromium -    Warn user when quitting with multiple tabs/windows open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0 (18678)  OS + version : openSUSE 11.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Metacity    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Warn when quitting with multiple   tabs open (unless you disable this feature)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): No idea      1. Open a bunch of tabs.  2. Accidentally hit ctrl+q (which is very easy if you mean to hit ctrl+w).          Be presented with a warning dialog saying &quot;you have a kabillion tabs open    are you sure you want to quit?&quot;.  There should also be a checkbox saying   &quot;don't ask me again&quot;.          Chromium quits and I am sad because all my tabs are gone.      I am burned by this missing feature multiple times a day (yes I know I suck   at computers). </pre>
