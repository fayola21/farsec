<title>Issue 17232 -   chromium -    FEATURE REQUEST: View History As Thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The ability to view your entire history as thumbnails. Not as big or drastic as   cover flow just a simple option in the history to view the pages visited as   thumbnails.    It is easier and quicker to recognize a page visually than by its name and written   words alone.     To prevent waste of memory and time  perhaps just the main site is shown in the   history as a thumbnail. Then a button to expand it to show thumbnails of the   pages visited within that website. </pre>
