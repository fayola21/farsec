<title>Issue 17831 -   chromium -    Download shelf item layout is too dumb - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the download shelf just increases the x position of all existing   items by 200 when a new item is added. This doesn't work when items are   removed  or when there are download items that are not 200 pixels wide   (such as the &quot;dangerous download&quot; warning). Need a real item layout routine.    I will probably fix this when I fix <a href="http://crbug.com/14665">http://crbug.com/14665</a> </pre>
