<title>Issue 19474 -   chromium -    When behind NTLM firewall with multiple load balanced web proxies  Chrome asks for my username/password up to 8 times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Close chrome  2. Open chrome  3. Browse to any external page  4. Chrome will ask for username/password up to 8 times  i assume this is   once for each proxy server? For some prompts it remembers the password  for   others it doesn't      It would be best if it only asked once upon startup and remembered the   password. Even better  if it automatically retried the password from the   previous launch  and only prompted for a password if it didn't work  like   firefox.      It prompts 8 times for my password  and remembers the password in about   half of the prompts.      <b>Please provide
