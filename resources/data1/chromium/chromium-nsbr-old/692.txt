<title>Issue 692 -   chromium -    Images larger than screen resolution cannot be viewed completely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to the above url  2. click on the image of the cactus  this links to the full sized image   which will load in another window.  3. This window opens showing the image  but with no scroll bars or zoom      The result that I would expect would be to either have the image scale to   fit the window with an option to view it at full size or at different   zooms.  Alternately having scroll bars would be nice for windows containing   images larger than the display area to feature scroll bars.      The image is displayed with its top-left corner at the top-left of the   display and only as much of the image as I can fit on the screen shown.    There is no way to move around to view the rest.    Please provide
