<title>Issue 17110 -   chromium -    Detaching a tab makes windowed flash plugin disappear  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	3.0.195.0 (Developer Build 0)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.0 Safari/532.0        URLs  : <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a>          1. Open two tabs one with youtube flash video   2. play video and then start dragging tab to detach it (to see a small   screen with the tab) still dragging attach at the same place (or different   window doesn't matter)  3. flash move should be grey now but should be still playing (sound   required)  4. start scrolling down flash rectangle should stay at the same place       flash video should be still playing       I can see a grey rectangle (sound of flash video still playing) rectangle   is detached from html so if you scroll down it stays at the same place if   you click on any link on the page page loads but rectangle stays on the   page covering everything    See attached video     </pre>
