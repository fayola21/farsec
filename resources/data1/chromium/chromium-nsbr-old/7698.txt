<title>Issue 7698 -   chromium -    RTL: &quot;Find In Page&quot; text field should change writing direction based on directionality of first character. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch an RTL instance of Chrome by adding --lang=he to the command   line.  2. Navigate to a webpage and open the Find dialog: cntrl-f  3. Type the letter 'a'.      Chrome should use the first character with strong directionality in the   string to set the directionality of the find dialog and should align the   insertion point to the left.    For an example of how this should work open www.google.co.il and type the   letter 'a'  then delete it and type a Hebrew letter  notice how the   directionality of the text input field changes.    The standard windows UI doesn't provide this functionality  but IMHO we   should do this for Find In Page text field. </pre>
