<title>Issue 19738 -   chromium -    need to handle all Google Accounts login error states - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1758520    If you have no network connection and try to start syncing  the set up   wizard will show &quot;Username and password do not match&quot; instead of  &quot;Could not connect to server&quot;    Reproduction steps:    1.  Disable network connection  eg. ipconfig /release  2.  Start up chrome w/ --enable-sync  3.  Go to Wrench-&gt;Options-&gt;User Data-&gt;Start Syncing  4.  Login    Notice the wrong error message.    It appears in a callback from SyncApi  as reported via ProfileSyncService-  &gt;backend_-&gt;GetDetailedStatus()  the auth_problem_ has been set to:    AUTH_PROBLEM_INVALID_GAIA_CREDENTIALS    when it should be    AUTH_PROBLEM_CONNECTION_FAILED      This is caused by not currently handling the full domain of error codes the   Google Accounts service can return  and mapping some failure codes to   &quot;invalid credentials&quot;. </pre>
