<title>Issue 19422 -   chromium -    Japanese IME fails to handle key inputs when Omnibox suggestion list is shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (202.0) <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23522">r23522</a>    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;            1. Input some characters in the Omnibox and wait for the suggestion list   is open.  2. Try to input more characters with Japanese IME on.        The Japanese IME handles key inputs  do Romaji to Hiragana conversion    and wait for more key to conversion to Kanji.      The IME does Romaji to Hiragana conversion  but then newly created   Hiragana characters are deleted  and only the text inputted at the step #1   remains. This is not always  sometimes newly created Hiragana characters   remains.   </pre>
