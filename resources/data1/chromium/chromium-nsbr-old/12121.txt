<title>Issue 12121 -   chromium -    Implement extension uninstall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the 'backend' of the uninstall feature  it doesn't include the UI   work  which is more a part of <a title="Implement final management UI" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12119"> issue 12119 </a>. Extension uninstallation shouldn't   require a restart; all the parts of the extension should get unloaded   immediately.    We should be able to uninstall all types of extensions (internal  external    and --load-extension).    Uninstalling an external extension will put a flag somewhere in the   preferences that we shouldn't load that extension from the external location   at startup.    Uninstalling a --load-extension extension will just unload it. </pre>
