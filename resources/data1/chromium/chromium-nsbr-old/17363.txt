<title>Issue 17363 -   chromium -    Chromium does not respect KDE's global proxy settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0~svn20090720r21115-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty   (and not to mention just about any build)  OS + version : Kubuntu Jaunty 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A      1. Open KDE's system settings  2. Go to Network Settings  3. Configure a proxy server  4. Start Chromium        Chromium should respect KDE's proxy settings when KDE is running as the   desktop environment (and it should respect any running desktop   environment's proxy settings as well).    My workaround right now is to write a script to export $http_proxy but   that's a rather ugly hack.        It still runs like no proxy has been set.     </pre>
