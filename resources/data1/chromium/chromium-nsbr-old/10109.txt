<title>Issue 10109 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   We're much closer now. To fully pass this we need encoders for jpg  and gif  which is a low priority.   DEFER WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/fast/canvas/toDataURL-supportedTypes.html = FAIL  (Automatically generated from line 994 to line 998 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
