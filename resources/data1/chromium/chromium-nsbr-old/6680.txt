<title>Issue 6680 -   chromium -    Dragged-out tab from maximized Chrome retains full screen dimensions even though it's not maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Maximize Chrome window.  2. Make sure there is more than one tab in it.  3. Tear-off one tab.        Only part of the new window is visible on the screen. I have to reposition   it manually to use it.    I'm using Chrome 2.0.157.2. I see two possible ways to handle such   situations:    a) make dragged-out tab maximized too and fit it on screen  b) resize (make smaller) the tab to make it fit on the screen </pre>
