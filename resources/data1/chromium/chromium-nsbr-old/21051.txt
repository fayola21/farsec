<title>Issue 21051 -   chromium -    apitest testCallback should be stricter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A couple of common errors I've been running into that it should help me with:    testCallback(function() {...}) should immediately throw an error (first arg   should be a bool).  Now it instantly succeeds.      testCallback(true  function() {...});  testCallback(true  function() {...});    the second one should instantly fail.  now the behavior is a bit strange   (especially if one of them fails). </pre>
