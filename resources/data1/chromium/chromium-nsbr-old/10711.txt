<title>Issue 10711 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: browser hang while trying to paint windowed plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: browser hang while trying to paint windowed plugin    Details:    1- Browser calls RedrawWindow(ALLCHILDREN)  2- Plugin process receives WM_PAINT  3- Plugin process calls a NPAPI method during its WM_PAINT handler  4- That results in a SyncChannel::Send to the renderer  5- That allows an incoming IPC from the renderer to be dispatched in the   plugin process  6- That received IPC is to initialize a new plugin instance  which results   in a SyncChannel::Send of PluginProcessHostMsg_CreateWindow to the browser   process  7- The IO thread in the browser process receives the CreateWindow IPC  and   then it does a PostTask to the browser UI thread    The posted task in step #7 never runs because the UI thread is still   blocked waiting for RedrawWindow to return. </pre>
