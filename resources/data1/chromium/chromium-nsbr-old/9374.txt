Open a flash application (game) using keyboard input  2. Alt + Shift to change the input language        The input language should obviously change  this is especially important   for WASD control in games  since some keyboard are AZERTY or whatever...        The keyboard mapping doesn't change and the app still uses default keyboard   mapping </pre>
