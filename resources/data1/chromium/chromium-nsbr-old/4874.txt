<title>Issue 4874 -   chromium -    autocomplete form history in textboxes is really very buggy (2 bugs listed here) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 6031)      Bug 1) No way to turn off auto completion which i have noticed is added in   builds lately. (no feature in such a important thing is also a bug in   itself)    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Bug 2 </a>) Home key in keyboard doesn't work when auto complete list pops. This   one really sucks. hope this gets fixed soon.      1. write something in text box  that u have already typed in textboxes in   chromium. When it invokes auto completion list and drop down list pops.   Press Home key to go to begining of the text. Thats it  it doesn't work!!!      Home key should work even if dropdown list in textbox for autocomplete is   open.      Home key press event is ignored. </pre>
