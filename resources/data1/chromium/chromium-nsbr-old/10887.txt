<title>Issue 10887 -   chromium -    Find bar disappears while typing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to google.com  - hit command-f to display the find bar. See it in all its hotness.  - type &quot;asdf&quot;    Expected:    - find bar should still be visible    Actual:    - as you type  the content area repaints which causes it to draw over the  find bar  leaving you with just a text field.    I tried using addSubview:position:relativeTo: to have it topmost in the  view hierarchy  as well as making the FindBarView opaque  but neither thing  seemed to help. I'm not sure why it's getting overdrawn.   </pre>
