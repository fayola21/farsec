<title>Issue 12610 -   chromium -    Wrong download speed and formatting issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all versions from day one    chrome checks the download speed based on the time the download began  and based on the current bytes received  here is an example that will show this bug       download a big fil    disconnect the network after some time      the DL speed becomes 0      chrome counts down like there is no tomorrow ... :)    also  while at it  the download speed shows a &lt;int&gt;.&lt;fraction&gt; iff(!)   the fraction is not 0  which causes flicker  and i would like it to always   show the decimal point    i post it here  as i want to fix both problems but from what i get you   first need some approval  so the ball is in your court now    (one note  i plan to calc the DL speed based on the last kSeconds (say 4?)   who passed since the last sample)    give the green light  and this is history </pre>
