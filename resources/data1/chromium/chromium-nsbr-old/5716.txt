<title>Issue 5716 -   chromium -    Control Keys in webmail editor don't work (e.g.  Tab  Ctrl+B for bold  Ctrl+I [iye] for Italic) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) :  any webmail using &quot;SmarterMail Enterprise 4.3&quot;  or   pretty much any WIKI or other site supporting control character macros.  Other browsers tested: IE    IE 6: OK    IE 7: OK      1. Raise Compose New Message    2. Enter some text in the message body    3. Select (highlight) a word or phrase in the message body    4. Hold Control key and press &quot;B&quot; key  EXPECTED: The selected text will become bold.  DEFECT: The control keystroke is ignored.  NOTE ALSO: The [B] Icon on the tool bar is in fact selcted  however  it   appears that the expected &quot;click&quot; event does not occur.    Note also: The TAB key does not behave as expected; instead of inserting a   an actual tab or a series of spaces  a line break is inserted and the new   whitespace is selected.  TAB is dropped in this &quot;chromium/issues/entry&quot;   compose control as well!    ...Since I just tried &quot;Ctrl + U&quot; and was treated to a new &quot;View Source&quot;   window  I can only presume that all low-ASCII strokes are commandeered by   the framework.      SUGGESTION: Make the custom control character behavior a &quot;developer mode   option&quot; and turn it off by default. </pre>
