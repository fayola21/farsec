<title>Issue 19882 -   chromium -    Poor UI flow when installing extensions from untrusted sites  or dragging .crx onto browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When dragging a local .crx onto a browser window  I got the following   behavior:  * The download arrow indicator animated  * The download bar appeared with the &quot;untrusted filetype&quot; save/cancel   button  * After hitting Save  I got a prompt for &quot;Really want to install?&quot;    I am also told this is the UI flow when clicking a .crx link on a random   website.    There are a couple problems here:  * The download animation  download bar  and download prompt text are all   surprising  since the user isn't thinking of this action as a &quot;download&quot;   (and if it was a download  wouldn't expect an auto-install to suddenly   follow)  regardless of what actually happens under the hood  * Dual-prompting is somewhat annoying  especially for the locally-dragged-  .crx case    Firefox uses an infobar on untrusted sites  plus a prompt after navigating   that hurdle  with a countdown before enabling the OK button (to defeat a   timing attack on the user).  The countdown feels weird and most users don't   know why it's there.    It seems like for dragged-onto-the-browser .crx files we could just show   our current &quot;second prompt&quot; with no changes (although if there's a way to   trigger the timing attack by dragging something from inside a webpage  then   we could restrict this to file:// URLs).  For clicking links on random   websites  maybe we could just show the prompt with a one-second delay   before enabling the OK button.  Not sure. </pre>
