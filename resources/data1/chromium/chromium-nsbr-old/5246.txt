<title>Issue 5246 -   chromium -    Bookmarks need to show URL in status bar/bubble/tooltip on mouse-over hover and be consistent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.31 (Official Build 6264)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a         Safari 3: FAIL        Opera 9: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    When moving the mouse and hovering over any bookmarks  no matter from Other   Bookmarks or Bookmarks Bar  it needs to show the full URL of each entry   in the status bar/bubble at the bottom of the page or in a tooltip.    This is the exact same functionality as hyperlinks for any webpage  and it   is also necessary when hovering over bookmarks as well.  Regardless of what   the bookmark title is  the full URL still needs to be displayed in the   status bar.    Also  Chrome needs to be consistent about it!  For bookmarks saved on the   Bookmarks Bar (not folders)  when hovering over them the title and full URL   *are* displayed inside a tooltip.  If you want to do it that way for all   the other bookmarks  that's fine too.  Just keep it consistent.    As well  Opera  Firefox  and IE all provide this functionality already.    Safari and Chrome are the only browsers that don't. </pre>
