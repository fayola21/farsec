<title>Issue 4716 -   chromium -    Window resize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 0.3.154.9     1. Open new Chrome window  click &quot;Restore&quot; button to make the Chrome less   than entire desktop.   2. Pick the top border of the window with a mouse pointer and drag it down    When the toolbar reaches the bottom border it covers the bottom border so   that it becomes impossible to pick and drag it back to enlarge the window.    See the attached screen shot. This is not a cut  but the entire Chrome window.    Thanks       </pre>
