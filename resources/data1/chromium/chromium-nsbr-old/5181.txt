<title>Issue 5181 -   chromium -    run_webkit_tests.py should output failures in the format of the test lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the regressions list at the end of run_webkit_tests was output in the format of the test lists  it   would make keeping the test lists up-to-date easier. Firstly  the output can just be copied into   tests_fixable.txt. Second  it will avoid mistakes people make updating the test lists where they get   the expecations incorrect.    Filing this bug as a way of discussing whether this is worth doing. </pre>
