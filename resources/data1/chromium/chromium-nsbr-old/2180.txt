<title>Issue 2180 -   chromium -    Noise and system slow-down due to timeBeginPeriod abuse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Get an old laptop  2. Start Chromium  3. Notice degraded system performance and (sometimes) excessive noise when   running on batteries    The Problem    Chromium calls timeBeginPeriod(1) which has a global effect on the system   scheduler. Per Microsoft  changing the resolution of the timer for a   prolonged period of time is a bad thing to do:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713413(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713413(VS.85).aspx</a>    I propose to remove calls to timeBeginPeriod and timeEndPeriod. This will   decrease accuracy of the timer from 1ms to ~20ms. As an alternative  use   another high-precision timer function  QueryPerformanceCounter.       </pre>
