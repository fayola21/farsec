<title>Issue 7224 -   chromium -    Should suggest email ids from contacts in yahoo classic email compose - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1158487&gt;    Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8889)    --Login mail.yahoo.com  --Compose an email in classic mode.  --Type-in an email id: in To  CC  Bcc  as user keys-in those boxes  Chrome  should suggest/populate mattching email id's from contacts.    Note: FF2.x  IE 7.x supports this.    Comments from brakowski:    This is actually a request for Yahoo mail classic to support autocomplete  in the to: field of their compose page on WebKit. On Firefox  typing in the  &quot;to:&quot; field invokes a dropdown list of completions from your contacts.    The new Yahoo Mail interface already supports Webkit.  I suspect that Yahoo  isn't putting many resources on Classic mail so we probably won't see this  fixed but I'll add to the evangelism hotlist </pre>
