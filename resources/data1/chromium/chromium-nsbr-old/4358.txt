<title>Issue 4358 -   chromium -    Enable HTML5 mult-file upload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enable HTML5 mult-file upload    This is something WebKit does that we need to support.    The FileChooser object has an allowsMultipleFiles getter  that if true    indicates that we need to allow the user to select multiple files.  We   should then use the chooseFiles method on FileChooser to store the result. </pre>
