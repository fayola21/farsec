<title>Issue 22929 -   chromium -    Convey more information in branch.py automated emails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Erik Kay pointed out that a nice thing to have in the branch announcement   email would be some text like this:       You can get a build for this CL (or close to it) this way:        1.  Navigate to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?</a>  C=N;O=D        2.  Chose your platform (i.e. win)        3.  Choose the directory for today        4.  Choose the directory named after the CL       There are times when the CL we chose will not be one that is pre-built   but we will try to use pre-built CLs whenever possible.    You can watch the progress of the builds at http://chrome-  master.hot:8010/waterfall?reload=60 </pre>
