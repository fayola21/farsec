<title>Issue 20694 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.create on linux sometimes opens &quot;http://www.google.com&quot; instead of &quot;chrome://newtab&quot;.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is when you don't pass any &quot;url&quot; key in the createProperties object.   E.g.    chrome.tabs.create({&quot;selected&quot;:false&quot;}  function(tab){...});    I haven't fully tracked down a reduced set of repro steps yet  but with my   tabs api browser_tests code (see <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/174633">http://codereview.chromium.org/174633</a>) I am   getting this reproducibly. Running chrome standalone  outside of   browser_tests  doesn't seem to exhibit the same problem.   </pre>
