<title>Issue 18412 -   chromium -    DOM Storage + Isolated worlds don't play well together (at least in layout tests) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/http/tests/security/isolatedworld/all-window-properties.html and LayoutTests/http/tests/security/isolatedworld/all-window-prototypes.html are failing   when I enable local storage and session storage in the test shell.  It's not clear whether this is a real issue or not.    The expected result is simply printing &quot;Done.&quot;.  Anything else that's printed are properties of the window object which shouldn't be there.    Here's a diff from one of the two results:  --- src/webkit/Debug/layout-test-results/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/isolatedworld/all-window-properties-expected.txt   +++ src/webkit/Debug/layout-test-results/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/isolatedworld/all-window-properties-actual.txt   @@ -1 1 +1 3 @@  +localStorage: FAIL: Visible in isolated world.  +sessionStorage: FAIL: Visible in isolated world.   Done.      I'm going to exclude these two files in the test exceptions for now. </pre>
