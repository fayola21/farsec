<title>Issue 15357 -   chromium -    Copy and paste from URL bar to other tab doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open two tabs  one with a text field in its content  2. Select the URL in the other tab  3. Middle-click into the text field in the first tab    Dan wants this to paste.    *Conceptually*  each tab has its own omnibox and just because one omnibox is   in the background doesn't mean it should lose its selection.  In an app like   gedit which doesn't fake its tabs  this sort of behavior works.    I guess we'll need to do some more hacking with selections because we only   have one omnibox. </pre>
