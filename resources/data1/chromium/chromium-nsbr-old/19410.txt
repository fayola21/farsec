<title>Issue 19410 -   chromium -    Chromium perf graphs don't display when opened in background tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure if this is Mac-only and I've only got Macs here  so I'm leaving   this at os:all for now.      1. Open a Chromium perf graph in the background.  Right-click this link   and choose ��_��_��_open link in new tab ��_��_��_ or on the Mac  command-click this link:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-</a>  10.5/startup/report.html?history=5000  2. A new tab will spring to life in the background.  Wait until its throbber   stops spinning.  3. Switch to the new tab by clicking on it.      Expect: perf graph should be visible.  Observe: no perf graph visible.  If you reload  the graph will become   visible.    Apparently  the graph sizes to the content area when the page loads.  The   new tab doesn't have any size.  This might be similar to the old ��_��_��_new   background tabs open at 200x200 or whatever��_��_��_ bug that we used to have.    If you change the size of the window  the graph doesn't resize to match it.    Maybe that's something we can fix about the graphs.    3.0.198.1 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23316">r23316</a> (official Google Chrome build) </pre>
