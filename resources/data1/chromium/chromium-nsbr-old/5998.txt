<title>Issue 5998 -   chromium -    All tabs freeze and new tabs don't render - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    A friend frequently (nearly every time he uses chrome) has Chrome get stuck with all the tab   contents unable to be interacted with. It's unclear whether they are hung or not. These are all   independent tabs opened from the addressbar. Also  creating new tabs creates a new tab  but   the contents are blank (i.e. new tab page doesn't render). All the Chrome UI still works.    Closing and reopening Chrome fixes it  but leaves a zombie Chrome process running (or maybe   there was a zombie process running before).    Unfortunately  there doesn't seem to be any consistency in when this happens. Two possibly   relevant bits are that it's a docked Thinkpad and he often has Google Finance open when it   hangs.    Is there more useful information I can grab next time he sees this? </pre>
