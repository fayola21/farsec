<title>Issue 7465 -   chromium -    Skia's point in path checking differs from CG at edges - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Canvas exposes the method isPointInPath. According to the spec  &quot;Points on the path itself   are considered to be inside the path.&quot; So that if you create a rect of size 20x20 at 0x0    then the point 0 20 should be in the path. We currently return false  because Skia considers   the point 0 20 outside the bounds of the rect.    Here's a trivial test case:    ctx = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;).getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);  ctx.save();  ctx.beginPath();  ctx.rect(0  0  20  20);  ctx.isPointInPath(0  20);  ctx.restore();      See LayoutTests/fast/canvas/pointInPath.html for examples similar to this. </pre>
