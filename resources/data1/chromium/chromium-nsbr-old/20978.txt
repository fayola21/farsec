<title>Issue 20978 -   chromium -    Chrome soon hangs with CyberPatrol's and other LSP installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43  URLs (if applicable) : All    Google Chrome Official Build 2.0.172.43: FAIL  Open Chromium Build 4.0.206.0 (25165): PASS  Google Chrome BETA 3.0.195.10: PASS  IE 8: PASS  IE 7: PASS  Safari 4.0.3: PASS  Firefox 3.5.2: PASS  Google Earth 5: PASS    With CyberPatrol's Internet Filter installed.  1. Only the official release of Google Chrome soon hangs when browsing      Not to hang.      Hang is not instant  it typically takes under 10 page visits.  Then the   rendered content part of the windows stops responding to user input (no   clicks  or scrolls)  application framework is responsive including   selecting tabs  and then sometimes I get a window stating tabs have become   'unresponsive'. Waiting just repeats the 'unresponsive' message after a few   seconds. Selecting 'Kill pages' does nothing.        The main point is that this is only an issue with Google's official release   but not with the community build.  So it looks like you're putting   something extra in that is not sympathetic to LSPs that attempt to inspect   browser network traffic content.  The good news is that your BETA version 3   does not show the problem  but I'm wondering if you've just not added your   'extra bit' yet. </pre>
