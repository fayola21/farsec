<title>Issue 20587 -   chromium -    Window class for web apps should be different from browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Any  OS + version : Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): Any  window manager : Any      1. Launch a web site in app mode (such as &quot;chromium-browser --  app=http://www.gmail.com&quot;      Each web app should be distinguishable by the Window Manager  probably by by   having their own window class.  These classes would be used in .desktop files as the value for   StartupWMClass      Web apps look like just additional browser windows by most window managers    for example they will be grouped together with the browser on any type of   panel/dock which groups application windows.      The window class could be based on the domain of the web app or something   (like chromium-app-gmail).    Or  a simple command line option could be used in shortcuts such as   &quot;chromium-browser --app=<a href="http://gmail.com">http://gmail.com</a> --windowclass=Gmail&quot;   </pre>
