<title>Issue 9609 -   chromium -    Displaying of HTML - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi. I am using 1.0.154.53 within Windows XP Pro SP3 and I notice a web page   which does not display correctly as it does in IE (v6).    This site is: <a href="http://www.palmside.co.nz">http://www.palmside.co.nz</a>    I have not analysed the HTML to see why  but leave this up to you :)    Can supply more information if needed.    Kind regards   Hayden Reid </pre>
