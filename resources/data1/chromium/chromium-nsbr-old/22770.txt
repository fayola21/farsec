<title>Issue 22770 -   chromium -    Don't prompt for user-initiated downloads of .dmg/.exe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/</a>  - click one of the download links which links directly to a .dmg    expected:  - download progresses and completes    actual:  - warning on download shelf asking if I'm sure I want to download this.    Yes  I'm sure I was to download it  I just clicked the link to do so. We do   this currently because we want to prevent carpet-bombing and drive-by   downloads  but we can't distinguish them from WebCore. As a result  we   prompt for everything  which is just as bad as asking me if I want to quit   when I select quit.    Once we can differentiate between the two  we should only prompt for   automatic downloads  not ones where the user clicks a link. </pre>
