<title>Issue 10620 -   chromium -    PDF plugin reloads continuously until pdf completely downloads while viewing using fast web view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf">http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf</a>    What is the expected output?   To render the plugin without any issues    What do you see instead?  Looks like it reloads again and again until the pdf is completely   downloaded.   * Favicon flickers  * The Go button beside omnibox alters between Go and Stop  * If we open pages menu on the left  the pages flicker    This used to work fine in Chrome1.0 but not in 2.0 because of some changes.   FF3 works fine without refreshing. It would be good if we can make it work   like FF3 </pre>
