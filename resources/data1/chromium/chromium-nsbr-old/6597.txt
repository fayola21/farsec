<title>Issue 6597 -   chromium -    Invisible search box or search text on apple.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Occurs in Chromium 2.0.157.0 (Developer Build 8179) (WebKit 528.11).  Does NOT occur in Chromium 2.0.157.0 (Official Build 8103) (WebKit 528.10).    I am able to demonstrate this on Chrome versions using WebKit 528.11  but  NOT 528.10.    IE7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari3 (upgraded to WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=39939">r39939</a>): OK        1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.apple.com">http://www.apple.com</a>     * Note that search box at right end of navigation bar is invisible.  2. Navigate to <a href="http://store.apple.com">http://store.apple.com</a> and enter some search text.     * Note that search box is black and search text is invisible (probably  black on black background).    What is the expected output?     Search box should be white with black text.    What do you see instead?    In case #1  search box is invisible.  In case #2  search text is invisible.    See attached pictures.   </pre>
