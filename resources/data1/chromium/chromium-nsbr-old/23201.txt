<title>Issue 23201 -   chromium -    Scroll not smooth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When scrolling through a web page and using the middle mouse key to allow an   automatic and smooth move down or up the page  Chrome is fast enough to make   the scroll jump so fast is causes a girky motion. It makes reading a slowly   moving page hard to read. Some small delay might smooth this out. Otherwise I   like it!! </pre>
