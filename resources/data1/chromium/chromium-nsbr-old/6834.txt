<title>Issue 6834 -   chromium -    When eliding overlays  give more space if no there is overlay beside - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  there 3 placement per line: left  center and right. I'll take the default footer as an   example:  left: {url}  center: nothing  right: {page number}/{total pages}    Currently the url is elided as is there was something in the center area. There isn't. So the url   is elided really short and a lot of empty space remains unused in the center area. The &quot;overlay   manager&quot; should be smart enough to detect that there is nothing in the center area and use that   space as much as possible. </pre>
