<title>Issue 4454 -   chromium -    Tab floats  then chrome crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.18      1. Open multiple tabs  browse around.   2. After a while  the current tab starts floating  as if it had been   dragged. Clicking on the tab bar to put it back results in an immediate   crash. Clicking outside takes out the tab and you can continue browsing    but there is still a minor chance for a crash. This started happening with   this dev build  it was OK before  but was again present in the build before   that (I don't remember the numbers).    Browsing with a single tab works OK.    Vista 64bit  Windows Classic Theme  AMD Athlon Dual Core CPU  4GB ram.     </pre>
