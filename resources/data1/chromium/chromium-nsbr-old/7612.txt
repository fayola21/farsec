<title>Issue 7612 -   chromium -    Autoscroll doesn��t work properly inside Gmail. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to your normal Gmail account  then open any long mail you may have.  2. Put the mouse cursor over the white panel  which is the panel where the   message��s info is displayed.  3. Press the autoscroll button in your mouse  and try to autoscroll all the   way down the page or all the way up.      Chrome is supposed to autoscroll the page down and up  no matter where the   cursor is located in the page.      Well  Chrome doesn't autoscroll when the cursor is placed inside the   message��s white panel  instead  it autoscrolls when you place the cursor   outside the panel.    Please provide
