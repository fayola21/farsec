<title>Issue 11435 -   chromium -    Add a &quot;user data&quot; tab to the options  remove the &quot;minor tweaks&quot; tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The &quot;User Data&quot; tab should contain:  * Saved Passwords  * Autofill  * a &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; button (see Glen for a mock)    &quot;Download location&quot; and &quot;Fonts &amp; Languages&quot; should be moved to &quot;Under the  hood&quot;. Cookies should also stay under &quot;Privacy&quot;.    (Rationale: the current split between &quot;minor tweaks&quot; and &quot;under the hood&quot;  doesn't mean anything. This bug is the result of a UI fixit brainstorm.) </pre>
