<title>Issue 7245 -   chromium -    Going back to a page with encoding overriden renders the page without encoding override  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to a page (say  news.google.co.jp)   2. Change the encoding to ISO-8859-1 in the page menu. You'll see a lot of   gibberish instead of Japanese text.  3. Go to another page ( say  www.google.com)  4. Press the back button   5. Instead of the gibberish in step 2  you'll see Japanese text you saw in   setp 1.     IE7 preserves the encoding override (i.e in step 5  you see the same   gibberish in step 2) while Firefox 3 does not. IIRC  Firefox 2 did that and   Chrome 1.0.x did that  too (Xiaolu  can you confirm that?)     There's a related bug to this (visiting a page for which the encoding is   overriden after looking that up in history search).        </pre>
