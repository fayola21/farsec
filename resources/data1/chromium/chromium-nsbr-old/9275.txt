<title>Issue 9275 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/encoding/char-decoding.html fails on buildbot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a follow-up to <a title="Fix bogus expected results for fast/encoding/char-decoding.html " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9247"> issue 9247 </a>  which removed the bogus expected results  (full of FAIL lines with 'XHR exception') for  LayoutTests/fast/encoding/char-decoding.html.     The test passes locally on my machine  but apparently they don't on others'  machines and bots. The test makes an XHR call using 'data' url and this may  have something to do with this 'flakyness'(?).        </pre>
