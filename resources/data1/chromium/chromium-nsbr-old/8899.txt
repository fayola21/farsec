<title>Issue 8899 -   chromium -    target drop area is too small for side-by-side mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 beta channel    target drop area is too small for new side-by-side mode (this feature:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn97WbalJwM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn97WbalJwM</a>). you need to be almost exactly  at the center of an edge to trigger the resize mode. this makes discovery  and usage unnecessarily difficult. after i found out about this feature  i  could not figure out how to acutually trigger it without watching the  video. suggested change: make the drop area larger both vertically and  horizontally so you don't have to be so close to the edge of the screen and  you don't have to be at the exact center of the edge. </pre>
