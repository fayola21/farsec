<title>Issue 6096 -   chromium -    Chrome looses spaces for Hebrew text with vowels (nikud) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) open chrome  Hebrew UI  2) go to a page containing voweled Hebrew text  for example:  <a href="http://benyehuda.org/rachel/Rac001.html">http://benyehuda.org/rachel/Rac001.html</a>  (from the Hebrew equivalent of the Gutenberg project)  3) compare with Safari 3 and IE on the same machine      Actual Result:  chrome looses most of the spaces between words  and adds additional spaces   before some lines.    Expected result:  spaces should be in their proper places        This is happening in Chrome  but not Safari. See the attached screenshot    showing the above URL in chrome  safari and IE7     </pre>
