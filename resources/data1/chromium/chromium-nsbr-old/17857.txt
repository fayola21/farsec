<title>Issue 17857 -   chromium -    Font picker uses pixel sizes  not point sizes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The font selection dialog uses the stock GtkFontButton (which uses   GtkFontSelectionDialog  which uses GtkFontSelection).    If we pass in a font size in pixels (ex &quot;Sans 16px&quot;)  the GtkFontButton   draws correctly  but the font selection dialog interprets it as point size.    We should bring in our own copy of gtkfontsel into the tree and fix it to   work correctly when given a fontname with a pixel size. </pre>
