<title>Issue 16852 -   chromium -    Other windows Ghosting on 2-pixel monitor-bleed from Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0 (Windows on Vista Ultimate)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. In a symmetrical dual-monitor arrangement (both running at 1280x1024    32bit depth)  place a maximized chrome window on either monitor (we'll call   it monitor 2).      When windows are moved around on the other monitor  there should be no   ghosting of the moving window in the 2-pixels which are adjacent to the   last-touched maximized Chrome window.      When windows are moved around on the edge (approximately the last 2 pixels)   of monitor 1  these windows are ghosted in these last 2 pixels. This only   happens when Chrome is running and maximized on the other monitor.     Whichever monitor Chrome is maximized on will cause the 2-pixel ghosting on   the other monitor. This occurs whether Chrome is running with one window or   multiple windows. If you open two Chrome windows  the ghosting will occur   on the monitor where Chrome was most recently used. Example: Chrome-1 and   Chrome-2  both are maximized on each of their respective monitors (monitor-  1 and monitor-2). I touch (click  whatever) Chrome-1. I move a window over   the center area which is adjoining monitor 1 and monitor 2. 2-pixels of   ghosting occur on Monitor-2.    Ghosting is cleared if the previously selected &amp; maximized Chrome window is    changed away from the maximized state using &quot;restore&quot;.    Ghosting is &quot;hidden&quot; if Chrome-1 is minimized. Ghosting returns when the   window is &quot;unminimized.&quot; </pre>
