<title>Issue 16856 -   chromium -    gclient needs a way to update/sync without calling the hooks. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The rationale is that it should be possible to fetch the sources from  anywhere  without a dev setup. But today  in chromium  gclient calls gyp  which needs a bunch of -dev packages (gtk2  nss  fontconfig  freetype   etc..). This should not be mandatory just to fetch sources. It could be  done later using runhooks.   </pre>
