<title>Issue 20275 -   chromium -    Feature request: Middle-drag tab zapper - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Open a bunch of tabs  2. Realize that you want to close a contiguous section of 7 tabs.  3. Middle-click and hold on the first tab you want removed  and drag to the   right across the other tabs you want removed. Release on the last tab to   close the highlighted tabs.      The tabs turn grey or maybe red as they are dragged across. When the middle   mouse button is released on the last one  all are zapped (closed).        Nothing. I have to middle click each tab individually  giving me RSI (and   frustration due to tab close slowness bug). </pre>
