<title>Issue 15679 -   chromium -    REGRESSION:Task Manager window size can't be reduced to the minimum window size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Launch Chrome and then Task Manager. Try to resize the window as small as you   can. It doesn't resize to the minimum as it used to be.     This is happening on XP only. Vista works fine.    Chromium 3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19584) </pre>
