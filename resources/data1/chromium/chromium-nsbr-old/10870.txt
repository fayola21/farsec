<title>Issue 10870 -   chromium -    extension_tabs_module.cc fails to compile in official release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Line 229:      int new_index;    DCHECK(args-&gt;GetInteger(L&quot;index&quot;  &amp;new_index));    if (new_index &lt; 0) {      DCHECK(false);      return false;    }      In an official release build  new_index never gets initialized because   DCHECK is void(0).    On the 176 branch for this week's Dev channel build  I just removed the   DCHECK() around the code in line 230.  This needs to get fixed on trunk   before Monday so that next week's Dev channel build does not fail   similarly. </pre>
