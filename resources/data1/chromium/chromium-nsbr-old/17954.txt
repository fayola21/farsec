<title>Issue 17954 -   chromium -    Tips and Suggestions missing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.3 (Official Build 21825)  URLs (if applicable) : (new tab page)             Chrome 3.0.195.1: OK      1. Visit Chrome's new tab page        To see the Tips and Suggestions box with links to suggested websites.        It now says &quot;Even more... What will we put here?&quot;    This seems to be a step backward  unless this was intentional. </pre>
