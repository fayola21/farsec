<title>Issue 7243 -   chromium -    Encoding override is not applied to external Javascript files with an explicit charset specified via HTTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When 'character encoding' is overriden manually by a user (in Page |   Encoding menu)  that encoding has to be applied to all the frames (main and   subframes loaded in a few different ways - JS  iframe  frame  AJAX).     An example case:     1. go to <a href="http://hantoma.hani.co.kr/board/view.html?">http://hantoma.hani.co.kr/board/view.html?</a>  board_id=ht_society:001016&amp;uid=60820  2. It's EUC-KR and has a lot of Korean Hangul  3. In Page-Encoding menu  select gb18030  4. Some parts now have a bunch of Chinese characters (that do not make any   sense)  but still other parts do not change. (there are some images with   text that cannot be changed  but it's not about this).     Different versions of Chrome  Firefox 3 and IE7 have varying degrees of   'success' with encoding-override in subframes. With the latest webkit merge   (January 28)  Chrome trunk got a bit worse  but even before that  it's not   perfect.     Xiaolu  can you check Chrome 1.0.x and compare it with the latest Chrome   dev channel (2.0.159.) and the latest trunk build (after yesterday's webkit   merge)?  </pre>
