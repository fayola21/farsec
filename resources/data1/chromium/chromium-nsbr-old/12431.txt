<title>Issue 12431 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: setup.exe missing from differential installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install 172.27. Exit Chrome  2. Update Chrome to 172.30 using 172.30_from_172.27_chrome_updater   3. Go to C:Documents and SettingsuserLocal SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplication    What is the expected output?   2.0.172.27 folder should be removed    What do you see instead?  2.0.172.27 folder is still present. If I update/overinstall using full   installer  the folder of previous version gets removed    This is not a big issue as Chrome is still in working state. But we   regressed here from the behavior of 1.0. </pre>
