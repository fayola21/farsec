Google-Chrome window with more than one tab  2. one of these tabs must show a pdf  3. activate one tab and click on a tab  showing a pdf  and move the mouse   out of the chrome-window directly/shortly after the click (click =   mouseDown + mouseUp).      The result  i expected  was to activate/change to the tab  showing the pdf.  Simply  showing the pdf and all the other tabs within the chrome-window   (already opened/exists) ==&gt; simple active tab-change.        A new chrome-window appears with one single tab  showing the pdf.      <b>Please provide
