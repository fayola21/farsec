<title>Issue 8993 -   chromium -    Prioritize HTTP transactions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should prioritize the HTTP transactions that are waiting  for their turns (in the STATE_INIT_CONNECTION_COMPLETE state  of HttpNetworkTransaction) when the maximum number of connections  allowed to the proxy or destination server is reached.    As a starting point  simply prioritizing images below everything  else should speed up page layout.    For future directions  we can prioritize based on on the resource  type or whether the resource request comes from a foreground tab. </pre>
