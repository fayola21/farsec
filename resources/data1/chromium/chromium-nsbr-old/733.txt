<title>Issue 733 -   chromium -    Mouse gesture - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry if i blame this..    Why don't put mouse gesture on this browser? The Opera have this and i love  it. I can open a tab with a gesture  go to front or back with one click and  the gesture. For do this with Chrome i need two click  one with right  button and other with left button in the menu tab. I lost a lot of time  with this :P     Why not make a virtual keyboard? Same time  i will only use the mouse (only  surf in web and make small search) and relax in the chair...   </pre>
