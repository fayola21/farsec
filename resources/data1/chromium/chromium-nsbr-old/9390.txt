<title>Issue 9390 -   chromium -    Omnibox doesn't highlight bookmarks in dropdown whose lower case length differs from bookmark text length - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a result of fixing 9335. As a temporary work around I made it so that   if the length of the lower case text of a bookmark title is different than   the length of the bookmark title we don't attempt to highlight the match. See   the test case BookmarkUtilsTest  EmptyMatchOnMultiwideLowercaseString for an   example of this. </pre>
