<title>Issue 8166 -   chromium -    Firefox's tab D&amp;D interacts badly with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a Firefox 3.1 window and open some tabs. Also open a Chrome window.  2. Drag a tab out of Firefox 3.1 and drop it on the screen over a Chrome   window.        Expected given Firefox's implementation of this feature is that the tab is   detached into a new Firefox window. This happens. But what is not expected   is that the the URL is also loaded in Chrome  which it does.    It seems like we're treating a plaintext URL drop as a load request. It's   Firefox's [IMO mis]use of OLE (a data exchange technology) to implement a   tab dragging (a UI/window management feature) that's causing this. Safari   and Chrome don't have this issue with our respective tab dragging impls   dragging over other OLE targets because we don't use OLE for tab dragging.   Nonetheless  Safari and IE don't have this problem when accepting drops   from Firefox tabs  and since it seems like Firefox 3.1 is going to ship   with this implementation of tab dragging  it seems like we should dial back   the WebDropTarget impl a bit and have it ignore these drops. </pre>
