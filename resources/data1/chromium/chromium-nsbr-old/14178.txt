<title>Issue 14178 -   chromium -    Can display multiple tooltips by switching tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Launch chromium to NTP  2. Hover over a suggested page to get a tooltip  3. Hit cmd-T to create a new tab w/out moving the mouse  4. Move the mouse over another suggested page    Expected:  Should just have a single tooltip from the frontmost tab    Actual:  Now have two tooltips  one from each tab.    This is because the tooltip handling code is at the RWHVMac layer  and  knows nothing about when the tooltip should be hidden on a tab switch. We  need to move that handler code up a layer (probably to BWC) and deal with  tab switching. </pre>
