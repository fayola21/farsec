<title>Issue 5197 -   chromium -    Can't navigate to ftp page  after &quot;Clear browsing Data&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.31(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)  I've been getting this behavior for pretty long time ( I guess more than 3  months)  but finally I got the consistent repro steps.      1. Navigate to any webpage (Google home page is fine)  2. Clear browsing Data for *Every thing  2. Navigate to ftp page <a href="ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo/">ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo/</a> (copy and paste the  URL) in the same google tab.  3. The page should not render at all.    I have waited like anything for the page to come up  but it is in vain.      What is the expected output?  Page should be loaded.    What do you see instead?  the rendering hangs with black back ground. (Screenshot attached)       </pre>
