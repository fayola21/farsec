<title>Issue 16375 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: window.close() is not respected for a window opened via showModalDialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: window.close() is not respected for a window opened via   showModalDialog    I'm told this worked properly in Chrome 1.0.    Please see the attached test case.    This bug is impacting Outlook Web Access  which relies on being able to use   showModalDialog to render modal dialogs.  It expects to be able to call   window.close() in response to a user action (clicking a button).    I think this bug should block M3. </pre>
