<title>Issue 21504 -   chromium -    linux options dialog  personal stuff -&gt; themes section is a mess - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've attached a screenshot of what it looks like currently.    Problems with it:  1) <a title="Get themes button in the options dialog should be a link" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21414"> Issue 21414 </a>  2) The heading is &quot;themes&quot; but we have a checkbox for toggling the custom   frame.  3) We have a checkbox  but above we have radio buttons for toggling a   feature on/off (it would make the feature less confusing too).  4) The two theme buttons (GTK+ theme and Reset to default theme) are   confusing.    I had considered taking away the Set to GTK+ theme and making the GTK+   theme the default (so Reset to default theme would set to GTK+ theme).  You   can still get the classic theme from the theme gallery and this would be   less confusing.  The problem with this is that the GTK+ theme has a 50%   slower startup than the default theme  so I don't think we're ready to make   it the default.    I personally don't think we should bother exposing &quot;Use system title bar   and borders&quot; or at least put it in Under the Hood since it seems like a   power user feature that you only toggle once at most. </pre>
