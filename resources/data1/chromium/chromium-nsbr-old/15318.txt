<title>Issue 15318 -   chromium -    &lt;audio&gt; elem stream gets interrupted by other tab activity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. find a page with an &lt;audio&gt; stream. A simple &lt;audio src=&quot;file&quot;   autobuffer controls&gt;no audio&lt;/audio&gt; will do. Ogg  or mpeg4  the issue   remains.  2. Also  open another tab with complex requirements. Gmail is a good   example  or the Chromium experiments examples. This one  for example    <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/depth-of-field/">http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/depth-of-field/</a>  3. While audio stream is playing in tab  start scrolling excessively within   the gmail tab. In the case of the Chromium experiments  just loading the   example caused the audio to cut off.        I expect the audio stream to continue playing  without interruptions  for   most all browsing use cases - checking email  looking at nifty JS examples.        ignoring that perhaps excessively scrolling up and down in a page is not a   typical use case  the audio cuts out. In the case of rapidly scrolling up   and down a gmail page  the audio cuts out intermittently. In the case of   loading up a chromium experiment  then the audio can shut off entirely.     <b>Please provide
