<title>Issue 9198 -   chromium -    Accidentally undocking tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0      1. Use slow machine (1.6GHz  1GB Ram Single Core Centrino Laptop in my   case)  2. Keep the machine/browser a bit busy  3. Open a few tabs  4. Put the mouse cursor e.g. to the bottom left of the screen  5. Try to click on a non-opened tab on the top quite fast by moving the   mouse cursor quickly to the tab  click on it and move it back quickly   somewhere else on the bottom away from all tabs.      The clicked tab should be activated.      The tab gets activated and accidentally gets undocked and the undocked   window appears where the mouse cursor stops.    Additional information:  In my case this happens REALLY often everyday while I just use Chrome. For   example I have a few pages open and want to switch to one of them quickly.   almost everytime  the tab gets undocked. I believe this has something to do   with my slow machine  but it should not happen anyhow.  Confirmed also with the latest stable release.    From the developer point of view  I think the following happens:  I move the mouse cursor and try to click. But a click (at least in Java)   is  if you press and release the mouse at the exact same x y position. And   because of the movement it won't be like that. So lets say a button press   is registered at x1 y1 and the mouse button is released at x2  y2. It is   interpreted as an attempt to move the tab. But here come the real problem:   The mouse cursor movement is stopped at x3 y3 and it seems like - maybe due   to the fact a slow machine -  as if mouse button release is registered for   position 3 instead of position 2 and because pos 3 is not on the tab bar   the activated tab gets undocked.    So  whatever really happens  it is definitely annoying!  </pre>
