The movie simply does not load. Does not happen with FF          What is the expected result?    Usually I click on a movie and it loads -- I can wait forever  the movie   will not load. Happens with about 1/2 of the youtube movies I try to watch.   I simply hit &quot;reload&quot; a few times -- and suddenly it works.           What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Not sure -- simply try selecting movies  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Does not happne in FF -- I have not experienced it. In Chrome it is a   commom     Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
