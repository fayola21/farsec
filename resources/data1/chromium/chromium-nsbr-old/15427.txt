<title>Issue 15427 -   chromium -    download shelf flickers on close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the shelf itself flickers on close sometimes in linux.    Most noticeable on plainish sites (such as google.com) which render quickly.   This is undoubtedly my fault  a result of the way the render view resizes   when it notices the download shelf is closing  and the z-ordering gets   messed up for whatever reason. </pre>
