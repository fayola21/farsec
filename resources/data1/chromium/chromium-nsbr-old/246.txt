<title>Issue 246 -   chromium -    Home page qualification should be time-based  not visit-based - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are sites I leave open all day  like my email.  On the other hand    there are blogs I go to a lot  but are less critical than email.    Especially since Chrome is geared towards web apps  the home page should be   comprised of the pages open longest  not necessarily the ones with the most   hits. </pre>
