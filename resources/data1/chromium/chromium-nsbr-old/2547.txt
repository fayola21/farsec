<title>Issue 2547 -   chromium -    Google Update thread + About Chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click on &gt; Wrench icon  2. Select &gt; About Google Chrome  3. &gt; Checking for Updates... displays on window    This spawns the &gt; GoogleUpdate.exe process that simply hangs in the   background. As a consequence the window doesn't resolve the &gt; Checking for   updates animation and GoogleUpdate never dies even after closing the   browser. Opening the browser again and following the same steps seems to   again spawn another &gt; GoogleUpdate thread that simply hangs in the   background.    In such a way I've previously found 2 threads running after closing all   browser windows.                Please provide
