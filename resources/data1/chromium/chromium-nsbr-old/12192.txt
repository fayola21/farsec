<title>Issue 12192 -   chromium -    Need to switch to native JSON parser in extenions code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that V8 supports native JSON  we need to switch to using it instead of   our javascript/eval based one.    This may imply some small changes because the spec dictates that the root   object must be an array or object  and I think that in some cases we are   currently json-encoding primitives. </pre>
