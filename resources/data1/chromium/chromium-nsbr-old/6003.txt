<title>Issue 6003 -   chromium -    FEATURE REQUEST: File upload by URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Suggestion: Allow users to enter a URL when filling out a file upload form  (Input type=file).  Currently Chrome renders a file selection dialog for  browsing the local filesystem.  As an additional option  users could enter  a URL of a piece of web content they wanted to upload.    This would greatly simplify a common use case -- uploading content to one  website from another website.  Currently this involves several steps --  downloading the content to the local drive  uploading it  and then deleting  the local copy.   </pre>
