<title>Issue 18295 -   chromium -    CPU usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use chess app at facebook.com  2. Play against an opponent  3. Check job/task list. Chrome.exe uses about 50% CPU. (system becomes   somewhat not useable) after sometime it drops  but stays  at 10% cpu usage.      I hoped that Chrome would not allow such high CPU usage...      Well.. Perhaps just as above  probatly ok if its just bad coding from   developers  but I had hoped that Chrome would not allow such high usage...   Perhaps some sort of settings so it won't be allowed to use so much cpu ..   ?    <b>Please provide
