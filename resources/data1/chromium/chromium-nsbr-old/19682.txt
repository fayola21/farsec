<title>Issue 19682 -   chromium -    Omnibox dropdown shown in full screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go into full screen mode  2. Open a new tab (ctrl+T)  3. Type something  4. Press enter      Expected: either [current windows behavior] Omnibox doesn't work at all in   full screen -or- Omnibox is shown on full screen NTP (this would be cool).    Actual: Omnibox is not shown  but when typing  the dropdown shows anyway    but the dropdown and invisible omnibox do not work.       </pre>
