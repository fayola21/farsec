<title>Issue 19663 -   chromium -    Make crash dump available in testing environment on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now crash dump generation only works for Google Chrome and not for   Chromium on Linux. If a crash happens  the process generates the .dmp file in   /tmp  immediately uploads it and deletes the .dmp file.    We'd like crash dump generation available for both Google Chrome and Chromium   in testing environment. Specifically  when CHROME_HEADLESS is set:  - Both Google Chrome and Chromium needs to be able to generate crash dumps.  - Crash dumps go in DIR_CRASH_DUMPS.  - Crash dumps do not get uploaded to the crash server and get deleted.   </pre>
