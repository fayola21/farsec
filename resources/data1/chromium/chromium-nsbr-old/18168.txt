<title>Issue 18168 -   chromium -    Add a unit test for the plural formatting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While reviewing <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/160432">http://codereview.chromium.org/160432</a>   Tony had the following to say about adding a unit test for the plural formatting:    I wonder how hard it would be to start unittesting some of these.  I guess you  would have to change the ICU locale  unload en-US.dll  reload a different  language dll  then run the test cases.   </pre>
