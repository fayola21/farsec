<title>Issue 16529 -   chromium -    Chrome should have a low memory/CPU usage option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1             IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL    When my computer is very slow (e.g.: my memory is almost full  or I have a   99% CPU usage chrome does not work very quick. This is normal. But I think   chrome should have an option to disable all effects (on the new tab page;   the tab dragging; the fading download bar when it opens; etc...). If these   effects could easily be disabled then chrome would probably run much   quicker.  I don't ask for an automatic detection of low memory/high CPU usage  but   for an manual option to disable all effects.    (p.s.: my computer is a vista with 1GB ram and Pentium D  so don't tell me   to buy a new(er) computer . There are enough other reasons why a computer   can be (extremely) slow: running a virtual OS inside it for example) </pre>
