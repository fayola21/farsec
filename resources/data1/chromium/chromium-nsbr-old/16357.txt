<title>Issue 16357 -   chromium -    Should not use ID generator in bookmark codec - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently use an ID generator in bookmark codec to check if the IDs in the   bookmark file are unique. If not  we reassign them to make them unique.    We should not pay the price of a set that's internally used by ID generator   in case when the file has not changed. Instead  we should do a second pass of   reassigning IDs when the file has changed. </pre>
