<title>Issue 13025 -   chromium -    left hand only to swtich previous/next tab instead of useless Ctrl+1 2 3 4 5 for a specifiy tab with both hands - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know other people's surf habbits  but one thing seems VERY un-  intuitive to me. Ctrl+1  2  3  4 ... 9 to swtich to a specific tab? Do you   have to actually count for the number of tab do decide which tab to swtich   to? Also it seems that pple always have far more 10 tabs open simutaniously.   Why not define a simple shortcut key to swtich to a previous/next tab?     I stronglly suggest a left-hand only shortcut key to swtich tabs  I suggest   F2 for previous tab  F3 for next tab  F4 for close the tab. </pre>
