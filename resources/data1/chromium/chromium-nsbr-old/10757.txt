<title>Issue 10757 -   chromium -    &quot;Undo Tab Close&quot; should sometimes read &quot;Undo Window Close&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0      1. Open a new window  2. Close it  3. Right click the tab strip      A context menu item headed &quot;Undo Window Close&quot; reopens the closed window.      The menu item reopens the window but is labelled &quot;Undo Tab Close&quot; which is   ambiguous.    By the way  the second two words should not be capitalised - it looks   inconsistent. </pre>
