<title>Issue 15805 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: cursor is not rendered in content editable fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: cursor is not rendered in content editable fields    Observed in:  3.0.192.0 (Developer Build 19801)    You can see the bug in Gmail's rich text editor or just fire up the midas   demo:  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/">http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/</a>    Click to type in the edit field  and notice that there in no vertical   cursor to indicate where your characters will be placed as you type.    This makes the browser almost unusable.    Could this be related to the focus behavior change in the recent webkit   update? </pre>
