<title>Issue 7883 -   chromium -    Selecting end of line selects wrong line in textboxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.163.0              Firefox 3: OK        1. Navigate to a website with a large text editing field  such as this bug   report form.   2. Make sure there are enough lines of text in the textbox to be able to   scroll down. the lines should also be of varying length so that the   behavior can be more easily tested  3. Scroll down at least one line and click in the space following any line   of text in the text box       The text cursor should move to the end of the line nearest to the cursor.       The text cursor moves to the proper column  but instead of the proper line    it moves to a line (2 * number of lines scrolled) beneath the expected   line.     This error applies to ALL multi-line text boxes  so any of them should do.    The error was originally discovered when editing wikipedia articles. </pre>
