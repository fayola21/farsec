<title>Issue 11343 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't always go all the way down to the taskbar when using small icons on the taskbar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	2.0.177.1 (Official Build 14854)  WebKit	530.8  V8	1.2.0  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.8 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.177.1 Safari/530.8      1. I enabled small icons in Windows 7 Taskbar properties  2. Opened Chrome (Chrome had been opened before the change)      It should go all the way down to the taskbar      the extra space is left open as if the large icons were still being used.    I already fixed it so I don't have a screenshot currently  to fix it I just   unchecked small icons then re-enabled them.   </pre>
