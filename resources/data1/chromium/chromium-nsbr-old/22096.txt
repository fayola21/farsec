<title>Issue 22096 -   chromium -    Give widgets useful names/integrate with ViewID - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have two systems for tagging GtkWidgets with names. One is to set the   name  which is useful for parasite  and the other is to set the __VIEW_ID__   data  which is useful only for the testing infrastructure that specifically   looks for certain view ids. Needs fixing. </pre>
