<title>Issue 17842 -   chromium -    xdg-settings fails to get localized default browser from kreadconfig - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set the BrowserApplication setting in ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals to   have a localization  i.e. BrowserApplication[$e]=...  2. Set the handler for the text/html MIME type to a different application  3. Run xdg-settings get default-web-browser        xdg-settings uses kreadconfig which fails to get the localized   BrowserApplication setting  so it falls back to the MIME type to get the   default browser. In this case that is a different application and the wrong   value is reported. </pre>
