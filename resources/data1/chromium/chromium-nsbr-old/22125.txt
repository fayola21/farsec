<title>Issue 22125 -   chromium -    Sometimes websites don't load properly (css not loaded  or gmail fails to load)  clearing cache fixes things for a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Chromium	4.0.212.0 (Developer Build 26435)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.11.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.212.0 Safari/532.0      1. Use Chromium normally  check Gmail often  2. At a certain point  Gmail fails loading (loads to 9x% and says that a   time-out occurred)  clearing cache fixes it right away  3. Sometimes loading sites like slashdot.org would present the site with a   broken layout  with obviously some css files not loaded      Gmail loads  other sites with normal layout      Broken layout  gmail fails to load    It's really hard to reproduce this one  but just from the daily usage of   Chromium I always have it  it's quite annoying and started happening around   2-3 days ago (maybe less?)  maybe some changes to the way content is cached   triggered this ?  </pre>
