<title>Issue 15935 -   chromium -    Show all extensions views in the process manager  and make it possible to inspect them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the chrome://extensions page shows all the extensions views   and enables the developer to inspect them. However  going forward this   page will be mainly aimed at end users  so we need to find another place to   display this info.    The proposal is to show the various views in the process manager  like   multiple tabs loaded in one renderer. With many extensions  this might get   unwieldy  so we should consider collapsing these by default and having a   little [+] zippy to expand.    Since some of these views have no visible UI (background pages)  we also   need some way to inspect them. This could be a right-click menu option   or a visible button (might be good for those with no other UI). Please   consult Glen for the best UI to do this.    Pavel  I'm assigning to you  since you seem to be the owner of the process   manager  but feel free to follow up with Aaron and Erik if that's not the   case (I'll be on vacation for the next two weeks). </pre>
