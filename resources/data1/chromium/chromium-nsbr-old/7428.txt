<title>Issue 7428 -   chromium -    Wrong tests being marked as timed out from TestShell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mads noticed this problem and said this in an email:     It seems that if a  test that uses waitUntilDone fails to call notifyDone  the *next* test  that is run will time out.  I think this is the reason for the new  failures you got after this change to dump on notifyDone.  I guess  nothing is dumped if you fail to call notifyDone?    To reproduce  here is an example:    [ager@ager-xp:/cygdrive/c/chrome/src/webkit/tools/layout_tests]$  ./run_webkit_tests.sh LayoutTests/fast/dom/Window/clear-timeout.html  LayoutTests/fast/dom/Window/window-property-shadowing.html    This will have window-property-shadowing pass.  However  if you change  clear-timeout.html by deleting the lines that calls notifyDone  then  window-property-shadowing will timeout. </pre>
