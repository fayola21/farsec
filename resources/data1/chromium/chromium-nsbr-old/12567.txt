<title>Issue 12567 -   chromium -    this chromium issue need to manage duplicates  move the contents of the duplicates and add stars to the original issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this issue tracker must move all duplicates post to the original issue post   so that people can see all posting to one thread only and collaborate and   exchange knowledge to the issue  then merge all stars to them so that   people and developer will know how the issue  feature request or whatever   it is a must to do rather than other issues  because really  even there are   critical priorities thats needs fixing  developers must fix first the   popular ones with most stars rather the geeky ones that only be seen by   developers and not noticed by general public.    by adding all stars from the duplicate issues and the original issue  it   can add more pressure because of the stars in it  mean its more demanded   rather other stuff.    and if someone posted to the issue  he or she will be automatically starred    for voting it to be demanded  because he/she wont post it if he do not want   it to be added to his/her business.    thats all  because i saw duplicates  and stars  if you add them all  it   makes the issue more popularly demanded.    some people do not read the manual  thus they have chances that they do not   know how to star an issue and add some gravity to it  so make it &quot;post here   vote automatically&quot; rule.    thanks </pre>
