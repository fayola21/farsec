<title>Issue 18789 -   chromium -    Incognito window box should move down to accommodate theme design - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you look at the stargazer theme on the NTP  there's a shooting Chrome   comet that appears just over the thumbnails.  This comet (and other designs   that future designers may come up with) is cut off in the incognito page.  If   we move the incognito box down several pixels  so that its top edge is the   same as that of the top row of the thumbnails on the NTP  we can allow themes   designed with this space in mind to work on both pages.  This move could also   give the two pages a more unified feel.   </pre>
