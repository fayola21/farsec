<title>Issue 22236 -   chromium -    AutomationProvider:: GetBooleanPreference has wrong order of parameters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (Developer Build 0)  URLs (if applicable) : NA           Safari 4: NA    Firefox 3.x: NA           IE 7: NA           IE 8: NA      1. Try to implement something that uses GetBooleanPreference and expects   FALSE as the returned preference value.        Unlike other methods in AutomationProvider GetBooleanPreference() has the   parameters for the returned value and success flag (both bool) reversed.     However  the caller still uses the normal order  which leads to incorrect   results. This hasn't surfaced so far  because the usage case expects a   return value of TRUE  which happens to be the same as the success value   TRUE. </pre>
