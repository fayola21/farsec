<title>Issue 6825 -   chromium -    [Try server] Fix svn cp/mv + binary patch issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using the try server  if a user has done a svn cp/svn mv and modified   the resulting file  the .diff file is unusable by patch since the --- +++   reference the new file  which is non-existent on a clean trunk. I hate svn   diff.    Potential workarounds:  - Package the whole files instead of diff with our own format.  - Use svn diff --xml.  - Create a manual diff functionality.  - Switch to git  really. </pre>
