<title>Issue 14045 -   chromium -    Download location in the options menu should be moved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The download location should be moved from &quot;Under the Hood&quot; to &quot;Basics&quot;.  Most users switch their download location from the default and it is nothing   advanced..it shouldn't be so hard to find too. Also  &quot;Under the Hood&quot; just   looks cluttered now. </pre>
