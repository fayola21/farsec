<title>Issue 6808 -   chromium -    Why on earth does Chrome revert my color calibrated monitor to the default color space. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;newest version january 2009&gt;             Safari 3:OK      Firefox 3:OK           IE 7:OK  Every other browser in existence:  OK      1. Starting Chrome  There is no excuse for a browser to change my system color settings.    There is no need for it and there is no excuse for it.  It is an absolute   deal-breaker; I will not use Chrome as long as it messes with my   calibrated monitor.        I expect a broswer  any browser to respect the color profile of my system    AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE like every other browser on the planet does.     Tim Kramer  Destin  FL   </pre>
