<title>Issue 20595 -   chromium -    Web pages render as blank page at random on latest nightly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Chromium	204.0 (Developer Build 24854)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.8.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.204.0 Safari/532.0    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.designspongeonline.com/">http://www.designspongeonline.com/</a>  but others at   random.  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Renders OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Renders OK      1. Visit a bunch of websites in new tabs        A page should be rendered and displayed as expected  i.e. identical to as   seen in Safari.        A blank page is displayed.    Reloading any blank pages does not fix the problem  however opening a   new tab (or window) with the same URL causes the page to be rendered as   expected.    The problem appears to happen regardless of URL.    I have provided three screen shots:  * An example of a page which failed to load (even after reload)  * An example of the same page loaded successfully in a new tab  * View source of the page which failed to load  showing source was   downloaded  but not rendered. </pre>
