<title>Issue 16015 -   chromium -    ThumbnailStore won't return thumbnails after clearing history until first update timer goes off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The ThumbnailStore updates its list of most visited URLs and the redirect  information for these URLs on a timer that goes off every 30minutes.  If  the history is cleared and the user visits pages before the next timer goes  off  the ThumbnailStore won't have any information about those pages.  If a  NewTabUI is created now  then no thumbnails will appear. </pre>
