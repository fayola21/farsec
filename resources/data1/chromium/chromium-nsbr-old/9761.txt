<title>Issue 9761 -   chromium -    alt-home doesnt work with location bar focus. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53 (Official Build 11798)          None of them have a speed dial except opera.(as far as i know)      1. setting focus on the address bar  2. pressing alt-home        goes to the alt+home page.        Nothing.    I think this is self expanitory. I personally quite often press ctrl+L to   get to the address bar and think doh i need home.     </pre>
