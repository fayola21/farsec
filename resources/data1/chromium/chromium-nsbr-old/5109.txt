<title>Issue 5109 -   chromium -    Regression: About Chromium no longer blocked on directory check - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chromium alongside Google Chrome and run Chromium.  2. Go to About Chromium  3. Notice that it no longer displays error 1  but instead launches the COM   component that tries to update Google Chrome.     We have a function CanUpdateCurrentChrome() that used to check if we are   installed in a location where Google Chrome would be installed. This function   would return false if run from Chromium (or from a developer build built by   VS).    It uses GetChromeInstallPath() which used to just return the Chrome install   path  but has been changed to return the Chrome or Chromium install path (depending on what you are running).    As a result  we now no longer abort during the directory test and launch the   COM component to try to update. This probably will result in Google Chrome   being updated from within Chromium.     </pre>
