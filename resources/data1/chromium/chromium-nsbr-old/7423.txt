<title>Issue 7423 -   chromium -    Select box inside a floating div does not dropdown on clicking the arrow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     The best way to describe the issue is if you look at  <a href="http://lipik.in/websearch-external.html">http://lipik.in/websearch-external.html</a> - use the select box at the top to  change the language to English. An on-screen keyboard  should appear (click  in the text field in case it doesn't)  - this is just lots of floated &amp;  nested divs. It Has been made draggable using the dojo drag&amp;drop facility   but nothing special beyond that.    The select in the bottom right corner of this refuses to drop down on  clicking the arrow  though works fine in Mozilla &amp; IE. I initially thought  it was due to the click event being cancelled  but this is not the case  (the problem remains even if I disable all event handling). Then I though  z-index (because keyboard is at 10000  but removing that does not help  either. Something to do with layouts  I guess.    It would really help if there is a workaround...    Thanks  Amit </pre>
