<title>Issue 20781 -   chromium -    Open all bookmarks should open only bookmarks from current folder  not subfolders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open bookmarks and find some &quot;bookmarks directory&quot; which has  &quot;subdirectories&quot;  2. Click on the directory by right mouse button  3. Choose &quot;Open all bookmarks&quot;      There would be fine to have opened only items from the directory  and not  items from its subdirectories.       Chrome opens all.  For example I have directory &quot;Sports&quot; and directly within I have my daily  used bookmarks  and in subfolders like &quot;Tennis&quot; or &quot;Football&quot; some more  specific sport webs  which I don't visit frequently. In other browsers I  used to click every morning on the folder &quot;Sports-&gt;Open all&quot; and my 7  favourite webs tabs opened. Chrome tries to open all 73 bookmarks.    I think to enable this at least as option would be a nice feature. </pre>
