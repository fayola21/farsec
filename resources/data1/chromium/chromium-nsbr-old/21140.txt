<title>Issue 21140 -   chromium -    enable compiler warnings for webkit/glue and webkit/appcache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently compile all of webkit.gyp as external code.  That is  we   disable warnings and warnings-as-errors.  I understand why we have this for   WebCore  but it would be nice to enable for our code in webkit.gyp.  The   two obvious targets are glue and appcache.    I tried adding:       'variables': {          'chromium_code': 1         }   To the targets  but that didn't work  probably because external_code.gypi   already got pulled in when common.gypi got pulled in?    A side project would be to turn on -Wall in WebCore so some day we can   compile with -Werror.    I bring all of this up because I made a change upstream to WebCore that -  Wall would have caught. </pre>
