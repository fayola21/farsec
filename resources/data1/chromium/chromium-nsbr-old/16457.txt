<title>Issue 16457 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Form auto save - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1  Other browsers tested: I know none who have this feature    Ever fill out a web form with a perfect answer only to find out that once you press submit the   website complains your session timed out?  You then press the back button and of course your work   isn't there.  Maybe even the form isn't displaying due to how the website still complaining your   session is timed out.  Some would say that this is poor web design and that it's up to the   website to fix this issue.  I say let the browser help me out!  It knows what I typed in if   somehow when I am filling out a form if it could save what I have  I don't mean autocomplete  in   case I hit the back button I can at least copy out the text I was trying to submit. </pre>
