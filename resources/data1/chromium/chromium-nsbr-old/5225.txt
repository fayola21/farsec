<title>Issue 5225 -   chromium -    Feature : Right-Click on the Star icon to display the Bookmarks list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29    It would be convenient if a right-click on the Star icon would display the   list of bookmarks.    In the current implementation  I have the choice between:    - Always enabling the bookmark bar. I don't like it because it takes  space   on the screen for something that is rarely used.    - Hit Ctrl+B to display the bookmark bar  click on the bookmark and hit   ctrl+B to make the bar disappear. It is too long and involves both the   mouse and the keyboard.   </pre>
