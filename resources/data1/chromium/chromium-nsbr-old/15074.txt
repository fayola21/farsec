<title>Issue 15074 -   chromium -    Text from Auto fill is not actually updated/considered  in the blank fields. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0  URLs (if applicable) : Any             Safari 4:N/A    Firefox 3.x:N/A           IE 7:OK            IE 8:N/A      1. Goto any webpage with register/login form  2. start entering the text. The auto fill data options are appears in the scroll down list  3. Select any from the auto fill text. Its get populated in the field.  4. But when you move the cursor/control to the next field  if the field has   any not null validation  it says data need to be entered or shouldn't be   blank.  This indicates that data from Auto fill is not actually updated in   the chosen field.   If I over type/type manually each and every character  then it is   considering.       </pre>
