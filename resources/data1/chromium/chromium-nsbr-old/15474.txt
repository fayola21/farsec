<title>Issue 15474 -   chromium -    Download shelf code illegally uses multiple inheritance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DownloadShelfView on Windows subclasses both DownloadShelf (which isn't an   interface) and views::View.    Platform front ends should create a download shelf view in the respective   toolkit that populates from a cross-platform download shelf model. The model   can live on the Browser object since download shelves are now per-window not   per tab. </pre>
