<title>Issue 3638 -   chromium -    Use WordIterator in calculating size of the dangerous download label - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the DownloadItemView code we have a function that calculates how wide   the label inside the view that displays the dangerous download should be   (see SizeLabelToMinWidth).    It uses spaces to determine line breaking opportunities  where it should   rely on ICU WordIterator to tell it where the line breaking opportunities   are. Using space works fine for English and such but might cause problems   in translations to locales where things other than space are used as line   breaking opportunities. </pre>
