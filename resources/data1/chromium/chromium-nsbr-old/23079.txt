<title>Issue 23079 -   chromium -    mole navigation sometimes fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you have a toolstrip/mole which use two separate URLs and then expand and   collapse them several times rapidly  navigation will sometimes fail.  This   usually seems to exhibit itself in the collapsed state showing mole content   (or sometimes a blank page).    This doesn't seem to be a problem if you use the same URL and DHTML   techniques  so something about the navigation code path is buggy.   </pre>
