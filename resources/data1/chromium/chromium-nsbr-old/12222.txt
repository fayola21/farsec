<title>Issue 12222 -   chromium -    INQUIRY - Should the appended extension to saved HTML filenames be .html or .htm? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Following the fix for <a title="Extension .htm added to a wrong position for some file name" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10581"> Issue 10581 </a> (Extension .htm added to a wrong position for   some file name)  I raised a question regarding the reason for why the appended   extension is '.htm' and not '.html'.  I guess  for consistency  it should be .html (&quot;HTML file&quot;  seems more   appropriate). </pre>
