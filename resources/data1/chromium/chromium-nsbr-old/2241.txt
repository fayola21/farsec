<title>Issue 2241 -   chromium -    [FTP] Setting current directory to something that is not a directory confuses some FTP servers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary:  [FTP] Setting current directory to something that is not a directory   confuses some FTP servers    Chrome attempts to load each FTP URL as a directory listing  but this   causes problems for some servers.    Chrome does something like this:    CWD /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip  550 /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip: Not a   directory  TYPE A  200 Type set to A  PASV  227 Entering Passive Mode (192 148 197 50 152 91).  LIST /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list  226 Transfer complete.    IE does this:    TYPE I  200 Type set to I  PASV  227 Entering Passive Mode (192 148 197 50 152 92).  SIZE /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip  213 1301698  RETR /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip  150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for /release/xradia/Visage_RT_FBP-  CB_1.2_beta2_Win32VC8.zip (1301698 bytes)    Looking at the code  it appears that we do indeed attempt to load every FTP   URL as a directory listing first.  Mozilla behaves like IE.    Unfortunately  this test case is behind a username and password  so I can't   share the full test case :( </pre>
