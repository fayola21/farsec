<title>Issue 12372 -   chromium -    SessionRestore does not close the old window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Crash the browser  2. Open the browser  3. Click on restore      This should restore the old browser session in a new browser window and   close the old browser window.  Instead  both browser windows are around.    It seems to be because we don't call BrowserList::SetLastActive().     </pre>
