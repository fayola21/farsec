<title>Issue 18638 -   chromium -    Titles of the thumbnails don't update correctly on the NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.196.2 (Official Build 22142) and previous.      No  because the New Tab Page is a Chrome peculiarity.      1. Open some site.  2. Accessed page isn't available for any eventuality.  3. This page appears in the most accessed on the New Tab Page  with the title   &quot;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a> is not available&quot;.   4. This page returns to work perfectly (now  available)  but its thumbnail   title doesn't change  still appear &quot;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a> is not available&quot;.  5. Not even hundreds of access to the thumbnail makes update the title.      The thumbnails titles should be to change to the real status of the page.      Remains the old title  under the thumbnails.   And the issue persists in the NNTP.      Attached a screenshot.     </pre>
