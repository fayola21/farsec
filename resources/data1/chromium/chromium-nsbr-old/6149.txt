Launch CamStudio and select Region/Full Screen menu option.  2. Click on &quot;Record&quot; button to start recording.  3. Launch Chrome/Chromium  create two tabs.  4. Drag and drop a tab to new window.  5. Try to Drop back the above tab to its original window.    You can't drop it back to its original window as long as the CamStudio is  recording.
