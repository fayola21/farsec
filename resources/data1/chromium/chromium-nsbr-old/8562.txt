<title>Issue 8562 -   chromium -    Running layout test when LayoutTests isn't synced causes fatal lint errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have LayoutTests synced on a repository.  I tried to run a layout   test that's from chrome's directory  but lint gave a lot of errors like:    Line:1746 Path does not exist.  LayoutTests/transitions/transition-end-event-container.html    and the test didn't run. </pre>
