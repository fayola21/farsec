<title>Issue 23037 -   chromium -    Feature Request - Browsing folders should use folder icon as well - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.14  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: IE an      Firefox 3.5: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Type a local directory or network directoy into the Chrome search bar   (eg. C:) and hit return.        The browser should typically provide an easy to understand view of the   files/folders in that directory and most modern browsers do show an icon   for folders.      Chrome does not easily distinguish between a folder and a file. The only   difference being that folders have a '/' at the end of their name and   indicate a blank for the file size column. I would think this functionality   could easily be added to pretty it up and make it much more usable.       </pre>
