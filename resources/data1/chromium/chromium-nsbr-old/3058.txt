<title>Issue 3058 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Please provide option to choose specific fonts for international languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519) on Windows XP   SP2/SP3    URLs (if applicable) : NA               Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Request:    1. At present there is no option to change the default font within   Chrome/Chromium for International languages (e.g. Hindi  Bengali etc.)    2. For such languages  one has to depend on Windows XP default option    which may be inconvenient for Chrome/Chromium browser. Normally  there is   no way to change this default font in Windows XP SP2/SP3  for any language   (not only Bengali  Hindi etc.). It appears to be harcoded there.       </pre>
