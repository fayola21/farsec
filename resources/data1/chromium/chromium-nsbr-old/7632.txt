<title>Issue 7632 -   chromium -    Add a clobber builder that does nothing but compile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Occasionally we have changes that only break in clobber builds. The full  builder is so slow  it can take over an hour to detect one of those. We  should add a clobber builder that only compiles  which would catch build  breakages in less than 10 minutes.    So far it doesn't seem necessary to do the same for Mac and Linux. </pre>
