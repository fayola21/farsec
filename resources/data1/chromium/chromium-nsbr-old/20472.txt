<title>Issue 20472 -   chromium -    Assertion at text_database_manager.cc(295) opening two of the same page at the same time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit <a href="http://images.google.com">http://images.google.com</a>  2. Clear history  3. Browse back and forth clicking Images and News links.  4. Open or close a tab containing News at the same time News is already  opening.        Chromium loads each page  even if there are two requests to open the same  page at once.    I ran into this with a page that opened the same URL twice in two separate  IFrames--I suspect it was probably recently broken or someone would have  reported this already since you don't have to do anything tricky to trigger  this assertion.        Gets to a NOT_REACHED in the text_database_manager.cc  [30973:30992:31577304225:FATAL:chrome/browser/history/text_database_manager.cc(295)]  Check failed: false.
