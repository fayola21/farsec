<title>Issue 17586 -   chromium -    Generate a source tarball with each release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm working for packaging Chrome for Gentoo Linux  and the only thing   needed on the side of Google infrastructure is generating a source tarball   with each release (just like we generate deb packages).    I made a tool to do that  in src/tools/export_tarball/export_tarball.py    It needs to be called like export_tarball.py --remove-nonessential-files   chromium-3.0.195.1    The important things:  (*) --remove-nonessential-files flag  so that the tarball takes ~110 MB and   not ~1GB  (*) name of the tarball (chromium) should ideally reflect the name of the   package in Gentoo; it's called Chromium because the binary will not be   official  (*) version number in the tarball name  (*) the tool automatically appends .tar.bz2 to the supplied name  and it   renames the top-level directory inside the tarball to that name    To be decided:  (*) should the package use Gentoo mirroring infrastructure? There is a n   option to disable it  for example to make possible accurate measuring   number of downloads.    Please help me getting the source tarball generation working for each   release. </pre>
