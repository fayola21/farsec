<title>Issue 7868 -   chromium -    PluginObject getURL needs to return status code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See the test LayoutTests/http/tests/plugins/local-geturl-from-remote.html .   This test expects plg.getURL to return a value indicating whether the load   was successful of not. We fail because we're not returning a status code.    &quot;plg.getURL&quot; ends up in PluginObject's getURL  which doesn't return a   status code.    I've rebaselined this test  because we don't allow the load  which is what   the test is testing for. When we add the appropriate logic remove the   baseline. </pre>
