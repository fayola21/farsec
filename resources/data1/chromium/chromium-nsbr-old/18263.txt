<title>Issue 18263 -   chromium -    Removing an item from download shelf crashes chromium. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Debug mode  when removing a download item from the download shelf via   context menu. It crashes chrome.    The reason why it crashes is because when you bring up the context menu to   remove item from list  the view is present. But after you click on remove  it   deletes the view but the context menu is still present and it continues that   method requesting a view repaint  but the view has been deleted causing   chromium to crash. </pre>
