<title>Issue 5569 -   chromium -    Modify Ctrl+Tab to change to most-recently-used tab and/or show tab title/thumbnail previews - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36              Firefox 3: OK (with an extension - stack-styled tabs)           IE 7: FAIL      1. Open 3 tabs  2. Ctrl-tab some times    This is a feature request  not quite a bug report.  I just thought it would be quite handy for users to be able to change the   behaviour of Ctrl-Tab to act like Alt-Tab (but for tabs  obviously). This   behaviour isn't default in any other browser  but there is a Firefox   extension which activates it (with some bugs  though). Since I got so used   to it  I would like to see it on Chrome.  Comment welcome! </pre>
