<title>Issue 14705 -   chromium -    [wiesmann.codiferes.net]: Chrome does not display any marker for missing character - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=3727&amp;lang=en">http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=3727&amp;lang=en</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?      When chrome displays a web-page contanining a character it cannot display    typically because the glyph is not present in any font  it displays   nothing. Other browsers typically display two lines (Internet Explorer) or   a square box with the Unicode code (Firefox).  This is misleading to the user  as she won't know there is any form of   missing information.       What is the expected result?    Some indication that there is a character that cannot be displayed.    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to the url  <a href="http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=3727&amp;lang=en">http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=3727&amp;lang=en</a>  2. Search for the text &quot;If you just see a square here:&quot;  3. Look for either a character or a sign that the character cannot be   displayed.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    The character in the web page is typically not installed on major OS   distributions (this is a non basic multilingual plane chinese character)    but firefox 3.08 and Internet Explorer 6.0.2900 display a hint that there   is something that cannot be displayed.    Please provide any additional information below.     </pre>
