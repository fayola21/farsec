<title>Issue 10724 -   chromium -    As you tear off tabs  the &quot;hold point&quot; should not move on the sliding window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Open 10 tabls  2.Cick and drag the *right* most tab  and slide it down a few inches      What is the expected (desired?) output?    I would expect the grabbed window tab to slide straight down the screen.     What do you see instead?    The window (and tab) in motion immediately jumps far to the right  so that   the &quot;hold point&quot; on the tab window that is is motion can immediately   establish itself at the far left corner of the window        </pre>
