<title>Issue 22600 -   chromium -    Failed to precache youtube video unless you manually move the timeline cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4 (Official version 26653)  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL on youtube that the video is longer then 2   mins      Firefox 3.x : Successfully cached whole flash video without any problem           IE 7 : Successfully cached whole flash video without any problem    Google Chrome before the latest update : Sucessfully cached whole flash   video without any problem      1. Just look at any video as you want and start to precache it by pressing   the start button and pause it after started  2. Then try to wait for a fully successful precache  you will find that   Google Chrome / flash is failed to precache whole video  even the video has   reached the last cached point  3. After reached the last cached point  Google Chrome / flash will not be   able to cache the video anymore  even that &quot;loading&quot; image appeared at the   center of the video.      I expected the video should be fully precached as it is a common and basic   function of flash streaming video.      Google Chrome is failed to precache the flash video as having download   problem (which I will report in another post / thread as Google Chrome   failed to download any file as the checksum is wrong).    Attached the screenshot of the &quot;loading&quot; screen on Windows XP when using   Google Chrome.  The video is always stoped at the &quot;loading&quot; or &quot;precaching&quot; screen without   any actual precaching at all. </pre>
