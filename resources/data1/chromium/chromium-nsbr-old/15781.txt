<title>Issue 15781 -   chromium -    Support multiple X displays - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be awesome if chrome could open windows on multiple displays  so   that if a user is logged in on a desktop with a running chrome and then logs   in remotely over ssh/nx/vnc/whatever and runs chrome again  a new window   (belonging to the same old running process) will show up on the remote   display.    Firefox can't do this  but emacs can (where the capability is called &quot;multi-  tty&quot;  in case the bits of GTKness that emacs and chrome share are useful).    (this is a feature request  not a defect report  but I don't see how to   change the class of the issue) </pre>
