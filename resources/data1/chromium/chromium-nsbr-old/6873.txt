<title>Issue 6873 -   chromium -    Middle-clicking address bar = mouse doesn't hover/click right until you click again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Start Chrome  * Middle-click in the address bar  Now try hovering the tab or window close buttons  or other UI components.    Nothing hovers.  Any click  including a middle click  including one on the   address bar again  will get you out of this state  and until then _no_   clicks on anything work (just like hover doesn't work).    I don't know  maybe the edit is somehow capturing the mouse on middle click   or something?  WTF.   </pre>
