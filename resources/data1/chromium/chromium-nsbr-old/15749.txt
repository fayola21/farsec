<title>Issue 15749 -   chromium -    Coordinates flipped while dragging in-page windows on Google Voice site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit <a href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html">http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html</a> .  2. Click &quot;Block calls&quot; or anything else that interests you.  3. A &quot;window&quot; will pop up.  Try to drag it vertically by its title bar.        Observe: When you move the mouse up  the window moves down.  When   you move the mouse down  the window moves up.    Expect: Window drags along with the mouse.    The windows are intended to host Flash videos  so the site's not terribly   usable anyway  but the drag behavior is flipped. </pre>
