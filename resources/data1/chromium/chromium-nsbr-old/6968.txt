<title>Issue 6968 -   chromium -    UI: User added search engines shouldn't be mixed with auto-collected ones - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium build 7477  URLs (if applicable) : NA           Safari 3: ?      Firefox 3: ?           IE 7: same issue      1. Click on Wrench / Options / Manage / Search engines  2. Look at the existing engines  or add a custom one        There should be two different lists:  * engines added manually  * engines collected automatically when browsing        Both types of search engines are mixed in one single list.    I have a lot of manually added search engines with custom keyword (maps  def  wiki  video    torrent  movies...). It would be nice to see them listed separately  to be able to manage the   search engines better.     </pre>
