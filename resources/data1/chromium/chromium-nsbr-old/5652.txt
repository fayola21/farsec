<title>Issue 5652 -   chromium -    textareas reserve space for scrollbar when they shouldn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some comments from hyatt about bugs that should be fixed before upstreaming   textarea changes:    Safari does this: scrollbar/resizer are in the wrong place  but padding is   properly visible on all four sides.    Chrome does this: scrollbar/resizer in the right place  but bottom padding   gone and you cannot scroll the bottom 20px of padding into view.    When a vertical scrollbar is not needed  Safari and IE reclaim the space   (leaving only 20px of padding). Chrome always reserves space for the   scrollbar. </pre>
