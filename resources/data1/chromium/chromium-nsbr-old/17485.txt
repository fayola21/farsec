<title>Issue 17485 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behavior with bookmarks imports location. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on DEV-3.0.195.1 (Official Build 21222) and ToT.    Works fine on Stable.    -Make sure your bookmarks list is empty - This is important.  -Import bookmarks from IE/FF    Notice  all the imported bookmarks go to under 'Other bookmarks' folder   directly  instead of 'Other bookmarks/Imported from xx' folder.    PS: If step1 fails  then imported bookmarks go to the proper location   ie   'Other bookmarks/Imported from xx'      </pre>
