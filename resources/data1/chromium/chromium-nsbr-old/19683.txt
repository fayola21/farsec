<title>Issue 19683 -   chromium -    Full screen mode in Compiz flickers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Specifically:    1) Entering full screen causes a noticable white flicker which isn't   present on metacity (not that bad though).    2) Exiting full screen mode shows my desktop (even if there are windows   behind Chrome) for about a second.    3) When in full screen mode  {tooltips  omnibox dropdown*  popups  task   manager  web development console} cause the same ~1s flicker of the desktop   image. The tooltips in particular drive me crazy.    * which doesn't actually work and shouldn't be shown; I include it in this   list to potentially aid diagnosis.
