<title>Issue 13560 -   chromium -    Cannot select google.com for Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.5  OS version               : 10.5.6      1. connect from Belgium  2. enter a search into the Omnibox      I want all my search results to come from google.com and in English.      I get the results from google.be and in Dutch.    ----  I would suggest that the browser has a language preference (which also   gets placed into Accept-Language)  and that pref is used to select the   appropriate google.* site and language.   </pre>
