<title>Issue 7902 -   chromium -    provide a way to set the vertical limits on the performance graphs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> provide a way to set the vertical limits on the performance graphs    whenever there is a crazy outlier in a performance test  it causes the   graph to be almost unusable since the interesting portion of the data is   squashed too much.    we should support some way to set the vertical axis.  a query parameter   would be fine  provided we show the default query parameter value in the   URL bar. </pre>
