<title>Issue 16164 -   chromium -    Context Menu Freezes during rapid tab opening - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Find a web page with multiple links in close proximity  2. right click and open link in new tab  3.IMMEDIATELY right click on an adjacent link and attempt to click &quot;open   link in new tab&quot; (should be done within 500ms after original click)        Should be able to click &quot;open link in new tab&quot; and open the link   immediately          button is not responsive.  Button may or may not 'highlight' (turn blue on   my system).  This may persist for a second or two.  Mouseout and mouseover   again fixes responsiveness.    I should note that I'm talking about right-clicking on the second link   within 0.5 or 1 second of opening the original link.  Sounds dumb but has   happened to me while casually browsing multiple times.    <b>Please provide
