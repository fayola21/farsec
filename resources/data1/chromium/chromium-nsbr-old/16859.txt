<title>Issue 16859 -   chromium -    clicking on a tab sometimes leaves page strangely clipped temporarily - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: don't know      1. Open several tabs in Chrome  2. Click on a background tab to select it  3. Sometimes the tab's content will be clipped to the top left corner        The tab's content should take up the full window area.        It is clipped to the top left and leaves the rest of the window empty. This   only happens sometimes. It seems to happen more with new tabs opened   in the background the first time they are displayed  and with tabs that   haven't been viewed in a while  and when Chrome has previously been   hidden. Clicking on another tab and back always seems to fix the glitch. </pre>
