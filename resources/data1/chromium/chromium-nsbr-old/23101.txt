<title>Issue 23101 -   chromium -    Offer Vista Aero theme for XP users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1    Any chance XP users could get a Vista theme option? On the Themes page    there's a Classic  but no Vista. I prefer the Aero-looking theme much more   than the XP classic theme.    Thanks   Graeme   </pre>
