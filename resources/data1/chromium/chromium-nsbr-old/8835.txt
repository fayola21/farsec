Go to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ericshawnauthor">http://www.myspace.com/ericshawnauthor</a>  2. Scroll down so you are seeing the 2 youtube videos in the page.    What is the expected output?       What do you see instead?  There is a spike in the CPU usage even though the videos are not playing.
