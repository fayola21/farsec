Go to one of the above URLs  2. Drag the bookmarklet link to bookmark bar  3. No bookmark is created      Bookmark should be created  and visible on bookmark bar  that runs the   javascript when you click it      Nothing--it's as if you've just dragged and dropped an image some place   it can't be dragged to.
