<title>Issue 4812 -   chromium -    Make some sense of the startup sequence - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The startup sequence is somewhat haphazardly split across   chrome_dll_main.cc  browser_main.cc and browser_init.cc. There are huge   multi-page functions where everyone and their dog hook in and do startup.   We should have an observer system whereby modules can register as observers   of various points during startup.    This will make our startup process more understandable and allow more of   our codebase to be reused. </pre>
