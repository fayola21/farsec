<title>Issue 4638 -   chromium -    CRASH @ NPObjectProxy::GetProxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happens with Chrome 0.4.154.23      1. Go to <a href="http://misc.xstandard.com/google/editor.asp">http://misc.xstandard.com/google/editor.asp</a>  2. Once the plugin loads  press F5    What is the expected output?   The plugin should load again    What do you see instead?  It doesn't load and crashes.     Interestingly  there is no message that something crashed. But an event   gets logged in eventvwr. Looks like this is related to <a title="Object with type=&quot;application/x-xstandard&quot; doesn't render after loading the page" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=292"> Issue 292 </a>    Dump can be found @  http://go/chromeqa-dumps/xstandard.dmp         </pre>
