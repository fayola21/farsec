<title>Issue 3948 -   chromium -    Get rid of tab contents type system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we have a notion of having different types of TabContents (e.g.   WebContents  NativeUIContents  etc). This should go away  it adds a huge   amount of complexity and crashiness to the product. Instead:    - NativeUIContents  StatusViews etc should all be re-done in HTML  - TabContents and WebContents should merge  - Process isolation offered by WebContents subclasses (e.g.   DOMUIHost/NewTabUIContents) should be handled internally to WebContents   somehow.  - WebContents should get some additional methods a la DOMUIHost - the   ability for the embedding app to add arbitrary JS hooks to the loaded page     </pre>
