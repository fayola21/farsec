<title>Issue 5070 -   chromium -    Multiple Profiles Prototype: Default profile will not show up in browsers running in non-default profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am on the verge of committing the multiple profiles prototype work to   Chromium trunk. There is one known issue with the current implementation.    The prototype of multiple profiles works by using the user-data-dir   functionality. We create sibling folders of the &quot;User Data&quot; folder for new   profiles. Example:  User Data  User Data-Munjal  User Data-Finnur  User Data-Scott    This assumes that the original user data folder name is &quot;User Data&quot;. This   is fine for Chrome installs  but is not fine when the user data folder   doesn't start with the expected prefix. For e.g. in tests  or installs   where this behavior is changed.    The only known problem in such cases is that when Chrome is running with a   non-default profile  the default profile will now show up in the list of   profiles.    This is fixable by storing some state information for each profile  but the   prototype right now is stateless.     </pre>
