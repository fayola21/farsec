<title>Issue 3295 -   chromium -    no easy way to convert text with links into a ChromeView layout with ChromeViews::Label and ChromeViews::Link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often times we want to display text with links using ChromeViews.  If this   is text that needs to be localized  this causes a problem because   localization only knows about strings.  We then need to convert the string   into a ChromeViews layout where we splice links into ChromeView::Link   objects between ChromeView::Label objects.    This is easy in HTML  but hard to do with ChromeViews.    Basically  what we need is a really simple parser that converts text with   &lt;a&gt; tags into the right ChromeViews layout automagically. </pre>
