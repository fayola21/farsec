<title>Issue 7823 -   chromium -    Prevent slow unload handlers from slowing down navigation and tab close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ben and I have both been whining about this in private but I'm not sure   anyone actually filed anything.    For a while now Chrome has frequently felt laggy when closing tabs.    Closing a tab can take up to a half second  which contrasts sharply with   the responsiveness of much of the rest of the UI  and makes it much harder   to quickly close a series of tabs.  The browser feels really busted.    I blame this on our onbeforeunload (etc.) handling code.  My recollection   is that Ojan wanted to do a lot more work to make this fast (killing   processes more aggressively  closing the tab element in the UI before the   renderer actually shut down  etc.)  but I suspect that didn't happen.    This does not happen on every page  but it does happen on more than just   pages with onbeforeunload handlers (I think).  For example  I frequently   get this with shacknews.com pages.  I'm not sure what could be causing   this  perhaps swapping something into memory  or maybe some interaction   with the Flash process running ads on the page.    Marked P2 since I don't think this should block a beta-channel release  but   this is one of my top couple annoyances right now. </pre>
