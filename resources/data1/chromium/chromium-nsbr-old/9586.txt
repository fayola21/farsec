<title>Issue 9586 -   chromium -    Linux and Mac now have to link in the world - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12881">r12881</a> added WebKit API functions to renderer messages. This required  linking in huge numbers of new libraries into many Linux and Mac targets  (inc librenderer in several places and adding breakpad to renderer).    In order to get the build going the following patches were submitted:    12894  12893  12892  12891  12889    We need to figure out how to reduce the transient closure of this change  and revert those CLs. </pre>
