<title>Issue 4141 -   chromium -    Tab close button no-longer highlights when tab slides in under the mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See the bug &lt;http://b/1246801  Reproduced in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=48039">r48039</a>  post Ben's tab strip animation change.    If you close a non-rightmost tab with your mouse  the tab to the right  slides into its place  positioned so that its close button is under the  user's mouse cursor. Previously  this close button was highlighted even if  you didn't move the mouse cursor  but this is no-longer the case - without  mouse movement  the close button of this tab is no-longer highlighted.    This is MagicBrowzR only. </pre>
