<title>Issue 7877 -   chromium -    Should display JS/HTML error indicator in the browser as a shortcut for &quot;Report a bug...&quot; menu item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are long standing requests to have a status icon in the Chrome UI   that shows whether or not the page you're on had an HTML or JS error.    While this feature is incredibly useful for web developers  perhaps we   could also use it for non-developers as an accelerator to report a site   compat bug.  So they see a little icon  they click on it and it shows the   errors and says &quot;report site compatibility issue to Google?&quot;. </pre>
