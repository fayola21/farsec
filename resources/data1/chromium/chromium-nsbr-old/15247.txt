<title>Issue 15247 -   chromium -    NNTP: No way to restore all deleted thumbnails. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   I believe  this is not yet implemented ??    Right now  there is no option to restore all the deleted thumbnails. User can   restore only the last deleted one.  As the case with NTP  we should provide an option to restore all the   thumbnails.  </pre>
