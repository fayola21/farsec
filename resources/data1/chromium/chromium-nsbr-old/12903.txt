<title>Issue 12903 -   chromium -    Horizontal Scrollbar in Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In IRC we've been hearing about horizontal scroll bars when using Gmail in the latest trunk. The   horizontal scroll bar only has ~15px off the page frame  and it disappears when you resize the   window.    Mostly we've been hearing about this from Mac users  though there has been a few Windows   reports of the same behavior. There was talk about it possibly being a WebCore issue. </pre>
