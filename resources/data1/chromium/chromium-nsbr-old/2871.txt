<title>Issue 2871 -   chromium -    Search from History page cannot find only pages viewed on a certain day - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    Steps:  1. Perhaps I don't know how to do it  by I type something like &quot;September   20  2008&quot; into the Search box in the History page.    Expected results:  Filter to show me only the pages that I browsed on that day.    Actual results:  Get many more results that just the pages that I browsed that day.    This is a crucial functionality of the search on the History page.  It must   be able to search for a date and show me all the pages that I browsed on   that day.   </pre>
