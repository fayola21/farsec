Check the &quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot; preference  2. Wait for an autoupdate or induce it somehow  3. Restart browser        Expected: Last open pages should be restored  Actual: Last open pages not restored      Google Chrome 4.0.202.0  but I've seen this in earlier builds as well. </pre>
