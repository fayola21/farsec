<title>Issue 23159 -   chromium -    Bookmarks manager behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is just a sum up  what would I expect to happen when using bookmarks   manager. (Linux version)    I'm having lots of folders in bookmarks bar  and after I add some bookmarks   I would like to organize them.    I would expect to:  1. open a dropdown from a folder in bookmarks bar  2. right click on a bookmark in the list and choose bookmarks manager  3. bookmarks manager would take me exactly to that bookmark and highlight it   for me     Currently bookmarks manager is opened at the root level. </pre>
