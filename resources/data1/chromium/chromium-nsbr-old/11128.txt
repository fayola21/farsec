<title>Issue 11128 -   chromium -    Override font sizes for UI elements where size matters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We can't require a particular font on Linux for UI elements (since we can't   know what fonts the user has installed  and we should obey the user's wishes   anyway).  But for the omnibox and tab titles  only fonts of a certain size   will fit.  We should override the font size for the omnibox and tab titles.    [linus brought this bug up] </pre>
