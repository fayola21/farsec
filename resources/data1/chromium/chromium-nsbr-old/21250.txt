<title>Issue 21250 -   chromium -    Window not fully maximizing with hidden start bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  my start bar is hidden. When I maximize a Chrome window  the UI   changes to the maximized state (small titlebar etc) but doesn't fully extend   downwards to cover the part where the start bar would be. As such  I get   something from background windows shining through. If I &quot;restore&quot; the window   and try to manually size it  I can't resize the window down past where the   top of the titlebar would be.    in 4.0.203.2 </pre>
