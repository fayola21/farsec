<title>Issue 17169 -   chromium -    mismatched delete / delete[] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With my <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21053">r21053</a> there was a new valgrind error:    Mismatched free() / delete / delete []    operator delete[](void*) (ome/chrome-bot/valgrind-  svn/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:335)    net::(anonymous namespace)::FreeMyAddrinfo(addrinfo*) (net/base/address_list.cc:57)    net::AddressList::Data::~Data() (net/base/address_list.cc:155)    net::SOCKS5ClientSocket::~SOCKS5ClientSocket() (base/ref_counted.h:107)    The problem is i use new sockaddrinfo_in6  however in the destructor it is expecting   CreateCopyOfAddrinfo() which instead does a new char[ai_addrlen].   </pre>
