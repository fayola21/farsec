<title>Issue 3922 -   chromium -    Broken link on the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9            Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL      1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=alpha_index.cs&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=alpha_index.cs&amp;hl=en</a>  2. There are two &quot;Friend Connect&quot; links. The first one  (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/friendconnect/?hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/friendconnect/?hl=en</a>) is broken. Blank page  is opened.    I am really sorry as this has nothing to do with Chromium  but I just  haven't found where to post this. I hope you  Google Support Guys  can  forward it to the right people. :) </pre>
