<title>Issue 22868 -   chromium -    Status bubble doesn't dodge mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">http://webchat.freenode.net/</a> and join a channel  e.g. #chromium        I should be able to use this. Instead  the status bubble pops up every now and then  unhelpfully   suggests that  chrome is &quot;Waiting for webchat.freenode.net&quot;  obscures my chat input box and doesn't   dodge even if I hover it with the mouse.    I understand that this is a technical problem with GTK  but at least for chromeos this is not acceptable   imho.         </pre>
