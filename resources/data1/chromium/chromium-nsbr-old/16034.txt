<title>Issue 16034 -   chromium -    Investigate timeouts on starting testserver. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I experimented with tcp_pinger timeouts  (<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/155020">http://codereview.chromium.org/155020</a>) and it turned out it broke Vista  buildbots.    It may be a good place to investigate one source of flakiness  as Nicolas  suggested.    I wonder about few things  it's really interesting:  - why did the change speed up the tests?  - why sometimes the testserver takes so long to start? Does it start at all  or is there some other kind of problem?    I'll try to find answers. </pre>
