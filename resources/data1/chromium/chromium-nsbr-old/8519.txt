<title>Issue 8519 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Hovering last tab does not show title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hovering the last tab in the last window does not show the tab title in a   tooltip (assuming the title is long enough to warrant this).  When there is   more than one tab  things work.    Left this as pri 2 because it shouldn't block beta IMO </pre>
