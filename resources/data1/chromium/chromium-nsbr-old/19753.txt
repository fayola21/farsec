<title>Issue 19753 -   chromium -    Import bookmarks asked to close FF  then it kept asking and never imported them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I ran Chrome for the first time in Linux.  2. It asked me if I wanted to import settings from Mozilla Firefox  I said   yes.  3. Chrome asked me to close all FF windows. After I killed FF  the dialog   kept reappearing  even though I clicked continue.        After I closed FF  Chrome should import the bookmarks.        The dialog about cancel / continue importing bookmarks kept reappearing. After clicking about 30 times  I gave up and clicked cancel. Chrome hasn't   asked me about importing bookmarks again.    <b>Please provide
