<title>Issue 6040 -   chromium -    add ability to measure total page transition time from javascript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a website developer trying to measure the performance of your web page    it's useful to measure the time it takes your page to load from the time   the user clicks on a link (or types it into the address bar) to some time   that the page actually believes it has finished loaded.  This allows you to   measure things such as DNS latency  redirects  and other client-side   effects that you wouldn't be able to measure by just measuring the load   time on the page itself or from the server's perspective.    I talked about this a few months ago with hixie  and he proposed adding   this via a new &quot;performance&quot; object to window.navigator where we could hang   stats like this off of.  Using window.navigator is good choice because it's   not technically part of the DOM (or in the spec)  and is considered vendor-  specific client information.    To start with  I think we just need two variables here:    window.navigator.performance.pageTransitionTime - a Date object set to the   time that the last page transition action was initiated    window.navigator.performance.pageTransitionType - an int that has enum   values for the type of page transition action (link  chrome  forward  back    new window  frame  redirect  other)       </pre>
