<title>Issue 1657 -   chromium -    CPU Boost to 100% for 10 seconds while using mousewheel in java application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : cannot find  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.runescape.com">http://www.runescape.com</a>  Other browsers tested: IE 7.0                 IE 7: OK        - A window should be scrolled        The application hangs also other tabs (CPU boost to 100% for aout 10   seconds)  when using the mousewheel to scroll.  Runescape is a MMORPG game made in Java. I installed the latest java   version that works with chrome. I tested the mousewheel in EI 7.0 and   works well. The game can be played in hardware rendering (OPENGL) but i   tested  in software rendering. (to avoid hardware problems)    See screenshots.     I see that the java machine of the webpage of the game is stable  only the   browser itself 'eats' cpu.    I do not think it's a problem of the game of javamachine. It think there   is a action behind the mouse scroll that makes the issue..    Greetings   Jeroen van Langen.    ps: keep up the good job!   </pre>
