<title>Issue 12968 -   chromium -    Coverity: stack use too large in ExtensionUnpacker::ReadPackageHeader - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   ExtensionUnpacker::ReadPackageHeader() {    ...    char buf[1 &lt;&lt; 16];  ...    }    That declares a stack variable of 65K bytes. It forces to grow the stack   and once it grows it never frees that memory. Please use heap memory   (scoped_ptr) for this sizes.            </pre>
