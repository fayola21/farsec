<title>Issue 4477 -   chromium -    Implement a new/better URL matching syntax for Greasemonkey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current URL matching syntax for Greasemonkey just uses simple globs.   These are prone to problems. Authors frequently do something like this:    *google.com*    This can match domains other than google.com. We should introduce a new   declaration where the protocol  domain  and path portions are treated   differently. For example  we could do:    @match &lt;protocol&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;path&gt;  @match * *.google.com * </pre>
