<title>Issue 16979 -   chromium -    Smartcard or private key's PIN/password dialog blocks the IO thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Smartcards use a PIN/password to grant access to private keys.  It's also possible to protect a private key in the Windows  CryptoAPI key store with a PIN/password.    This PIN/password must be entered the first time the private  key is used.  At that time the CSP (cryptographic service provider)  pops up a PIN/password dialog.  Since this happens during the  signing operation  which runs on the IO thread  the dialog  blocks the IO thread.    CSPs typically remember the PIN/password  so this dialog won't  pop up until Chromium restarts or the smartcard is removed and  reinserted.  So this problem occurs rarely.    The fix is to identify the SSPI function call that performs the  signing operation using the private key during SSL client  authentication  and move that call to a worker thread. </pre>
