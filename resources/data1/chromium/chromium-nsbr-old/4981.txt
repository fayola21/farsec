<title>Issue 4981 -   chromium -    Chromium Should Not Always Create &quot;Downloads&quot; folder. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Everytime chromium starts  it checks and creates the %UserProfile%DocumentsDownloads folder if it does not exists.     I've changed the download location on my install to &quot;E:&quot;. So I do not need   nor do I want the &quot;Downloads&quot; folder  either in  %UserProfile%Documents   or in my alternative download location.     Chromium should only create the  %UserProfile%DocumentsDownloads folder   during initial installation and if the user has not changed his or her   download location through the options menu.       </pre>
