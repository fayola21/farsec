<title>Issue 3551 -   chromium -    Download menu items should be disabled when downloaded file has been deleted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium build: 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 3546)        1. Download a file; I used this URL:  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.3&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.3&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US</a>  2. In the Download Confirmation bar  click the &quot;Save&quot; button.  3. In Windows Explorer  delete the downloaded file.   4. Click the down-arrow on the associated item on the Download Bar to pop  up the menu.    What is the expected output?     The menu items &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Show in folder&quot; should be disabled.  Firefox: menu items are disabled.    What do you see instead?    The above menu items are enabled  but when selected  nothing happens.     </pre>
