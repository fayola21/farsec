<title>Issue 9706 -   chromium -    Should be able to launch a set of URLs on first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  there's no clean way to launch a pre-determined set of URLs on   first launch -- we end up setting the home page  and pre-setting the URL of   the second &quot;welcome&quot; tab.    The installerdata/master preferences file should support a new array in the   &quot;distribution&quot; name structure:    {    &quot;distribution&quot; : {      &quot;launch_on_first_run&quot; : [        &quot;<a href="http://www.chromium.org/launch/in/first/tab">http://www.chromium.org/launch/in/first/tab</a>&quot;         &quot;<a href="http://www.chromium.org/launch/in/second/tab">http://www.chromium.org/launch/in/second/tab</a>&quot;         ...      ]    }  }    (or something similar)    When Chrome the runs for the first time  it launches each of the given URLs   in their own tabs.  If this structure is not defined in master prefs  the   browser should behave as it does now.       </pre>
