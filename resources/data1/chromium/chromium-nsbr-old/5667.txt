<title>Issue 5667 -   chromium -    BUG: The entire browser gets stuck when WMP plugin is not responding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.39  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.nana10.co.il/Article/?">http://www.nana10.co.il/Article/?</a>  ArticleID=602527&amp;sid=120      1. Start playing the video (click play).  2. While buffering or whenever  try to select the text beneath the player bar  or   press the buttons over there a few times (doing it while it takes time until it   starts).      The workflow continues.      The entire browser gets stuck and after 30 seconds approximately  may be   more  the &quot;The plugin is not responding&quot; message comes up.    The thing is  the entire browser should not get stuck - in situation. As you   promote it - it is not a single process browser  these kinds of stuff should not   happen.      Note - I think you have to be from Israel (got an Israeli proxy instead? :)) to   watch the video.  I bet you can reproduce it with any player of this kind.    Thank you! </pre>
