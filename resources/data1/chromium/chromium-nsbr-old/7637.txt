<title>Issue 7637 -   chromium -    Some context menus have different border/shadow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start chrome  2. Optional: open a second tab to get the tab context menu on tabs  3. Open two tabs  and right click on a tab. Or right-click on the bookmarks   bar.      All context menus should have the same look and behavior.      Some context menus look different  and behave a bit differently. These   include the tab context menu in the tab bar (try with more than one tab   open)  and the bookmarks bar context menu. The border and shadow both look   'thicker'. Also  press and hold Ctrl  and then press Alt. Normal menus   would go away  but these different ones will not. (I assume these are not   real menus)    Please provide
