<title>Issue 14373 -   chromium -    [www.comtalk.dk]: Top navigation menu animates slowly and irregularly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.comtalk.dk/">http://www.comtalk.dk/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.30 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.30 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?        The top navigation menu on this site uses some fancy spinning rectangles   to represent menu items.  In google chrome these menu items spin slowly and   irregularly  enough that I'm sure anyone viewing the site in google chrome   will find it annoying.  This is not an issue in either other browsers I've   tried.    What is the expected result?        The menu items should spin quickly and smoothly.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to comtalk.dk  2. Mouse over the rectangles next to the comtalk logo at the top  3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    FF3: OK  IE7: OK    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
