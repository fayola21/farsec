<title>Issue 18379 -   chromium -    Content Scripts don't work on base page when there is more than 1 frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install the extension in the attached zip file.    Run a debug build something like this:    $ ./chrome/Debug/chrome.exe --enable-extensions --load-  extension=&quot;C:/frame_cs_test&quot;      Visit this page:    <a href="http://asargent.com/chrome/extensions/content_script_frame_test/with_frames">http://asargent.com/chrome/extensions/content_script_frame_test/with_frames</a>  .html    Hit the &quot;Script Test&quot; toolstrip button  and notice that the &quot;Hello&quot; message   gets appended to the two frames but not the base page.    I played around a little  and when I add more frames to the page it seems   to only run on the last 2 frames. Switching between having same-origin and   different-origin frames didn't seem to make a difference.       This was with a debug build (built at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22274">r22274</a>).     </pre>
