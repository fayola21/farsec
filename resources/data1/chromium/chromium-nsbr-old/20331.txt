<title>Issue 20331 -   chromium -    Multiple related problems with &quot;default search&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23795">r23795</a>  OS + version : goobuntu kernel 2.6.24-gg24-generic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : metacity     There are two related issues.    Issue #1: &quot;Shortcuts&quot; from default search engines break typing in URL's.      1. Open the options  and make sure that under &quot;default search&quot;  a search   engine is set with a single-character keyword; e.g.  google.com with   keyword &quot;g&quot;.  2. In the URL bar  type in any URL beginning with the letter g; OR  2'. In the URL bar  type in a URL beginning http://g  3. The URL bar will &quot;magically&quot; turn this into a Google search for   everything starting after the letter G.    The result of this is that I can't actually load any URL's beginning with a   g.     The natural workaround would be to remove all of these &quot;default search&quot;   behaviors from the options  (which I would actually like to do anyway --   they annoy me) but that leads to problem #2: these elements have been   reappearing spontaneously. I don't have as certain a reproduction chain    but the basic process seems to be:    1. Go to the options  click on &quot;default search &quot; and remove all the   entries.  2. Wait a day or so.  3. Some of the entries have magically reappeared. A different set each   time. google.com -&gt; 'g' is most common  but facebook.com and the internal   Google bugsdb URL have happened in the past few days as well.    I have no idea what's causing that particular issue.        If I type in a URL  I expect it to be treated as a URL  not as a search   command. The inability to type URL's beginning with various letters of the   alphabet seems particularly irksome.   </pre>
