<title>Issue 21994 -   chromium -    about: pages empty when restored from the previous session. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Chromium (Ubuntu  daily PPA)  if an &quot;about:&quot; page (such as   about:linux-splash) is part of a session  when the browser is restarted    that page is restored as an empty tab. Reload doesn't help  only hitting   enter in the url bar helps.    (it's not new  but i couldn't find an existing issue for this) </pre>
