<title>Issue 19875 -   chromium -    Spaces can cause bad z-order for tab-modal sheets (e.g.  http auth login) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 202.0 (Developer Build 23612)  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Activate a tab-modal sheet  e.g.  navigating chromium to   &lt;<a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html</a>&gt;.  2. Make sure you have a bunch of other application windows on the same (virtual) screen.  3. Quickly move from and to that screen using Ctrl-&lt;arrow-keys&gt;.      Not much.      Sometimes another application's window ends up between the sheet and the browser window.   Sometimes (somehow) the browser window at the front (and the sheet somewhere behind).    (This is presumably actually a GTM bug.) </pre>
