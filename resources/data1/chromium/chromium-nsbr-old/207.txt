<title>Issue 207 -   chromium -    Install behind Authenticating Proxy fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Initial public release installer (Windows XP)           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A      1. Use an authenticating proxy  (i.e. Squid)  2. Try and install Google Chrome behind this proxy.      It needs to be able to run the installer  but it can't  because it can't   get past the proxy. There are no configuarable settings to fix this.      The install fails on the trying to connect to the internet bit at the very   beginning  and won't get any further. I suggest that you provide a setting   in the installer to enter in relevant proxy addresses  and passwords. This   way  it can be installed in a corporate environment. </pre>
