<title>Issue 3297 -   chromium -    Fix retardation in app window throbber updating - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To update the throbber on an app window  the following steps occur:    Browser::LoadingStateChanged  TabStripModel::UpdateTabContentsLoadingAnimations  TabStrip::TabValidateAnimations  TabStrip::LoadingAnimationCallback  Browser::ValidateLoadingAnimations  BrowserView2::ValidateThrobber  OpaqueFrame::UpdateThrobber  ... (updates throbber)    I think we can compress this to:    Browser::LoadingStateChanged  BrowserView2::ValidateLoadingAnimations  BrowserView2::LoadingAnimationCallback  OpaqueFrame::UpdateThrobber  ... (updates throbber)    ... for the app window case. There's no reason to involve the TabStrip.   Rather  if we want to continue with this single source of animation timer    we should make BrowserView2 be that source  since it's constant in both   cases (windows with or without TabStrips). The flow for windows with   TabStrips would look like this:    Browser::LoadingStateChanged  BrowserView2::ValidateLoadingAnimations  BrowserView2::LoadingAnimationCallback  TabStrip::UpdateLoadingAnimations  ... (updates throbber)    This approach avoids involving the TabStrip where it's not required  and a   roundtrip through Browser (!)    This is probably most easily accomplished once the old frame code is   removed. </pre>
