<title>Issue 15632 -   chromium -    Incognito window sharing cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start up an incognito window.  2. Log into groups.google.com in that window.  3. Go to a non-incognito window.  4. Use ctrl+shift+n to create a new incognito window.  5. Go to groups.google.com in the new window.  6. See that you're already logged in to groups.          Groups shouldn't be able to see your cookies from the other incognito window.        All incognito windows appear to be sharing the same set of cookies; it's  like there are two profiles  incognito and regular  instead of having each  incognito window be an island unto itself  which was what I expected.    I've tried starting another regular chrome instance via a shortcut  then  creating another incognito window from it  with the same results.  I have  not yet tried restarting chrome entirely.    Ah--once I close all incognito windows  opening a new one doesn't repro  this behavior.  It really is like there are two profiles  whereas I expect  N+1.  Is this the intended behavior?  It seems wrong to me; I often need  more than two separate profiles [for managing multiple Google accounts   etc.].  I can use multiple browsers [or any number of Firefox profiles]   but I think Chrome should support this use case.    <b>Please provide
