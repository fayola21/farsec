<title>Issue 7623 -   chromium -    BUG: Files are locked while downloading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Ever (2.0.162.0)          URL - <a href="http://greatsongsfree.com/free-MP3-music-downloads.html">http://greatsongsfree.com/free-MP3-music-downloads.html</a>           IE 7: OK (though through manual cache browsing)      Download a big file (to really notice it  can be with small files  too) and try to   view it in TextPadNotepad  or download an MP3 file and try to listen to it in   WinAMP - while it downloads.      The MP3 will partially play the TextPadNotepad will partially show you the   file.      The MP3 will not play and TextPadNotepad will not show you the file  since it   is locked. </pre>
