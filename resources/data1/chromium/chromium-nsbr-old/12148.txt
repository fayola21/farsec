<title>Issue 12148 -   chromium -    The position of the status bubble is wrong on the mirrored UI (RTL) mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start chromium.exe with --lang=he  2. Navigate to Google image search site: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?">http://images.google.com/images?</a>  hl=en&amp;q=chromium (any site is ok  but I  suggest this site  see <a title="Status bar doesn't show when mouse hovers on a link at bottom-left corner" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4821"> Issue 4821 </a> for details.)  3. Scroll page and make lower parts of images to be hidden (see attached   picture).  4. Move your mouse on the bottom-left (or middle) image.    What is the expected output?    The status bubble appeared on the bottom-right corner.    What do you see instead?    The status bubble appeared outside of the window.     </pre>
