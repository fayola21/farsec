<title>Issue 16646 -   chromium -    page info shouldn't move the titlebar up as it adds content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.load google.com  2.right click in the content and select &quot;View Page Info&quot;        the window opens  and then the history area gets added after the fact  when   this happens  the window &quot;grows up&quot; to add space instead of pining the   current location and &quot;growing down&quot; this makes it rather hard to tell what is   in the window until the content stops moving on you.  if it simple extended   down like most windows  the other content wouldn't be moving around.   </pre>
