<title>Issue 19483 -   chromium -    expose &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; pref in options dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : (23540)  OS + version : Debian Testing AMD64  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : Metacity(GNOME)    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Normal buttons        Basically  I have a highly customized GTK theme that EVERYTHING looks nice   in  with the exception of chrome.    All of my 64-bit GTK libraries have 32-bit equivalents(so chrome is 100%   normal)  so this is not an issue. I would suggest that instead of having   the &quot;default GTK theme&quot; just do the colors  have the default gtk window   manager deal with the buttons as well(or have an option to toggle it). I   think this honestly would make it or break it for many people(Going through   bug reports  most infamously the head one  people like the default GTK   window manager drawing the default window manager's buttons).    If this isn't supposed to be here  fine by me  but I think it would be a   very nice thing to have the default window managers buttons like it once   did  as an additional option. </pre>
