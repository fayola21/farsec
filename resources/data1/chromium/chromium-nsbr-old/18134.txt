<title>Issue 18134 -   chromium -    Tab width math is off with pinned tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open several tabs so that they have to be compressed to fit.  2. Pin two of them (right click &gt; &quot;pin tab&quot;) (the problem gets worse with   more pinned tabs).    (see screenshot)    In addition to the gap shown in the screenshot  closing tabs causes all of   the (unpinned) tabs in the bar to _shrink_ until the mouse is removed from   the tab bar.    I guess pinning tabs isn't in the Windows version currently? I tried to test   there  but there's no &quot;pin tab&quot; option. </pre>
