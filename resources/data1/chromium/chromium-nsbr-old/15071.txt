When you find an item and click it to see the description and larger image    the text and pictures overlap.            What is the expected result?  I expect to see (as in Firefox) the images and the text separately so I can   change the color of the item or read the description clearly.            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. anytime you are in the site and click on a specific item as if you were   going to see it better then purchase  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  Firefox    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
