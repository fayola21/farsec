<title>Issue 15738 -   chromium -    No connectivity with system proxy settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 3.0.192.0 Build 19719    Other browsers tested: Chrome (dev)  IE  Fx  Safari  Opera         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.5: OK           IE 8: OK          Opera: OK    Problem?  Since build 19000something I'm not longer able to connect to the   internet with my proxyfied machine. I'm still able to reach local   sites and on my non proxyfied box everything works fine. Both machines   are XP professional SP3 with all patches applied.  When using the --proxy-server argument everything works fine on the   proxyfied box. Logs for several test cases attached.
