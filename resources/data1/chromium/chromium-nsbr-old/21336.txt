<title>Issue 21336 -   chromium -    Linux/NSS only: an unauthorized OCSP response makes Chromium to report the certificate as revoked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To reproduce the problem:  1. Go to <a href="http://www.medicover.com/plpl/152 Strona-glowna.htm">http://www.medicover.com/plpl/152 Strona-glowna.htm</a>  2. Click the orange box on the right of the page that says  &quot;MEDICOVER on line.  Zaloguj sie!&quot;    Chromium incorrectly reports the certificate as revoked  which  causes Chromium to crash because of another bug.    I found that NSS thinks the OCSP responder is not authorized  to provide OCSP responses for this certificate.  I haven't  verified that  but let's assume that's true.  Then  because of  that  NSS considers the certificate revoked.  That's too  strict.  I think NSS should treat an unauthorized OSCP response  as if there were no OCSP response.    I filed an NSS bug upstream and submitted a patch:  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515279">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515279</a>    I'm afraid that we can't work around this NSS bug  so we'll  need to ask Ubuntu  etc. to patch their NSS packages. </pre>
