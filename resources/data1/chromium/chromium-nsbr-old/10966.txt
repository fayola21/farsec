<title>Issue 10966 -   chromium -    Use AutocompletePopupPositioner to position the Omnibox results popup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we size based on the location edit  and then add some numbers to  make things look ok.  Really the toolbar should implement the  AutocompletePopupPosition interface (since it knows where the star  edit   and go buttons are)  and then this needs to be plumbed through the location  bar  edit  and popup. </pre>
