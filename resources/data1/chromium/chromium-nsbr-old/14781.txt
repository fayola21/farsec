<title>Issue 14781 -   chromium -    Session restore  single tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This applies only when the &quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot; option is   selected.    When closing a window with one tab in it  that should be treated as a session   to restore.  When closing the last tab on a window  it should not be treated   as no session to restore  and the next launch should take the user to the   'new tab' page.  As it stands  either way is treated as a session to restore. </pre>
