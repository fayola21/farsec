<title>Issue 6569 -   chromium -    The password manager ignores MySpace  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;2.0.157.2&gt;  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.myspace.com">http://www.myspace.com</a>  Other browsers tested: YES         Safari 3:OK      Firefox 3:OK           IE 7:OK      1. Have the login data for MySpace stored in password manager  2. Open the central page of MySpace        The Password manager should enter my email and password in the appropriate   fields (the data IS availlable in the manager)      In previous versions (up until 2.0.157.0) the email was remembered by the   page and clicking in the password field would &quot;force&quot; the manager to enter   the password. Since 2.0.157.0 The password has to be entered manually  and   no offer to remember it is made.       </pre>
