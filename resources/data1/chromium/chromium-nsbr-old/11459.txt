<title>Issue 11459 -   chromium -    Sky.com programming guide looks wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Go to <a href="http://www.sky.com/epg/release/current/sky.htm">http://www.sky.com/epg/release/current/sky.htm</a>  2.  The boxes look wrong  the channels look to be unordered  some don't   have text  and the shading looks misaligned (see screenshot)    This reproduces in all versions of Chrome  even when spoofing the user-  agent string as Safari  IE  and Firefox.      It looks correct in all other browsers  including Safari 4.       </pre>
