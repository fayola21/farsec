<title>Issue 18016 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/canvas/image-pattern-rotate.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test started failing in the WebKit merge between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46369">r46369</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46426">r46426</a>.  It   looks like it's a new test.  I can't understand the bug well enough to know   whether Chromium's current behavior on trunk (after the merge) is correct --   it looks the same to me as my Dev channel build from before the merge.    (Maybe the commit only affected Safari?)    Shinichiro  if you can either determine that the behavior is correct and add   Windows and Linux baselines  or else morph this to be about fixing anything   wrong on the Chromium side  that'd be great. </pre>
