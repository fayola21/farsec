<title>Issue 20681 -   chromium -    Appropriate use of scroll-lock? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL    When Scroll-Lock is turned on  then single objects on the page should be   ignored  for the sake of page scrolling with U-D-L-R arrow keys.  even when inside a textbox...    Try Microsoft (yuc!) Excel for example  when the ScrollLock is turned on    the arrow keys do not travel between cells  but scroll the whole page.  This could be very useful for reading pages  or scanning for something. </pre>
