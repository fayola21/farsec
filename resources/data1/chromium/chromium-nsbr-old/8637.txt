<title>Issue 8637 -   chromium -    Unable to drag window when one browser window open with single tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.170.0 (Developer Build 11328)    REGRESSION of 7861? This may be different  though  because it involves  window dragging  not tab dragging.  Regression happened between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11113">r11113</a> and 11328.        1. Open a Chrome browser window with only 1 tab.  2. Try to click on the tab and drag the window.    MUST have only 1 Chrome browser window with 1 tab open. If there are 2 or  more browser windows open  tab dragging is enabled.    What is the expected output?     Should be able to drag the window.    What do you see instead?    Dragging the window is disabled.     </pre>
