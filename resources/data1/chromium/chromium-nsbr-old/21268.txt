<title>Issue 21268 -   chromium -    Large SSL writes fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Open the weekly dev release notes doc  2. Make some changes  3. Hit the &quot;Save&quot; button in the top right        Saving should succeed.        The document stays in &quot;Saving��_��__&quot; for a while and then says &quot;Saving didn't   work because of network problems&quot;. It always works just fine in Safari.   Sometimes it even works in Chrome  but most of the time it doesn't.    Probably a problem with our custom http stack? </pre>
