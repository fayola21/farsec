<title>Issue 19374 -   chromium -    Add support for reading preferences from registry as well as Preferences file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Preferences are currently read only from the Preferences file in the user's   data directory.  This works fine  but won't always work when the user does   not have write access to their data directory  or need to have preferences   set via the registry.    We should add the ability to read preferences from the registry  set at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesGoogleChrome  (or the appropriate   location for that setting.)    If the preference is set in the registry  then that preference should be used   over a preference set in the Preferences file.   </pre>
