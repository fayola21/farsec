<title>Issue 22691 -   chromium -    download warning text is not localized for all plural formats - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have IDS_SINGLE_DOWNLOAD_REMOVE_CONFIRM_WARNING and   IDS_MULTIPLE_DOWNLOADS_REMOVE_CONFIRM_WARNING.  This doesn't work in all   languages due to complex plural rules.    See the code in chrome/common/time_format.* for how we handle different   plural formats for times.  generated_resources.grd has examples of how to   format the strings for translation (e.g.  IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SEC_SINGULAR    IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_TWO   IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_FEW    IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_MANY).    See also <a title="recently closed tabs text is not localized for all plural formats "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21407">issue 21407</a> which is the same bug for recently closed tabs. </pre>
