<title>Issue 6817 -   chromium -    Find box should dismiss on blur - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a somewhat long discussion internally &lt;b/1088399&gt; about why we   should do this. I have a number of bugs to go through so I don't feel like   sorting the wheat from the chaff and summarizing that discussion (beyond   noting this will fix a number of bugs).    </pre>
