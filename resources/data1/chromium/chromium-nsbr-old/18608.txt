<title>Issue 18608 -   chromium -    64bit flash plugin does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. place libflahsplayer.so in plugins directory  2. start chrmoe with --enable-plugins  3. all flash sites state I need the latest flash plugin..  I cannot (don't   want to) try with the 32-bit plugin as it installs all kinds of other 32-  bit dependencies that make my default firefox much slower...    Thanks                <b>Please provide
