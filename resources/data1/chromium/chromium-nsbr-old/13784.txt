<title>Issue 13784 -   chromium -    Find-in-page option for inspector should be disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the options of inspector  select find in page. This will bring up find-  in-page box. Searching in it doesn't work.     I think we should either disable it or make it point to the search box of   inspector    Chromium 3.0.188.0 (Developer Build 18069) </pre>
