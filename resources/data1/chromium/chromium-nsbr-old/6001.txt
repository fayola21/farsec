<title>Issue 6001 -   chromium -    HTML tables should have a specific context-menu to allow opertions like sorting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all versions  URLs (if applicable) : NA        1. Navigate to any page with tabular data  for example a sales report  2. Right click on the table        Most websites now only use HTML tables for tabular data. It would be nice   to have new items in the context menu when we right click on a table  such   as:    - &quot;Sort by &lt;header name&gt;&quot; when clicking on a column  which would reorder   the rows accordingly.  - &quot;Copy all table to clipboard&quot;  because selecting a table is sometimes   tricky.    Even on the occasional website with a table-layout  the extra context menu   can simply be ignored  and will not distub the user.          The standard context-menu appears. It doesn't contain anything specific to   tabular data. We have to copy the table manually and paste it into a   spreadsheet to do basic operations such as sorting.     </pre>
