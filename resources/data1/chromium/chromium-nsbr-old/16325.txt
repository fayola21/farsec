<title>Issue 16325 -   chromium -    excessive memory usage on searchengineland.com left running overnight - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I left my browser running overnight with a few tabs open  one of them was   here:  <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-operating-system-google-chrome-os-22077">http://searchengineland.com/google-operating-system-google-chrome-os-22077</a>    When I checked this morning  this tab was using 720k of private bytes   (although it's only reporting 110K of memory in the task manager (working   set).    A few extra data points:  - the page seems to be consuming a consistent (but small) amount of CPU  - when I launch the page from scratch  its memory starts at ~50MB and then   starts growing continuously  adding ~1MB every 5-6 seconds.  In two runs    it seemed to stop growing after a few minutes  once stopping at ~75MB  the   next time stopping at ~99MB.  After another few minutes  the memory growth   started again at the same rate as before.  I didn't see this restarting   memory growth with my original 720MB page.  It seemed to be capped there.  - when I open the web inspector  memory growth stops immediately (at least   for a short time).  I only repeated this twice and didn't wait very long to   see if memory growth restarted  so I don't know if it's 100%.    This repros with current dev release (192) as well as tip of tree.   </pre>
