<title>Issue 20228 -   chromium -    Dragging tabs fails when a window is minimized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23795">r23795</a>  OS + version         : Ubuntu 8.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager       : Gnome  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): NA  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not sure      1. Open two windows  let's say windows A and B  with several tabs each  and   at least 5 in window A.  2. Drag a tab in window A to reorder them  reorder in window B  tear and   drag a tab from window A to window B  3. Minimize window B  4. Drag a tab to reorder in window A  5. Tear a tab from window A to a new window C  6. Tear and drag a tab from window A to window C  7. Restore (un-minimize) window B  8. Pin all of window C tabs and move them back to A  9. Pin any tabs torn and moved from A to B back to window A.        At the end  window B will be minimized  window A will have all but 2 of its   original tabs but reordered  and window C will have two tabs.        Step 2 works fine.    Starting with step 4 and after window B was minimized  any tab movement   (tearing or reordering) results in the tab immediately being torn to a new   window. Step 4 will create a new window and the tab cannot be re-pinned.   Step 5 will result in yet another window. Step 6  you guessed it  will   create a new window.    After step 7  with window B un-minimized  tab tearing and sorting works   again. Steps 8 and 9 should behave as expected.   </pre>
