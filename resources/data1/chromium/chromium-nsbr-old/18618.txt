<title>Issue 18618 -   chromium -    loading forever in one tab and instantly in another - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0.    It's quite old problem.    From time to time (often enough to be annoying)  when I type the address in   omnibox and &quot;enter&quot;  it loads the site forever. It shows that it's   &quot;loading&quot; (circle spins)  but shows nothing  not even a title of a site.   Seems like it might be stuck in DNS or something. If I type another URL in   the same tab it will be stuck in the same way.    But if I close this tab  press Ctrl+N and type the same URL in a new window   - the site opens fast  as usual.    Happens on both Win and Linux for me. </pre>
