<title>Issue 21518 -   chromium -    Remove locks from StrictTransportSecurityState - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We shouldn't need the lock in the STS state any more.  All the accesses should be on the IO thread.    There are two things we'll need to change to make this work:    1) Call the Clear method asynchronously via the MessageLoop instead of on the UI thread.  2) Serialize / Deserialize the state on the IO thread  passing just the string back and forth to the   FILE thread.    We should also add DCHECKs that we're always on the proper thread. </pre>
