<title>Issue 11779 -   chromium -    Introduce a separate &quot;settings&quot; API for extensions that works in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently extension are scoped to a profile. Their permanent state is per-  profile and at runtime they do not &quot;see&quot; browser state from other profiles.    This seems reasonable for regular profiles  but falls down in incognito mode.   Many extensions will have settings and the extensions may not work without   these settings. So these extensions when run in incognito mode will not work.   Also  settings changes made in incognito mode should probably apply to normal   mode.    A good solution would be to introduce a separate &quot;settings&quot; API. This would   be exactly the same as the HTML5 storage API  except that it would be shared   with the normal profile. </pre>
