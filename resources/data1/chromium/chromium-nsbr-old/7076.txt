<title>Issue 7076 -   chromium -    Unhelpful Error 105 page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0           Safari 3:OK      Firefox 3:OK           IE 7:FAIL      1. Go to URL that causes Error 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED) e.g. a   random long domain name      The browser should be able to tell the name of the requested domain  for   example firefox and safari both name the domain requested as the problem   responsible  and safari offers a search bar autofilled with the name of the   domain.      Chrome's message is &quot;The web page at null might be temporarily down or it   may have moved permanently to a new web address.&quot; which does not name the   domain and is potentially confusing.  It offers no course of action other   than refreshing the page  where it would be more helpful to suggest that a   spelling error may have been responsible - by displaying what was actually   requested by the user.   </pre>
