<title>Issue 20906 -   chromium -    Need script to check pngs match their checksums - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a test passes with the text and checksum expectations  the png is never   checked  so these errors go undetected.    See <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/100128">http://codereview.chromium.org/100128</a> as an example of how bad png's can   get checked in  where webkit/data/layout_tests/platform/chromium-  win/LayoutTests/editing/deleting/delete-br-013-expected.png and   webkit/data/layout_tests/platform/chromium-  win/LayoutTests/editing/pasteboard/paste-blockquote-after-blockquote-  expected.png are the same image.    We need a script to check for these situations that we can run periodically. </pre>
