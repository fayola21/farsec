Open enough tabs to make them resize  2. Close the first few or a few in the middle  observing that the tabs stay   the same size to make them easier to close in sequence  3. Move the mouse off of the tab bar    Expected: The tabs should resize to fill the area or to become their   maximum size  as they do on Windows    Result: The tabs stay small until a new tab is opened or the window is   resized </pre>
