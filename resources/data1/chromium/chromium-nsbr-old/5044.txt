<title>Issue 5044 -   chromium -    Need to do something about generated_resources.grd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Several files in chrome/common rely on generated_resources.h  which is  generated from chrome/app/generated_resources.grd. Currently we have no  mechanism for turning grd files into headers. The other place we've  encountered this  we added a bogus  hard-coded string file.    The files we're excluding at this moment because of this roadblock are:     - chrome/common/pref_service.cc   - chrome/common/time_format.cc    but there are probably others. What should we do here? </pre>
