<title>Issue 22704 -   chromium -    Screwed up caption drawing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I found what seem to be consistent repro steps for the old &quot;native caption   buttons drawn atop the opaque frame&quot; bug.    On my dual-portrait-monitor Vista box  if I:  * Ensure I'm using a Classic theme (e.g. &quot;Windows Standard&quot;)   * Start Chrome up as a restored window   * Double-click the titlebar to maximize it   * Grab a different app's window on the other monitor and drag it partly over   the Chrome window and then back off   * And double click the titlebar to restore Chrome   ...then subsequent clicks (and sometimes hovers) in the titlebar region cause   the glitchy drawing to occur. </pre>
