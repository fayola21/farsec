<title>Issue 15973 -   chromium -    Import settings from other Moz browser locations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0~svn20090703r19907  OS + version : Ubuntu / Karmic      Today  under linux  it's possible to import bookmarks from Firefox.  This only targets the canonical ~/.mozilla/firefox directory.    I would be nice to have a system to import from other locations.  Something that downstream could use to allow users to import from other   sources  such as seamonkey  fennec  flock  or distro-specific locations such   as ~/.mozilla/firefox-{3.0 3.5 3.6} on Ubuntu. </pre>
