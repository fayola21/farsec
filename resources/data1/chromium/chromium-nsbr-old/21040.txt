<title>Issue 21040 -   chromium -    Mock media filters should use mocked media_format() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I manually implemented media_format() instead of mocking it:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/155316">http://codereview.chromium.org/155316</a>    Reason being ::testing::Return() doesn't work when returning references.    However I recently learned about ReturnRef()  which does work when returning   references.    We can now revert this patch and fix up the tests to use ReturnRef().  A   great way for anyone to learn googlemock if they're interested :) </pre>
