<title>Issue 2406 -   chromium -    Feature: Add all addresses from all of the protocols to about:network - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Only HTTP requests are logged as far as I can see.  Is there a way to log all of the request  to all of the protocols  made by   Chrome or its plug-ins?  This will be useful for developers  at least and generally  the logs should be   extended to support that  too.      Thank you. </pre>
