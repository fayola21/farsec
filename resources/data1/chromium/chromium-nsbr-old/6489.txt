<title>Issue 6489 -   chromium -    Multthreaded use of Channel::ChannelImpl::ChannelImpl() (designed only for one thread to use) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   This problem appeared on the build-bot.    1. Run CacheTest.Cache (as done by automated tree testing)  2. DCHECK sometimes fails in histogram code  suggesting constructor of   static initializer was run on multiple threads (contrary to design).     What is the expected output?     Test should pass.  Ricardo told me that the code that creates the   &quot;AsyncIO.IPCChannelClose&quot; histogram should only be called on exactly one   thread.    What do you see instead?    [ RUN      ] CacheTest.Cache  .ui_test.cc(154): error: Value of: assertions.size()    Actual: 2  Expected: expected_errors_  Which is: 0  The following error(s) occurred in the application during this test:    [4044:2660:116967109:FATAL:histogram.cc(557)] Check failed: histograms_-  &gt;end() == histograms_-&gt;find(name). AsyncIO.IPCChannelClose is already   registered as a histogram.  Only one histogram may be registered with a   given name.
