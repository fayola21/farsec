<title>Issue 8887 -   chromium -    Total size of paused download shown as 0 on Download shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.170.0 (Developer Build 11729)        1. Start downloading a file (preferably a really large one).  2. Click on &quot;Show all downloads&quot; on the Download shelf.  3. From the Downloads page  pause the download in progress.     What is the expected output?    Progress indicator on download shelf should read &quot;xxx/yyy K&quot;  where &quot;yyy&quot;  is the total size of the file to download.  Also  the units should be probably be displayed in Kbytes.    What do you see instead?    Progress indicator reads &quot;xxx/0 B&quot;. The total is shown as 0. See attached  picture.       </pre>
