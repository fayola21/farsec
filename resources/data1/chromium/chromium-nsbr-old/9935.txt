<title>Issue 9935 -   chromium -    [Regress ??] Double click on App shortcut favicon should close it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on DEV: 2.0.173.1 (Official Build 13271) and Trunk(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13423">r13423</a>).  I'm not sure either we regressed here or changed by design.    -Create a application short cut for any webpage.  -Double click on app's favicon.     Expected:  App window should be closed.    Result:  Drop down list shows up and closes.     </pre>
