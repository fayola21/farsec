<title>Issue 4042 -   chromium -    [magic_browzR] Windows title shows through on Title Bar when New Tab opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 4462)        1. Open 4 or 5 new tabs (it's easier to see if tabs fill the width of the  browser window).  2. Cover up the Chrome window with another window.  3. Uncover the Chrome window.  4. Click the '+' icon to open another new tab.    The problem is somewhat intermittent  so you may have to experiment with  trying the above steps in a different order.    What is the expected output?     Should not see page title from Windows title bar showing through.    What do you see instead?    Page title from MS Windows title bar shows through.      May be regression of 3246?   </pre>
