<title>Issue 10823 -   chromium -    Find-in-page beeps when switching tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.176.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14103">r14103</a>)        Precondition: have more than 1 tab open.    1. In one tab  type &quot;nomatch&quot; into find-in-page box.  Counter should show  &quot;0 of 0&quot;.  2. Switch to another tab.  3. Switch back to the first tab with find-in-page active.     What is the expected output?    No beep.    What do you see instead?    Beep.    Apparently  find-in-page doesn't save the search  but needs to run it again  each time.  Perhaps it could do so silently.   </pre>
