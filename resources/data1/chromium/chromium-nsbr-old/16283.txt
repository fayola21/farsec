<title>Issue 16283 -   chromium -    New windows appear off screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've seen this before but never so frequently. When I'm only using one   monitor for my laptop (when I'm at my desk I have an extended desktop to a   second monitor)  new chrome windows almost always open off screen. This has   been happening very frequently in 3.191 (and I think the dev version before   that). I'm not sure if I need to start chrome when I have a second monitor    then undock and open some windows to trigger this bug or not.     Opening an app from a application shortcut or creating the first browser   window when I only have app windows open seems to trigger this reliably for   me right now. </pre>
