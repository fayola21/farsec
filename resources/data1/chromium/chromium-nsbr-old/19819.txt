<title>Issue 19819 -   chromium -    Maximizing window always goes full-screen on second monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: google-chrome-unstable 3.0.198.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23116">r23116</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome 2.22.3          1. Open a new Chrome instance  2. Drag the window to the secondary monitor  3. Double-click the title bar or single-click the maximize button        The window should fill the screen  but the title/tab bar should be visible   at the top.        The window becomes full-screen.  Hitting F11 causes the title/tab bar and   URL bar to reappear.  Double clicking the title bar at this point causes   the window to restore to its original dimensions.    Note that maximizing the window works correctly on the primary display   (i.e.  the display with the Gnome docks). </pre>
