<title>Issue 19916 -   chromium -    FFMpeg crash on aac decoding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Play mp4 videos with aac tracks in the test matrix (done on linux)  2. clock around on a bunch of the videos  3. eventually  you might get an &quot;Aw Snap&quot;        The error message that was logged was:    [aac @ 0xb9ac2b0]Transition from an ONLY_LONG or LONG_STOP to an   EIGHT_SHORT sequence detected. If you heard an audible artifact  please   submit the sample to the FFmpeg developers.    Unfortunately  I don't know which video I clicked on to cause it to crash.   I think it might have been red2.mp4  but not sure.     </pre>
