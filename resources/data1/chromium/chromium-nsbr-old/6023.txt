<title>Issue 6023 -   chromium -    save-as for webpages and images should remember the save directory for the session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) go to google.com  2) right click on the google logo and use save-as  3) save the image to some other directory than the default directory  4) repeat step 2  5) at this point  it defaults to saving the image in the default download   directory again.  this seems wrong  it should remember the last directory   used so you can download lots of images to the same place.    we should only remember this directory for the session.    changing it while in incognito mode should not change it for the rest of   chrome. </pre>
