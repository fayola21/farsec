<title>Issue 22582 -   chromium -    Header doesn't blink &quot;_Name_ says:&quot; on new Gtalk IM if the cursor was left in that IM window  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Steps to reproduce:    - open IM window with anyone (person 1)  - open IM window with another person (person 2)  - leave cursor in the text entry field for person 1  - open a new tab and go to it  - have person 2 send an IM -&gt; the tab title blinks &quot;Person 2 says:&quot; as   expected  - clear the notification by visiting the chat window  then leave cursor in   text entry for person 1 again and switch tabs  - have person 1 send an IM -&gt; the tab title does NOT blink    so in other words  if the IM window with a particular person had focus   when the tab was switched  it seems that new IMs will not trigger tab title   blinking.         Tab title should blink upon receipt of new IM.        Tab title does not blink if the chat &quot;mole&quot; had focus.    <b>Please provide
