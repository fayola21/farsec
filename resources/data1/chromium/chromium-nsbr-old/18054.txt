Start a download  2. Cancel it  3. Go to the downloads tab  4. No way to restart it by clicking a link      Finished downloads have the option 'view in folder'  downloading downloads   have the option to 'pause' or to 'stop' them. I think cancelled downloads   should have the option to restart them.      You'll have to copy the url to the urlbar. </pre>
