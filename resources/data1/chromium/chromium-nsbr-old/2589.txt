<title>Issue 2589 -   chromium -    Box in box could not be shown full - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. do not know          The frame/box inside could show fully to the right (see:   IE8SmarterMail2.jpg) so we could see email subject inbox etc easily. With   Chrome frame show not quite wide  so it becomes difficult when the columns   are small  if we adjust the subject column  then the other colums could not   be seen.  Also it makes me difficult to edit/create new message.    Chrome okay with other webmail such as YahooMail and other webmail using   Horde.    Again I am using Windows XP.            Please provide
