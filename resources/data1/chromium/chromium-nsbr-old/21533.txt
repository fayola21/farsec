<title>Issue 21533 -   chromium -    Maximize/un-maximize is messed up ! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 3.0.195.19  Filing this after showing demo to Glen.  Not sure what happened suddenly  My browser window  started completely with  painting issues (title bar/tabs/window management controls/..etc) when  Browser window is maximized/un-maximized.    In case  If I spot the repro steps or any info  I will update the thread.  My profile can be found @   http://go/CrashDumps/User_Data.zip    PS: If I start Chrome with new profile  then I don't have any problems. </pre>
