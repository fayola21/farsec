<title>Issue 2409 -   chromium -    Unstable : img elements are not render stable if thier &quot;src&quot; attribute is setted dynamicly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is some web-based  application (enterprise-level  no public url) in   which bottons on UI got it's image dynamicaly throug javascript which   setups &quot;src&quot; attribute and changes it on distinct events.     Images are provided by standard &lt;IMG src='...'/&gt; construction (no as css   backgound).    Mozilla and IE 7 down it well.    Chrome works too but where is no stability - sometimes we catch [empty box]   for certain images somtimes for others  sumtimes for all.    So  F5 and Ctrl-F5 ends with different results.    JS is well-tested and works properly in all lines.     Sometimes application under GCh works totally fine .    Unstability in one word... </pre>
