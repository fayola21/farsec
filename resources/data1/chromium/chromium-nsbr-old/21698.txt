<title>Issue 21698 -   chromium -    Add option for opening link &quot;Open in duplicated tab&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (Official Build 25617) (Linux)        Firefox 3.x:With Extension    When right-clicking a link  I think there should be an option &quot;Open in   duplicated tab&quot;.  Perhaps there should be a mouse+keyboard shortcut as well   (not sure what it would be).  Optionally  there should be a setting in   options to make opening in a duplicated tab the default method of opening   links in new tab. </pre>
