<title>Issue 4399 -   chromium -    No write protection for HttpOnly cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9           Safari 3: FAIL (does not even have httponly read protection)      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Get a httponly cookie from a server  2. Try overwrite that cookie from javascript  3. Observe whether the overwrite happened        httponly cookie remains unmodified        httponly cookie gets overwritten    Additional information:    This behavior is underspecified  standards-wise.  Should javascript be able to set a httponly cookie? But then no be able to   read or rewrite it? Or does it only apply to cookies set by HTTP?    That said  other major browser implement write protection. </pre>
