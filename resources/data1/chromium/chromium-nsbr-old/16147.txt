<title>Issue 16147 -   chromium -    Rapid navigation between two bookmarks can cause tab to close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I found this bug when tracking down crbug.com/16052. It is similar  but of   a different (but related) root issue.    Steps to reproduce:    1. Create two booksmarks on the bookmark bar: yahoo.com  cnn.com.  2. Click rapidly between the two bookmarks with only one tab open.  3. Sooner or later the tab &amp; browser will close.    Again  I believe this is a race condition where messages between the   RenderViewHostManager and RenderView are getting interleaved with external   navigate events from clicks which results in a RVHM arriving in a state   where it receives a ClosePage_ACK  but the pending_render_view_host_ has   been cancelled but a subsequent navigation.    See crbug.com/16052 for a detailed explaination of what (I think) is going   on.   </pre>
