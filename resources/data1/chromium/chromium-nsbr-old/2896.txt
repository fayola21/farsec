<title>Issue 2896 -   chromium -    Online Form Filling- Data entry error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit the above mentioned link  2. Try to enter numbers in the fields &quot;MTNL Telephone number&quot; and &quot;C/A  number&quot;. The first field is of length 8 and the second one is of length 10  3. Instead of entering the numbers in the field  it keeps reentering the  number in the same position.    For example  if I enter &quot;25513337&quot; in the &quot;MTNL telephone number&quot;  there is  only a single number entry (i.e the last entered digit)    4. This works fine with other browsers        I should be able to enter a &quot;8&quot; digit number in the field &quot;MTNL Telephone  Number&quot; and &quot;10&quot; digit number in the &quot;C/A number&quot;          I am able to enter only a single digit (which keeps on overwriting at the  same digit position) in both the above mentioned fields.    Please provide
