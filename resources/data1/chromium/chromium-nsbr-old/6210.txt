<title>Issue 6210 -   chromium -    Seems to not support CSS3 rule border-radius.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.betatoys.com">http://www.betatoys.com</a>           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Just go to any site using border-radius.  2. Betatoys.com also uses an image hack to create rounded (styled) corners   so it would appear that corners of the tabs are styled but I would like to   remove image hack and simply rely on the web standard solution.    What is the expected result? border-radius is honored.  What happens instead? border-radius is not honored.     </pre>
