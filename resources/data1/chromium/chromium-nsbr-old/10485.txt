<title>Issue 10485 -   chromium -    Tab resize layout animation occurrs too quickly after closing a tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In Linux  open enough tabs so that the tabs are resized to fit the tab   strip.  2. Close one of the tabs using the mouse.        On Windows  the tabs don't resize until the mouse leaves the tab strip area.    On Linux  the resize happens immediately after the tab is closed. </pre>
