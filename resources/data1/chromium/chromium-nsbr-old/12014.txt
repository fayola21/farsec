<title>Issue 12014 -   chromium -    [Mac] Resizing window to less than zero width is (a) possible and (b) a way to trigger CRAZY behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STEPS TO REPRODUCE   1. Resize a Chromium window to narrower and narrower width until it   disappears  then without letting go drag it back to a normal size.    EXPECTED RESULTS  While dragging  there should be a minimum size. After dragging  it should be   back to where it was before  as if nothing happened.    ACTUAL RESULTS  The window goes to less than zero width  teleports to another location on the   screen  and the UI falls apart in a spectacular way. </pre>
