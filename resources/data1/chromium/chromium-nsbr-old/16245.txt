<title>Issue 16245 -   chromium -    Make the malware interstitial less obstrusive in cases where we can block sub-resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the malware interstitial may be triggered for content loaded into   sites from 3rd party domains. In these cases (say  dodgy ads) it may be   preferable to show an info-bar notifying the user that we've blocked some   suspect content from loading (and perhaps giving them the opportunity to   load it). Until the user has made a decision  suspect content should be   prevented from loading. </pre>
