<title>Issue 11283 -   chromium -    While dragging a tab back into a browser by right clicking  hides the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chromium Browser  2. Load two websites ( <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a> )  3. Drag out cnn.com to another browser window. (now we have two windows)  4. Pop cnn.com  back to the google.com window  but right click it to drop   it.  5. Window disappears  but the browser thinks there is a spot in the tab   strip.  6. Notice it the window still resides in the task bar.   7. Close the invisible tab  it is still hidden in the task bar. Cannot   close that window. Unless we &quot;end task&quot; chromium.      Either dispose the right click event when popping window in while dragging    or do it correctly  by placing it on the tabstrip not hidden.    <b>Please provide
