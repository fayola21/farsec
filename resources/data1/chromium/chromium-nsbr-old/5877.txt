<title>Issue 5877 -   chromium -    FEATURE: Need a command for Reload All Tabs / Refresh All Tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have many tabs open all the time and constantly have to refresh all tabs   individually.  It would be such a nice addition to the usability of Chrome to   have the ability to Reload All Tabs in one command.    This can be accomplished by:    (1) adding a &quot;Reload All Tabs&quot; to the tab context menu  and    (2) binding a new keyboard shortcut for this command.    Since this has to do with refreshing  there have been proposals for the   keyboard shortcut to be Shift+F5 or Ctrl+F5.  According to    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95743">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95743</a>  Chrome's current keyboard shortcut for a &quot;hard refresh&quot; or refresh ignoring   cached content is BOTH Ctrl+F5 and Shift+F5.    My preliminary search seems to turn up more references to Ctrl+F5 as the   shortcut for refresh ignoring cache:     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard+reload+ignoring+cache">http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard+reload+ignoring+cache</a>     and Ctrl+F5 is the shortcut for refresh ignoring cache for both Firefox and IE.     <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Keyboard+shortcuts">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Keyboard+shortcuts</a>     <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/quickref.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/quickref.mspx</a>     I propose re-purposing Shift+F5 to be &quot;Reload all Tabs&quot;.  As well  this matches   the current &quot;Reload all tabs&quot; shortcut for Konqueror and Maxthon browsers. </pre>
