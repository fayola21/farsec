<title>Issue 20406 -   chromium -    icu data size reduction : remove Unihan collation tables and some other entries from the ICU data file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ICU 4.2 has separate UniHan collation tables for zh  ja and ko. They're not   only redundant (they're almost identical) but also all but useless because   they're only invoked with '@collation=UniHan' tailoring  which I know for   sure we never do in Chrome/Webkit.     So  we have to rebuild the ICU data after removing unihan tables from   coll/{zh ko ja}.txt.     In addition  we don't use currency names at all. So  we can remove them from   all the locale files.     This will be done after initial DEPS switch for ICU.    </pre>
