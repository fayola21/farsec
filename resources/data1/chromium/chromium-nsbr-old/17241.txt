<title>Issue 17241 -   chromium -    cpu spin and browser becomes unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 3.0.193.0    visit <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/07/16/ie6-must-die/">http://mashable.com/2009/07/16/ie6-must-die/</a>    The page eats 50% (one core) of my CPU and the whole browser becomes   unresponsive. Looks like both a JS and plug-in problem.    Don't know if the timer thing got clobbered again or if it is something new.   Oh the irony. </pre>
