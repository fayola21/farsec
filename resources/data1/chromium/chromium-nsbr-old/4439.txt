<title>Issue 4439 -   chromium -    Can't click on  thumbnails (Most Visited)  if two new tabs are opened. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.19 (Official)  This is happening for me since yesterday  but today  I got the repro steps  finally.      1. Make sure you set [New Tab] as your home page.  2. Launch Chrome.  3. Create one more [New Tab] - Ctrl+t  4. In the 1st new tab  click on a thumbnail (Most Visited section)      What is the expected output?  Should be navigate to the page.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.    Not sure  when it is broken.   BUT works fine in 154.0 Official build.         </pre>
