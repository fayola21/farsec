<title>Issue 16268 -   chromium -    Cannot lock the new New Tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1      1. Install the latest dev build. Attempt to lock the page to prevent   accidental movement of the thumbnails and to get rid of the blue border on   mouseover.      A 'Remove thumbnails' link like on the old New Tab page and a Cancel button   to undo all changes.      No go.   </pre>
