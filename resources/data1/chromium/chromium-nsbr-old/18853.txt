<title>Issue 18853 -   chromium -    padding   boder and width in css - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.6 and all other versions    Other browsers tested: IE 7   IE8                 IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1. this is about css when making a div and make style for it   2. if i set {width:100px; height:100px; padding:10px;}   3. this will cause the div width to be 120px and height to be 120px in the browser   because it will add 10px padding from each side  4. if i set {border:1px sold #000000; width:100px;} this will cause the width to be   102 in real shape   5. the only way to avoid this is to make to div's and set the first div width to   100px and the inner one(the 2nd) will set the padding   margin and border  6. in IE i don't have to do all this   7. the border  padding must be calculated form the whole width or hight no to be   added to it   8. even when i set max-height and max-width the problem is the same        i know if i own a 100m of land area and i'd lik to put some thing in it with padding   20m .... i shouldn't put this thing in the whole 100m area then make 20m from the   outer area to be it's padding  and the same for the border i should make a border   inside my area not around the 100m ....by this i'll take a small area of my neighbors   area    i hope you under stand my view   i don't know if this is w3.org standers or not but it should be </pre>
