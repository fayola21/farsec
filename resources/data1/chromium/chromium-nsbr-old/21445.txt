<title>Issue 21445 -   chromium -    Google Desktop Enterprise link to open Lotus Notes appears like a download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have Google Desktop Enterprise installed and have Lotus Notes search   component installed.  2. Search for emails in Google Desktop with Chrome 4.0.206.1 as standard   browser.  3. Open one of the email search result  click on link &quot;Open in Lotus   Notes&quot;.  4. In stable version of Chrome  the link will open Lotus Notes and show the   message. In this version  although the link will still open Lotus Notes and   show the message  there will also be a download entry created and a 0-byte   &quot;action&quot; file will be downloaded into the download folder. I bet it is a   MIME setting issue (either in GDS or Chrome when handling that MIME type).                <b>Please provide
