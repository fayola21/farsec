<title>Issue 20911 -   chromium -    Running UI tests in parallel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running UI test in parallel will speed up the test in multi-core machines. I   have done the following:  - Adding command line switches in ui_tests to utilize sharding mechanism   provided by gtest.  - Modify smoke_test.py to launch multiple instances of ui_tests with the   command line switches.    What remains is fixing the flakiness due to multiple ui_tests instances   connecting http server.    </pre>
