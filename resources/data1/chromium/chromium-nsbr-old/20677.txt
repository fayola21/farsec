<title>Issue 20677 -   chromium -    &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot; disappearing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.

It seems this happens after some time of surfing over   the net  I was not able to know what event was indefinitely reproducing   this problem.      When clicking on the wrench  the &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot; option should   always be visible.      Sometimes  this option just disappears. Every other menu item is still   there (see attached screenshot)  but &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot; is just gone.    <b>Please provide
