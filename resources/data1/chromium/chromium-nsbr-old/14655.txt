When confirming delivery in Taobao  inputing alipay username and password  (using the taobao edit plugin)  the server always tells me the password is  incorrect.    What is the expected result?  We can successfully confirm delivery.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Login to taobao.  2. Select something to buy and pay for it. This step is successful if you  installed the taobao edit control plugin.  3. After you receive the article you bought (for testing  you can do this  just after you buy the article)  try to confirm the delivery. Input alipay  username and password. The server always tells you the password is incorrect.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  IE 6/7/8 OK.  Firefox 3 OK.    Please provide any additional information below. </pre>
