<title>Issue 18074 -   chromium -    INGDIRECT.COM: 'void check' not displaying correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Log into INGDIRECT.COM.  2. Go to your &quot;Electric Orange&quot; account  3. Click &quot;Account Maintenance&quot;  4. Click &quot;so here's a way you can print one&quot; under &quot;Voided check&quot;  5. A new window will pop up showing the check you can print. However  the   layout is very messed up. The large word &quot;VOID&quot; is supposed to be on top of   the check image but is right above it.    This works perfectly fine in Firefox 3.5    My version information:  Chromium	3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 21978)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.196.0 Safari/532.0 </pre>
