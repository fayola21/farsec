<title>Issue 11366 -   chromium -    Back history broken with Yahoo photo gallery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Start here:  <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/teams/dal/photos;_ylt=Amj8_XTBSB3bTow2uKJR631Du">http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/teams/dal/photos;_ylt=Amj8_XTBSB3bTow2uKJR631Du</a>  bYF  This should be a gallery with 43 pictures in it  on picture 1 of 43.     2. Near the top of the page  there are controls to advance through the   pictures. Click [&gt;] to go to picture 2 and then to picture 3.    3. Click the _browser_ back button. It goes back to picture 2  as expected.    4. Click the browser back button again. Instead of going back to picture 1    it either reloads picture 2 or goes to picture 3.     Repeat step 4 several times. Click and hold the browser back button and   notice that every time you click Back  you're adding an entry to the back   history.    OTHER BROWSERS:    Safari 4 has the same issue  but I haven't tried with a WebKit nightly.    Firefox 3 works fine.    VERSIONS AFFECTED:    2.0.172.15 (Official Build )    2.0.178.0 (Developer Build 15144) </pre>
