Chrome behaved inconsistently.    At first  Chrome displays javascript code instead of running it. I   reproduced this several times. So I wrote this bug report. I tried it on   IE7 and FF3 also.    Then I tried to reproduce the bug in Chrome again. But now it run the   javascript and shows a message saying that the site does not support   browsers except IE.      What is the expected result?    Run the javascript. And support Banking login.        What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://www.kbstar.com">http://www.kbstar.com</a>  2.
