<title>Issue 15740 -   chromium -    RFE: send link by e-mail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4                  I hope it is OK to file a change request on this issue tracker? (there is   no template for that)    I miss a quick way to send the current page link by e-mail - usually   browsers feature a popup menu &quot;Send link by mail...&quot; or similar.  This would be very useful in Chrome  too  and save me from manually   copying&amp;pasting URLs.   </pre>
