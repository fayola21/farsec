<title>Issue 16344 -   chromium -    Enable user scripts by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now --enable-user-scripts is off by default. We should turn it on by   default.    The reason we never did this before was that we weren't sure how the user   scripts feature should relate to extensions. Here are my current thoughts on   this:    * User scripts remain a power user feature.  * There's no UI for user scripts: you need to copy a file in to the right place   to install them  * We don't aggressively advertise the user script feature  instead directing   &quot;real&quot; projects meant for large redistribution to the extensions feature.    Still  basic Greasemonkey-style user scripts are an extremely useful power-user   feature and I think it would be good to finalize it. </pre>
