<title>Issue 7937 -   chromium -    Provide launcher icons in various sizes and png - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : any upcoming Linux version          Firefox 3: OK    Chromium does only provide a 48x48 version of the icon in   src/chrome/app/theme/chromium/chromium.ico    The .ico file format is not supported by GNOME and KDE so for launchers we   will need separate .png files of the logo in various sizes. The FreeDesktop   icon spec asks for the following sizes:    - 16x16  - 22x22  - 24x24 (which is 22x22 with a 1px border)  - 32x32  - 48x48 (ideally availabe in scalable SVG format)  - 256x256    Note that this affects both Chromium and Chrome. Chrome at least has a   multi-res .ico file which contains most of the needed sizes. </pre>
