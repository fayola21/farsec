<title>Issue 7203 -   chromium -    Chrome redirects to a adult &amp; other phishing websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.3.154.43  URLs (if applicable) : www.manoramaonline.com           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    I saw somebody else was already reported this issue before. Actually me too   experience the same problem; Chrome redirects to a strange websites. This   happened when I was accessing a popular portal www.manoramaonline.com. The   strange thing is it is not happening always. But it will happen at least 50:50. Few seconds after the website loaded then Chrome redirect the page   to various adult / phishing websites. I contacted the website support team   and they said problem with my computer. But only Chrome has this problem   and other browsers (IE  Firefox  Safari) works well with.     Any patch exists ?     </pre>
