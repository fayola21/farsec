<title>Issue 18023 -   chromium -    linux chrome is missing the 1px client edge on the sides and bottom of web contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Windows has a 1 px border (kClientEdgeThickness) that gets applied around   the toolbar and web contents.  Our shadow is supposed to get drawn over this   extra pixel of border.  We're currently not drawing this on Linux.    Would be nice polish to add this to Linux.    We should probably have this drawn by the code that draws the shadow so it   can do the right layering.  I imagine it would be sufficient to add an   alignment around the contents_vbox (or maybe give it a padding?) that   provides the space for the extra pixel and just have the existing   DrawContentsShadow draw the white border. </pre>
