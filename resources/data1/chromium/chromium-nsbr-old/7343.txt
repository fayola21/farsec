<title>Issue 7343 -   chromium -    Better translation for the word &quot;application&quot; since Chinese will not understand a website can be used as an application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   zh-tw    2.0.159.0    Windows Vista Ultimate Service Pack 1    &quot;��__��_��__��__��_��_��_��_��__��__��_��_��__��_&quot; in the top right left hand side menu button.  [What should be appeared instead and explanation.]  It should be appeared as &quot;��__��_�ʍ_____��___��_��_��__��_��_��__��_&quot; or &quot;��__��_�ʍ___��_��__��_��_��__��_&quot;.  Since  &quot;��______��___��_��_��_&quot; = &quot;Internet&quot;   &quot;��____��_��_&quot; = &quot;Webpage&quot; while  &quot;_��__��_��_��_��_��__��_&quot; = &quot;Application or binary file&quot;  Therefore it should not be appeared as &quot;��__��_��__��__��_��_��_��_��__��__��_��_��__��_&quot; since we are not   creating a application shortcut but creating a webpage shortcut.    In addition  &quot;��__��_��_&quot; = &quot;create&quot; and &quot;_��_��_��__��_&quot; = &quot;shortcut&quot;    btw  I still can't understand why in that mode  webpage is called as an   application. Because it it actually opening an website / webpage just in a   reference /cache / offline mode while it will be synchronized when the   computer goes online. I still can't see any special thing in that mode that   make it called as a appication. btw  There is no explanation for that mode   too unless you search for Google Gears.    At last  I can sure that no one will understand what an application (&quot;_��__��_��_��_��_  ��__��_&quot;) in Chinese world. Since they always refer application as offline   binary files instead of online application. They even don't know that an   website can be used as an application. </pre>
