<title>Issue 20410 -   chromium -    Have maximum image size for doing high quality resampling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a lot of heuristics for when to do high quality image resampling.    We should add a heuristic for very large images so we don't do high quality   resampling on them at all. Resampling these images can give very bad   behavior.
