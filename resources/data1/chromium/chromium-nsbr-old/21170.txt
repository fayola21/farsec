<title>Issue 21170 -   chromium -    Download progress disk looks amazingly ugly with dark themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Apply a dark theme such as   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_floralblue.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_floralblue.html</a>  2. Dowload something that is large enough so that you see the progress   disk        Expected: Should look decent. Actual: Looks really bad:   <a href="http://imgur.com/9Qzzi.png">http://imgur.com/9Qzzi.png</a>    The solution is probably not to make code changes but to change chrome/app/theme/download_progress_*.png to have more of the disk in   the alpha channel.        Glen  are you the themes guy? If not  assign to the themes guy or some UI   person.    Imho  themes can't be launched with this. </pre>
