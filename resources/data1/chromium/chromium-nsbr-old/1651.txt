<title>Issue 1651 -   chromium -    Removing selected downloads from the download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;0.2.149.29&gt;    Hi there     This is more of a suggestion than it is a bug. I would like to   recommendation regarding the download &quot;tabs&quot; or &quot;icons&quot; that appear at the   bottom of the browser after starting a download. After a few downloads    these become annoying  and you want them to disappear. At the moment  the   only option you have to dispose of these download icons is by closing the   entire download bar. My suggestion is to allow a right click on each of   these icons  which will bring up the menu that shows when you click on the   arrow next to the icon. This menu must include options such as &quot;remove   icon&quot; and the single most useful option that the firefox browser offers    &quot;open destination directory&quot;    The most important of the above mentioned is the option to right click on   these icons rather than taking the time to move the cursor over the arrow   and clicking on it. This could really save a lot of time.    Thanks to who ever reads my recommendation.    Kind Regards   Paul Nel      1.
