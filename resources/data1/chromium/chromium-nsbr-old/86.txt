<title>Issue 86 -   chromium -    joomla back-end doesn't work correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. use the administrator back-end of an joomla site.  2. write a new article and add an picture to your text  3. you're not happy with the parameters (like size  spacing etc.) you have   given to your picture and you want to change it.      You should click a link and a pop-up screen should appear where you can   change your settings      Nothing  you can't click the link so nothing happens. I think it's a   problem with JAVA.    Please provide
