<title>Issue 14079 -   chromium -    Upper-side taskbar BUG: X Y coordinates restored improperly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Move the windows taskbar to the upper-side of the screen  disable auto-  hide.  2. Close and reopen Chromium or Google Chrome several times.        The browser should be restored to it's last position. This bug usually   indicates that the application is using different functions to get and set   window's position. There are two variants of these functions: one variant   that gets/sets absolute screen coordinates  and the other gets/sets desktop   workspace coordinates - that's usually the screen area minus (-) the area   taken by the taskbar. If one variant is used to get and the other to set    the position is not restored properly eg. like in Chromium ;-)      Each time the browser is placed higher and higher  so the title bar will be   placed behind the taskbar and even outside of the screen! - as shown on the   screenshot.    <b>Please provide
