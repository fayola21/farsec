<title>Issue 18323 -   chromium -    Need more bits (64-bit Mac version) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 197.0 (Developer Build 22258)  OS version               : 10.6 build 10A421a  Behavior in Safari 4.x: Works as expected    Snow Leopard will be released in less than 2 months. I believe we should start testing a 64bit   version of Chrome so it can be ready when SL ships. </pre>
