<title>Issue 1077 -   chromium -    Second googleupdate.exe process created by Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Install Google Gears for Firefox without Chrome being installed  2. Install Chrome  3. Check Windows Task Manager      Only one googleupdate.exe process should be running.      Two googleupdate.exe processes are running (one as user &quot;SYSTEM&quot; and one   as user &quot;martin&quot;).      Furthermore  I am not sure whether it is a good idea to have an update   process running as a service in the first place.  Why not check when the   program is run? I personally don't like the various update processes of   various programs running on my system where this could simply be   implemented in a way like e.g. Firefox does this (update checking from   within the program). </pre>
