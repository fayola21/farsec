<title>Issue 13253 -   chromium -    In a two-item array only one of items is shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In a JS function I have an array containing two items. Debugger shows   &quot;length: 2&quot; for it  but only displays the second item (index 1). WebKit's   debugger shows both items.      1. Start debugging  stop on a breakpoint.  2. Inspect a two-item array.    Only the second item (index 1) is shown.   </pre>
