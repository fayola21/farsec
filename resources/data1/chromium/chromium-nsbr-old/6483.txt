<title>Issue 6483 -   chromium -    Save layout test results on mac too - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Like it's currently done for 4 builders there:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/layout_test_results/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/layout_test_results/</a>    The main issue is that they don't have 'win' in the names  I'll have to fix   that first  or maybe not. </pre>
