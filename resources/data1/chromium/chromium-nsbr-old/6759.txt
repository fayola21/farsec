<title>Issue 6759 -   chromium -    Clicking scrollbar in renderer should not change focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit a page with a scrollbar (e.g. news.google.com )  Put focus in the browser chrome somewhere (e.g. hit ctrl-f)  Now use the page scrollbar.  Notice focus is stolen from the browser.  This   breaks Windows conventions.    On its own this bug isn't that important  but it blocks dismissing the find   box on blur.      Notes:  In order to prevent that when clicking on a scroll-bar  one solution would   be to:  - when the render widget host HWND gets focused through a click  it refuses   focus leaving it on the previously focused window and sends the click to   the renderer as usual  - the renderer processes the click and if not on a scroll-bar sends a   message to the browser notifying it took focus  - on receiving this message the browser focuses the render widget host HWND   (if it is the one of the current tab that was initially clicked).
