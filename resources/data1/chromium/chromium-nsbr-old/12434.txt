<title>Issue 12434 -   chromium -    FTP file only gets transmitted when refreshing Chrome Error Page (F5) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go the Webpage mentioned above  2. Click with the left mousebutton on one of the mp3 podcasts [download   mp3]  3. A Chrome error page will occur  stating that it did not find the ftp   download.  4. Hit F5 to refresh the page and the download will be initiated and you   will correctly get the file...    Hitting F5 is just a workaround  but the download should actually commence   without an error page from chrome (obviously like in the other browsers).   Bug is there since Version 1 of Chrome.                  <b>Please provide
