<title>Issue 3326 -   chromium -    When the focus is on a plugin (Flash  for instance) keyboard shortcuts are not triggered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1 (and earlier too)    Other browsers tested: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/barvilik">http://www.myspace.com/barvilik</a> (for example)         Safari 3: n/a      Firefox 3: n/a           IE 7: n/a      1. Go to the website.  2. Click on one of the songs so the plugin will get focused.  3. Press F5.      The page will reload.      You still enjoy the song. :)      Note -  This is indeed a duplication of <a title="When the focus is on a plugin (Flash  for instance) keyboard shortcuts are not triggered" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2836"> Issue 2836 </a> and <a title="Clicking on object/embed TAG with flash content disables keyboard shortcuts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1147"> Issue 1147 </a>.  This behavior is not acceptable.  You cannot close the browser with Alt+F4 or close the window with Ctrl+W   and anything like this.  The logical behavior would be to act on browser keystrokes and send the   rest to the plugin.  This can lead to bad results. For example  plugins that may harm your   computer that the anti-virus or the browser did not detect - trying to   quickly close them will not be possible with the keyboard in the current   behavior  which can lead to bad behavior of the plugin. </pre>
