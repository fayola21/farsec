<title>Issue 22907 -   chromium -    When I started to use your search engine it was perfect. Under the last month nothing really works. I only use safe sites and serious programs. But most links does not work anymore. When I use other browsers they works  just Chrome did before. What have happened? How can I get an earlier version of Chrome  which is my favorite search engine indeed.  Best Regards John - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>                       <b>Please provide
