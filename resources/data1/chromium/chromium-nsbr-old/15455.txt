<title>Issue 15455 -   chromium -    Complete Firefox Import functionality on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Import from Firefox on OS X still needs some work to be done.     - Rewrite GetProfileINI in firefox_importer_utils_mac.cc to use NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains()    - In the same file write the Init() function to load NSS libraries that we   need to import passwords from Firefox. </pre>
