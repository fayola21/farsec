<title>Issue 15910 -   chromium -    Dictionary should automatically detect language and switch to it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome should automatically detect the language I'm writing in  and set the   right dictionary for it.    e.g. I'm writing in German  the dictionary should detect that and switch to   it.     Ways to implement that could be either to analyze the written words  or just   go ahead and look at the URL suffix (if the suffix is .de dictionary is being   switched to German  if it's .com it's being switched to English).     </pre>
