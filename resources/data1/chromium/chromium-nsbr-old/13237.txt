<title>Issue 13237 -   chromium -    Checkbox invisible on Google Code login page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3  URLs (if applicable) : log in through code.google.com...           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to the login page  2. look for the checkbox near 'remember me on this computer'  3. did you find it?      Visibility...      It plays hide and seek. I can only find it using the TAB key  and then it   still only shows the cool Chrome outline around the checkbox  but not the   checkbox itself.     </pre>
