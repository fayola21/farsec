<title>Issue 6250 -   chromium -    CSS Style fails on new tab... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=site:msdn.microsoft.com+asp.net+user+controls&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=">http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=site:msdn.microsoft.com+asp.net+user+controls&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.0.5         Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK  BUT INCOMPATIBLE FOR TEST      1. Open the 'google search result' page from the url link.  2. The first search result (msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y6wb1a0e.aspx)  right click the link and click 'Open link in new tab' - DO NOT CLICK THE  TAB TO VIEW IT  WAIT FOR THE TAB TO COMPLETELY LOAD IN THE BACKGROUND  BEFORE LEAVING THE GOOGLE TAB TO THE NEWLY CREATED MSDN TAB.  3. After the new tab has been fully loaded  click the tab to open it  and  you will see the styling 'width' is incorrect for the &lt;div  id=&quot;ctl00_rs1_mainContentContainer_cpe238111_c&quot; style=&quot;width:842px&quot;/&gt;. This  element should have a width of 842px (along with other style attributes)   but it acts as it has a width of 0px.      The expected result is a width on that div of 842 pixels.  This is not a problem when calling the page directly (not on a background  tab)  nor is it a problem when you open the tab and attempt to open it  before the page has loaded.    This is a problem with almost all MSDN Library pages when opening them in a  new tab. Also a problem on latest Chromium build 7799.   </pre>
