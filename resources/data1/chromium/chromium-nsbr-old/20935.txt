<title>Issue 20935 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't always launch &quot;with a window&quot; when launched prorgamatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.203.2 (Official Build 24690)      In Java  call:  Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {path_to_chrome  some_flags});      A Chrome window opens  fully loaded and ready to go.  Furthermore  the  background page of extensions should be loaded  and should be able to  chrome.tabs.create a new tab.      On Mac: Chrome appears in the dock  but no window is loaded.  Using  Applescript to activate the application will give it a window  but this  does not scale to the case of having more than one window.    On Windows (tested on Vista x64): A Chrome window is always opened.   Sometimes (not always  have not been able to  isolate when it succeeds and  when it fails)  that window gets focus  and all is well.  Other times the  window does not get focus  and problems as per the Mac occur.   Specifically  <a title="Tabs fail to open in extensions with message &quot;Error during undefined: No current window&quot;"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19846">bug 19846</a> manifests itself  even if the background page loops  retrying to open the page if it fails  which should succeed.    On Linux I have not had these problems (although I have not checked since  ~3.0.195) </pre>
