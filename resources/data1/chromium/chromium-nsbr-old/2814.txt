<title>Issue 2814 -   chromium -    Broken upstream tests: HTMLFrameElement09.html HTMLIFrameElement11.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Migrating from internal bug 792023.)    These two tests (and perhaps others) are buggy.  WebKit bug here: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15690">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15690</a>    We have forked and fixed these in our pending/ directory.  But it turns out   we also pass the original  buggy versions.    We should unfork these once they're fixed upstream. </pre>
