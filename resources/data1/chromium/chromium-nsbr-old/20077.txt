<title>Issue 20077 -   chromium -    Website/Chrome Installer uses unwanted language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   English/German      Current as of 2009-08-23      Windows 7 x64      This issue has several faces for me. They all begin with my desire to  install Chrome. I have 2 use-cases A: using Firefox and B: using IE.    Let me first note that I use an US English version of Windows  my  localization settings for time and date in Windows are slightly adjusted  and I use a German keyboard. Additionally I live in Germany.  Now due to this mix I get very unpleasing results in both use-cases.    A: I go to google.com/chrome. The site is in German. I switch the language  to English. Now if I click download everything is in English and I am  happy. But if I want the beta version instead I get the German EULA  a  German installer and a German installation.    B: I go to google.com/chrome. The site is in English. Everything will be  English as well unless I want the beta version. In this case I get a German  EULA again  a German installer and German installation.    And to clarify this  I always want an English version and I don't  understand why I get a German website in Firefox. Simply giving me the  option to pick a language prior to installation would be most desirable. </pre>
