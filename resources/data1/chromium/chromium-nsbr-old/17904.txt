Open up some websites in various tabs (I went to finance.yahoo.com and   opened a few random news articles)  2.

Switch back to other tabs and find that scrollbars don't work  keyboard   input is ignored  and links don't click        Other tabs continue working        Other tabs freeze... however  playing around with them for a few minutes I   discovered that occasionally  double-clicking a link in one of the tabs   will make it start to load  but it's very slow    <b>Please provide
