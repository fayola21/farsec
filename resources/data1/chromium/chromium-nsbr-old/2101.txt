<title>Issue 2101 -   chromium -    &quot;Remove label&quot; after using &quot;Open more actions menu&quot; via keyboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Google Chrome 0.2.149.29              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL (at second step described below)      1. In Gmail  after using &quot;.&quot; keyboard to label a mail   2. then tapping the letter of the label on the keyboard (like f for   friends)    3. it is impossible to use &quot;y&quot; directly. I need to reclick on the mail to   be able to use the &quot;y&quot; keyboard shortcut (Open more actions menu)      Tapping &quot;y&quot; should remove the label (without having to reclick on the mail)      nothing      </pre>
