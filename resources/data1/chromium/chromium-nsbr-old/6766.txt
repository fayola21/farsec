<title>Issue 6766 -   chromium -    PrefService doesn't fire notifications on changes to ListValue or DictionaryValue entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> One way would be to change the API to only have a way to Get and Set these  objects.  The downside would be that Get should return a copy so it would  be a bit slower if we're manipulating large Value objects. </pre>
