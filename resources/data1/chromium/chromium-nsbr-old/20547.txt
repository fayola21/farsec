<title>Issue 20547 -   chromium -    Decide how we want to capitalize unusual cases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From boganizer: http://b/1124542    LayoutTests/fast/text/capitalize-boundaries.html    exercises a lot of capitalization cases  in English and various other   languages and scripts.  It's not clear from the test what the correct   behavior should be: the header says &quot;In fact  I do not entirely agree with   all of the given test cases in terms of their expected results  nor do I   think that the browser should yet be expected to match all of the cases in   the different languages...&quot;.    Even as a grammar pedant  I don't know what we should do for Russian  but I   know our capitalization for English  French  and Dutch  at least  is wrong   -- call it overly enthusiastic.    We should figure out what we want to match  then do it.     </pre>
