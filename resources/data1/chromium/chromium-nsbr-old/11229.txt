<title>Issue 11229 -   chromium -    Tab loads with content not filling entire window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chrome Version       : 2.0.178.0 (14936)      make sure chromimum is the default browser  and it repoens last session and   there is one tab only pointing to  <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?</a>  service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;rm=false&amp;continue=<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/%3">https://mail.google.com/mail/%3</a>  Fshva%3D1%26ui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&amp;bsv=zpwhtygjntrz&amp;ss=1&amp;scc=1&amp;ltmpl=default&amp;lt  mplcache=2    on my machine  there is no &quot;automatic log in&quot; nor password saver  so it   remains on the gmail screen      close chromimum  and do Window + R and type www.google.com      chrmium will launch  and two tabs will appear  the one on the right and the   active one is the google.com one    4. wait for the tobber (the spinning thing) to stop loading both pages    5. close the google.com one (the active one)      you should see the gmail.com login screen in all its glory      3 options  - it mostly is ok  sorry ... wish it was easier for you guys  - the gmail window appears shrinked..... the login and password field are   closer to the left then they should be  this is quite visible  if you now press F5 the crazyness will beign  you gotta see it for yourself   :)  - the gmail window will appear to live inside a much smaller window  in   fact chrome adds a scroll bar on the vertical access as the window becomes   so small        ok  on 2.0.174.0 the behaviour is quite the same.    please  before you dismiss it  i find easy to see bugs in chrome/chromium   but i see they were reported    the bugs i do report  tend to be hard to reproduce (like my Ctrl+A one)  but i think if you will truly test this  you will see they are all true   </pre>
