<title>Issue 5133 -   chromium -    Add a &quot;BoundsInWidget&quot; method to View - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add a method called &quot;BoundsInWidget&quot; to View:    gfx::Rect BoundsInWidget() const {    gfx::Rect bounds_in_widget = bounds_;    gfx::Point origin;    ConvertPointToWidget(this  &amp;origin);    bounds_in_widget.set_origin(origin);    return bounds_in_widget;  }    ...    and then convert the callers of &quot;ConvertPointToWidget&quot; to use this instead    since it's a common pattern. </pre>
