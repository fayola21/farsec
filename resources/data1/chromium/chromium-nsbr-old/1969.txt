<title>Issue 1969 -   chromium -    Send Email + IM Links to an Incognito Window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to suggest a feature that makes any links clicked in eMails or  Instant Messaging chat windows to be sent automatically to an Incognito window.    Like if someone sends me an eMail and there's a hyperlink in it  after  clicking the hyperlink it would open an Incognito window.    Or if my friend sends me a link to some random website  via IM  and I don't  want to save the cookies or cache  then it could send that link to an  Incognito window as well. </pre>
