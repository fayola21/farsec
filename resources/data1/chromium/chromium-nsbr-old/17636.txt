<title>Issue 17636 -   chromium -    window.open() from a extension process (tab or background page) to relative url that uses an api call will crash the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. do something to cause window.open() to fire from a toolstrip to any html   page in that extension.  2. if the opened page calls an api function  the browser will crash.    it appears that the RenderViewHostManager.dom_ui_ never gets setup because   Navigate() never gets called.     </pre>
