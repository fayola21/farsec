<title>Issue 3417 -   chromium -    Download progress doesn't blink when saving a page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to www.google.com  2. Get the context menu of the page and select Save As  3. Save the page    What is the expected output?   Once the download completes  on the Download bar  the progress should blink    What do you see instead?  The progress doesn't show up at all. This doesn't happen to all the files   but happens surely for webpages(as they can be downloaded very fast?)    Google Chrome	0.3.154.3 (Official Build 3339)     </pre>
