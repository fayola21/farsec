<title>Issue 16760 -   chromium -    Right-click menu of bookmark entries has &quot;Delete&quot; right next to &quot;Edit...&quot;  and no undo. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0 (Official Build 20299)      1. Book any page  then open the new tab page.  2. Right click on a bookmark entry.  3. Notice that &quot;Edit...&quot; is immediately above &quot;Delete&quot;  4. Accidentally delete a bookmark instead of editing it.  5. Notice that there is no way to undo the deletion.      Delete and edit should not be right next to each other.  Also  delete should be undo-able.   </pre>
