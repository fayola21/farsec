<title>Issue 7322 -   chromium -    lost focus while using gmail keyboard shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.46  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com          Firefox 3: OK      1. Login to a gmail a/c  2. Check one or more emails in inbox  3. Press &quot;.&quot; to open menu  4. Press &lt;Esc&gt; to cancel the menu      The keyboard focus should remain in gmail and any further keyboard   shortcuts are expected to work (e.g.  j to move down or y to archive)        The keyboard focus is lost and the keyboard shortcuts don't work until you   click with mouse somewhere inside gmail.      The focus is lost even if you don't press &lt;Esc&gt; to close the menu but   select something  say a label. This disrupts the keyboard workflow for many    actions and forces you to use the mouse. Very annoying. </pre>
