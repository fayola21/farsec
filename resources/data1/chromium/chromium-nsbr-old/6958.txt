<title>Issue 6958 -   chromium -    Tabs are condensed at the top (title and icons not visible) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0      1. I have no idea what I did to cause the issue.        The tabs render properly (as in 2.0.157.x).        See the attachment.   </pre>
