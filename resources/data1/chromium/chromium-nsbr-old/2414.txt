<title>Issue 2414 -   chromium -    Drag and Drop corrupts images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : any site           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Access to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>  actually any website will occur this   problem.  2. Drag a image you'd like to save say NY times logo and drop it to your   desktop.   3. Open a saved image file in binary editor and check the last byte. It is   filled NULL(0x00) by Chrome.         If you drag and drop NY times logo  it is supposed to end with 0x3B.        It is filled NULL(0x00) byte by Chrome.     In this case I choose gif image  but image type doesn't matter. Whatever you   drop an file displayed on website to desktop from Chrome  a last byte is   filled NULL byte by Chrome.    If you save an image by choosing &quot;Save image as...&quot; on context menu  this   problem will not appear.     </pre>
