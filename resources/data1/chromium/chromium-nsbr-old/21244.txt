<title>Issue 21244 -   chromium -    Chromium fails to start on Ubuntu 9.04  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium fails to start up on Ubuntu Jaunty amd64. I installed for the  first time today. The browser never opens. Anyone else seeing this?    I did get the initial dialog asking if I want chromium to be the default  browser. I did not check that. I did allow it to import my FF settings  and  that appeared to succeed. However the browser never started. No window came  up  not the first time  not any time.    myuser@Jaunty:~$ chromium-browser  [20532:20535:23098451160:FATAL:/build/buildd/chromium-browser-4.0.207.0~svn20090907r25598/build-tree/src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/async_resource_handler.cc(145)]  Check failed: read_buffer_-&gt;data().

What happens instead? when clicking the launcher icon  I get a wait cursor  for a few seconds  then nothing. When running from the terminal  I get the  errors listed above.     </pre>
