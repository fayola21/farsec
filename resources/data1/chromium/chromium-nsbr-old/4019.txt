<title>Issue 4019 -   chromium -    does not remember account number at my bank site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://nbc.ca/">http://nbc.ca/</a>            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://nbc.ca">http://nbc.ca</a>  2. Click on the link &quot;Open Session&quot; on the left hand side  under &quot;Internet Banking   Solutions&quot;  3. Enter client card number  password  and most importantly  check the &quot;Save card   number&quot; check box  4. Press &quot;Continue&quot;  5. Browse to make sure all is working fine  6. Click on &quot;Quit&quot; at the top right corner to log out  8. Click on the link &quot;Open Session&quot; on the left hand side  under &quot;Internet Banking   Solutions&quot;      The client card number that I typed in at step 3 should be automatically inserted   into the appropriate text field.      The client card number is blank. Because I checked the &quot;Save card number&quot; check   box  chrome should have remember the number.  This works as expected in IE7 and   FF2/FF3.  I have not tested with Safari.     </pre>
