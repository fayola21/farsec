<title>Issue 549 -   chromium -    window maximize bug on duel monitor system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I use duel monitors and I usually maximize web-browser on secondary  monitor. but when I maximize chrome on secondary monitor  it takes  resolution of 'main' monitor.    my main monitor has 1680x1050 res and sec has 1024x1280. so chrome is not  fitted on my monitor.        - take 1024x1280 resolution      - take 1680x1050    Please provide
