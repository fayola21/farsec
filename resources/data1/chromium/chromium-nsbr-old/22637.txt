<title>Issue 22637 -   chromium -    Can't select version number in About Chromium window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 212.0 (Developer Build 26808)    OS version               : 10.4.8  Safari: OK  Firefox: Can select User Agent string  but not version number      1. Pull up About Chromium from the Chromium menu      You can select the version number in order to copy/paste it into a bug      It's not selectable anymore. I think this is a regression/change. </pre>
