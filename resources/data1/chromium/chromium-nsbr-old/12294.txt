Open a lengthy document in Google Doc's.  2. Scroll down and then scroll up the page.      Expected:  There should be no change in the page when we scroll down and scroll back up.    Actual:  Scrolling down a Google Doc's page would wipe out the inbuilt toolbar and other options on the   top of the doc's page.      We have noticed this only with Documents in Google Doc's.     </pre>
