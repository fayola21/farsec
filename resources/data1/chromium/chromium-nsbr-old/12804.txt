<title>Issue 12804 -   chromium -    Auto spell correct needs configurable option and context menu entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.2 (Official Build 16964)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    Currently  auto spell correct is activated with &quot;--auto-spell-correct&quot;    When it goes live  it will need a configurable option to activate or   deactivate.  Perhaps put the option in:    Options &gt; Minor Tweaks &gt; Change font and language settings &gt; Languages &gt;   &quot;Auto spell correct&quot; ?    It also needs a context menu entry to activate or deactivate from   textfields/textareas  as in:    right-click &gt; Spell-checker options &gt; &quot;Auto spell correct&quot; </pre>
