<title>Issue 5414 -   chromium -    Chrome requires UAC confirm or admin privleges to run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;0.4.154.29&gt;      1. Run chrome from any shortcut or directly from the exe  Also note: Chrome is not set as my default browser...      Chrome opens normally.      Chrome requires me to click a UAC conformation dialog. Which makes me very   sad and frustrated. Why is Chrome requiring elevated privileges? </pre>
