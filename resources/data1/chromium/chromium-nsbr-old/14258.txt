Some of the content is appearing as encrypted code.          What is the expected result?  It should appear as normal Telugu script.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Type <a href="http://www.sakshi.com/">http://www.sakshi.com/</a> in Chrome browser.  2. The encrypted code (looks like gibberish) appears in the first half of  the page below the fold.      Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  It doesn't work properly in Mozilla either  but appears fine in IE.    Please provide any additional information below.   </pre>
