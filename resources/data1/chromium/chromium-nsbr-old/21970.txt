<title>Issue 21970 -   chromium -    Nightly for Mac shows a &quot;Status bar&quot;-like area at the bottom of the screen  that behaves strangely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Installed (copied to /Applications over old version)  2. Ran Chromium nightly  3. Noticed a strange &quot;status bar&quot; area on the bottom  which I've never seen  before.  4. Closed window  opened new Incognito window  5. Resized window.      I don't think the &quot;status bar&quot; area should be there at all. Even if it's  intended  it should resize correctly.      &quot;Status bar&quot; area fails to resize correctly. A new &quot;standard color&quot; status  bar appears over the &quot;incognito blue&quot; status bar. URL pop-up acts  strangely. See screenshot attached.    <b>Please provide
