<title>Issue 6526 -   chromium -    Inform user if downloaded file does not exist anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes you may have forgotten that you have cleared the &quot;downloads&quot;   directory. If the file still shows in the download bar  and you click on   &quot;open&quot;  nothing happens.    What is the expected output?   Perhaps  there can be a dialog stating that the file does not exist   anymore/ or has been deleted.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens. You wait and wait only to realize that it is no longer   there when you check the downloads directory.       </pre>
