<title>Issue 5578 -   chromium -    JSON Key Order ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a JSON object with numeric indexes that are not in numeric order.  For example: var json = {&quot;2&quot;:&quot;First&quot; &quot;1&quot;:&quot;Last&quot;};  2. Iterate across these indexes using a for-in construct. For example: for  (var x in json) { alert(json[x]); }  3. Observe that it actually reorders the elements to be in numeric order  (it should not!).
