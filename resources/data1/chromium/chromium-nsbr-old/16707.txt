<title>Issue 16707 -   chromium -    [MAC] Contents are not being selected when clicking on OMNIBAR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0    OS version               : 10.5.7    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Firefox on MAC automatically  selects contents of location bar when you click once.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Chrome on windows automatically selects the  contents of the omnibar when clicked once.      1. Open Chromium  2. Click once on Omnibar  3. Contents do not get selected      Content of the OMNIBAR should be selected when single clicking on the OMNIBAR.      Contents do not get selected.    --------------------------------------------------  The default behavior on Firefox on a MAC is to automatically select all  contents  Chromium should follow platform consistency and behave the same  way as Firefox does.    Chromium should also follow consistency with other platforms  Chromium for  Windows selects all contents of the OMNIBAR when clicked  Chromium for MAC  should behave the same way as its Windows counterpart.    The argument that says Chromium on the MAC should follow Safari on the MAC  is incorrect  since Chromium on Windows does not follow Safari on Windows   Safari on Windows does not select the contents of the location bar when  clicked.    8 out of 10 times  when a person is clicking on the OMNIBAR is to replace  the entire contents of it with a new search term of URL.  It really  benefits workflow to select all text so that when you start typing it  replaces the old URL.  Otherwise once must triple click to select the  entire contents to be replaced  having to tripe click really affects workflow.    If this is the correct design choice for Chromium on windows  it should  definitely be the correct design choice Chromium for MAC. </pre>
