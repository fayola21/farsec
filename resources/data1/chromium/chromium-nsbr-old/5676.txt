<title>Issue 5676 -   chromium -    Newtab+Open website+ [Select URL+Enter (while loading)] = New tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL            Firefox 3: OK        1. Open a new tab  2. Open a website  3. While it is loading  select the url (clicking on it once) and press   Enter (easier on websites which lagged or not responding at all)      Well  since the url is inputted on the textbox  I assume it would be   expected to re-load that website (much like a F5 or so)      The loading stops and the &quot;New Tab&quot; page is shown  with an empty URL on the   URL bar.    ----------  I also tried with a normal already loaded page  selecting the URL the same   way and press Enter and the page is reloaded  seem to happen only when the   page is loading and/or unresponsive.     </pre>
