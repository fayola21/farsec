<title>Issue 3615 -   chromium -    Printing Adobe Acrobat Reader documents from the page menu fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open a pdf and wait for the full-page acrobat reader plugin to load. Select   print from the page menu. You get a blank page with headers and footers.    In Firefox  the document prints correctly (or at least the first page  I   only tried a 1-page document). </pre>
