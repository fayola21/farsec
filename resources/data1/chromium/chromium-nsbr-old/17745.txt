<title>Issue 17745 -   chromium -    Show homepage on new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Below changes are in need.  1.

There were so many improvements on &quot;New tab page&quot; but still we cannot open specific website on new tab.    Today  classic &quot;Open Homepage&quot; setting is getting less important as opposed to new tab  since we click   more on new tab button when we use tab-based web browser. As what the &quot;Open Homepage&quot; setting has done   for us so far  same option on new tab for modern browser is potentially in demand.    FYI I've tested some other browsers to see how they deal with this issue. (see attachments)    As for Chrome  there are some grass-roots solutions to change new tab content using plug-in. For this   issue  key of the modification is to widen capability of new tab  and to get Chrome to be more standard    and well-doing browser for www.
