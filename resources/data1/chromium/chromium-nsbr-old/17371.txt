<title>Issue 17371 -   chromium -    Implement CSS3 appearance for tooltips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For the new tab page I wanted to create my own tooltip using HTML + CSS.   However  I made it look like Windows Vista/Windows 7. I would have preferred   to make it look native. Mozilla supports the value &quot;tooltip&quot; for -moz-  appearance. We should support the same value in webkit/chrome   </pre>
