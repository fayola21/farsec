<title>Issue 3082 -   chromium -    Make search bar work JUST like firefox3's - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure exactly how they differ but I highly prefer firefox's  prioritization schema over Chrome's.    Basically Chrome suggests doing a Google search FAR too much.  People  usually frequent the same websites so I think searching your search  history/bookmarks should consistently be ranked higher.   </pre>
