<title>Issue 1882 -   chromium -    Java runtime (6 U10) doesn't receive connection settings from browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. System and browser are configured to use a proxy (i.e. no direct connection)  2. Java runtime is configured to use the browser's connection settings  3. Open any page containing Java applets (e.g.  <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml):">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml):</a> Error.  4. Reconnect/reconfigure the system/browser to use a direct connection  5. Repeat step 3: OK.      Java platform (Java 6 U10) sees and uses browser/Windows connection  settings  uses proxy as configured and successfully loads Java applets      Connection settings aren't fed to the Java platform at runtime  as they  would be with IE. If the JRE is configured to use the browser's connection  settings  it will always attempt a direct connection  and Java applets  won't load. This is also an issue in the latest Safari build (3.1.2).      Please provide
