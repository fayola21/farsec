<title>Issue 13337 -   chromium -    New Tab has gotten 25% slower since start of May - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you look at the perf graph for new tab time:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release/new-tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release/new-tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500</a>    You'll see a 25% slowdown from the start of May (approx CL 15800) to the  start of June (approx CL 17600).    This could just be due to us adding features  but if there's a smoking gun   we should look and see if we can isolate it so we know. </pre>
