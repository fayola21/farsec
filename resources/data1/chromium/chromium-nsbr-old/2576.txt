<title>Issue 2576 -   chromium -    proxy_resolver_winhttp.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : rev 1924 of proxy_resolver_winhttp.cc    - What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. VS2005 SP1 install  2. 2008 SDK install  3. Compile proxy_resolve_winhttp.cc      - What is the expected result?     Successful compile    - What happens instead?    Look at attached screen shot of two VS2005 IDE windows side by side  the   left side has the net.sln project only  and the right side has the entire   chrome.sln loaded.    I can't explain this but the NET.SLN does not compile from within the   CHROME.SLN (right side)  but it does when loading by itself in the IDE or   via command line (left side).    This is related to the specstrings.h issue known to exist between versions   of the compiler versus versions of the SDK.      But I can't see why this this is problem or maybe there is and it needs to   be fixed.    </pre>
