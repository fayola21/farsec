<title>Issue 2967 -   chromium -    Cannot find bugs like about:network from the bug list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> How can I search for bugs with the following string in the Summary line?       about:network    I already selected All Issues.  If I just type  about:network  or include   it inside quotes like  &quot;about:network&quot;  but it never finds any entires.    Such a bug exists of course  eg. <a title="About:blank and about:network pages are &quot;Untitled&quot;" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2861"> issue 2861 </a>    I think the search is confused because it can find special criteria like   stars:3 or status:fixed.  How can I get around this to search for the   literal string? </pre>
