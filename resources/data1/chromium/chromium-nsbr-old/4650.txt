<title>Issue 4650 -   chromium -    View source grabs wrong source file when form post uses the same url over and over - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.mig33.com/wap/download_mig33.php">http://www.mig33.com/wap/download_mig33.php</a>  2. Choose Nokia  3. Submit form  4. Then you get a new dropdown list with all the Nokia models (note  the  url does not change)  5. View Source    What is the expected result?    The HTML should match what is displayed on the screen.    What happens instead?    The HTML matches what was first presented to the user when they selected  the phone model  you will see none of the number options.  If you inspect  the elements on the page and/ or if you save the page you will see the  correct content (as when you view source in the other browsers).    Probably not the severest of security bugs  but in theory someone could use  this approach to mask the contents of an exploit page containing a more  significant payload.    Please provide
