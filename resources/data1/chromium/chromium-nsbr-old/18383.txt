<title>Issue 18383 -   chromium -    Increase the VectorDevice internal resolution by 10x when Printing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Increase the rendering resolution to (printer dpi) / 2 or 4.  This would help a lot because GDI functions work with integers but skia works   with floats. The idea is to premultiply the matrix with this factor and   multiply each SkScalar that are passed to SkScalarRound(value) as   SkScalarRound(value * factor). Safari is already doing the same for text   rendering. </pre>
