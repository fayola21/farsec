<title>Issue 19025 -   chromium -    Sad tab should have &quot;refresh all sad tabs&quot; button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Quite often when I am in Google Reader  I will middle click myself to having   maybe 20 or so tabs all running in the same process (since middle clicks   from Reader apparently do not spawn new processes). Then  when one of them   crashes  I have to go through and refresh each newly saddened tab.    It would be nice if the sad tab page had a button to do this for me  since   <a title="FEATURE: Need a command for Reload All Tabs / Refresh All Tabs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5877"> issue 5877 </a> was wontfix'd. </pre>
