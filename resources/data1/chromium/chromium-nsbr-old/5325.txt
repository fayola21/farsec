<title>Issue 5325 -   chromium -    Possible memory corruption on the HttpCache::Transaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The HttpCache::Transaction uses cache_read_callback_ to isolate the   transaction from the disk cache callback.    When the transaction is destroyed  cache_read_callback_ is canceled so that    any subsequent callback from the disk cache is not directed to a deleted   object.    The HttpCache::Transaction::Read operation itself uses a buffer passed in   by the caller. Said buffer could be for instance a stream_buffer provided   by a filter_ of an URLRequestJob.    When the URLRequestJob is deleted  the filter_ is deleted  the   stream_buffer_ is deleted  the transaction_ is deleted and the cache_read_callback_ is canceled. However  if there is a read in progress     the buffer is still in use and may very well be overwritten after it was   reused. </pre>
