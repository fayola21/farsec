<title>Issue 2563 -   chromium -    Entering a URL with a scheme handled by a url protocol handler in location bar doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter a URL with a scheme handled by some external program registered as  a URL protocol handler by putting appropriate registry entries in into the  location bar  2. See a search page instead of it browsing to the URL        It should 'browse the url' which generally means launching an external  program.  This works from a link in an HTML page  but not in the location  bar.  I guess http: https: file: and such are special cased to know that it  should just load them but other schemes from the registry are not properly  handled.      You get a google search result    Please provide
