<title>Issue 12296 -   chromium -    IPC message parameters are copied unnecessarily - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Example:    new ViewMsg_ScriptEvalRequest(L&quot;foo&quot;  L&quot;bar&quot;)    creates a temporary wstring for each param  then copies those temporaries   into a Tuple2 before passing them into IPC::MessageWithTuple's constructor.    Chances are  the copy gets optimized away by the compiler  but it has the   side effect of requiring any type we want to send over IPC to have a copy   constructor.    I have a relatively simple fix to remove this requirement. </pre>
