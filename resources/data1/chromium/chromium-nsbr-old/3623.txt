<title>Issue 3623 -   chromium -    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value native runtime.js (line 283) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit the URL  2. Login if required          The page controls (new folder  upload  etc) are activated by JavaScript   that runs when the page loads  changing them from text to a nice green   colour.        If an error occurs in the JavaScript the buttons don't turn Green. This   happens whenever I mess up as a developer on the site.    With Google Chrome it sometimes(!) fails before enabling the buttons and   reports the error:    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value native   runtime.js (line 283)    Since it works reliably in Safari I assume a JavaScript issue due  or   revealed by  the v8 javascript engine.    Please provide
