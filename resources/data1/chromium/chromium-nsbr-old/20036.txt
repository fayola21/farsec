<title>Issue 20036 -   chromium -    theme_overlay has problems in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try the glossy_blue theme  and open an incognito window.  Note that the   theme_frame_overlay in the upper left-hand corner has the wrong color for   incognito mode.    Possibility of theme_frame_overlay_incognito and   theme_frame_overlay_incognito_inactive should be added  and regular   theme_overlay should not be displayed in incognito mode.   </pre>
