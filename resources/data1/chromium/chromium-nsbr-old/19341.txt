<title>Issue 19341 -   chromium -    &quot;Open file&quot; dialog and unavailable network resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39        1. Navigate to a website that can be used to upload a file (one-clich file  hosting services  image hosting sites  anything that can be used to upload  files).  2. Press the &quot;Browse&quot; button. The Windows XP &quot;Open File&quot; dialog appears.  3. Navigate to a folder on your local network and select a file. For  example  network-pcimportant.doc. Upload the file.  4. Reload the webpage after the upload is complete.  5. Disconnect the network resource so that network-pcimportant.doc won't  be accessible anymore.  5. Press the &quot;Browse&quot; button again.      The &quot;Open file&quot; dialog should appear immediately.      The &quot;Open file&quot; dialog tries to access the disconnected network resource.  When it fails  it falls back to the &quot;My Documents&quot; folder. However  the  file dialog takes a lot of time to understand that the resource location is  not available anymore - probably a Windows XP issue  however  in all the  time the dialog tries to access the network location  Chrome is unresponsive.    I find it unacceptable that an &quot;Open file&quot; dialog has the power to lock me  out of the whole browser. I should at least be able to access the other  open tabs or the Chrome task manager. </pre>
