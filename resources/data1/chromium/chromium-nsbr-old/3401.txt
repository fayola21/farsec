<title>Issue 3401 -   chromium -    Clicking CTRL+Link behaves differently in GMAIL and other websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit any website  say google.com. Holding CTRL key  click on any link.   It opens a new tab. The focus remains on the current tab all through.    2. Visit gmail.com. Open any mail that contains a link. Do the same action   as mentioned above. i.e. Holding CTRL key  click on any link. It opens a   new tab but the focus is shifted to the NEW tab. The current tab loses   focus.    3. Close the newly opened tab. Now  on the same link in gmail  right-click   and choose &quot;open link in new tab&quot;. A new tab is opened and the focus   remains on the current tab.         When CTRL+clicking on a link  the focus should always remain on the current   tab. It should not move to the newly opened tab.      When CTRL+clicking on a link  the focus moves away to the newly opened tab.    Apparently  this happens only with the links in gmail.com.      Please provide
