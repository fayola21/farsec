<title>Issue 9021 -   chromium -    Version notifications on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The New Tab Page should show a &quot;Chrome BETA 1.170.1: Last updated on XX  YY   _Release Notes_&quot;-style string in a subtle way (perhaps bottom aligned    faded) in the case where you are on a BETA or DEV channel. We do not wish   to add things to the New Tab Page for stable-channel users.    This is for changelog level information; larger feature changes should have   UI that promotes the feature  and may not be NTP-located. </pre>
