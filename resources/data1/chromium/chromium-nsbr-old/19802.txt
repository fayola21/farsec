<title>Issue 19802 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.202.0      1. Use a profile with lots of history  including Gmail.  2. Clear browsing data - all data for all time periods.  3. chrome://history/ - note that it is empty.  4. Log into Gmail.  5. Refresh chrome://history/.      One history entry for Gmail.      The history is populated with many strange entries from Gmail  going back   several weeks. The entries are fairly cryptic  but have text like &quot;widget&quot;   and &quot;container&quot; in them.    When I log into iGoogle  I also get a bunch of strange things re-appearing   in my history.    This issue may also be causing the Win 7 jumplist to populate with empty   lines after clearing data. </pre>
