<title>Issue 17758 -   chromium -    Certain tabs won't close or won't close properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: chromium-3.0.196.0-0.1.20090724svn21567.fc11.i586  v8-  1.2.14-1.20090724svn2534.fc11.i586  OS + version: Fedora 11  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : metacity  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com      1. Open some AJAX pages like mail.google.com  2. When the page is running  try to close the tab  3. Tab will not close (in most cases) OR  in the case of Gmail  the &quot;page&quot;   will close but the tab itself will stay open  leaving nothing but an empty   page with a background image (I'm using the planets theme)--attempting to   close the &quot;ghost&quot; tab works.  In the case of the totally non-closing tabs    attempting to close the whole browser window will also fail where such tabs   are present.      The tabs should close normally.        Certain tabs appear to get &quot;stuck&quot; and will no longer close.  When they are   open  the overall browser session cannot be closed either.  Gmail behaves   strangely when closing--it needs to be &quot;closed&quot; twice on my system (this   happens every time).    My suspicion is that the problem is related to javascript in some way    since the pages I have problems with make some use of AJAX for example to   do UI effects.  When a page gets stuck  there is not much that can be done   except kill its chromium-browser process.  Sometimes I'm able to navigate   away from the page first and then the tab will close  but this does not   always work!  Closing the tab this way will usually result in a browser   crash when chromium is totally closed. </pre>
