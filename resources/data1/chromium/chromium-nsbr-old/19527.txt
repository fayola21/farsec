<title>Issue 19527 -   chromium -    Pop-out compose window in Gmail is truncated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1 (Official Build 23116)    When you press Shift+C to open a pop-out compose window in Gmail  it's   truncated vertically and horizontally. Works fine on Win.    Other popups (eg popuptest.com or popping out a chat mole in Gmail) seem   fine: no truncation observed. </pre>
