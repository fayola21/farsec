<title>Issue 11433 -   chromium -    Resetting &quot;Don't ask again&quot; on Default Browser info bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 1.0.154.62    Precondition: Chrome not set to default browser.        1. Start Chrome &gt; Default Browser info bar is displayed.  2. Select &quot;Don't ask again&quot;.    The question is  how to reset so that Chrome will ask again.  Currently   the only way I can see is:    3. Set Chrome as default browser.  4. Set IE/FF as default browser.     Now Chrome will ask again upon startup.    I think it would be more intuitive to have a checkbox for this. IE and FF  have this.   </pre>
