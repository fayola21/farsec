<title>Issue 22214 -   chromium -    In App mode  links opened in new tab don't go to foreground in the Chrome window we switch to - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NOTE: This bug is specific to App mode and is -not- a continuation of the   old argument that &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; should open a foreground tab   instead of a background tab. I don't think we should change that. The   problem I have is this:      1. Launch Chrome  2. Launch a website in app mode (chrome --app=<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>)   3. In the App Chrome window  right-click a link and select Open in new tab.    Since the link is in an App window  which doesn't support tabs  the request   gets shunted to the regular Chrome window and that window gets focus.   However  the tab it just opened does not.    We have to bring the other window to the foreground  in my opinion  since   otherwise it will look like this feature is completely broken. However  when   doing so we should bring the tab to the foreground  otherwise it will look   like we didn't open the tab requested.   </pre>
