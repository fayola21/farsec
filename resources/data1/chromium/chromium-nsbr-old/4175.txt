<title>Issue 4175 -   chromium -    On RTL locales  the Bookmarks Manager's window flickers during resize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chrome in Hebrew (by running &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot;  2. Open the bookmarks manager.  3. Resize the bookmarks manager's window.        The resize should be smooth but instead there is flickering going on.    This doesn't happen on LTR languages because TreeView performs double   buffering. This double buffering method doesn't seem to work properly when   the TreeView's HWND is flipped.     </pre>
