<title>Issue 4543 -   chromium -    It is impossible to edit a text selection using the arrow keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Use the mouse to select some text that isn't in a text box  2. Use the key combination SHIFT+ARROW KEY to edit the selection      The selection is modified      The page moves.        Ok  i guess this is the expected behaviour  as IE7 does the same thing  and Chrome   probably behaves like this by design  just like in <a title="Selecting entire lines instead of the actual text string on double click" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=72"> issue 72 </a>.    So i am just sort of asking.    Yes i hit this most of the times when i want to remove that white space from the   selection :D     </pre>
