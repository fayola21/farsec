<title>Issue 6044 -   chromium -    Symbol directory names will sort incorrectly once we reach revision 10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Goto:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall</a>  2. At the top  click on the &quot;Continuous&quot; link in Builds: Continuous    The Continuous link currently points to:     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=N;O=D">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=N;O=D</a>    This results in bad chronological date sorting because of the MM-DD-YYYY   directory names (see <a title="Chromium continuous builds do not sort chronologically" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6008"> Issue 6008 </a>).    Update the Continuous link to the following will quickly solve this problem   from the Waterfall page.  This link sorts the continuous directory by   descending Last Modified Date:     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=M;O=D">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=M;O=D</a> </pre>
