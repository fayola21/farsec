<title>Issue 4411 -   chromium -    MSN / HOTMAIL EMAIL UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.9&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : WWW.HOTMAIL.COM        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        1. CREATING NEW MESSAGE TO COMPOSE  2. REPLYING TO A MESSAGE        To be able to write an email even if it is just in plain text.        I can enter an email and it seems to pull names from the contact list.  I   also am able to enter a subject for the email.  Yet I am unable to type   anything in the main body.  The &quot;field&quot; does not seem to focus at all    atleast that is how I think it is technically described..      Comments.  It seems like msn has been fighting with chrome ever since I started using   it in August. </pre>
