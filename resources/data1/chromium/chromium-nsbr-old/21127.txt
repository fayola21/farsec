<title>Issue 21127 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: [ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo]: FTP downloads are broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Broken out from <a title="fix ftp downloads: ftp://89.149.202.120/Sega%20Genesis%20Roms/Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20(USA %20Europe).zip" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20304"> Issue 20304 </a> Comment 5:    -Start downloading a file from ftp site.  (foreg: <a href="ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo">ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/demo</a> )    issue: The download never completes. If your file size is x mb  then x mb will be  downloaded  but still the progress indicator still spins and also speed of download  also never ends.    PS: Repros on DEV release candidate 4.0.206.1 and ToT. </pre>
