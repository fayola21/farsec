<title>Issue 3936 -   chromium -    Enable single-line text-fields spelling check by context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I miss the option to check for spelling errors in single line text fields     For example the summery text field when posting new issues here. i actually   had to copy paste it back and forth to the a bigger text area in order to   have it checked.    A right click on the the single lined text field-&gt;&quot;Enable spell check&quot;   option could really be useful. If possible  it does make sense to put that   option in bigger text fields too (so we can disable it for a specific text   field).    bottom line... i realize that having the spell check happen automatically   on single lined text fields can cause a problem  but any on-demand action   to check them on a specific page would be great :) </pre>
