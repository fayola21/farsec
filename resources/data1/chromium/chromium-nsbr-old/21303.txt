<title>Issue 21303 -   chromium -    Runaway Chrome Helper - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    OS version               : 10.5.8    I just noticed that Chrome Helper was eating 97% of one of my CPUs. I quit Chrome and the   Chrome Helper process did not die. Finally had to Force Quit it in Activity Monitor. Took a sample   first  attached.    I'm not sure what I did to make this happen. I suspect it's because I tried to make an attachment in   GMail and the Flash plugin got all hot and bothered.    </pre>
