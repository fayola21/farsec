<title>Issue 10629 -   chromium -    Adding &quot;reorder by title&quot; in Bookmark Manager's context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 or others.  URLs (if applicable) : None.  Other browsers tested: No  because it's a suggestion for Chrome.        1. Open the bookmark manager (Ctrl+Shift+B);  2. Click with the right mouse button on folders;  3. There is no option &quot;Reorder by title&quot;.      It would be very useful if this option yet was already in direct context   menu (right-click mouse on).    Attached a screenshot of Bookmark Manager's context menu.   </pre>
