<title>Issue 7880 -   chromium -    there is no option to disable/restiction on calling print repeatedly from javascript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A malicious page is able to run the following snippet:    while (1) print(&quot;w00t&quot;);    this will effectively block all tabs in the open window indefinitely.    Unlike the more well-known:    while(1) alert(...    bug  there is no option to stop multiple print dialogs from appearing after   each other.    Example:    <a href="http://www.offsetdesign.co.uk/static/printfail.html">http://www.offsetdesign.co.uk/static/printfail.html</a> </pre>
