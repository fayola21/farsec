<title>Issue 2538 -   chromium -    Enter url with Alt+Enter from a tab shouldn't leave focus of that tab in url bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A                1. Start with a web page (it helps if it's a web page with keyboard   shortcuts  like Gmail or Google Reader    2. You decide to navigate to some webpage!  Go to the url bar  type in url    press alt+enter to open the url in a new tab    3. You're done reading that page!  Close it or just switch to the   originating tab    4. The focus on that tab is still on the url bar  not on the page!    Keyboard shortcuts don't work until you click on some white space on the   page.        Like in Firefox 3  I expect focus to return to the page instead of staying   in the url bar.  After all  I'm putting focus into the url bar just to open   a new tab; after I've done that  focus should return to the tab   automatically.        Focus remains in the url bar.  This annoying when you mostly interact with   the originating page via keyboard shortcuts (Gmail  Google Reader)  etc.    Worse -- there's no way I can tell to jump focus from url bar to the page   via a keyboard shortcut  forcing me to use the mouse!   </pre>
