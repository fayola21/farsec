<title>Issue 20199 -   chromium -    ipc_channel_posix.cc(420)] pipe error (9): Connection reset by peer Segmentation fault  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : any 4.0.2xx (upon having updated from 3.0.9xx to any   4.0.2xx  no matter in google chrome either chromium versions on linux).      1. upon having updated from version 3 to version 4 the browser cannot start due   to the aforesaid issue  in case the browser is started with parameter --enable-  extensions (without this parameter the both browsers start smoothly).  2.it's been noticed that issue is caused only in case when having extensions which   are visible in status bar (any other extensions do not produce that issue: i.e. issue   comes with gmail  weather  delicious  gtalk and all the other extensions that are   visible in the status bar). And never come with the other extensions which are   installed but not visible in status bar.  3. I had them both checked google chrome and chromium version under linux -   the same behavior: in versions 3 they operated without the said issue. Upon   having updated to version 4.0.202 and 4.0.203 nightly - every nightly version has   this bug     </pre>
