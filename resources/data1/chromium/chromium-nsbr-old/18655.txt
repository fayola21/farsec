<title>Issue 18655 -   chromium -    9elements.com HTML5 Canvas page doesn't get past LOADING - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Followup from <a href="http://crbug.com/18470">http://crbug.com/18470</a>.      1. Visit <a href="http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/canvas/">http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/canvas/</a>  2. It hangs at LOADING.    Verified on Linux.  Haven't tried other platforms yet  but I suspect it will   be similar. </pre>
