<title>Issue 7287 -   chromium -    Chrome Task Manager does not show high CPU usage process/tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Not clear what causes the repro  but this is the second time I noticed it.  My machine ground to a halt. Windows Task Manager showed chrome.exe taking   90%+ CPU. Chrome Task Manager did not show any such process. I killed the   offending process  and no tab/plugin was affected.    See screenshot.    Please provide
