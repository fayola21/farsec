<title>Issue 1079 -   chromium -    Middle-click on tab does not close tab if a context menu is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 3.1.2: middle-click on tab never closes tab      Firefox 3.0.1: middle-click on tab always closes tab               IE 7: Middle-click on tab does not close tab if a context   menu is open         Opera 9.52: Middle-click on tab does not close tab if a context   menu is open      1. Open two tabs with web sites loaded  2. right-click in one tab  leave the context menu open  3. middle-click on tab rider      Tab should close      Nothing      Chrome has the same behaviour as IE 7 and Opera 9.52  however  I think   that the Firefox 3 behaviour is more logical: If one middle-clicks on a   tab  the user wants to close this tab  even if he previously opened a   context menu. </pre>
