<title>Issue 10561 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: unable to save text documents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: unable to save text documents    Load <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=29487">https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=29487</a>  Right click  and select &quot;save as&quot;    Problem:  Notice that the &quot;save as&quot; dialog has &quot;*...cgi id=29487&quot; as the recommended   save as type.  It also oddly suggests &quot;https   bugs.webkit.org attachment.cgi   id=29487..cgi id=29487&quot; as the file name.  Then  when I save it  it saves the   file as HTML instead of as plain text like it used to.   </pre>
