<title>Issue 6359 -   chromium -    Universal scrolling - implemented but with some issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. press scroll wheel down to activate new scrolling mode  2. move mouse        - should scroll smoothly with variable speed      - few things not ideal:  1. at 'medium' scroll speeds  the screen does redraw many times to give   a 'smooth' appearance  but the speed is not constant. The motion seems to   slow periodically  giving a 'jerky' impression. Most obvious for long   pages and only for specific scroll speeds.     2. The crosshair cursor that is shown is displaced from the location where   the mouse was clicked  which looks odd (but may be by design?)    3. The slowest smooth scroll is too fast. I like to use this mode to   glance over blog posts  but the current slowest scroll doesn't allow me to   keep up. Please slow down the slowest scroll  and speed  up the fastest   scroll. IE7 has this down perfectly IMO  so perhaps cross-check with that?    4. Perhaps unrelated  rotating the mouse wheel to scroll seems to scroll   in very small discrete steps again  as in early versions. Did this get   reverted? I prefer larger smooth looking 'steps'  which had been requested   elsewhere and implemented.     Please provide
