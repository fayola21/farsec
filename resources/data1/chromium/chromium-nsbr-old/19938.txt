<title>Issue 19938 -   chromium -    Chrome does not tile in Awesome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use a tiling layout mode in Awesome  2. Launch a couple of other applications (terminals  for instance)  3. Launch Chrome      Expected result is that Chrome will be resized by the window manager as   appropriate and put into the tiling layout. It should behave this way when   &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; is enabled  but should be free to do as   it wishes when this is not enabled.      Chrome is placed into &quot;floating&quot; mode by Awesome  bypassing the layout. I   cannot toggle this floating state  indicating Chrome is somehow   ignoring/overriding client resizes. In my case  this means that Chrome   fills the entire screen  hiding all the windows in the tiled layer unless I   explicity raise them again.    <b>Please provide
