Clicking the Add to Basket button while viewing the page in Chrome does not   trigger the Added to Basket confirmation pop up that appears in FF3.0.       What is the expected result?    Clicking Add to Basket for an item should trigger a confirmation Pop-Up.   (The item is added to your basket every time you click on the button; you   just don't receive confirmation).

Click Add to Basket  3. Nothin' happens!     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?
