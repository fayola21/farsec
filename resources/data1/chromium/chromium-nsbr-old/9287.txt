When trying to &quot;map your photos&quot;  typing in the address and clicking   &quot;go&quot; leads to no action.  It worked fine with the first photo  however    when trying to do the next photo  the page does not change to show the   address that you typed in.  2. The map originally shows up as topographic with texture  however the 2nd    map that occurs is simply a political map... </pre>
