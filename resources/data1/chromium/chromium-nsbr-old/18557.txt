<title>Issue 18557 -   chromium -    Figure out solution for web view drag and drop destination cancellation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When there is a GTK system drag over the renderer (initiated either within   chrome or from another program such as gedit)  and the tab closes  GTK   asserts. I looked into this for a long time and decided that the problem   was that GTK was not taking a reference on the drag destination widget    because if we just never delete the widget (keep it alive during tab   closing)  GTK behaves normally. The relevant asserts are triggered here:    static void    gtk_drag_dest_leave (GtkWidget      *widget   		     GdkDragContext *context   		     guint           time)  {    GtkDragDestSite *site;      site = g_object_get_data (G_OBJECT (widget)  &quot;gtk-drag-dest&quot;);    g_return_if_fail (site != NULL);    ...    The assertions are:    [12473:12473:5608188472487:ERROR:chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc(195)] GLib-  GObject: g_object_get_data: assertion `G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed  [12473:12473:5608188472525:ERROR:chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc(195)] Gtk:   gtk_drag_dest_leave: assertion `site != NULL' failed    This seems harmless in Release mode  and in any case is hit only very   infrequently. I should probably track down a solution and submit it   upstream; until I can at least point to the exact code that is wrong I   don't want to file a bug upstream. I will follow up on gtk mailing lists. </pre>
