<title>Issue 532 -   chromium -    WinXP Installer crashes if temp is a drive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                  1. set temp=c:  2. chromesetup.exe        Installer runs        Installer cant create its log file and silently exits. I guess chromesetup   requests privs not applicable to drive root path. NB I saw this behaviour   with Google Lively installer also    </pre>
