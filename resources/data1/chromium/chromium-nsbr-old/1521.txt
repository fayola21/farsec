<title>Issue 1521 -   chromium -    google:baseURL unchangable and sets Google search language purely based on IP country - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use an IP or proxy based in one country  and then switch to a service   that directs connection through an IP from another country  2. Use the omnibar for repeated Google searches from the new IP over a   period of time      Google's search engine would continue to function through google.com in the   English language  which is what my localization settings are set to in both   the browser and my Google account.
