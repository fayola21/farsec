<title>Issue 22516 -   chromium -    Parallelize WPO builds even more - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For WPO builds  parallelize more the linking steps by not enforcing runtime   dependency -&gt; build time dependency. This is especially important since the   projects are really slow to build.    Examples:  - page_cycler_tests  startup_tests  etc wouldn't need to wait for chrome_exe   and chrome_dll to finish building.   - chrome_exe wouldn't need to wait for chrome_dll to finish building. </pre>
