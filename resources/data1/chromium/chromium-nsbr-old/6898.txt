<title>Issue 6898 -   chromium -    inspector needs a different icon in &quot;alt-tab&quot; window selector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2             Safari 3: OK          1. open a web page  2. right click  open the web inspector  3. alt-tab to another application  4. alt-tab back and try to figure out which is which        It would be best if inspector windows had a different &quot;alt-tab&quot; icon than   chrome browser windows. With many browser windows open (and potentially   many attempted inspector sessions)  it becomes difficult to figure out   where you were. This is made doubly difficult since the inclusion of   inspector windows in the alt-tab order increases the # of windows to be   sifted through. Either having inspector windows not be in the alt-tab order   or giving them different alt-tab icons would be useful. </pre>
