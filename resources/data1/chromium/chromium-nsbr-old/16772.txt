<title>Issue 16772 -   chromium -    Ctrl+A  Ctrl+E  Ctrl+K do not work as expected in text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):  Ctrl+A goes to beginning of text   field  Ctrl+E goes to the end of the text field  and Ctrl+K deletes text from   the cursor position to the end of the text field.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):  Same as Safari.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:  N/A.      1.  Enter some text in a text field (e.g.  the search field at Google.com)  2.  Press Ctrl+A  Ctrl+K  or Ctrl+E.  3.  There is no step three.      The same behavior as Safari:  Ctrl+A goes to beginning of text field  Ctrl+E   goes to the end of the text field  and Ctrl+K deletes text from the cursor   position to the end of the text field.      Ctrl+A selects all text in the text field (like Cmd+A)  Ctrl+E and Ctrl+K do   nothing. </pre>
