<title>Issue 7943 -   chromium -    Mouse cursor does not move textarea cursor when left mouse button is clicked. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.164.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://wikispaces.com">http://wikispaces.com</a>            Firefox 3: OK        1. Place text into a textarea.  2. Click around in the textarea.      The input cursor is moved to the appropriate position in the textarea   depending on where the mouse cursor was when the mouse was clicked.      There is no  or inappropriate  movement of the input cursor.    While I was writing this bug  I noticed similar (but not identical)   behaviour with the Google Code textarea as well; it appears that clicking   within text works as expected  but not outside of text. Moving the input   cursor after successful clicks can also cause this behaviour. </pre>
