Run Google Chrome browser in a terminal server window on a remote   desktop  2. Open up any URL  3. Create a second tab  4. Open a Url  5. Click on first tab and move mouse before tab gets redrawn.  Dag-and-drop   will activate and tab will drag itself into a new window.  6. Behavior drives everyone here (100 users) nutz!!           To simply switch tabs and not drag-and drop the tab into a new window.      Takes extended time on terminal server to redraw dragging window - very   frustrating for users.
