<title>Issue 5496 -   chromium -    Figure out how to deal with sluggish renderers blocking accelerators - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Keyboard messages are sent to the current renderer for processing. This   allows the web page to override most keystrokes. If they are unhandled    they are echoed back to the browser process.    This is good because web pages want to see the keystrokes. They can also   override interesting commands such as Ctrl-P for print (they may want to   provide their own print preview).    However  tab and window management commands aren't well suited for this.   Even if the web page doesn't override the commands (which is very rare and   possibly harmful or annoying to the user)  the responsiveness of the   browser to these messages depends on the responsiveness of the current   renderer.    For example  if the current renderer is hung  Ctrl-W won't close the tab.   You have to use the mouse. If you have a slow or hung renderer and you use   Ctrl-PageDown to cycle through the tabs  it will stop on the hung one and   not continue.    I propose the following &quot;non-maskable&quot; commands which would be handled in   the browser and never sent to the web page for processing.    Ctrl-PageUp  Ctrl-PageDown  Ctrl-W  Ctrl-F4  Alt-F4 (this one probably already is)  Ctrl-T  Ctrl-N  Ctrl-Shift-N  Shift-Esc (task manager) </pre>
