<title>Issue 15656 -   chromium -    Scrolling doesn't update tooltip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - Go to a page with a lot of tooltips and a scrollbar (such as   <a href="http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=99">http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=99</a>)  - Move the mouse over one of the table rows so a tooltip shows up  - Use the trackpad to scroll down w/out moving the mouse    Expected:  - Tooltip should go away when the mouse leaves the table row  - Tooltip should update once the scrolling stops    Actual:  - Tooltip never goes away  it stays the same one no matter what row you   end up on. It stays up the entire time you scroll  which is jarring.    Helpwanted. </pre>
