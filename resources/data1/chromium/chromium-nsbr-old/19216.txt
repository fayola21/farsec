<title>Issue 19216 -   chromium -    Facebook : Going to enter a comment  then clicking out of the comment box instead of submitting = indefinite freeze. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39 (Official Build )  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.facebook.com">http://www.facebook.com</a>        1. If you click in to a comment box after someone has posted  or anywheere   there is a comment box  then instead of submitting the text you simply   click away out of the box (any area of blank page for eg) Chrome _may_   pause and crash indefinately  you are thren able to shut chrome down unless   you end the process.      This is off and on  it doesn't always happen - probably a good 65% it does   though.  Very frustrating. </pre>
