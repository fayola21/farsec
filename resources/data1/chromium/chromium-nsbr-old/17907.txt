<title>Issue 17907 -   chromium -    &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; opens link in new tab *and* switches to new tab instead of remaining on current tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1  OS version               : 10.5.6  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): browser does not switch to new tab  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): browser does not switch to new tab  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: browser does not switch to new tab      1. Right-click on a link.  2. Select &quot;Open link in new tab&quot;.      The link will open in a new tab  but the browser will remain on the tab containing the link.      The link opens in a new tab *and* the browser switches to the new tab.    Additional Information:  I feel like this is new since 3.0.192.x or thereabouts  but am not entirely sure. </pre>
