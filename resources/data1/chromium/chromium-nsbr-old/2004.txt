<title>Issue 2004 -   chromium -    Lock icon should be shown when a bad HTTPS resource is blocked in a secure HTTPS page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today when bad HTTPS content is blocked from a secure HTTPS page  the   security style is UNAUTHENTICATED (no lock is shown in the location bar).    The behavior is inconsistent: this happens only for bad frames (status is   AUTHENTICATED for other blocked resources such as images)    We should make the behavior consistent: if a resource has been blocked the   page is still considered secure (AUTHENTICATED  lock icon shown).    The SSLUITest.TestUnsafeContents should be changed as well as it test that   the page is unauthenticated.        More info on why this happens only with bad frames:  When a bad frame is loaded  its content is replaced with some warning text   and the response does not contain a cert id.  So it triggers the setting of the UNAUTHENTICATED style in   SSLManager::DidCommitProvisionalLoad() for lack of a cert.   </pre>
