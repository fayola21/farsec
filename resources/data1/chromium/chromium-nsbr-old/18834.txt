<title>Issue 18834 -   chromium -    Save image as removes focus from main Chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.6 (Official Build 22526)           Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open a webpage  with a picture.  2. Right click on the image and save it.  3. Now press CTRL+W to close the window. It wont happen  because the focus   is not on Chrome anymore.  4. It's very annoying  since you have to refocus the window to save another   pic or change to another tab.      Return focus to the actual window and/or tab.      Focus shifts away from Chrome window.   </pre>
