<title>Issue 21622 -   chromium -    Extension cookies file is written even when no extensions are installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was looikng at a profile for which there have never been any extensions    and it looks like an Extension Cookies file is still getting generated.    When there are no extension cookies  there should probably be no file   generated  and when there are no changes (which will probably be pretty   common even when you have extensions installed) we should be sure that   nothing is written. </pre>
