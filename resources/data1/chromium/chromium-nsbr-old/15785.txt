<title>Issue 15785 -   chromium -    Sites not loading images and displaying broken icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.30      1. Visit a site such as Facebook.com or Google Image search         Images on the page should load successfully      Images do not load and broken image icons are displayed.     Users are reporting that this issue occurs after the upgrade to 2.0.172.30   and that images work fine in other browsers such as IE/FF. Sometimes a  refresh will load the images  but this happens often enough that users are  downgrading and finding that that resolves the issue.     Other problematic sites mentioned are Google Reader  Lifehacker  Flickr   etc. Will try to obtain more specific URLs.    </pre>
