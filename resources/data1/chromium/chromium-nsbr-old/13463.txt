<title>Issue 13463 -   chromium -    Field trial experiments should &quot;time out&quot; some time after the build date - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many users appear to use old versions of Chromium.  Since statistical tests   are (usually) only monitored for a fixed length of time  we should cause   any field trial tests to turn them selves off after some standard (default)   period of time. </pre>
