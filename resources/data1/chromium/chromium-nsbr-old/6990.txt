<title>Issue 6990 -   chromium -    Cursor wonkiness while selecting word-at-a-time in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Double-click in the omnibox  hold the second click  and drag around.  Your   cursor is an I-beam when it's off the selection  but an arrow when it's   over it.  This goofy behavior (which comes from the underlying   CRichEditCtrl) doesn't match sane apps like Visual Studio  or even single-  click-drag-mode  where the cursor is an I-beam all the time in this case.    A judicious SetCursor() ought to fix this but I have to figure out where to   put it.   </pre>
