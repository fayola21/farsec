<title>Issue 13961 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: javascript console auto complete is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1    A few versions ago  when typing an object's name inside the Inspector    it was writing the object's name and showing an arrow  when clicking on the   arrow it shows the whole tree of that object's children.  Now it just write '[Object object]'    This is too bad  because the object inspection was a real treat for   developers. </pre>
