<title>Issue 11951 -   chromium -    Default browser infobar doesn't interact well with session restore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have &quot;restore my last session&quot; turned on. When I started  I saw the &quot;not   your default browser&quot; infobar  and I was going to click it. But then the   contents of that page loaded as a result of session restore  and the   infobar went away.    We peobably need to special-case session restore to not trigger these   types of infobars going away. </pre>
