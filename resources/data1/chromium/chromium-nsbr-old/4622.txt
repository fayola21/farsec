<title>Issue 4622 -   chromium -    Suggestion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Describe security bug here  with as much details and steps to reproduce as   possible. Security bugs are visible only to the reporter and to project   members.)  I cannot find a place to submit a suggestion about Google Chrome so this is   the best I can do  hope it gets redirected to the right place!  I would   like to see the following modification to Google Chrome - Under tools;   options; on startup; have a bullet that allows one to customize what &quot;most   visited&quot; icon pages you want to appear first time  every time Chrome opens.    This way you can have your most visited sites be truly what you want to   come up  and not just a running list of websites that have been visited   over the last few days.  The running list can be added in after your   favorites opens.  And put a place in for feedback on your product!!! </pre>
