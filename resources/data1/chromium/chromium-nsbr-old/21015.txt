<title>Issue 21015 -   chromium -    Refactor HttpAuthHandler interface to more cleanly support multi-round auth schemes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The HttpAuthHandler interface was originally design for Basic/Digest schemes  which don't have the   concept of multiple &quot;rounds&quot;  and are not connection-based schemes.    We should push the necessary abstractions down into HttpAuthHandler / HttpNetworkTransaction   so the NTLM code is less confusing. </pre>
