<title>Issue 8735 -   chromium -    Cannot set cursor position or highlight a closing tag in inspector  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is b/1182077    Steps  --------  1. Open a webpage and do an inspect element  2. Look for a closing tag (i.e. &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/form&gt; )      Issue  --------  You cannot set your cursor to move to that closing tag. (in Firebug  you   can).  If you use the arrow keys to move through the lines of code  the cursor   skips the closing tag and goes to the next opening tag. </pre>
