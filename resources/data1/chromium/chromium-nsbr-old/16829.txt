<title>Issue 16829 -   chromium -    IPC infrastructure should be separated from common - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The 'common' project has a lot of IPC infrastructure  which is not particularly   Chromium-specific  as well as utilities and data that is very Chromium-  specific such as command-line flags.  'common' also has a dependency on   webkit-glue which pulls in a dependency on webkit+webcore.    It would be useful  especially for other projects wishing to use some of   Chromium's infrastructure  if the IPC related code was pulled into a separate   project with slimmer dependencies.  agl@ attempted this at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13062">r13062</a> but issues   with the windows build system thwarted the attempt.  Now that everything is   gyp generated this should be easier. </pre>
