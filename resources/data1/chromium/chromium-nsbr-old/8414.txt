<title>Issue 8414 -   chromium -    Increase limit in cookie count - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From IRC  someone reported that our limit for cookies (1000) is too low.    They posted a patch to up it to 2000.  From their cookie database:    sqlite&gt; select count(distinct(host_key)) from cookies;  476  sqlite&gt; select count(*) from cookies;  1158    The cookies database file was 336 896 bytes  and after a vacuum it was   221 184.    Would it make sense to change this limit? </pre>
