<title>Issue 5541 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: bad drop-shadow rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: bad drop-shadow rendering    1.0.155.0 (Developer Build 6991)    I loaded up Gmail  used the &quot;More actions...&quot; widget  and noticed some   errors in the way the drop-shadow gets painted.  I'm guessing that this   must be a Skia regression.   </pre>
