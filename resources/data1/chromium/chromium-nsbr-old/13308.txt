<title>Issue 13308 -   chromium -    Bookmark searching should search within URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My wife had this site bookmarked:  <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en">http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en</a>    The word &quot;census&quot; doesn't appear in the title  but that's what the page is  about. The bookmark search in the omnibox only searches titles.    It should be straightforward to add the URL terms to the index as well. </pre>
