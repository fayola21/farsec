<title>Issue 9572 -   chromium -    gmail: Address autocompletion does not work for Korean names - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> How to reproduce:    0. Install Korean IME  1. Add the following 3 addresses to the addressbook:       - ��_鍕�_��_��_��_��_ &lt;kildong@example.com&gt;     - ��_鍕�_��_��_��__��_ &lt;kilsu@example.com&gt;     - ��_����__��_��__��_ &lt;chunhyang@foobar.org&gt;       2. In 'To' field of a new email  switch to Korean IME    3. Type '��_�' by pressing 'ghd' and press 'right arrow key'  [1]    What's expected:       Two email addresses '��_鍕�_��_��_��_��_' and '��_鍕�_��_��_��__��_' should show up as candidates.    Actual:      No candidate shows up.     To get candidates  one can do the following :    1. Type at least two Korean syllables (e.g. '��_鍕�_��_��_')  2. Press tab to move to the next field  3. Press shift-tab to move back to 'To' field  4. Move the cursor to the right of the second syllable and press   'backspace' to delete the second (last) syllable    This also happens in Safari 3.x on Windows. So  it's either a Webkit issue   or 'Gmail - Webkit' compat issue. I'll also file this internally against   gmail.     Xiaolu:  can you test with C&amp;J IMEs?     [1] Gmail's autocompletion needs more work. It should work without pressing   the right arrow key  but currently it does not. It used to work better than   this and it seems to be a regression in gmail's autocompletion.        It's reported in the Chrome Korean U2U group.    </pre>
