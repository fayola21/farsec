<title>Issue 10592 -   chromium -    crash reporter loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53 (Official Build 11798)                    Unclear            Crash reporter windows continuously appear. Surprisingly Vista's dwm copes   with hundreds of windows  but Chrome does not recover or end. I had to kill   Chrome using task manager. On restart it offered to reload my tabs which   worked.    Sorry for the lack of details  I have no idea what triggered this.     </pre>
