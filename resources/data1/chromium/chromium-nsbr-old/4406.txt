<title>Issue 4406 -   chromium -    Move window saving to browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per discussion with sky...    Create a window saver class in chrome/browser that saves the window   placement information to the local store.    Add a saver static member to WindowDelegate  and set this on startup to the   saver in the chrome/browser dir    Have base class impls of state set/get in WindowDelegate defer to this   saver if it exists.    This will break the browser dependency from chrome/views/window_delegate </pre>
