<title>Issue 2981 -   chromium -    Page cache behavior differs from Firefox  IE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30 (2200)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://skrul.com/cache.php">http://skrul.com/cache.php</a>           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Navigate to <a href="http://skrul.com/cache.php">http://skrul.com/cache.php</a>  2. Click the |link| link  note how the page's age increases  3. Click in the address bar to give the bar focus  and press enter      Page's age should continue to increase      Page's age is reset    The cache.php file serves a page with an Expires: header 24 hours in the  future.  I don't know how much this matters  but the behavior is different  from both IE and Firefox -- IE and Firefox serve the cached version of the  page when you hit enter in the address bar  where Safari and Chromium will  get the page from the net.   </pre>
