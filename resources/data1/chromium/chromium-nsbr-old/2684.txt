<title>Issue 2684 -   chromium -    Youtube shaking wii video freezes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/experiencewii">http://www.youtube.com/experiencewii</a>  2. Play/watch the video  3. Video will eventually freeze/stutter      Video should run smoothly  not freeze  not stutter.  Works fine on FF3.    I found that once the video froze  I was able to &quot;un-freeze&quot; it by   selecting parts of the page  or sometimes just clicking/double-clicking.    I'm not sure if this is issuing some interrupt that gets the plugin out of   a loop or something...?    System specs:  Win XP SP 2  Chrome 149.30  Flash 9.  Intel Core 2 Duo  2.37Ghz  2GB RAM. </pre>
