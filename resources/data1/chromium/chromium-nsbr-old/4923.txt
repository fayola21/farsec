<title>Issue 4923 -   chromium -    Closing last tab using Ctrl+W should not make it restore if you select 'Restore open tabs' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25           Safari 3: CAN'T BE DONE      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: NOT TESTED      1. Open a window with a tab  go to any address  2. Close with the tab close  3. Re-open chrome      After re-opening Chrome  the tab should open new tab page.      Chrome re-open the last tab you closed.    Since you are closing the tab  not Chrome  it means you want to get out of   that page. So  after restarting chrome  it should open chrome with a new   tab.  If you are closing entire Chrome. Then it should re-open the last opened   tab(s) on next launch.     </pre>
