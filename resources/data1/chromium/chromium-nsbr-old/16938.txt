<title>Issue 16938 -   chromium -    Hulu Flash video Ads don't display; interrupts viewing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a video on Veoh (for the purposes of this bug  the one at the URL   above; any video should do  though).  2. Watch the video.  3. Notice the ads don't display; eventually an error displays.      Ads display; if they are unavailable for whatever reason  an error should   display once for every time an ad is requested  and only for 30 seconds.      Ads don't display; when they are requested they are either skipped entirely   or the error is displayed. If the error is not displayed  later it will   display and get stuck in a loop  preventing the rest of the video from   displaying.    <b>Please provide
