<title>Issue 424 -   chromium -    can't turn off &quot;recent bookmarks&quot; and &quot;recently closed tabs&quot; sections on the new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Describe security bug here  with as much details and steps to reproduce as   possible. Security bugs are visible only to the reporter and to project   members.)    - A user should be able to choose whether the &quot;recent bookmarks&quot; and the   &quot;recently closed tabs&quot; sections appears on the &quot;new tab&quot; page.  There   should be an &quot;X&quot; to remove these sections in the title bar of these   sections.    Since I have no control when and how this appears  another user opening the   browser could potentially see the last bookmarks visited or closed.    I would consider this a security risk  a low risk  but a risk none the   less.      thanks.....    </pre>
