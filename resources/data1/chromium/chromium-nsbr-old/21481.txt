<title>Issue 21481 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Content not drawn for background-opened tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Open content in background tabs (e.g.  I Ctrl+click on a link) and then moving to those tabs either by clicking on the   tab or kb shortcut. Once I force a redraw  e.g. by &quot;restoring&quot; the chromium window from maximized to windowed size  the   current broken screen will repaint properly &amp; once I've done that for that tab  that tab is no longer broken although   other tabs still may be broken until I force a redraw on those  as well.      When I click on a tab that is not currently up front (or Ctrl+Tab to one or even Alt+Tab to another maximized chromium   window)  I expect to see the content of that tab.       I see the content of whatever was painted on the screen last. This could be the last tab  it could be menu a menu from   something in the taskbar  etc. Note: the text in the tab &amp; the address bar of the broken tab correctly shows the title of   the page that *should* be drawn as well as the correct URL.    <b>Please provide
