<title>Issue 17222 -   chromium -    Context menu for location bar has a lot of cruft - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 195.0 (Developer Build 21063)    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): a little less cruft  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): only the basics        1. Go to the location bar.  2. Right click.  3. Observe.      A reasonable menu (e.g.  Firefox gives you Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete/Select All).      We get the whole kitchen  including lots of inapplicable items (e.g.  the Font/Writing Direction   submenus) and highly dubious items (e.g.  Spelling and Grammar/Substitutions). Various items   are enabled  yet don't do anything.
