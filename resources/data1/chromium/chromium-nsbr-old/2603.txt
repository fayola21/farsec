<title>Issue 2603 -   chromium -    Site searches vanish before they can be selected when entering partial URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.any        1. Enter a partial URL of a website with a stored search (i.e. the option   'Search site.tld for &lt;enter query&gt;'  2. Attempt to select the 'search site' option        I'd like to be able for Chrome to recognize a partial URL to a site with a   search  to suggest the full URL to that page first  followed by the 'search   site for blah' option.        The 'search site for blah' option disappears and is replaced with either a   page within the site (or  the site matching the partial url)  or a Google   Suggest-ion.     What I'd like to see is that  when a match for a base URL is made (i.e.   Google.com  whatever)  and a site-specific search for that site is active    that the 'search site for blargh' option remains at the top of the list of   suggestions underneath the address bar  instead of vanishing when more data   about the partial url becomes available. When more than one site matches   the partial url  and matches it closely (i.e. google.com and googol.com    whatever)  the list of base URLs is displayed first  and a list of site-  specific searches is listed after that.    I'm not sure if this proposed behavior is shared with more people  if   there's enough that believe the thing should work differently  it might be   neat to make it a configurable feature. </pre>
