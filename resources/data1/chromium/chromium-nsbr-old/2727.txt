<title>Issue 2727 -   chromium -    Broken Download  Cache Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.154.0 (Developer Build 2496)             Safari 3: n/a      Firefox 3: n/a           IE 7: n/a      1. Start downloading a file  of reasonable size  2. Interrupt the download  i.e. disconnect and reconnect internet  3. Try downloading the file again      The full file should be downloaded      The partial download has been cached and is served instead of the full   file.    The cache could be used to resume the download where available  but it   should not assume the file was completely downloaded.    Or provide an option on the failed download to restart  but the resume is   preferable. </pre>
