<title>Issue 16044 -   chromium -    Enable (use system title bar and border) doesn't redraw Openbox titlebar  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.2  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox            1. Disable the option: Use system title bar and borders  2. As you can see the Openbox title bar will be hidden.   3. Now enable the option: Use system title bar and borders      The Openbox title bar should be showed again (redraw)      The close/restore and close button disappear  but I don't see the Openbox   title bar    Obs: To see the Openbox Title bar  I need to restart Chrome Browser.    See the screenshot uploaded to see Chrome with option (Use system title bar   and borders) enabled but without restart the browser.   </pre>
