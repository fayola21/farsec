<title>Issue 16536 -   chromium -    Google Chrome not working confirmed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I play a video game complete full screen.  2. I alt-tab or click the windows key to go to my desktop  3. Run Google Chrome and it doesn't work. Cannot go to websites or click  anything. The main page runs then nothing more. Long time problem.      Google Chrome shouldn't freeze or stop. I have to use IE or firefox in  order to go to websites while anything full screen minimized.      Google Chrome fails to work and just gets stuck there. Only thing to do is  close it.    <b>Please provide
