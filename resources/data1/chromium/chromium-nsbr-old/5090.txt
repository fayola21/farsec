<title>Issue 5090 -   chromium -    NewTabPage Thumbnail not updating - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have one thumbnail on my new-tab page that hasn't updated since somewhere   in the beginning I used chrome  and I've been using chrome since the   beginning (2 september).    I visit <a href="http://www.register.co.uk/">http://www.register.co.uk/</a> a couple of times per week. The   thumbnail is still showing the reg's previous design  and they've updated   somewhere in september.   </pre>
