<title>Issue 5738 -   chromium -    RTL: App drop-down menu should be displayed below the favicon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Broken on Trunk build: Chromium (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7307">r7307</a>).    Works fine in Dev channel Chrome (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7133">r7133</a>).    -Launch an Application shortcut for a RTL (arabic is fine)  -Click on Application favicon (to-right) to display the drop-down list.    Expected:  The menu should be displayed just below the favicon.    Result:  The menu is displayed in quite opp direction (screenshot attached)    This is funny and annoying too.           </pre>
