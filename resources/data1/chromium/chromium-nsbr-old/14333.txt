Navigation panel (flash) at the top of the page is not visible from time to   time. I suspect it's a timeout problem. Http? Hitting F5 several times might   show or hide it.      What is the expected result?    Navigation panel should be always visible.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Goto: <a href="http://www.sawatzky.ru/services/Default.aspx">http://www.sawatzky.ru/services/Default.aspx</a>  2. Refresh page (F5) many times and see possible renderings.  3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Firefox 3.0.10: Ok    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
