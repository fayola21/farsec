<title>Issue 17195 -   chromium -    The close button on the Mac Info Bar is off. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 195.0 (Developer Build )  OS version               : Mac OS X 10.5.7        1. Any event that causes an infobar to be opened up.      The close (X) should be aligned with the text.       Right now it is way above touching the top of the infobar which looks unpleasing to the eye. </pre>
