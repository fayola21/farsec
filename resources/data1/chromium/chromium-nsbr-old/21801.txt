<title>Issue 21801 -   chromium -    Move gatekeeper config to chromium-status.appspot.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  the configuration lives in master.chromium/master.cfg. Changing   the steps requires a restart. If the logic was in the appengine instance    that would make it easier for build sheriff to 'mute' a step on the fly.    The main issue with this implementation is the sheer number of steps that   happens in a second vs the time an http connection takes. I'm afraid it could   kill buildbot performance. </pre>
