<title>Issue 1367 -   chromium -    Chrome does not impelemnt 'find as you type' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : Any        Firefox 3: OK      1. Open some page and focus its content (by mouse click or whatever)  2. Start typing your search term      Chrome should continuously look the page content for the character sequence  I've entered and highlight what it founds.      Nothing - one must tap Ctrl+F to open a &quot;Find dialog&quot; (i.e. textbox on the  top of a page).    Obviously it's not a bug but rather feature/enhancement request. The find  textbox should appear not only upon hotkey tap but also when I start to  enter something into any widget on webpage rather than dedicated text entry  widgets. This behavior should also be configurable via Settings.    </pre>
