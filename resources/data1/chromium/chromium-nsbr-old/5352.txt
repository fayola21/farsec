<title>Issue 5352 -   chromium -    When downloading a file  if the disk fills up  chrome pretends to keep downloading. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.31        1. Start downloading a file  2. Fill up the hard drive  3. Watch        Chrome should pause the download  and possibly inform the user that the   download didn't complete because the disk filled up.        Bytes are magically lost somewhere. An interesting &quot;feature&quot; of this bug is   that if you fill up your disk  then free up space again  a segment   somewhere within the middle of the file gets lost.     </pre>
