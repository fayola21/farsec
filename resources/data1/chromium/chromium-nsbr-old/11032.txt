<title>Issue 11032 -   chromium -    Triple-click selection doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is reported to work on Windows  which means it's probably a plumbing   problem in our code.  I suspect GTK may have a triple-click message that   we're not handling?  Or maybe we need to translate double+single into a   triple?    (Putting the masters of input on CC in case they have insight.) </pre>
