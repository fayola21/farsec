<title>Issue 20124 -   chromium -    Add sync re-login to UMA stats - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are three places in the UI where we indicate to the user that they need   to re-enter their password when their credentials expire: the New Tab Page    the Options dialog and the Bookmarks bar. We need to add these to UMA   alongside the other sync events. </pre>
