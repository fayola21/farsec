<title>Issue 20926 -   chromium -    Open a new (second window) window should open on same height  if the first window is full expanded vertically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.0 (25218)    OS version               : Version 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Okay  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Okay  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not testet      1. Open a window in full expanded to the vertical size (from menubar until the visible/unvisible   dock)  2. Open a new second window (cmd+n)      The new second window should open on same height  when the first window is full expanded   vertically.      What happens instead? The new second window opens displaced down. The Problem is  that the   the new window always has to be moved manually the top to see the rest of the window at the   bottom.    (Info: The actual behaviour is okay  if the window is not expanded full vertically.)      Thanks and regards  Mehmet   </pre>
