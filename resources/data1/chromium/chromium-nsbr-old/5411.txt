<title>Issue 5411 -   chromium -    Session Restore startup performance could be better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed two speed bottlenecks when running with the &quot;restore last   session&quot; startup pref:    - time to first window is considerably longer than &quot;show new tab page&quot;   startup option    - when system is under heavy load or has just been restarted  when I start   Chrome all of the tabs are white and spin the throbbers for a noticably   long amount of time  after which something magical happens and they begin   to actually appear    Seems like this feature could benefit from some profiling. </pre>
