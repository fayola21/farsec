<title>Issue 20117 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't respect http-equiv refresh with space instead of semicolon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome doesn't redirect on load of  <a href="http://exploration.nasa.gov/programs/station/index.html">http://exploration.nasa.gov/programs/station/index.html</a>  like Firefox does.  The line  -- snip --  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0  url=<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Summary.html">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Summary.html</a>&quot;&gt;  -- snip --  is not being obeyed.  Note the space where a semicolon usually is.    This is almost a dup of <a title="Chrome doesn't respect http-equiv refresh of bbs.hasea.com web pages" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3162"> bug 3162 </a>  but that one was merged into  a big-ball-o-hair bug  let's have a nice simple separate bug for this. </pre>
