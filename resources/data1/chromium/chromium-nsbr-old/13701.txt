<title>Issue 13701 -   chromium -    Controls are drawing in the wrong colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.1.182.5  URLs (if applicable) : google.com for example  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):refuse to answer  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Go to any page with a control      It has the normal blue tint.      It looks as if color correction is broken (only in web contents  the url bar   tint is still fine).    See first picture for how the url bar tint looks (good) and the others for   how web content looks (the goggles! they do nothing!).    If the pictures end up without an extension  rename them to png. I'm just   doing cmd-shift-4 and then uploading the files from my desktop. </pre>
