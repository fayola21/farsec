<title>Issue 6501 -   chromium -    While &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; can be middle-clicked  subfolders can't be. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a sub-folder using the bookmarks manager with links inside.  2. On the main interface's bookmark toolbar  click &quot;Other bookmarks&quot;.  3. Middle-click the subfolder.      Like middle-clicking the &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; folder  a warning prompts if too   many tabs will be opened if I complete this action  and if I accept  the   links inside the subfolder will open in individual tabs.      Nothing.    Please provide
