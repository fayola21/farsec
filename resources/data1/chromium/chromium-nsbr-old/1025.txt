<title>Issue 1025 -   chromium -    Keyboard Switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome and have more than 1 tab open.  2. Navigate to each tab using one of the supported shortcut keys.3.       I expect to use any other shortcut keys to be able to navigate between each   tab completely (left to right and right to left).      I cannot go from left to right starting from first tab using CTRL + TAB.    CTRL + TAB + SHIFT will go right to left if starting from any other tab   that is not the first  but it will not go back to the very right once it   gets to the first tab.  CTRL + PgUP and/or CTRL + PgDwn are the only   selections that you can use to go left to right and right to left   completely in a loop.    Please provide
