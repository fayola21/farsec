<title>Issue 16915 -   chromium -    GTK Theme:Star/Go button/entry area don't match GTK+ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.195.0 (Developer Build 20863)  OS + version : Linux      1. set chrome to use GTK+ theme    To further test this  got make sure you have some backward history but no   forward history. The &quot;Next&quot; button will be display grayed out = disabled.   Now compare this to the Star button and the URL entry: those look even more   grayed out. Same for the &quot;go to&quot; button and also the page/wrench buttons.    IMHO at least the Star and Goto buttons need to better match the   active/disabled border colors of the GTK theme. Fill color could also be   mimicked better but that's not the biggest problem.    Also  drawing the Star/Goto/Page/Wrench &quot;glyphs&quot; with a grayed out look   makes it very hard to guess the state of the buttons. IMHO there are two   possible solutions:   a) use proper (colored) icons  if possible themed ones  or   b) draw the glyphs in a known-to-be readable color (e.g. GTK theme's text   color). </pre>
