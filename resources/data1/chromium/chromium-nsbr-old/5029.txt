<title>Issue 5029 -   chromium -    OnBeforeUnload event can be fired more than once - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a page with a blocking window.onbeforeunload (that opens a dialog)   for example  2. Close the tab  try clicking multiple times on the x button.    The onbeforeunload handler is invoked more than once.  It is not easy to see because we have a 1 sec time-out after which we close   the tab anyway.     </pre>
