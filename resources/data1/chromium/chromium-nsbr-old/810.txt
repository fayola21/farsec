<title>Issue 810 -   chromium -    Non- Windows Live supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Well  it's not really a bug. But just want to report the when I try to   access Windowslive email account  it announces that I should take a browser   update such as downloading Firefox  Internet explorer  etc.. Seems because   it's a new beta release.    Thank you for your new browser  Great work. Keep finishing the final   release. Will reports any bugs i find out.
