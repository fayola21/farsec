<title>Issue 12622 -   chromium -    Non-minimized Chrome windows prevent PC from turning off display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am running the Dev channel on Windows Vista 64.  This problem has occurred   as long as I can recall.    The system is set to turn off the display after 20 minutes of inactivity and   sleep never.  If I have a non-minimized Chrome window  my PC will never turn   off the display.  If all Chrome windows are minimized  things work OK. </pre>
