<title>Issue 3013 -   chromium -    Clicking the &quot;Back to safety&quot; button on the SSL interstitial page loses the security style of the original page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am using Google Chrome 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519) and  Chromium tip-of-trunk developer build.  This bug is in both  builds.    First  browse to a page with a security style  for example   <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">https://www.wellsfargo.com/</a> (good SSL)  or <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/">https://alioth.debian.org/</a>  (click &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; to get broken SSL).    Then  type &quot;<a href="https://etrade.com/">https://etrade.com/</a>&quot; in the location bar.  In the  interstitial page  click &quot;Back to safety&quot;.    This brings us back to the original page  but the original page  now has the unauthenticated (HTTP) security style.   </pre>
