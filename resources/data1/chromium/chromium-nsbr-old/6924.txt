<title>Issue 6924 -   chromium -    Scrollbar tickmarks on multi-frame pages are permanent (until reload) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0 (8550)        Firefox 3: OK        Opera 9: OK      1. Search for some text that appears multiple times on a page (so matches   are highlighted) somewhere with multiple frames  2. Exit the search window      The tickmarks on the scrollbar should disappear after exiting the search   window.  OR at least when you clear the search text.      The tickmarks remain.    This seems to only happen with multiple frame webpages.  This is an example:  <a href="http://www.epochrypha.com/japanese/verbs/verbs.html">http://www.epochrypha.com/japanese/verbs/verbs.html</a>  Search for 'a' there and exit the search window.  Try to get those pesky tickmarks to go away.  The only way is to reload the page which isn't really intuitive (and those   tickmarks can be quite distracting). </pre>
