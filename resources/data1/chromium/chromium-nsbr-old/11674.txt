<title>Issue 11674 -   chromium -    Move Always On Top off window delegate and into Task Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The task manager should implement its always on top window menu item itself   and not rely on Window to do it for it. Window can still support always-on-  top mode  but the UI to toggle it should be left to the user. This allows us   to remove a string and a command from the views dependency list. </pre>
