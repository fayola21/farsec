<title>Issue 22957 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame should be usable using a proper HTTP response header - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome Frame    As Chrome Frame is activated using a meta 'http-equiv'  that implies that if there was a HTTP   response header named 'X-UA-Compatible'  then Chrome Frame should behave exactly as if it was   set in the &lt;meta&gt; tag.    In PHP this would be done with:    &lt;?php header('X-UA-Compatible: chrome=1'); ?&gt;    Setting this header currently has no affect on Chrome Frame in IE8 on Windows7. </pre>
