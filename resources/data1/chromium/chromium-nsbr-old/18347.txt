<title>Issue 18347 -   chromium -    New windows contain both NNTP and about:linux-splash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.196.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22005">r22005</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  window manager: ion3    When I start Chrome or open a new window by starting a new process while   Chrome is already running  the new window contains two tabs  the NNTP and   about:linux-splash.  Just showing one of the two (I don't really care which)   would be better.    I get the two-tab windows on two of my computers  but just about:linux-splash   on my laptop.  The difference in behavior appears to be caused by the session   section of the Preferences file on my laptop explicitly stating that only   about:linux-splash should be restored on startup.   </pre>
