<title>Issue 3769 -   chromium -    update plugin finder to help people install Java 10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Java 10 is out of beta.  Users should get an appropriate missing plugin message with a link to the   correct download page <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a> when they   encounter a page that uses Java.    Currently  we tell them that the plugin is not supported.     </pre>
