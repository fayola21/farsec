A lot of times when you attach an attachment in any email service  Chrome   crashes. It does not happen all the time           What is the expected result?  The attachment should successfully get attached and chrome should smoothly   work.           What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. It does not happen all the time  so I don't exactly know how to   reproduce it.   2. Try attaching something to an email and send it across.   3. If attachment is of a large size  like 8-10 mb  it happens more often.      Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes. Firefox  IE.     Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
