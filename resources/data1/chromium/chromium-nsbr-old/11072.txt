<title>Issue 11072 -   chromium -    run_webkit_tests generates bad baseline images when the image doesn't change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. run_webkit_test.sh --new-baseline PassingTestWithImage    Note that the new image file for the test isn't what it should be.    The problem is that test_shell doesn't output an image when the hash doesn't change.     &quot;Only encode and dump the png if the hashes don't match.&quot;     </pre>
