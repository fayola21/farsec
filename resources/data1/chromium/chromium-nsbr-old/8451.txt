<title>Issue 8451 -   chromium -    Clear Browsing Data dialog remembers settings after Cancel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10990)        1. Wrench menu &gt; Clear Browsing Data   2. Check some checkboxes  make some selection in the dropdown list.  3. Hit Cancel  4. Bring up Clear Browsing Data dialog again.    What is the expected output?     After canceling  the settings should not be remembered. (The Import  Bookmarks and Settings dialog works that way.)    What do you see instead?    After canceling  the setting you made are remembered next time.    At any rate  the dialogs should probably work in a consistent way.   </pre>
