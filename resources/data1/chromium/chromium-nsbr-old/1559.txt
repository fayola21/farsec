<title>Issue 1559 -   chromium -    Navigation Usability - swap 'go to' / 'stop' with 'bookmark' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Use Chrome    A Navigation / usability recommendation would be to have all the actual   navigation buttons closer together.  Back  Forward  and Refresh are all   next to each other ... however  Go To and Stop is clear on the other side   of the app.  I would recommend that the 'bookmark' star and the Go To   'play' / Stop 'X' be swapped to properly group all navigation controls   together.     </pre>
