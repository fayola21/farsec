<title>Issue 17999 -   chromium -    Logic to detect if browser is already running is inaccurate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This isn't fully reproducible  but sometimes after Chrome crashes when I try   to restart it  nothing happens. So I try from the command line and it says:    calebegg@skids:~$ google-chrome   /opt/google/chrome/chrome: Symbol `SSL_ImplementedCiphers' has different   size in shared object  consider re-linking  Created new window in existing browser session.    I am pretty sure that it's not still running. pgrep -l chrome returns   nothing. The only thing I have found that helps is restarting X or using a   different --user-data-dir.    The bug in all of this is not really the crashing; it's that whatever is   being used to detect if the browser is already running is inaccurate; it's   possible for Chrome to crash in such a way that it is left in a state where   it looks like the browser is still running  but it isn't. </pre>
