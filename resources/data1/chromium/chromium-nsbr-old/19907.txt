<title>Issue 19907 -   chromium -    &quot;Extension install error&quot; dialog shows wrong icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download a few crx theme file from that &quot;get themes&quot; site  2. Undo each of the themes after installing it  3. Click the crx file in the download shelf  4. Observe &quot;Extension Install Error&quot; dialog appears (that's fine).        The alert should use the chrome icon. Instead it shows the &quot;warning&quot; icon    which should only be used in severe situations  such as possible data loss   (see apple HIG).       </pre>
