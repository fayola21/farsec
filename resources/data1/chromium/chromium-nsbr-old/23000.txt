<title>Issue 23000 -   chromium -    Allow externally conditionalized requests with multiple conditions to update the cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a request contains both if-modified-since AND if-none-match    We currently disallow such conditional response from updating the cache.    We should allow this  but need to take particular care to make sure that both of the validators   match what is in our cache (having a mismatched validator could compromise the cache's integrity    since there is no telling which of the conditions will be used by the proxy servers / target server). </pre>
