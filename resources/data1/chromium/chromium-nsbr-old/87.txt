<title>Issue 87 -   chromium -    Incorrect rendering of PNG alpha channel for opacity of less than 100% - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Go to the URL indicated above.    2. Click on the 'idischarge' logo.    3. Wait for the interior page to load.    4. Drag mouse across the play / pause button (center of screen)        A. - As indicated in the attached screen shot  the images making up the thumbnail bar (appears   when the play / pause button area is moused) should appear at an opacity of 70% (set via CSS   opacity attribute) with PNG alpha transparency properly rendered.         A. - Chrome does not render PNG alpha channel properly at opacity of less than 100%.  Instead    the alpha channel constituent of the PNG graphic (in this case transparency) is rendered with a   white BG  as can be seen by visiting the URL in question.  Also watch the fade in and fade out of   the thumbnails background - note the ugly white BG that appears until the opacity of the region   reaches 100% .  at which time the PNG alpha will be fully rendered  including its transparency.    <b>Please provide
