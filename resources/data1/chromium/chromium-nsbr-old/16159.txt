<title>Issue 16159 -   chromium -    Middle-clicking link to .crx file produced uncloseable tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I middle-clicked a link in an email (in gmail) to a CRX file.  (Can't share   the link  it was on the Google corporate network.)  I got a new background   tab (called &quot;Untitled&quot; with URL about:blank) and a dialog asking if I   wanted to install the extension.  After clicking &quot;OK&quot;  the extension   installed  but the newly-created tab was not closeable: middle-clicking it    clicking its close box  and hitting ctrl-w with it focused all did nothing.    When I dragged it out into a new window I clicked the window close box and   still got nothing.  Finally I pulled up the task manager  which had this   tab and my gmail tab in the same process  and killed the process; at this   point the new window disappeared.    During this time I could manually create tabs (via ctrl-t) and close them   just fine.    I have no idea who should own this.  I picked a few people who have a small   chance of knowing.  Please feel free to reassign. </pre>
