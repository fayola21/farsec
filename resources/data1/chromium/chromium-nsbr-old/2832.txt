<title>Issue 2832 -   chromium -    Latin characters rendered with CJK typefaces in URL bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1206136&gt;    Copy the string &quot;Sans Serif?��_��__&quot; into the clipboard.  Paste it twice into  the URL bar.  The second run of Latin characters is rendered with the  Chinese font SimSun  rather than Tahoma.    If you type the Latin runs (rather than copy and paste them)  Tahoma is  used instead of SimSun. Wordpad shows a similar problem  except for the  latter behavior -- in Wordpad  typing Latin characters after SimSun results  in SimSun  not Tahoma.     </pre>
