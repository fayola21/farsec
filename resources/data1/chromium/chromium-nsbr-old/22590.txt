<title>Issue 22590 -   chromium -    mp4/aac does not playback on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build chrome with the branded ffmpeg binaries  2. Open a page with a &lt;video src=&quot;somefile.mp4&quot; controls /&gt; tag.  3. Star in amazement at the light-green box without a video.        It should play the video. It doesn't.  Ffmpeg is rejecting the mp4 stream during   av_open_input_file with  return value of -96  which  on mac  is the posix errno ENODATA   according to /usr/include/sys/errno.h.    Using --simple-data-source and/or --single-process does not make it work better.    Oddly enough  ogv works.  Also  running the same ffmpeg binaries with media_bench seems to   work.  Someone should verify my steps though.    When using media_bench on mac  make sure to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. </pre>
