<title>Issue 3195 -   chromium -    we should get rid of base.sln  net.sln sandbox.sln and (maybe) webkit.sln - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since we no longer have code checkout modules  it seems pointless to have   these extra solution files.  It would be easier for us to just maintain   chrome.sln and chrome_kjs.sln.  My main concern is that webkit.sln might be   building a different test_shell than chrome.sln.  It would be easy to   regress this.    We would need to create fake vcproj targets that would build the subset of   chrome.sln for base  net and webkit (maybe only webkit that builds   test_shell and test_shell_tests).     </pre>
