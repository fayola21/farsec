<title>Issue 8733 -   chromium -    fast/repaint/transform-replaced-shadows.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There seem to be multiple problems:  * Chromium's box is 2px bigger in each dimensions than Safari's  * Chromium's box has 1 less margin pixel on top and left compared to Safari  * Chromium's shadow is bigger (and IMO uglier)  * Repainting is goofy    I have heard eroman is working on something related to the last item. </pre>
