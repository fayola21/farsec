<title>Issue 6572 -   chromium -    Edit box on some web site respond very slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Google internal buganizer site  2. Edit a bug with many comments  3. Type some text in the edit box  then try to modify the text in the edit   box      Step 1: Should navigate to the site right away  step 3: Text edit should be smooth      Step 1: it takes a long time to navigate to the site  while firefox and IE   does not no time to get there.  Step 3: The editing overlapping with the text after it. For example  if I   hit backspace to del 3 characters  it will show &quot;333&quot; over the characters   supposed to be deleted. The editing does not recover until I move my mouse   away from the current line. One of the colleagues saw the same problem.   Very bad experience. This is reproducible on my machine.
