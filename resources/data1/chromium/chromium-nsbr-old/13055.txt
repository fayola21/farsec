<title>Issue 13055 -   chromium -    suggestion: add right click menu item for Encoding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3      Firefox 3.x: Fail           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go into a badly coded website where you need to change the Encoding for   every page you visit  2. realize that for every page you now need to go with your mouse all the   way to the top right corner for the page menu...     then go all the way down that menu to get to Encoding...      and you are still no done yet! you have a sub menu to use ;)        a simpler way to change encoding  either a keyboard shortcut that opens   this sub-menu where the mouse is or simply a right click  (context menu)   item just like IE offers </pre>
