<title>Issue 8089 -   chromium -    Two Choices for user to make Chrome as default browser ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Honestly  This has been ruining my mind since quite a long time. Finally I  decided to dump it from out of my head.    When I launch Chrome with FRUI (or at the time of installation):    We provide the option to make Google Chrome as the default browser in  &quot;Welcome to  Google Chrome&quot; dialog. For any reasons  if user clicks on  &quot;Customize these settings&quot; link  then we again provide an option to make  Google Chrome as default browser there too (Customize your settings dialog) !!    Is it some thing like: In case if user misses to select the box in  &quot;Welcome..window&quot;  we provide one more chance to select it in  &quot;Customize..settings&quot; dialog?  If so  the user can simply cancel the  customize dialog and can select it in welcome window right ??    Screenshot attached.    Anyhow  I feel free now :)                 </pre>
