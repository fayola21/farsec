<title>Issue 8946 -   chromium -    autos.msn.com: Misalignment of an anchor element cause overlap - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://autos.msn.com/default.aspx">http://autos.msn.com/default.aspx</a>  2. On the right  observer the link 'next' below ad     What is the expected output?   'next' should be in the same line as 'back'    What do you see instead?  'next' moved to next line. As a result the second ad overlaps with the   first one    IE7: ok  FF3: next moved to next line but the second ad doesn't overlap  Safari4/Chrome1.0.154.48/Chrome2.0.169.1: not ok    Please see the attached image     </pre>
