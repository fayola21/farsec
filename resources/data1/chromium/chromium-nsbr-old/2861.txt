<title>Issue 2861 -   chromium -    About:blank and about:network pages are &quot;Untitled&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)    Repro  -----  Navigate to about:blank and about:network.    What is the expected output?     Tab title should say something like &quot;About blank&quot; and &quot;About network &quot;  respectively.   The other about:xxx pages (version  plugins  memory)  display a proper title.     What do you see instead?    Tab titles say  &quot;Untitled.&quot;   </pre>
