<title>Issue 18982 -   chromium -    Isolate and reduce plugin load/instantiation time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a morejs page cycler which tests page load times with JavaScript and plugins   on snapshots of 7 sites.  There is also a morejsnp page cycler based on morejs with   plugin references removed.  Comparing the results of morejs and morejsnp helps us see   the overhead associated with loading plugins:    build   morejsnp  morejs   comment  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11991">r11991</a>  1009ms    1582ms  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12704">r12704</a>  ---       ---      2009/03/26 plugin refactor  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18000">r18000</a>  1072ms    1861ms  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22818">r22818</a>  ---       ---      2009/08/07 delay plugin release  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22886">r22886</a>  1077ms    1576ms    Assuming 500ms of overhead currently  it would be great to isolate and reduce plugin   load/instantiation time by a good amount. </pre>
