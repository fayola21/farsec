<title>Issue 12930 -   chromium -    Back button does not work with navigation via window.location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I haven't tested this on other platforms  but it occurs on the Mac trunk. I've included a test case. Download the file   and keep the file:// URL for it handy.      1. Open a new tab/window and navigate to a site (<a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a> is what I used)  2. Go directly to the URL of the test case you downloaded  3. Click the red box (which has an onclick attached to it) and you'll be navigated to google.com  4. Press the back button and you'll be taken back to twitter.com  rather than the test page.    If you click the link instead  the back button works as expected.      The test case page should be in the back button history after clicking on the red box.      Pressing the back button skips the test case page  as if it's not in the history. </pre>
