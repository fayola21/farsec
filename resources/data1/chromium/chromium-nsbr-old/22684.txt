<title>Issue 22684 -   chromium -    Control bar on NTP thumbnails appears at the wrong time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The controls on the NTP appear too often. In a normal attempt to click on a   thumbnail  the controls start appearing as I click. We should adjust the   delay to either be a bit longer (100-200ms) and/or we should cancel the timer   on mousedown. Too often the controls continue to expand after I click to   visit the page.     </pre>
