<title>Issue 21266 -   chromium -    gyp conversion broke incremental linking of chrome.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is because chrome.exe and chrome.dll shares the same base name. To fix   this  the trick is to output chrome.dll in the $(IntDir) and to hardlink it   back into $(OutDir).    Steven  if you don't have time to do it I can do it later. </pre>
