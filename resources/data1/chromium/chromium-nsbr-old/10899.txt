<title>Issue 10899 -   chromium -    tab_strip_controller.mm needs a unit test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> tab_strip_controller.mm needs a unit test.    The main problem here is creating a WebContents for the tab model to do  things with. One can be created on the stack  but then unrelated tests  crash if if you don't do anything with it.    I'll check in the progress I've made to bootstrap  but someone else may be  able to more easily see the problem. </pre>
