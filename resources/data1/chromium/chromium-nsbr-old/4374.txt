<title>Issue 4374 -   chromium -    Bookmark import promo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the user has just started Chrome but haven't imported any bookmarks    we should give them a tip allowing them to import. &quot;You don't have any   bookmarks yet. [Import from Firefox or IE]&quot;    The tip should be dismissable and should appear if there are either no   bookmarks  or  if we ever support default sets of bookmarks  if those are   the only bookmarks.    It should appear on the New tab page in the bookmarks bar and maybe in the   Recent bookmarks area.       </pre>
