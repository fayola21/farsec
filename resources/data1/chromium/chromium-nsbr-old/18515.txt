<title>Issue 18515 -   chromium -    NNTP: Background alignment shifted when window maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2 (Official Build 22142)      1. Install any theme with a background image from   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a> (eg. Legal Pad)  2. Maximize the Chrome window  3. View the NNTP      The double red lines of the margin background (for Legal Pad) should line   up straight up through the bookmarks bar and tabstrip.      The background is shifted to the left in the window content area of the   NNTP (see attached screenshot).    This only happens in maximized mode.  This happens for all themes with a   background image.   </pre>
