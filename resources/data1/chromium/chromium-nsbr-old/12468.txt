<title>Issue 12468 -   chromium -    Find not using last search in new tab if F3 is pressed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open google.com  2. Ctrl+F and search for 'e'  3. Open new tab  4. Press F3    It should search for 'e'. Instead  it just opens the Find box. Pressing Enter   will search  but that's implied with F3.     This is easy to fix  working on a patch. </pre>
