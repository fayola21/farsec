<title>Issue 17587 -   chromium -    toolbar buttons have wrong tint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I installed the Ian Fette theme from here: http://go/ifettetheme    I saw it and uninstalled as quickly as possible (using chrome://extensions)    The browser didn't reset to the default theme so I restarted it. Now my   buttons are stuck in green! (see attachment) </pre>
