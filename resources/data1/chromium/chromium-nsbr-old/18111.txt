<title>Issue 18111 -   chromium -    Update server not available (error: 3) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1                      1.Go to &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; window          Won't update.      The original fix for the problem does not work for me. I can't find the  registry key    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  CLSID  {2F0E2680-9FF5-43C0-B76E-114A56E93598}   LocalServer    It simply does not exist. I have installed/uninstalled and reinstalled. It  does not create the entry. I searched my computer for googleupdate.exe but  I could not find it. Are any windows services needed to use googleupdate?         </pre>
