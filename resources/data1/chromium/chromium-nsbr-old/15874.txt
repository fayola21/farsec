<title>Issue 15874 -   chromium -    gtk find bar UI touchups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - need to adjust edges of find bar such that you can see more grey edge  - need to refactor find bar positioning such that it is shared between   platforms (see TODO in code)  - Needs 1px padding around red area in &quot;0 of 0&quot;    these bugs aren't really related but I will probably fix them all in one   sweep </pre>
