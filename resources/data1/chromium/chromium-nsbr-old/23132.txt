<title>Issue 23132 -   chromium -    isAvailable check in CFInstall.js incorrectly uses cached results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The CFInstall.js script's isAvailable method uses a version copied from the   CFInstance.js script which  erroneously for this application  caches the   result of the isAvailable check. This caching should be removed from   CFInstall.js so that interval polling functions correctly. </pre>
