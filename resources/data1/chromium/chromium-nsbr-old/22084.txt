Browse a few websites to have all eight thumbnails  including the hard-  coded thumbnails  showing in the NNTP.  2. Click the &quot;keep on this page&quot; option for each thumbnail.  3. Clear browsing data for everything and check all boxes.    What happens: The thumbnails are still there but the broken camera icon is   displayed for some of the thumbnails.
