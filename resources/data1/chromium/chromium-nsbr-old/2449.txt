Maximize Chromium window.   2. Click on each window management button in upper-right corner (Minimize   Restore  Close).        Minimize  Restore  and Close buttons should perform their assigned  functions on single-click.        1. Nothing happens when any of these buttons is single-clicked.  They are  activated on double-click  however.  2. When activated  they do not perform their assigned functions.  Instead   they all perform the Restore function.      </pre>
