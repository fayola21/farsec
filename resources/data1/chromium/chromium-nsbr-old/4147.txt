<title>Issue 4147 -   chromium -    &quot;Get Plug-in&quot; place-holders conflict  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install a shiny  new copy of Chrome (do not install any plugins)  2. Go to www.factoryfive.com      Page should display as if nothing was wrong except a yellowish &quot;get plug-in   &quot; box should be in place of any flash movie stuff.  Also  a yellowish bar   should appear at the top of the browser.      The &quot;get plug-in&quot; box and yellowish 'drop-down' bar fight each other (for   focus?) and clicking on the button to get the plug-in does nothing.  The   website is rendered useless.      Please provide
