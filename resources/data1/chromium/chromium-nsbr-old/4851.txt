<title>Issue 4851 -   chromium -    Hodling mouse on title bar stops playing CNN video. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.25 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5918">r5918</a>)  Flash Player 10.  Not sure  when it is broken  but works fine in 149.30 release build (just  hangs for a second and resumes playing after that).      1. Play any video in cnn.com   2. While video is getting played  click on title bar (empty blue area) and  hold the mouse button.      What is the expected output?   The video should be continuously played.    What do you see instead?  The video hangs and just sound keep on continuing.    Observation:  Safar 3.x  FF3.x: Same behavior as Chrome 149.30 build.  IE7.x : Plays fine  even does not hang for a second  when right clicked on  Title bar.   </pre>
