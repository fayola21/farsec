<title>Issue 16842 -   chromium -    Should allow deleting multiple engines at once - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When multiple search engines are selected in the &quot;edit search engines&quot;   dialog  we disable the &quot;Remove&quot; button.  I don't see why we shouldn't allow   this.    Less clearly  maybe we should also enable editing multiple engines (which I   guess would pop up a bunch of edit dialogs atop each other). </pre>
