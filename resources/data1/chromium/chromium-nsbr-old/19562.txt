<title>Issue 19562 -   chromium -    EventSender does not generate real key events - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> EventSender does not generate &quot;real&quot; events.    Some examples:  * eventSender.keyDown('a'  ['ctrlKey']) does not perform select-all  * eventSender.keyDown('a'  ['shiftKey']) inserts 'a' rather than 'A'  * Events that do not generate keyPress in chrome generate keyPress in test   shell.     </pre>
