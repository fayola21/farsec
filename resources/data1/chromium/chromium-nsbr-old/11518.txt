<title>Issue 11518 -   chromium -    Select file dialog &quot;last path&quot; cache should be separate for open/save dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. User presses ctrl-o  and selects a file from the desktop.  2. One hour later  user presses ctrl-s to save a webpage.  3. User expects to be saving to his default download dir  but instead gets  the desktop.  4. Huh?    I have a patch to fix this on linux  so soon it will only apply to windows  (and perhaps mac?). CCing Glen to see if he has an opinion. </pre>
