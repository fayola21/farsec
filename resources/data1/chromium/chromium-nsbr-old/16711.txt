<title>Issue 16711 -   chromium -    Switch from stable to dev doesn't work first time for system-level Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Installed system-level Chrome from pack.google.com and I got 172.28  * Updated Chrome to 172.33 from about box  * Created a string ap with value 2.0-dev @   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463C-  AFF1-A69D9E530F96}  * Go to about box and click on update now    I see that GoogleUpdate.exe is launched but it doesn't launch setup.exe. I   had to wait for a minute and finally closed Chrome and had to kill the   Chrome and GoogleUpdate processes.     * I launched Chrome again and tried to update from about box    This time GoogleUpdate.exe launched setup.exe. While Chrome was getting   updated  I saw that the ap value @   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463C-  AFF1-A69D9E530F96} got appended with &quot;-full&quot;. Infact a new ap string with   value &quot;-full&quot; is also created @  HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463C-  AFF1-A69D9E530F96}. The &quot;-full&quot; for ap @ HKLM was removed after the update   completed but HKCU value remained.    If it works for the first time  uninstall and try to do the same again. It   worked the first time I tried today morning and then started to trouble me.    User-level switch to dev channel seems to be working fine at least on XP </pre>
