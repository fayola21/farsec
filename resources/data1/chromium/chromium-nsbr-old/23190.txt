<title>Issue 23190 -   chromium -    I'd like a way to quickly navgiate to recently selected tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a feature request  it'd be useful for many to have a way to quickly   navigate through most recently used tabs.    I would suggest making a stack-style tabs navigation option available (&quot;Enable stack-style tabs navigation&quot; or such)  as to make Ctrl+Tab navigate   to the last used tab  Ctrl+Tab+Tab to navigate to the tab used two tabs ago    and so on. Ctrl+PageUp/Ctrl+PageDown already do what Ctrl+Shift+Tab/Ctrl+Tab   currently do anyway.    </pre>
