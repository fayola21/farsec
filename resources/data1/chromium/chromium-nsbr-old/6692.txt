<title>Issue 6692 -   chromium -    Autofill popup should not eat enter key press when there is no selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open a form where you have some autocomplete values (ex: salshdot.org    the search area)  2. Start typing so the autocomplete popup appears.  3. Don't select anything  press enter    Expected:  The popup is closed and the enter key press goes to the page (typically in   a search form  this triggers the search)    Actual:  The popup is closed but the enter key press does not go to the page (a   search form such as slashdot.org does not navigate).     </pre>
