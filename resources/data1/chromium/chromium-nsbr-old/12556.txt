<title>Issue 12556 -   chromium -    Autocomplete focus is not maintained across tab switching. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. browse to www.google.com.  Focus should end up in the on-page search box.  2. Bring up a new tab.  Start typing in autocomplete field.  3. Click back to www.google.com tab.  Focus should still be in search box.  4. Click back to new tab.  What you typed (and autocompleted section) should be present  but the   previously-selected text is not selected  and the field does not have focus.    It is expected that you would end up with the field exactly as it was when you left  except that the   popup would no longer be present (it would popup when you start typing).   </pre>
