<title>Issue 7508 -   chromium -    We don't anti-alias &lt;canvas&gt; drawImage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like other browsers anti-alias when images are draw into a  &lt;canvas&gt; tag.  This is easy to see when you use a rotation transform  etc.   It also looks like we aren't scaling the image nearly as well as other  browsers.    <a href="http://pigs.sourceforge.jp/blog/200811140144/uupaa-canvas.js/demo/3_3_canvas_drawimage+trans+clip.html">http://pigs.sourceforge.jp/blog/200811140144/uupaa-canvas.js/demo/3_3_canvas_drawimage+trans+clip.html</a>    Compare that example to Firefox  and you can see we are much more pixely.   </pre>
