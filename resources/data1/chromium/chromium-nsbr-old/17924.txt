<title>Issue 17924 -   chromium -    There could be two blinking cursors on the screen at the same time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome version is 3.0.195.1    when clicking on a page with text field  the highlight will stay within the   page.  Afterwards  when clicking on the location bar  there will be two   cursors blinking and no matter how I typed  there could be nothing updated   in the location bar  and the blinking course will not lose focus on the text   field within the page. </pre>
