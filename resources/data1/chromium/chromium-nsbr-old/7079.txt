<title>Issue 7079 -   chromium -    Cannot use Page Up &amp;amp;amp; Page Down while using the &quot;search in page&quot; feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0 (8444) (Chromium)          Firefox 3: OK        1. Visit a page that has a rather long scrollbar.  2. Press CTRL+F. The search textbox appears.  3. Search for something that is further down the page. The page scrolls   down to highlight the search term.  4. With the cursor still blinking inside the search textbox  try to use the   Page Up or Page Down keys.        Page Up and Page Down keys should scroll the page up or down.        Page Up and Page Down keys do not scroll the page. The user has to perform   another click somewhere inside the page to remove focus (blinking cursor)   from the search text box and only then the keys will work.      In Firefox the user is able to use the Page Up and Page down keys while the   focus is still inside the search textbox. No additional click is required.   </pre>
