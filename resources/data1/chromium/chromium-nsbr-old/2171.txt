<title>Issue 2171 -   chromium -    Security:Well am not sure how severe it is or if it is serious at all... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've coded a small app(fuzzer) in cc++ to test Chrome &amp; other browser's  to study how they handle characterset with ASCII values above 100 &amp; below  1000.  Well...Chrome &amp; even Opera opens multiple tabs when fed with a string 100-  200 bytes long having ASCII values as mentioned above.While when fed with   normal characters like &quot;AAAAAA&quot; no matter how long the string is  only one   tab is opened.  Am attaching the source code of my app.  Am an InfoSec Research Asst. &amp; new to fuzzing so bear with me if my find  is not at all a bug.  Regards   Atul Alex Cherian.    </pre>
