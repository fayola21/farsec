<title>Issue 17731 -   chromium -    Layout regression since few releases: Tab bar tint is not as per system colors anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0~svn20090724r21527-0ubuntu1~ucd2~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : GNOME + Compiz          I'm using Ubuntu dust theme and since few releases ago  chromium browser   tab bar was showing brown (which is correct as the &quot;selected item&quot; color   for that theme is #996B5C).    After latest updates chromium is showing blue again  which in my   understanding this is a regression. I tried searching for similar issues   but I'm not sure what I have found is actually what I'm referring to. So    please don't blame  me is this is a duplicate of something.. :) </pre>
