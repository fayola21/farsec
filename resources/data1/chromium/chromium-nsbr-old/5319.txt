<title>Issue 5319 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager search needs to show no matches in some way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use the bookmark manager to search for some bookmark you don't have.  2. Wait and realize you don't know when the bookmark manager is done   searching. There is no visual feedback.    I expect it to show a throbber or something so I know it is still   searching. Maybe this is just jarring because of <a title="Bookmark manager starts search on third letter (as opposed to first)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5315"> issue 5315 </a>  but I suspect   it would be good to have this when searching through large amounts of   bookmarks data. </pre>
