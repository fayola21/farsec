<title>Issue 19853 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Anchor elements cannot be clicked when an image is present in the same column of a table with inappropriate/no height defined - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.echoecho.com/javascript.htm">http://www.echoecho.com/javascript.htm</a>  2. Try to click on any of the links under javascript basics  browser   detection  etc    What is the expected output?   The user should be able to navigate to that page.    What do you see instead?  On mouse hover the pointer doesn't change and doesn't allow to navigate.    I'm not sure how many websites are affected by this behavior.    This happens with Chromium 4.0.203.0 (Developer Build 23825). Webkit   nightly 47288 works fine. </pre>
