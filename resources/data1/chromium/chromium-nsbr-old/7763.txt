<title>Issue 7763 -   chromium -    RTL pages with direction=rtl truncated incorrectly (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.162.0  URLs (if applicable) : e.g. <a href="http://glida.tzadam.com/">http://glida.tzadam.com/</a>  <a href="http://www.dentalspace.co.il">http://www.dentalspace.co.il</a>               IE 7: OK      ============================  When the BODY tag has a dir=&quot;rtl&quot; or style=&quot;direction: rtl;&quot;   the scrollbar of the page has to be on the LEFT of the page.  Also  when the content is truncated (smaller window width)  it should be   truncated from the LEFT and not from the right.      =====================  The opposite...      RTL support in chrome seems almost complete now. There's only few glitches   like these  and we're done... :-)   </pre>
