<title>Issue 14047 -   chromium -    crashed GoogleGears lead to repeating error message in Google Docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1    In offline-enabled Google Docs  I am getting repeating error message   &quot;Attention: Sorry  your changes have NOT been saved. To avoid losing your   changes  copy the text to the clipboard  refresh the page  then paste the   text back in the document. [2]   (OK)&quot;. After clicking OK button  the message   disappears only for a second or two  and then pops up again--and there's no   way to get rid of it (except reloading the page).    The message appeared after an infobar popped up saying &quot;Google Gears plugin   has crashed&quot;.    Google Gears version: 0.5.21.0. </pre>
