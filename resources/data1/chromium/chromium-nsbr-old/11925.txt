<title>Issue 11925 -   chromium -    Problem with pasting pasting images into Microsoft Word (2003) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.65 (Official Build )  Firefox 3.x: OK        1. Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora</a>  2. Copy the image of the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; as it is (don't click it which makes it bigger).  3. Paste it into a blank Microsoft Word document.        The image is pasted into Microsoft Word at the size it is on the page.      The image does not appear in Microsoft Word.   Repeat steps 1-3 in Firefox and it works perfectly.               </pre>
