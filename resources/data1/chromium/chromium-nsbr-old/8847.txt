<title>Issue 8847 -   chromium -    Do we need provide an UI for user to customize &quot;Standard Font&quot;? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;See b/1193064 and b/1185933&gt;    We mapped one of Serif font or Sans-Serif font as standard font for each   language at back end  but do we need to provide user an UI to customize it   by themselves? Like Firefox  it allows user to select which one they would   like to use as &quot;Default Font&quot;. </pre>
