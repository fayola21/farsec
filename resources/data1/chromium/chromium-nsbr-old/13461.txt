<title>Issue 13461 -   chromium -    Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 2.0.181 (181.0)  OS version               : 10.5.7    Because the window close/minimize/zoom widgets are on the left on OS X   instead of on the right as in Windows/Linux  the tabs should start on the   right and new tabs should be created to the left  in a mirror image of the   Windows/Linux versions of Chrome.    Also  the close button for each tab should be on the left side of the tab   instead of the right side.     </pre>
