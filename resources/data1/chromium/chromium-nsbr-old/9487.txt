<title>Issue 9487 -   chromium -    Google Maps Drag to Modify Direction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a>                   IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      Get directions from between any 2 locations.  In IE  one is able to click a   point on the route and modify the directions.  However  in 2.0.171.0  this   feature does not work.  The circle shows up suggesting that you may  but   clicking and dragging will not change anything. </pre>
