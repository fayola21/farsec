<title>Issue 19299 -   chromium -    Google Maps panning slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.0      1. Go to Google Maps  2. Try to pan (drag) the map around with your mouse  3. Show/hide the mini map in bottom right corner  4. Try the same in Firefox      Map panning is smooth. Showing/hiding the minimap is quick.      Map panning in Chrome is noticably less smooth than in Firefox. The minimap   shows/hides slower than in Firefox. I have an older computer so maybe you won't notice   this.    This happens both in Linux and Windows versions. </pre>
