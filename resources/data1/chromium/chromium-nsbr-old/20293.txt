<title>Issue 20293 -   chromium -    Window deactivates  funny mouse behavior when clicking on bottom of web content area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.202.0  Windows 7 with Aero Glass    &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Open a new window and go to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a>  2. Click repeatedly in the bottom and top of the content area (all over the   place  basically).  3. See window deactivate on one of the clicks on the bottom.    &gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    Window should not deactivate.    This issue doesn't seem to be reproducable on all sites (can't repro on   gmail  but can on the URL above  the NTP and google.com). I can't tell if   this is a backend or frontend issue and am assigning to myself to find out   more.   </pre>
