<title>Issue 2788 -   chromium -    Closing last tab also exits from application. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have only one tab open in browser windo.  2. Click [x] to close that tab.  3. The *browser* closes.      I expect to be back at the &quot;Most visited&quot; quasi-start page.      I have no *browser* left after closing a *tab*.    This strikes me as unexpected behaviour in a user interface.    Please provide
