<title>Issue 6072 -   chromium -    download appears to be canceled when tab is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download a file  2. Close the tab that spawned the download      1. Tab can't be closed; or  2. You are warned that you can view the download in the downloads page; or  3. The download page is opened when a download starts so it's obvious      Tab is closed.  No notification is given but UI disappears  so users assume   the download is canceled.    It turns out I can go to Tools-&gt;Downloads and it's still running  but how I   know this?    Please provide
