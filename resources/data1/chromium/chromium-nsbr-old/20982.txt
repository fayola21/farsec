<title>Issue 20982 -   chromium -    chrome won't start if username == hostname (aka chrome only starts as root) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. create a user with the _exact_ same name as your hostname  e.g.:     $ cat /etc/hostname   adam  $ whoami  adam    2. apt-get latest chrome build (mine is the ubuntu build from 9/2/09)  3. run chrome from the 'applications &gt; internet' menu in gnome  OR from the   command line:    $ chromium-browser        I expect chrome to start and show me the typical welcome screen  or a   browser window.        When starting from the menu  the mouse spins with the busy icon for a bit    then nothing.  When starting from the command line (chromium-browser)  it exits   immediately with the following error:    [5560:5560:1253132987513:FATAL:/build/buildd/chromium-browser-  4.0.206.0~svn20090902r25168/build-  tree/src/chrome/browser/process_singleton_linux.cc(732)] Failed to create   SingletonLock: File exists  Trace/breakpoint trap        if i then check the exit code:    echo $?  133        However  when running from a different user  it starts up normally. I   originally noticed that chrome only worked when run as root (sudo chromium-  browser). On my machine  it also runs on a different user I created to test   this (su - regis / chromium-browser / it appears). The regis user seems   exactly the same as root  both have additional output but are able to do   basic web browsing  such as filing this bug.    <b>Please provide
