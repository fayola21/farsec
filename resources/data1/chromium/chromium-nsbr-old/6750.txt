<title>Issue 6750 -   chromium -    Remove logging of editor actions without UI context - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've been looking at UMA logs  and found that one of those log calls is  incorrect (it's logging usage of an internal function).  But more broadly   after discussion with Ojan I think logging at this level isn't useful.    I think the UMA questions we want to answer are:   - what accelerator keys are webapps using?   - how often do people use ctl-c vs right-click menu copy?  Since we can't disambiguate these at the level that change introduces them   I think we should remove all of them and instead have:   - at the browser level  log all accelerator key presses that are processed  by web content (?)   - in the particular context menus  add UMA logging there    (This is referring to the call in editor_client_impl.cc that records all  editor commands). </pre>
