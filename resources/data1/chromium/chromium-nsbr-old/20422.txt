<title>Issue 20422 -   chromium -    Autocomplete edit view needs automated testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I started looking into this myself but I think James Su would do a better   job of it since he has been working a lot with input in the omnibox recently   so has a better idea of how the pieces all fit together.    It should not be too difficult to write tests that will run on Windows as   well as Linux (some testing infrastructure is missing on mac).    I think this is rather important as we've had a rash of input regressions   lately. </pre>
