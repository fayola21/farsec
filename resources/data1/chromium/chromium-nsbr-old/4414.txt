<title>Issue 4414 -   chromium -    Chrome does not support a feature I feel may be common. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Loading chrome on a laptop running windows vista (possibly other OSs   too).           When using internet browsers on my laptop there is usually support for   pressing the laptop touchpad with two fingers  one on top of the other  it   will bring up the scrolling mouse feature that happens when you click the   middle-button/scroller on most mice.      Chrome does not support this feature. This is my first laptop so I don't   really know if I'm the only one with this feature but I assume other people   out there are using it on IE as well.    Please provide
