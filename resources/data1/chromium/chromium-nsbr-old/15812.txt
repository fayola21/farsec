<title>Issue 15812 -   chromium -    select/move text causes chromium to hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 19803  OS + version : Fedora 8/9  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32    1. Select text on a website.  2. &quot;Grab&quot; and move the text  but only for a distance of a few pixels.  3. The mouse icon permanently changes to the document icon.  4. Chromium hangs.    It's important to move the text for only a few pixels  otherwise the bug   doesn't occur. I can reliably reproduce it. </pre>
