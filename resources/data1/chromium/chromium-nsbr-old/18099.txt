<title>Issue 18099 -   chromium -    Chrome does not hold the changes made to &quot;Open this page&quot; option in the preferences. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 3.0.196.0  Rev:22005    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open Preferences &gt; Basics  2. Under &quot;Home Page&quot; select &quot;Open this Page&quot; option.  3. Give the page you want to open as home page say &quot;www.google.com&quot;  4. Close and reopen the preferences.    Expected:  Preferences should still show the changes we made for &quot;Home Page&quot;.    Actual:  Preferences still shows the &quot;Open this page&quot; option selected  but the website that we entered   (google.com) has been revereted back to chrome:internal.  So clicking on the home page button does not take us to the home page.     </pre>
