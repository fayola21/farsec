<title>Issue 1012 -   chromium -    popup is hidden too well - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page with a popup  2. See if anybody notices it  3.

Users file bug reports that their ticket services don't work  because they   don't see the popup with login/site remote control functionality.    Please provide
