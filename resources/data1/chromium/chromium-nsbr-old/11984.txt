<title>Issue 11984 -   chromium -    Prioritize/limit loading when restoring many tabs at once and when many tabs are open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL    For usage scenaria when too many tabs are open (and Chrome doesn't fit   into RAM and thus swaps itself and other applications a lot)  it would be   smart to save full page content on a local disk for unused tabs and free   up most memory of its chrome renderer processes--and re-open+render them   upon activation  loading from from disk upon activation of tabs.    Similary  when Chrome is re-started after a crash / normal shutdown with   many-many tabs saved in the last session  it would be smarter not to   render all of them at once (loading HDD and RAM with a bulk of job)  but   to render them only when a respective tab is activated.    I am sure Google guys are absolutely smart in finding right algorithm to   choose a threshold for starting &quot;loading unused tabs to disk&quot;  sequence   of &quot;least used unloaded first&quot; and making in it all running in background   and not slowing down foreground Chrome processes and other applications.
