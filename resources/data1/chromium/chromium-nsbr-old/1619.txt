<title>Issue 1619 -   chromium -    Canvas globalCompositeOperation 'lighter' is ugly  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a canvas  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')  2. Draw something  3. Set ctx.globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'  4. Draw something on top of the existing image        The new drawing blended on top of the other  using the 'lighter' blend mode  (whatever that means  it looks like a suspicious mix of screen and color  dodge on Gecko and Safari.)        The new drawing is blended on top of the other  using something that looks  like the add blend mode  blowing out my carefully tweaked gradients.      Please provide
