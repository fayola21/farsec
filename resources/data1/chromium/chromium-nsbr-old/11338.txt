Issue1:  -Bookmark any about protocol page on Bookmarks bar.  -Go to any webpage (say google home page)  -Drag and drop the about: protocol page to the content area  Result:  You are navigated to about:blank page    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue2 </a>:  in NTP  Drag and drop the about: protocol page to the content area.  Result:  You will get a white blank page with out any URL in the Omnibox.    PS: In both of the above issues  if you drag and drop the about: page to   Omnibox  then it rocks.     </pre>
