<title>Issue 20522 -   chromium -    Page rendered blank  but I can copy text and see the source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Chromium	204.0 (Developer Build 24491)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.8.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.204.0 Safari/532.0    URLs (if applicable) : not specific to any URL  I am experiencing it on any   random site        Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      It is quite random  so I don't have exact steps. I think that typically this   happens when I open link in background tab with Cmd+Cllick.      To see the page correctly rendered.      The page is blank (white to be precise) and reload doesn't help. Interesting   is  that I can see that cursor is changing as I am moving over text    hyperlinks etc... I can also select the text from page and paste it in some   text editor and I can also look at page source.    I know it is almost impossible to track this down without steps to   reproduce  so if it s possible to turn on some debugging messages that I   could attach here later  please suggest how. I also tried to search for   similar issue  but didn't find it. </pre>
