<title>Issue 20488 -   chromium -    Once you trigger an update the aboutbox sticks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once you kick update now  the about box state sticks  it won't ever check for   updates  etc. so it always shows the last state.  if you wanted for another   update to be available before a restart that won't show up if you open the   aboutbox again. </pre>
