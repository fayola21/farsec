<title>Issue 21628 -   chromium -    Security: Should not show basic HTTP auth dialogs for subresource loads  particularly images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a generic bug affecting all browsers -- but perhaps something we can   trivially tighten up in Chrome for a good benefit.    The issue is that many many web apps (Orkut in the case that was brought to   our attention) but also Gmail etc. permit the rendering of an &lt;img&gt; tag with   an arbitrary &quot;src&quot; parameter.    The issue is that if the &quot;src&quot; parameter refers to a resource which responds   with a HTTP 401 plus HTTP header indicating basic auth -- the browser will   pop-up a little login dialog. This might be abused for phishing as the   appearance to the untrained eye would be that the trusted site popped up the   dialog.   </pre>
