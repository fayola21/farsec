<title>Issue 6992 -   chromium -    Ignore alt on some keypresses in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently throw away some combos that are &quot;alt+&lt;xxx&gt;&quot; where we could   potentially do something useful by simply ignoring alt.  For example    alt+up should be the same as up.  I hit this case when trying to navigate   the popup just before using alt-enter to open in a new tab  if I've already   started holding down alt. </pre>
