<title>Issue 2646 -   chromium -    Performance issue when iterating over a query ResultSet in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Chrome 0.2.149.30 and Gears 0.4.2  URLs (if applicable) : See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=734">http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=734</a>     Attached HTML file will create a test table and insert 15000 records into  table.  Once table has been created a query will be issued against the  table.  The ResultSet will include 5000 rows.  In Chrome it takes over  10 000 milliseconds to iterate through each row in the ResultSet.  In IE8  it takes 188 milliseconds.  In Firefox 3.0.1 it takes 88 milliseconds.              Firefox 3: Ok           IE 7: Ok    I also posted this in the Gears forum.  Please see it for more details.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=734">http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=734</a>  </pre>
