<title>Issue 11506 -   chromium -    Preference Service UI test failing on windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I disabled PreferenceServiceTest.PreservedWindowPlacementIsLoaded because  it was failing on the buildbots and there were no obvious candidates for  its failure (the 2 patches that when in the cycle before it started failing  were both linux-only).    I couldn't repro locally. </pre>
