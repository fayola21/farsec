<title>Issue 9074 -   chromium -    Error dialog should be shown when Chrome 1.0 is installed over Chrome 2.0 beta - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome 2.0  2. Over install with chrome 2.0 beta      What is the expected output?   Either update to chrome 1.0 or show a message that it cannot be upgraded.    What do you see instead?  Chrome doesn't get updated and no error message is seen.      Note: Installer is writing the message to regkey   lstInstallerResultUIString  but Google chrome is not displaying the message   in the UI.   The installer log has the message saying: A higher version is already   available.                   </pre>
