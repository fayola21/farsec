<title>Issue 16167 -   chromium -    Aero caption buttons don't always receive mouseout? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Maximize a Chrome window on a left-hand monitor and hover the window close   button.  Now whip your mouse to the right.  The close box stays highlighted   until the mouse enters the caption area of the window again.    Try this with Wordpad  and the box unhighlights.    Perhaps we need to send a WM_NCHITTEST or WM_NCMOUSEMOVE or something where   we aren't (when the mouse leaves the window).  If we figure out what the   right message is  we should register for mouse leave events so we get the   right opportunity to send this.    In fact in general maybe our window should always register for mouse leave   and then just handle it like a mouse move. </pre>
