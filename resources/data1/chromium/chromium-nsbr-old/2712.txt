<title>Issue 2712 -   chromium -    Don't show link to cache if user is offline (or not using error page suggestions) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.1        1. Make sure &quot;suggestions for navigation errors&quot; is checked  2. disconnect from network  3. browse to an error page    What is the expected result?   No link to cached page    What happens instead?  If you are offline  you can't see the Google cache. Also  if you aren't   using LinkDoctor  we shouldn't show the cache suggestion because we don't   know if it exists.
