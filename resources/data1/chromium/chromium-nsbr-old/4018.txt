<title>Issue 4018 -   chromium -    Link targets not echoed in &quot;app mode&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9            Firefox 3: OK   Older Chrome: OK      1. Run an &quot;app&quot; (like &quot;chrome.exe --app=<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/&quot;">http://mail.google.com/mail/&quot;</a>)  2. Put the cursor over any hyperlink      I'd expect the link target to be echoed at the bottom of the window  just  like they do in normal (not &quot;app mode&quot;) Chrome windows.      Link target fails to appear at the bottom of the window.  The only  immediately-discoverable way to see the link target apart from actually  jumping to the link is to use the inspector.    This used to work before Chrome upgraded itself to build 4058  and my inner  control freak is a little unhappy.    thank you   --m </pre>
