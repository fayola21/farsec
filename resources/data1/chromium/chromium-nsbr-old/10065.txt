<title>Issue 10065 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   This tests the screen's pixel depth  which we don't set on the buildbots  so it depends on the users settings.  Making this a broken test for us.  The test must be fixed to not depend on user settings and rebaselined.  post-beta.   DEFER : LayoutTests/fast/dom/Window/window-screen-properties.html = FAIL PASS  (Automatically generated from line 538 to line 543 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
