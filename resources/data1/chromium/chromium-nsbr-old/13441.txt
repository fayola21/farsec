<title>Issue 13441 -   chromium -    sleep/wake cycle with monitor size change terminates chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.184 (184.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. start chrome on mac laptop where laptop is operating in &quot;lid closed&quot;   mode attached to an external monitor.  2. detach mac from monitor  keyboard  mac will sleep.  3. reattach mac to different monitor  keyboard  awake mac  4. chrome has silently ceased to run (though there are numerous   complaints in the logs.)      step 4 above should not happen: chrome should continue to operate   across sleep/wake cycles.    Note that this is a recent change: as of June 3 on 10.5.6 with a build-bot   chromium instance not more than 2 days old  this didn't happen.      chrome ceases operating. note that it is a crash  not an orderly shutdown   as the open tabs are not preserved.    aside: crashes would be less annoying if all tab state was recorded   regularly.   </pre>
