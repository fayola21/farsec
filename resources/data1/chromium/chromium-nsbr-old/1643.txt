<title>Issue 1643 -   chromium -    The memory leak in the root process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     After several days of usage  the root process allocated 1.6GiB of memory.   And this process could not be restarted or selectively killed.           The root process must not leak the memory  or it should be easily   restartable  picking existing page processes after restart. Fro example   page navigation could be done by the separate child process. That respawns   if it dies.        1.6GiB is allocated.     Please provide
