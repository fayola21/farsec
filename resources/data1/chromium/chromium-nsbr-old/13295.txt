<title>Issue 13295 -   chromium -    Too much flicker! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the omnibox string is &quot;?foo&quot;   * Hitting ctrl shouldn't rerun autocomplete at all because the TLD doesn't   matter in forced query mode.  * Even if it runs (like it does now)  minimal_changes should be true and we   shouldn't be re-running everything causing flicker.    Tagging Mstone-3 so I'll look at this immediately. </pre>
