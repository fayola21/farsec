<title>Issue 7539 -   chromium -    Selecting &quot;Open image in new tab&quot; in Most Visited section opens crashed tab  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Problems occurs on trunk and dev builds:  ----------------------------------------  Chromium 2.0.160.1 (Developer Build 9392)  Google Chrome 2.0.160.0 (Official Build 9072)    Images in web pages are not affected by this problem.  Sorry  could not get a call stack on this one.          1. Open New Tab.   2. Right-click on a thumbnail in Most Visited section to bring up context menu.  3. Select &quot;Open image in new tab&quot; from menu.    What is the expected output?    Thumbnail image should be opened in new tab.    What do you see instead?    New tab is crashed.  Sad tab is displayed.   </pre>
