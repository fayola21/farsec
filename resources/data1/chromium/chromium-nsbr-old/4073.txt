<title>Issue 4073 -   chromium -    Feature Request - Search Engine box  or multiple default search engines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Just open Chrome.      I want a search engine box where I can choose an engine  type something    and search. Or when I type something into the location bar  multiple   options in the dropdown menu will appear  like:  Search &quot;crap&quot; in Google  Search &quot;crap&quot; in Wikipedia (en)  etc... based on my preferences.      Now  I type something into the address bar  only *one* search engine   (usually Google) appears  and others are history suggestions.    Please provide
