<title>Issue 9976 -   chromium -    Only worry about always-on-top autohide taskbars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split from <a title="Chrome windows hide autohide taskbars" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20"> issue 20 </a> comment 142:    &quot;I notice  in win_util.cc  bool EdgeHasAutoHideTaskbar is checking   IsWindow(taskbar).  Shouldn't it check GetWindowLong(taskbar GWL_STYLE)&amp;&amp;WS_EX_TOPMOST also?&quot;    Need to figure out expected behavior when you have not-always-on-top autohide   taskbars  but if the window is supposed to just ignore them this probably   does the trick. </pre>
