<title>Issue 6401 -   chromium -    Font code in platform/graphics/chromium should check the return value of the win32 calls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In platform/graphics/chromium (mainly GlyphPageTreeNodeWin.cpp.   SimpleFontDataWin.cpp) we call user32/gdi functions and we don't check the   return value. We also have no way of handling the errors.    This is making some bugs really hard to track down and can hide font   handling problems.    Example of functions:    GetTextMetrics   SelectObject   GetCharWidthI  ScriptGetFontProperties </pre>
