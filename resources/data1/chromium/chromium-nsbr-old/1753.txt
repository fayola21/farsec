<title>Issue 1753 -   chromium -    Chrome unresponsive on Flash/Shockwave with mouse wheel scroll on WinXP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">http://www.pokemon.com</a>      0. Verify latest Flash/Shockwave plugin installed  1. Browse to <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">http://www.pokemon.com</a>  2. Use mouse wheel (actually tested with an IBM scrollpoint mouse; the   middle wheel is really an &quot;eraser head&quot; which can scroll in four   directions)  either to scroll page the page up/down or with CTRL pressed to   attempt zoom adjustments (since there is no HTML content  the latter does   nothing useful)  3. Chrome quickly becomes unresponsive for 30sec on 1+min  4. Try click on the '+' for a new tab  try opening configuration/page   dropdown menus; try clicking in omnibox; none of these respond  5. It seems that ALT-TAB to another application and back may help get   Chrome to be responsive again; not sure  6. Eventually Chrome responds again; a backlog of mouse clicks may be   processed  such as multiple new tabs being opened if the new tab '+' was   clicked a few times  7. Flash interaction on the site  or using the scrollbar on the right-hand   side of the browser to scroll does not appear to cause lockup problems; so   far just mouse &quot;wheel&quot; causes lockups    Note: Unable to reproduce on Vista (although that machine had a 'regular'   mouse wheel  and not a 4 way eraser head on the problem XP machine)     </pre>
