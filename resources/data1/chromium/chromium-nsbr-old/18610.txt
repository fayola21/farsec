<title>Issue 18610 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: block-test.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: block-test.html fails    This is fallout from:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=22590">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=22590</a>    The test can simply be re-baselined  but I'd rather use this test as an   excuse to further reduce variance between TestShell and DumpRenderTree   instead. </pre>
