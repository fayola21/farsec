<title>Issue 8123 -   chromium -    TabContents:SetInitialFocus method should be changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently BrowserView::GetInitiallyFocusedView() returns the location bar    causing the location bar to be focus by default.  This causes bugs with app mode and session restore where we have to set the   initial focus for the tab shown.    The TabContents::SetInitialFocus method should be changed to return the   view it wants to be focused instead of setting the focus directly.  That way  BrowserView::GetInitiallyFocusedView() could return the view that   the current tab wants initially focused.     </pre>
