<title>Issue 12967 -   chromium -    No youtube login - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I try to log into my youtube account it asks to save the password and   redirects me to the home screen and no log in. When I try to log in using my   gmail account though  it works perfectly fine. This is only a problem for the   newest past two releases for the Dev Channel. </pre>
