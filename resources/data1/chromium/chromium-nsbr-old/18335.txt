<title>Issue 18335 -   chromium -    Render view font hinting wrong with antialias disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.0~svn20090802r22252-0ubuntu1~ucd1~hardy  OS + version : Ubuntu hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit):32-bit  window manager : Gnome    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works        1. set Gnome font proferences to &quot;Smoothing: none&quot;  &quot;Hinting: slight&quot; so as   to reproduce Window's appearance with non-��_��_aliased fonts  2. set Arial or any MS TTF font as default  3. watch Chrome render badly jagged fonts        Getting smooth non-antialiased fonts inside the Chromium window  as for the   rest of the system.        You get smooth fonts for the window menus  but not inside the Chromium   window.    The effect is similar to what you get with freetype's bytecode interpreter   disabled. I am attaching a screenshot  note the correct rendering for the   window menus (and the correct rendering in FF behind the Chromium window)    and the awful rendering of fonts inside the Chromium window.   </pre>
