<title>Issue 5718 -   chromium -    BUG: LogMeIn Remote Desktop Is Ridiculously Slow And Faulty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.39 &amp; Java 6 Update 11  URLs (if applicable) : www.logmein.com                   IE 6: OK (Though ActiveX)      1. Log into one of your computers (you have to sign up and install a little   software).  2. Start remote desktop through the interface.      A remote desktop will show up and be completely responsive and quick.      It makes the tab work very slowly (even the mouse cursor movement is   somewhat skipped).  The applet itself works very slowly.  When choosing to go full screen  it is a little better  but it takes a lot of time   until it understands the you clicked on that button in the first place.    Keyboard input is parsed incorrectly (I have English US and Hebrew in my   language input settings and English is the default). I cannot  for example  use   the letter &quot;w&quot; because in Hebrew the key means &quot;'&quot; and it goes for that   meaning. As opposed to that  when trying to press the &quot;.&quot; in Hebrew (which is   the &quot; or ?&quot; in English)  it actually types the English &quot;.&quot; key  which is the   equivalent for the Hebrew letter &quot;_��_&quot;  so either way (English or Hebrew)  I   cannot type &quot;.&quot;.  (And pressing the Hebrew letter simply gives me the Hebrew letter.)    I hope I did not confuse you.    Thank you! </pre>
