<title>Issue 12065 -   chromium -    Renderer processes limit exceeds on restoring a session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a machine with 767MB physical memory. According to the code in function GetMaxRendererProcessCount()  user can create only 9 processes.   But I see 10 processes.    Steps  -----  * Open 11 or 12 tabs and navigate to some website (Have restore tabs option   set)  * Exit Chrome  * Launch Chrome again (Here I see that each tab is in it's own process. Is   this expected?)  * Close some tabs and open some tabs again    Expected: To obey the limit(9 in this case) set for renderer processes   count    Actual: Limit exceeds. I see 10 renderer processes    Please see the screenshot   </pre>
