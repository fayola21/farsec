<title>Issue 11228 -   chromium -    Make ui_tests launch Chromium app in the background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Mac  it' really annoying to have the Chromium app launch in the  foreground when running ui_tests as it takes over the machine as it  launches/quits repeatedly.    It would be awesome if it launched in the background so you could keep  using whatever foreground app you were in while the tests were running in  the bg. </pre>
