<title>Issue 7262 -   chromium -    Consider throwing a error when network is reset while 'Download' is in progress - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1072257&gt;  Sorry  if we have a bug for this already on external bug tracker.    while downloading huge files which take pretty much few hours  We can't  assume the network to be consistent in case of wireless network. If we can  show up error message to the user as soon as network is reset  the user may  start downloading again  otherwise  he will be under assumption that  'Download' is in progress. </pre>
