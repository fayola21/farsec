<title>Issue 19300 -   chromium -    ProfileImpl::InitThemes is 9% of startup on Mac even with no themes installed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I ran Shark on Chrome. ProfileImpl::InitThemes was 9% of startup  divided   between GenerateTabImages (5%) and GenerateFrameImages (4%).    This was without any themes active.    It seems as though startup could be made faster by disabling this code path   when the user hasn't selected a theme? </pre>
