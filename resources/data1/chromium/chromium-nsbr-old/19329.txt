<title>Issue 19329 -   chromium -    Need to support Hawaiian (haw) in language preference  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copied from b/2052612.    Not sure if this bug belongs in Chromium or not.  google.com is available in Hawaiaan:   - <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/haw/">http://www.google.com/intl/haw/</a>   - <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=haw">http://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=haw</a>    but Chrome's language preferences does not allow a way to select Hawaiian.    So users cannot set up the browser to send the accept-header for haw and   get google.com to present the Hawaiian user interface.    I'm not sure if there are other google.com languages that are not   supported  but someone should check.    Safari allegedy support haw.  See this U of HI press release that got a bit mixed up:   <a href="http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/news/press/view.php?release=842">http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/news/press/view.php?release=842</a> </pre>
