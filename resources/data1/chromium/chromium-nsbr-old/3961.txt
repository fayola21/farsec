<title>Issue 3961 -   chromium -    Other bookmarks overhangs the right side of the bookmarks bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In a trunk build (not visible in 154.9)  the 'other bookmarks' folder is   aligned to the right side of the bookmarks bar  so the hover state overlaps   the edge. This looks horrible.    Nominating for 1.0 because it should be a simple fix  and if we ship like   this  Linus and I will cry. </pre>
