<title>Issue 15817 -   chromium -    IPCSyncChannelTest times out often under Valgrind on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   IPCSyncChannelTest times out often under Valgrind on Mac    It does not timeout always though  and the test that times out varies every   time. The ones I've seen are:    IPCSyncChannelTest.BadMessage  IPCSyncChannelTest.Unblock  IPCSyncChannelTest.Recursive  IPCSyncChannelTest.QueuedReply   </pre>
