<title>Issue 10524 -   chromium -    should only have one font-size preference  instead of one for normal text and one for monospace text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a workaround for the related upstream bug with monospace fonts:    <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19161">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19161</a>    IE7 doesn't seem to have a default font size.  It certainly doesn't have a  different fixed width font size and variable width font size.  It would be  nice if we didn't either.    I propose that we set the default fixed font size to 16 for all locales  that use courier new as the default fixed width font.    Jungshik  are there some i18n site compat reasons why this would be a bad idea? </pre>
