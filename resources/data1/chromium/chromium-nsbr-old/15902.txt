<title>Issue 15902 -   chromium -    when '��_��__��_��__��_��__' is typed with Korean IME on  turn it off and replace the string with 'www' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is b/1025045.    A lot of Korean users end up typing '��_��__��_��__��_��__' when they mean to type 'www'    in omnibox (i mean the url bar of other browsers) because '��_��__��_��__��_��__'   corresponds to 'www' with the most popular Korean keyboard layout.    When '��_��__��_��__��_��__' is typed at the beginning  switching to English mode and   replacing it with 'www' would be handy. (it was requested in the Korean   mozilla user group a couple of years ago)    We can go a step further and make an intelligent guess of what a user means   when a gibberish Korean is typed when she actually means to type an English   word (or vice versa). However  there's a Korean patent (a stupid patent   office !!) for this and MS ends up payting some money to the patent holder   (IIRC) so that we may not do that (Google search quality/spelling  team   considered this before  I heard). </pre>
