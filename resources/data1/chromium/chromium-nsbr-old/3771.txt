<title>Issue 3771 -   chromium -    Wish: Different download destinations for different file types (pictures-&gt;my pictures) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> when i right click a picture and choose save image as i expect it to offer   the &quot;my pictures&quot; folder.  Could be nice if there was a way to set different default destination   folder for pictures.  (same for videos and other content i guess) </pre>
