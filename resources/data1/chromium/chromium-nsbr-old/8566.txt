<title>Issue 8566 -   chromium -    Remove reference to FrameLoader::setPreviousHistoryItem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FrameLoader::setPreviousHistoryItem() has been removed from WebKit   &lt;<a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/41521">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/41521</a>&gt;.    It is still used by webframeloaderclient_impl.cc:    void WebFrameLoaderClient::frameLoadCompleted() {    // FIXME: the mac port also conditionally calls setDrawsBackground:YES on    // it's ScrollView here.      // This comment from the Mac port:    // Note: Can be called multiple times.    // Even if already complete  we might have set a previous item on a frame   that    // didn't do any data loading on the past transaction. Make sure to clear   these out.    webframe_-&gt;frame()-&gt;loader()-&gt;setPreviousHistoryItem(0);  }      Is this still needed? Or can it be reorganized.   </pre>
