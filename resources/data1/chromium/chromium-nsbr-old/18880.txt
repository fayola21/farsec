<title>Issue 18880 -   chromium -    Resizing the task manager window is janky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Resizing the task manager on linux is very ugly  even with only a pair of   tasks present.  More obvious for resizes that expand the size of the window.    tot  Ubuntu Karmic.  965 intel graphics  kernel modesetting  metacity with   compositor.    I had a look at <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/2009/07/09/neat-hacks/">http://blogs.gnome.org/otte/2009/07/09/neat-hacks/</a> and tried   out the patch (<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=138105&amp;action=view">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=138105&amp;action=view</a>)   with chrome.  It doesn't show any callbacks blocking the mainloop for a large   amount of time. </pre>
