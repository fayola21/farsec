<title>Issue 11533 -   chromium -    need web inspector unit test to verify that it at least works at a macro level - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the last week  the web inspector has broken twice  the first time as a   result of a webkit merge (11314)  the second one still hasn't been tracked   down (11532).  The bad thing is that neither case was noticed when it   happened  in part because we don't have a unit test that will fail when this   happens. </pre>
