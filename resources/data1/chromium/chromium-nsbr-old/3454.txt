<title>Issue 3454 -   chromium -    Chrome + gwtTextControl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.155.0          Firefox 3: ok           IE 7: ok   Opera/9.51K: ok    We use gwt1.5.2 in our web application and when we try to open it using   chromium  then at the TAB focus is at the first textfield and the textfield   is writeable; but if you try to click other textfields then focus'll set   there if you strife mouse to the left or to the right (as you try to select   the text).  it's not convinient for users and not allowed us to use chromium.  can you decide this problem?       </pre>
