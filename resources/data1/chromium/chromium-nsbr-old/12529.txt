<title>Issue 12529 -   chromium -    Disable gears harder so apps don't think it works - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you have the &quot;location in signature&quot; lab on in gmail  it tries to use   gears while initializing.  We apparently provide enough of gears for this to   think it should load gears and then fail  preventing the editor from opening.    We should figure out how to not claim we support gears.  Probably just adding   a &quot;return false&quot; somewhere. </pre>
