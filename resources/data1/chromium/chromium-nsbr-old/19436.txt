<title>Issue 19436 -   chromium -    Backslash in file name doesn't open properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04       CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : GTK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works properly  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Converts backslash to forward   slash      1. Create a file with a backslash; this is a legal filename in Linux.  2. Double click to open.      The file is open.      The screen tries to open a file of the same name  with back slashes   converted to forward slashes.    Note: Drag and drop of the file works properly. Ctrl-O does not.    </pre>
