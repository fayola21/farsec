<title>Issue 8872 -   chromium -    webkit background clip text demo fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On both 2.0.169.1 and ToT  the -webkit-background-clip option doesn't   appear to be working properly.  Try this page:    <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/page/4/">http://webkit.org/blog/page/4/</a>    in Safari 4 and Chrome.  In Chrome  only the first line of text is visible.    In Safari  both lines are visible.    Is this a regression?   </pre>
