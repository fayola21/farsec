<title>Issue 17881 -   chromium -    Disk cache doesn't work on 64-bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You hit a compile assert since the RankingsNode are expected to be 36 bytes    but have a pointer in the last field  so they are 40 bytes on 64-bit.    Commenting out the compile assert leads to runtime failures because the block   size doesn't match.  Returning 40 instead of 36 BlockSizeForFileType for type   RANKINGS gets a bit further  but not enough.    Maybe we also have disk cache files checked into the repository for the   tests? </pre>
