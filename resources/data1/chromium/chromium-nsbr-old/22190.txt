<title>Issue 22190 -   chromium -    Find bar has a different close button than download and info bars.  Is this a good idea? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't think it is.    Compare the find bar's close button and all of its states  including hover and   pressed  to the close buttons on the download and info bars.  If the download   and info bar close buttons weren't broken  they'd look and act a lot like the   close buttons on tabs.    Why is the find bar different?    4.0.207.0  and  trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26488">r26488</a> </pre>
