<title>Issue 22668 -   chromium -    Extension browser tests are flakey on linux (timeouts) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many extension browser tests periodically timeout on linux. Probably some   underlying assumption in our infrastructure is not correct on linux.    To see examples of this  load the flakiness dashboard:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/flakiness-report/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/flakiness-report/</a>    Open any of the extension failures  then search for &quot;Timed-out&quot;. Look for   recent failures by looking at the &quot;last on&quot; at the bottom of each report. </pre>
