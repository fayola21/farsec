<title>Issue 16230 -   chromium -    location bar history imported from firefox not sorted by most used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3 (Official Build 19935)      1. Create firefox 3.0 profile and use it for a few months  2. Import FF profile into Chrome using Import bookmark &amp; Settings  3. Start typing an address that appears in history      The most used addresses from my history should appear first. There are some   pages I've been to 10s or 100s of times and FF puts these at the top of the   list after I've typed 3 characters from the URL or HTML Title.        After I type 4 characters there are 6 results shown. 2 web searches   (magnifying glass)  1 search with a globe  a bookmark I didn't know about    and 2 things from my history that I've been to exactly once each ever    today. The websearch and bookmark are okay  but not showing URLs I visit a   lot is a major regression from FF. </pre>
