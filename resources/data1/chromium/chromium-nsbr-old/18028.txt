<title>Issue 18028 -   chromium -    DCHECK(r != WAIT_ABANDONED) in logging.cc is contributing to test flakiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The code:        if (lock_log_file == LOCK_LOG_FILE) {        // Ensure that the mutex is initialized in case the client app did   not        // call InitLogging. This is not thread safe. See below.        InitLogMutex();    #if defined(OS_WIN)        DWORD r = ::WaitForSingleObject(log_mutex  INFINITE);        DCHECK(r != WAIT_ABANDONED);  // &lt;--- fails intermittently  #elif defined(OS_POSIX)        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;log_mutex);  #endif      } else {        // use the lock    Do you have ideas how to fix that? Maybe we should do something else   instead of DCHECKING? </pre>
