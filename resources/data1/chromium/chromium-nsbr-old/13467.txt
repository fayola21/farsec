<title>Issue 13467 -   chromium -    Remove --enable-extensions flag from stable channel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't want people to experiment with extensions on the stable channel   until they are more ready. So create a change to remove the flag  commit it   to make sure it passes tests  then revert it and pull the first change to the   release branches. </pre>
