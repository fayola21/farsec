<title>Issue 432 -   chromium -    Non-editable URLs in search engine management dialog should look non-editable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Open Options -&gt; Manage (search engines)  2. Select one of the pre-installed default options and click Edit  3. The URL field is not editable      Again  this is presumably intentional behaviour  but if the field should   not be edited  this could be indicated visually by greying it out  or   something like that.  In any case  if the Name and Keyword are editable  why not the URL?    </pre>
