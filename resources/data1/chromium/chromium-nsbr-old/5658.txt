<title>Issue 5658 -   chromium -    URL entered without http: will try to load local file rather than website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter a URL without http: (so //www.google.com)  2. URL will change to file://www.google.com      Also when http: is not specified  the default location should be the web so   http: should be added rather than file:      URL is changed to file://www.google.com which fails obviously    Please provide
