<title>Issue 4139 -   chromium -    Infinite loop of crashing awesomeness in bitmap allocation failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Crash report ID: 919b90b366d5af2e    The problem is our CHECK(0) in the bitmap allocation failures triggers a   message box with an error message. This doesn't terminate the app right   away  and we'll in fact continue getting painting messages recursively.    We should just change these checks to something more immediately crashy. </pre>
