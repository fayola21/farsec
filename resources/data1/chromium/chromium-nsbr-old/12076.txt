<title>Issue 12076 -   chromium -    Updating an extension creates multiple instances running at once - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create an extension with some toolstrip contents  and install it  2. Create an updated version with different toolstrip content and install   that (drag the .crx file onto browser  run with my not-yet-checked-in   autoupdate feature  etc.)  3. Notice that a new entry appears on the toolstrip  with a duplicate copy of   the old contents      The old version should disappear  and the new one should appear.        </pre>
