Component: Chrome &gt; User Interface  Type:      Feature request  Priority:  P2  Severity:  S2  In prod:   false  URLs affected:  &lt;none&gt;    Hi     Just a small feature request: on Firefox  there is this feature that I  really like and use all the time: &quot;Search for text when I start typing&quot;.  You don't have to first press Ctrl+F to search on the page.  Do you plan to add that to Chrome as well?    Cheers     Aurelien      aurelienboffy on September 04 2008 14:14 (Assigned)  Assignee: rickb   </pre>
