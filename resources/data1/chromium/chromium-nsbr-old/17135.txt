<title>Issue 17135 -   chromium -    application/json download crashes Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.194.0 Safari/531.5  OS + version: Kubuntu Karmic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KWin  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/12345/json">http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/12345/json</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Downloads the file  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): untested      1. Go to <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/12345/json">http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/12345/json</a>  2. Refresh/open new tab a few times. Usually takes 1-4 tries.      The file should either show or download.      Chrome crashes.      I'm going to guess its related to files being served as application/json    but I haven't tested anything else. </pre>
