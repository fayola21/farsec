<title>Issue 13916 -   chromium -    Really crashy on window close with extensions installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It gets easier to repro this the more extensions you have installed. On opt   builds  on my machine  I need about 5 to get it every time. On dbg builds  on   a different machine  I'm seeing it after about 3 (not sure why it's   different).    1. Enable extensions  2. Install about 5 extensions  3. Open a new window (a second window)  4. Close the second window    If no crash  repeating steps 3 and 4 a few times usually cause it. </pre>
