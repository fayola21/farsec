<title>Issue 2402 -   chromium -    Chrome gives error of 'page not available' without checking when utorrent is running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : almost any           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Run utorrent. (I was downloading as well in it)  2. After about 10-15 minutes  try going to a page in Chrome  3. It won't load. The only way is to repeatedly press the F5 button  in   which case the page will load sometimes on one of the presses.      Google Chrome should load the page as it usually does.      The error 'This page is not available.' appears.      </pre>
