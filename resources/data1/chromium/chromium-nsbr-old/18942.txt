<title>Issue 18942 -   chromium -    disable &quot;did you mean http://host/?&quot; infobar when DNS errors are hijacked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you're using an ISP that returns custom error pages when DNS would   ordinarily fail (see <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-">http://arstechnica.com/tech-</a>  policy/news/2009/08/comcasts-dns-redirect-service-goes-nationwide.ars)    Chrome shows and infobar offering to take you to that host every time you do   a one-word search from the omnibox.    Rather than give users yet another option to disable that infobar  Chrome   should be smarter about not showing it when DNS errors are being captured.    One idea is to try to resolve a known unresolvable domain   (nonexistanthost.google.com) when the network settings change. If it   resolves  then disable the infobar.   </pre>
