<title>Issue 19398 -   chromium -    Cannot move window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows XP: If you right click on Google Chrome from task bar and click on   &quot;Move&quot;  mouse cursor it's not correct positioned on title bar so I cannot   move the browser window.  Not big issue  but if you have an external monitor turned off and Ghrome   starts on that monitor  then it's a little annoying. </pre>
