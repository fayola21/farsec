<title>Issue 17381 -   chromium -    Extension api function callbacks should always fire - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently if an error occurs  a text string goes to console.error  but the   callback never fires and the caller cannot handle the error case.    Create a mechanism so that callbacks always return a result object that has a   &quot;success&quot; member  that if true means that the additional callback params   should be attached to the result object. if success is false  it should have   an &quot;error&quot; member.     </pre>
