<title>Issue 20768 -   chromium -    Tabs don't redraw until a mouse passes over them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 24879)  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit i386  window manager : Metacity          Tabs don't appear to properly redraw until a mouse goes over them. This is   most visible when Ctrl+Tab switching  but can also be shown with mouse click   switching as well. The attached video first shows issues with mouse clicking   (see the grey/blue colours of the tab) and then with Ctrl+Tab switching. </pre>
