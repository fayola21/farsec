<title>Issue 15633 -   chromium -    Notify user that browser restart is needed after update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux  autoupdates do not affect the currently running  browser session.  Some users never log out and never restart their  browser normally.  To reach those users with the new version   we need to notify them that a new version has been installed and  will take effect when they exit and restart the browser.    An infobar message is probably the way to go.   </pre>
