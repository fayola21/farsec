<title>Issue 7705 -   chromium -    homeless.co.il: Toolbar obscures text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.homeless.co.il/sale/">http://www.homeless.co.il/sale/</a> in Chrome.  2. Scroll down one page      The &quot;Homeless Toolbar&quot; that should be collapsed at the very bottom of the page is displayed on   top of the listings.    Analysis:  If I set Chrome's useragent to make it look like Firefox then the site renders fine.    The problem looks like a simple case of bad useragent detection.  The site actually works fine in   FF/Chrome but it's serving the IE version if it's webpage to Chrome.    Other browsers:  IE7/FF3: OK  Safari/WebKit/Chrome: FAIL </pre>
