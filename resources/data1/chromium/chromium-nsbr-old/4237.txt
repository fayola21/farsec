<title>Issue 4237 -   chromium -    Split file download problem with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. download a movie that is split into parts with no file association.   ex:.001 file 1  .002 file 2  .003 file 3  2. wait until they are all downloaded  3. google chrome gives it a file association and they are not numbered   correctly        If I use HJSPLIT it will bring the files together as 1 file so the video   can be played. They are split because it is easier to upload to a website.        Chrome messes up the names of the files  and gives one file a windows media   player file association. When it downloads it seems like Chrome does not   recognize the .001 as 1st file and then .002 as second file and so on. When   I go ahead to put the files together there is no .001 because HJSPLIT   supposed to recognize .001 then it will pull the rest in that order.    Please provide
