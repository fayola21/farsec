<title>Issue 6762 -   chromium -    Title bar of the tabs doesn't expand to the actual size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had 4 tabs open.  Inintially I had google mail and about: open. The two tabs here looked   good.   Later I opened docs/ and opened a document in it and then the title bars of   all the four tabs contracted as if I had too many tabs.    Please see the image. I don't have any repro steps right now. I will update   once I find them.     Google Chrome	2.0.158.0 (Official Build 8360) </pre>
