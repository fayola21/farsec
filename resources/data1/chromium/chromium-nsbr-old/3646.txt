<title>Issue 3646 -   chromium -    Ctrl-k doesn't work anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3             Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: N/A      1. Type Ctrl-k  2. No exclamation mark on the left-hand side of the location bar  3. Anything typed is searched in history      Ctrl-k used to have the same behaviour as in Firefox but it doesn't   anymore.  It's very handy to be able to distinguish between strict search   terms and history search.      Whatever is entered in the location bar is searched and is completed using   history.   </pre>
