<title>Issue 5697 -   chromium -    Should auto change the keyboard to Arabic/Hebrew  if a Arabic/Hebrew is pasted to chrome's box (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.40(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7133">r7133</a>)    Do we change the IME to a RTL  if a RTL text copied to any Chrome's input  box (Omnnibox  find-in bar  search box etc.. ) ?    -I have copied Arabic text in to clipboard.  -Pasted this text to any Chrome's input box (For eg: Omnibox)    Surprisingly  My IME is auto changed to RTL  in this case Arabic.    Is it by design ? If so  It would nice to have the same behavior even for  other i18n locales also         </pre>
