Pick up the latest dev build and over-install previous build  2. Click on Chrome's shortcut icon      What is the expected output?   No FRUI comes up on over-installs or updates    What do you see instead?  FRUI always comes up when doing over-install or updates        This is an effect of <a title="Make Chrome Installer delete installation directory if the version registry key is missing" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7176"> issue 7176 </a> </pre>
