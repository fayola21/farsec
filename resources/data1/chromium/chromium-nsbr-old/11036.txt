<title>Issue 11036 -   chromium -    Dictionaries (en-US-foo.bdic) are downloaded to random directory on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dictionaries effectively download the the cwd where chromium was launched.    Part of the issue is that it's not clear where they belong.  They  definitely don't belong in a user's profile  but ideally they could even be  shared by all users on the same system.  On Windows it downloads next to  the binary but we don't assume we can write there.    Also note:  - <a title="Figure out where to store spellcheck dictionaries on Mac." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8317"> Issue 8317 </a> is a similar issue on the Mac.  - <a title="Spell-checking dictionaries are not downloaded in case of system-level install" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9650"> Issue 9650 </a> points out that the current code doesn't even work on Windows  if your binary directory isn't writable.    The code to fix is    case chrome::DIR_APP_DICTIONARIES:  in chrome_paths.cc. </pre>
