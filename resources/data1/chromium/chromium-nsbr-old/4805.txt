<title>Issue 4805 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Watch cursor remains far too long after opening pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While loading a page  we change the user's mouse cursor to a pointer +   hourglass  then change back to a pointer when the load finishes.    On trunk  this has regressed.  On most page loads  we change to a pointer +   hourglass  but don't change back until several seconds after the page   loads.  This feels very frustrating.    Sample repro: Open a New Tab when there are none currently open (weirdly    if some are already open  the bug does not reproduce).    I suspect this is due to brettw's NavigationController refactoring work. </pre>
