<title>Issue 554 -   chromium -    Can't access https net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin</a>    Trying to access any https provides the following error:  Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): Unknown error    Including Google https  such as this bugzilla or gmail.  I don't discard that it may be a problem at WinHTTP layer  as https on IE  also fails  this time with the cryptic 'Can't find server or DNS error'  No problems accessing https with Firefox 3  so it's not a server/connection  problem.    OS: Windows XP SP2 / IE6 </pre>
