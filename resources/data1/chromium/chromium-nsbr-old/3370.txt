<title>Issue 3370 -   chromium -    Make images have correct titles when loaded at the toplevel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is part of <a title="Image documents need to have a meaningful title" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=107"> bug 107 </a> broken out. Images should have the correct titles.    Apparently  the Mac networking library always gives a &quot;suggested filename&quot;   for all loads  and this is what is used for computing the title of &quot;image   documents&quot;. We only give this when the suggested filename is given in the   headers.    After chatting with andersca on #webkit  we both think the best solution is   to modify ImageDocument to just use the lastPathComponent of the URL   (possibly with some fallback) instead of the suggested filename. This will   work better for different platforms  and doesn't require us to compute a   suggested filename for every single load. </pre>
