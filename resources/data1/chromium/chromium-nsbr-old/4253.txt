<title>Issue 4253 -   chromium -    composing a message on juno.com broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. navigate to www.juno.com  2. enter username  password  and click &quot;sign in&quot;  3. click &quot;you have [no] new email&quot;  4. Click on the &quot;write&quot; tab  5. begin typing anything in the &quot;message body&quot; field  6. change the insertion point to the middle of the text  7. begin typing/backspace/etc.      text insertion/deletion should behave conventionally      -when typing  inserted characters overwrite following characters.  This   seems consistent when there is only one line of text  inconsistent if there   are more  but it seems to happen more often on the last line of text.  -sometimes the overwritten text will be re-inserted after a short period of   time (seemingly especially after inserting punctuation).  This could happen   all at once  or one character at a time using the right arrow key.  This is   not consistent.  -sometimes typed words... even without ever changing the insertion point    will disappear after jumping to the next line.  -when using backspace  the deleted characters are often replaced with   another character.  The new character seems to usually be the character to   the right of the insertion point before the backspace.      Please provide
