<title>Issue 17853 -   chromium -    Add UI to trigger extensions auto-update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to have something on the chrome://extensions page that would   let you manually kick off extension auto-updates instead of having to use a   custom update frequency.    Being able to do this for individual extensions might be useful  but the   easiest initial implementation would be to just have one button to start the   update check for all extensions.      </pre>
