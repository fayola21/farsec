<title>Issue 16437 -   chromium -    dom perf test should output the perf lines directly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the dom perf test writes out local files that the build bot script processes  it   should just write the raw perf lines like the other perf tests so the build bot   script can be simpler.  this is also needed so we can run a reference build   through the test. </pre>
