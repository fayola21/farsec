<title>Issue 13051 -   chromium -    &quot;Close&quot; X not working on Vista  larger fonts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0    I am using larger screen fonts for my HTPC running Vista SP2. When hovering   over the red X to close the application  it does not work  nor does the   button animate when hovered. I have to put the cursor to the far right   position of the button for it to close. If I double click on the X normally    it acts as if I'm double clicking the taskbar (and making the window full   screen or windowed).     Screen fonts are 135% from normal size.  </pre>
