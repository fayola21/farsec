<title>Issue 5575 -   chromium -    Cannot scroll up or down with mouse wheel in Other Bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Downloaded the new release of Chrome and something's been bugging me ever  since using it...when opening the bookmark menu you can't scroll up and  down using a wheel on your mouse.  It's the little things but it's enough  to make continue to use Firefox until this is implemented - it's an  otherwise awesome browser!!    Regards     Ed </pre>
