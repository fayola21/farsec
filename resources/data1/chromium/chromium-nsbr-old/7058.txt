<title>Issue 7058 -   chromium -    User should be able to print SSL error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like  it never worked.    --Navigate to any SSL error page.  --Hit Ctrl + P or menu Page-&gt;Print on.    Expected:  Print Dialog should be displayed.    Result:  Nothing happens    FF3.x : works fine.  IE7.x : works fine.  Safari3.x: It shows up a dialog for SSL error info  so we can't expect the  user to print the dialog.    PS:  The bug is also applicable to Saving the error page also  I mean user  should be able to save the SSL error page (?) </pre>
