<title>Issue 20207 -   chromium -    The tab on a window with a single tab cannot be dragged to another Google Chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open Google Chrome  2. open a new tab  there are now two open tabs  3. drag the second tab to a new window  4. you can't merge both windows to one anymore  dragging the tab  drags   the window itself        I expect to drag the tab to another Google Chrome window. The   originating window should close since it has not tabs left.        When you try to drag a tab around from a window that only has a single   tab  you drag the entire window instead of the tab.    <b>Please provide
