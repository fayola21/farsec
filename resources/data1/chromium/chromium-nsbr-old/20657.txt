<title>Issue 20657 -   chromium -    Remove Google Chrome from Windows 7 Taskbar on Uninstall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  4.0.203.2                    1. Install Google Chrome  2. Pin Google Chrome to Windows 7 Taskbar  3. Uninstall Google Chrome      All Google Chrome icons  including the one pinned to the Windows 7 Taskbar  are removed with the program.      Google Chrome icon stays pinned to Windows 7 Taskbar with ugly application icon.    Please ask if you really need a screenshot  I'll do it  but I don't feel like doing an uninstall of my precious Google   Chrome! :-) If it doesn't exist  it should just disappear. I shouldn't have to:  A. Unpin it manually  B. Open it and have Windows ask me to remove it </pre>
