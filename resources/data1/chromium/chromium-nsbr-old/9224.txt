<title>Issue 9224 -   chromium -    www:faraos.dk: Chrome cannot open page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.faraos.dk/">http://www.faraos.dk/</a>          Firefox 3.x: ok           IE 7: ok           IE 8: ok      - The website cant be read by Chrome  where on Firefow and Explorer there   is no problem. I don't know what causes this problem  but would think that   it might occur on more sites      simply that the site cant be seen by using Chrome       </pre>
