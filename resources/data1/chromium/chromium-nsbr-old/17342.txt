<title>Issue 17342 -   chromium -    Bookmarks &amp; search engines  new features - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.1             Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL        This &quot;issue&quot; contains suggested new features only. Please ignore it if   you're interested in defects only. Sorry for using this framework.    1. Simple: on the new tab page  there could be another button on the right   side from &quot;+&quot; that opens a new tab: it could open a new window. Instead of   a &quot;+&quot;  it could have an up-arrow or a doorknob  to open a window. ;-)    2. It should be possible to export and import the custom search engines.    3. A more advanced solution: custom search engines and bookmarks should be   unified into &quot;[generalized] bookmarks&quot; (that could be fully   exported/imported). In their list (shift/ctrl/b)  each of them would be   allowed to contain %s (query) or no query. Each of them would be allowed to   have a keyword associated with it  including the bookmarks without query    or no keyword. (I am using keywords for ordinary bookmarks anyway  but I   have to define them as custom search engines.)     Bookmarks with %s (search engines) could be shown with a different   background color but they could be added to new and old folders  too. There   would also be a special folder in the &quot;[generalized] bookmarks&quot; that would   show the search engines (bookmarks with %s) only: right-clicking URL and   choosing to edit search engines would directly send the user to this folder   in the &quot;[generalized] bookmarks&quot;.    4. I think that the &quot;generalized URLs&quot; - including custom search engines   with their queries - should be offered from the history as we are &quot;typing&quot;    much like all other URLs. </pre>
