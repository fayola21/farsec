<title>Issue 14176 -   chromium -    Tab dragging/tabstrip docking problems with ATI Remote Wonder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31  Operating System     : Windows XP SP3 32bit      1. Open Chrome with two tabs  2. Move one of the tabs into another window  3. Try to move/drag the tab back into the previous window: It's impossible    the tab just won't try to stick into the target window tab list.        The tab should be moved with dragging back into the window where you try to   drag it but it just won't go there.    It also seems that it's now very easy to accidentally drag a tab from the   current chrome window into a new chrome window. This makes the problem even    more frustrating as it seems to be impossible to drag the tab back. </pre>
