<title>Issue 19182 -   chromium -    Omnibox: popup shape should mirror star/go buttons and line up icons. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pulling a piece out of <a href="http://crbug.com/14898">http://crbug.com/14898</a> .    Popup should extend to edges of star and go buttons and have rounded corners like those buttons.    [Not sure how well that works visually when you don't have the page and wrench menus  since it   will overlap the scrollbar.]    Icons align under star.  Text aligns under omnibox. </pre>
