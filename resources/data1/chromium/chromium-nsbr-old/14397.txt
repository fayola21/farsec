<title>Issue 14397 -   chromium -    [www.fibi.co.il]: Pulldown menus poorly laid out on www.fibi.co.il - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.fibi.co.il">http://www.fibi.co.il</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?      The pulldown menus look sloppy  and the secondary menu is wrongly located   over on the left edge of the page.        What is the expected result?    The pulldown menus should be laid out in a contiguous  solid block  and the   secondary menu should appear immediately to its left.            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://www.fibi.co.il">http://www.fibi.co.il</a>  2. Mouse over the menu bar on the top of the page; try the second option   from the right.  3. Mouse over the first item that appears in that menu.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Works on IE6. Fails similarly on FF3.    Please provide any additional information below.    This is the home page of one of Israel's main banks. </pre>
