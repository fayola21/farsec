<title>Issue 9622 -   chromium -    Webkit editor swallows hotkeys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. put cursor in some input field  2. press ctrl-l      the omnibox should be focused  but instead you see an l typed into the  input field.    I have a (sad) attempted fix here: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/50049/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/50049/show</a>    It seems that the char event windows sends for the L in ctrl+L has a  keycode different from the keycode send for the char event for just L.  (It's 0x14 instead of ASCII L.) On linux (and presumably mac) the  disambiguating char event has ASCII L keycode for both L and ctrl-L  and  the only difference is the modifiers. This probably should be fixed in  disambiguateKeyDownEvent  but I don't understand that function at all.   </pre>
