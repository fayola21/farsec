<title>Issue 23057 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Frame Check - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently only Internet Explorer 6  7  and 8 on Win7   Vista or XP SP2  are supported.    However  the check() method redirect the user to the install page even  when there is nothing the user can install.  For example  I am using IE7 with Win2003 server  and I cannot download  anything from the ChromeFrame install page. But the check() method  still shows me the dialog.    Would it possible to redirect the user only when the user can really  download a ChromeFrame to install?  And if the user's OS + Browser combination is not supported  just skip  the check.  Because it does not help but blocked the user with the dialog.    ChromeFrame is a really great project!  Thanks! </pre>
