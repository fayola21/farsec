<title>Issue 1957 -   chromium -    Hungarian localization: out-of-context translations in tab's context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)      1. Set browser language to Hungarian  and right click on a tab  2. Note that the meaning of some entries is not clear in this context (one   needs to understand Hungarian to see this ...)    Two of the translations are not faithful in this specific context.  Most   probably the translator did not know where these strings were going to be   used in the browser.      I suggest correcting these two translations as follows:    English - Hungarian (current) - Hungarian (suggested)    1. &quot;Close other tabs&quot; - &quot;Egy��_��_b lapok bez��_��_r��_��_sa&quot; - &quot;A t��__bbi lap bez��_��_r��_��_sa&quot;  2. &quot;Close tabs to the right&quot; - &quot;Z��_��_rja a lapokat jobbra&quot; - &quot;Jobbra l��_��_v��_��_   lapok bez��_��_r��_��_sa&quot;     </pre>
