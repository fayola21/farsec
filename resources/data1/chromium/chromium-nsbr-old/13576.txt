<title>Issue 13576 -   chromium -    search text truncated sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)  WebKit	531.0  V8	1.2.6.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.183.1 Safari/531.0            1. open a tab  2. type search text and press enter quickly      A google search for the text I entered.      I get a search result for the text with the last two characters cut off   (sometimes).    For example  I type &quot;chrome linux&lt;enter&gt;&quot;  and I get a google search page   for &quot;chrome lin&quot;.  If I pause before pressing enter  and wait for the drop-  down suggestions to stabilize  then I don't get truncation.  I also don't   get it if I paste the text and press enter.    It seems like a race condition with the drop-down  where it fills in the   suggestion &quot;search google for ...&quot; as I type  and when I press enter  it   picks the one for the prefix that hasn't been updated for the last couple   characters I typed.    The problem seems more prevalent with different words  maybe depending how   slow the other suggestions are to come up for that prefix.  I've seen it   truncate from 1-4 characters for the same search word. </pre>
