<title>Issue 6654 -   chromium -    Option for forcing popup in tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  URLs (if applicable) : not applicable            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Clicking a link which opens a popup      The page opens in a new tab of the existing Chrome window.      Chrome opens the page in a new window    Some users experience that its annoying when each popup opens in an new   window. It takes a lot op space in the Windows toolbar. Furthermore  you   can't change the adressbar.    The only reason to open a popup in a new window is because some tabs are   build for a special size  bigger or smaller than the Chrome window. Taking   this one in account  i think the best way to handle popups is:    1. A user clicks on a link which leads to a popup  2. The popup opens in a new tab in the same window  3. A button shows up  like the &quot;Pop-ups blocked&quot; button downstairs on the   right  which says &quot;Open page in popup&quot; or &quot;Open page in original size&quot;. </pre>
