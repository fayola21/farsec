<title>Issue 17577 -   chromium -    DOM Perf test lacks reference build results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DOM Perf test lacks reference build results    Without reference build results  it is hard to know if a &quot;regression&quot; is real   or just corresponds to a system change.  I don't think we can take these test   results seriously without reference build results.    I don't know who to assign this to.    I'm referring to the test that corresponds to this output:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-</a>  10.5/dom_perf/report.html?history=150 </pre>
