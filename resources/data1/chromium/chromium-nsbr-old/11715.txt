<title>Issue 11715 -   chromium -    Privacy problems with &quot;New tab&quot; showing last visited content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.64  URLs (if applicable) : (new tab)                  1. open a new tab  2. you and everyone near your desk will see the last visited Web pages    Currently  one of the biggest annoyances in Google Chrome regarding privacy   is that each time a new tab is opened  the last visited pages are shown.   While this is ok in a private environment  not everybody - especially in   Europe - wants to show everyone else working or standing near the user's   desk  which Web pages were visited recently.    Please add a user setting to show a user chosen home page or a blank page   instead. This setting currently only exists for the start page  but not the   new tab page. Thanks in advance for respecting user privacy. </pre>
