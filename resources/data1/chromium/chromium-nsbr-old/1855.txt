<title>Issue 1855 -   chromium -    On exit one Chrome process consuming all CPU remaints - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to 'About Chrome'  2. Should get dialog saying new version available.  3. Click ok.  4. Exit out the app. I use the exit menu option.  5. Bring up task manager and notice that one chrome process remains   consuming all the CPU  even after a couple of minutes.    I've seen this twice now. First time when upgrading to 28 and now again   when upgrading to 29. Both times I've had to kill the process via the task   manager.       </pre>
