<title>Issue 13103 -   chromium -    Installing extensions with multiple windows open is wonky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open a second browser window.  2. Go to <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-</a>  documents/extensions/samples and install an extension that you don't already   have.  3. Observe that the extension shows up in one of the windows  but is   invisible in the other.    Other weirdness:  - hovering over where the extension should be shows a giant grippy.  - uninstalling the extension will crash chrome. </pre>
