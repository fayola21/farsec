<title>Issue 4808 -   chromium -    Content area stops updating sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://ogur.livejournal.com/428311.html">http://ogur.livejournal.com/428311.html</a> .  Now right-click the window   frame  or open the Chrome Task Manager and grab its titlebar to drag it   around.  Sometimes (~1 in 4 tries?)  the animated GIF on the page stops   spinning.  If you have set the cursor in a textfield  the cursor stops   blinking.  The entire page  in fact  has stopped updating -- although   WM_PAINT is still getting through because you can drag a window over the   content area and not leave destroyed areas behind.    I overheard some speculation about sub-pumps not running etc. but didn't   understand it enough to write down anything useful :) </pre>
