Start ftp server (vftpd didn't really try another ftp server) on any   host you want (in this case dcground.kicks-ass.net)  2. Set up the vftpd to disable anonymous access directory listing   (vsftpd.conf entry dirlist_enable set to NO)  3. Try address any file from the FTP directly... FF  Safari  IE7 can   dispaly or popup with download dialog  chrome fail to do so...       Expacted result is to be able to address files from ftp directly so the   anonymous users can download them when you send them full link  but they   can't list the ftp content...
