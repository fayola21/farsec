<title>Issue 18454 -   chromium -    URLFetcher::Delegate::OnURLFetchComplete not called when network cable is pulled. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i have some code that makes a call to a url that holds the connection open  for a long time.    If I unplug the network after the url connection has been established but  before the remote end sends any data back then my Delegate is never called.    If I unplug the network before the url connection is established then then  my delegate is invoked. </pre>
