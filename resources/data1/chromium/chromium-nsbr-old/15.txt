<title>Issue 15 -   chromium -    Chrome(ium?) is not fully Open Source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download the sourcecode        Sourcecode is compilable using nothing but Open Source software.        One of the build-requirements is Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. The usage of  the free (as in beer) Visual Studio Express (i don't even know if the  express version is enough) requires acceptance of the EULA and the creation  of a MS-Windows Live ID(formerly known as Passport)  which also requires  the acceptance of an EULA.  While the license does conform to the letter of the Open Source Definition   it certainly does not conform to the spirit of point 5 (No Discrimination  Against Persons or Groups)  as acceptance of hundreds of pages of  Microsoft-legalese without the backing of a lawyer is plain stupid.
