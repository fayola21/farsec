<title>Issue 5660 -   chromium -    Failing loading pages using automated configuration proxy script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : ALL            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Configure an automated proxy configuration script. I use chrome in my  work place  so the proxy is used to go out to the internet. So this is very  important I think.  2. Open chrome browser and go to any URL you like in the _internet_  3. Try to go to a different URL (it can be in the same tab OR in a new one)      The new URL will be loaded      The browser get stuck on &quot;Resolving proxy...&quot; and the URL is not loaded    From what I remember  this bug was not in the first public version of  chrome. I used the first version of chrome with no problems at my work  place with this proxy.   </pre>
