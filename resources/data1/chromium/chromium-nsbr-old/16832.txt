<title>Issue 16832 -   chromium -    POST body not sent in response to a 307 redirect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> POST body not sent in response to a 307 redirect    It turns out that this bug is caused because we unconditionally null out the   upload data in URLRequest::Redirect.    This probably breaks some web sites  although I doubt this feature is very   popular since Firefox puts up a modal confirmation dialog before sending a   POST body in response to a 307 redirect. </pre>
