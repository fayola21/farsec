<title>Issue 20134 -   chromium -    crx files don't open in many zip programs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ones I've seen that do not work:    - Compressed folders (windows built in)  - osx built-in  - winzip    I've heard conflicting reports about 7zip.    Things to consider:  - Erik thinks that if we change the extension magic number to something   like &lt;zip-magic-number&gt;&lt;chrome-extension-magic-number&gt;  this may convince   most zip programs to think of crx files as zip files.  - We could register Chrome to handle the &quot;crx&quot; extension on the OS  and add   something like &quot;unpack extension&quot; to the right click menu.  - Change the crx format to be a nested zip. The information currently   prepended would be in the first level. </pre>
