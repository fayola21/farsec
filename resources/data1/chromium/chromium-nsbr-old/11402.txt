<title>Issue 11402 -   chromium -    click on an item in context menu doesn't work when Chrome unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1    When Chrome is running with many tabs  for context menu (both inside renderer   and for tabs on the top line of Chrome windows) clicks on individual commands    in a context menu are accepted only at the moments when Chrome is responsive   -- and clicks are not queued for unresponsive Chrome to be processed when it   becomes able to process user input again.    This takes annoyingly more time for each Copy (for selected text) or New Tab   or Duplicate (for a tab) from user than in other browsers / Windows   applications. </pre>
