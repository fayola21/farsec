<title>Issue 14159 -   chromium -    Add an explicit uninitialize method to base/icu_util - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently have a method in base/icu_util.h called Initialize(). I'm   proposing that we also provide an explicit UnInitialize() method that calls   FreeLibrary on the loaded DLL. This will allow us to cleanly shutdown and   release all library references from within chrome.dll.  </pre>
