<title>Issue 11437 -   chromium -    Autoscroll shows cursors for directions not available to scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a page with only vertical scrollbars  2. Press middle-mouse  3. Move cursor diagonally.    You see diagonal (or even horizontal) cursor even though there's no   horizontal scroll available. IE only shows cursors for directions that can be   scrolled (in this case  only vertical scrolling cursors)  which feels   significantly better - when you only care about scrolling in two directions    it sucks to see cursors for eight possible directions. </pre>
