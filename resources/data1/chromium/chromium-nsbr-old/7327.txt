<title>Issue 7327 -   chromium -    Restore entered form values when restoring tabs/windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type some values in a form  2. Close the tab  3. Restore the tab    We would like to see the values preserved. Instead  the values are reset.    Password fields should not be restored. Ideally  we wouldn't restore credit card fields either (16   digits). Credit card verification codes would be trickier (3 digits  could be confused with phone   numbers)  but maybe we could ignore fields that don't allow autocomplete?     </pre>
