<title>Issue 4757 -   chromium -    chrome::PathProvider should not create the directories that it returns a path for. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a cleanup issue that came up during a code review for patch 11586.    The method PathProvider under the chrome namespace in the  chrome/common/chrome_paths.cc file currently create some of the directories  for which they return the path of if they don't already exist. It should  not be the responsibility of this method to create directories  the callers  of that method should take care of creating them  themselves  when it makes  sense.   </pre>
