<title>Issue 4675 -   chromium -    Chrome JavaScript Debugger crashes the tab when you execute 'print length(&lt;whatever&gt;)'  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open Chrome's JavaScript debugger and type this:  $ print length('abc')    It replies with:  &gt;&gt;lost connection to tab    and the tab has crashed (&quot;Aw  Snap! Something went wrong while displaying   this webpage. To continue  press Reload or go to another page&quot;).    Chrome's JavaScript Console doesn't crash on this:  &gt; length('abc')  TypeError: number is not a function    While I'm at it  why does the message say &quot;webpage&quot; rather than &quot;web page&quot;?   Going to Chrome's help and typing in webpage   (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/search.py?">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/search.py?</a>  query=webpage&amp;ctx=en:searchbox) says &quot;Did you mean: web page&quot;  which seems   like strong evidence that this should be considered a typo. </pre>
