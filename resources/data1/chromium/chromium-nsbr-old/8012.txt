<title>Issue 8012 -   chromium -    Text selection is broken in about:network window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.167.0 (Developer Build 10261)        1. Open about:network window.  2. Click on &quot;Start tracking&quot;.  3. Populate about:network window with http requests  for example  by typing  a URL into the Omnibox.  4. Try to click and drag to select some text in about:network window. Start  at the beginning and drag downwards.    What is the expected output?     Should be able to drag and select all the text in the window.    What do you see instead?    Can only select part of it; it gets stuck and can't get past a certain point.    See attached picture.   </pre>
