<title>Issue 13353 -   chromium -    &quot;Windowless&quot; Silverlight in iframe reflects incorrect alignment - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Place a Silverlight plugin  with &quot;windowless=true&quot; parameter specified    in an iframe on a page  located at some location offset from the top of the   page.  2. &quot;Windowless=true&quot; required to allow dropdown menu overlays/etc.  Please   note that the symptom does not appear if windowless=false.  3. In case it helps  the iframes are being generated by an ExtJS TabPanel    under a toolbar (resulting in tabbed iframes roughly 30 pixels from the   screen top edge).  The Silverlight plugins on the iframes are set to 100%   width and height of their iframed documents.      Button/Control &quot;hitboxes&quot; within the Silverlight control should be aligned   with the controls.  For example  a button should highlight when the mouse   is moved over the button  and should register click events when the mouse   is clicked over the button image.      Button/control &quot;hitboxes&quot; are offset from the actual controls.  Casual   observation makes it appear the hitboxes are aligned as though the   Silverlight plugin was aligned to the top of the browser (rather than the   top of the iframe)  but that isn't conclusive.  Tooltips and such within   the control appear at expected locations  but only if the mouse is placed   over the ghost hitbox.  (In my observation  placing the mouse roughly 30   pixels above a button elicits the expected reaction/animation.)    <b>Please provide
