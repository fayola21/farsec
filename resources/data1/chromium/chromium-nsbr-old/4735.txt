<title>Issue 4735 -   chromium -    NativeControl is too complex - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NativeControl is too complex  for example there are all these views and   HWNDs... the NativeControl is a View that has a HWNDView that attaches to   the HWND of a NativeControlContainer which has as its child a HWND that is   the actual child HWND. Eek!    This could all be replaced by one object:    class NativeControl : public HWNDView { };    This object would also have an HWND that is the child HWND  and a wndproc   function. Oh and we could also get rid of the ATL dependency. </pre>
