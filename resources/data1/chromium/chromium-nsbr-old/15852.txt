<title>Issue 15852 -   chromium -    Incorrect keycode with dvorak keyboard layout on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.0~svn20090630r19587-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit x86  window manager : xmodad      1. Configure the system to use the dvorak xkb layout (e.g. using gnome-  keyboard-properties).  2. Go to <a href="http://www.asquare.net/javascript/tests/KeyCode.html">http://www.asquare.net/javascript/tests/KeyCode.html</a>  3. Type an 'x' into the input field (by pressing the key labeled 'B' on a   US QWERTY keyboard.      'x' appears in the input field  '88' (X) in the keyCode properties  and   '120' (x) in the charCode properties.      'x' appears in the input field  '66' (B) in the keyCode properties  and   '120' (x) in the charCode properties.    This affects applications like Google Reader.  To go to the next item  I   have to type an H in Dvorak (same physical key as J in QWERTY) instead of a   J.    It also affects built-in keyboard shortcuts in form fields within web pages   (e.g. ctrl-C  ctrl-X  ctrl-V).    I think this problem appeared in the nightly builds approximately one week   ago. </pre>
