<title>Issue 20509 -   chromium -    Complex character composition is not working correctly in layout tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-text-maxlength.html  LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-text-paste-maxlength.html    These layout tests fail on buildbot because the complex character (over-   and under-lines on the &quot;x&quot; char) is not rendered correctly. The actual   pixel dump from buildbot can be found at  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/layout_test_results/webkit-rel/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/layout_test_results/webkit-rel/</a>    The chrome browser (2.0.172.43) renders these tests correctly. I also got correct pixel dumps if I run the tests locally (vista machine).    Check http://b/1124513 for more info related to these tests.       </pre>
