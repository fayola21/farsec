<title>Issue 21182 -   chromium -    Google Docs - Document - Insert Drawing - It's invisible... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://docs.google.com">https://docs.google.com</a>         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Visit Google Docs at <a href="https://docs.google.com">https://docs.google.com</a>  2. Create a new document by choosing NEW -&gt; DOCUMENT  3. Choose INSERT -&gt; DRAWING.  4. Pick any shape or line in the toolbox and click and drag to create the   shape or line in the edit box.        I expect to see the shape or line I am drawing.        Nothing is visible.  I only see the bounding boxes after performing the   step  but there is nothing visible in the box.  Clicking &quot;Save and close&quot;   in the &quot;Insert Drawing&quot; panel shows the result  which IS visible within the   document... but which was a complete mystery during the whole editing   process.    This used to work in Chrome previously  though I don't know which version   stopped working.  If I can find the time to do so  I will test out various   previous versions of Chrome to determine which version stopped working.   </pre>
