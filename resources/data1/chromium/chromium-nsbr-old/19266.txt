<title>Issue 19266 -   chromium -    displaying the selected option of a combo-box needs scrolling down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39  URLs (if applicable) : attached file         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.5: OK           IE 7: OK             IE 6: OK        1. click button &quot;Test&quot;      A SELECT element is dynamically created (with &quot;size&quot; attribute of &quot;5&quot;).  It should look the same as the one declared statically in the HTML page.  Notably the selected option &quot;F&quot; should be displayed without scrolling.      The user needs to scroll to display the selected option.      Additional information:    Night build Chromium 4.0.202.0 (23182) also fails.  I search the list of Chrome issues but did not find the issue.  I have also attached a screen shot.  The issue occurs only for dynamically created SELECT element with an   explicit &quot;size&quot; attribute.  It work fine when the &quot;size&quot; attribute is not specified or equal to &quot;1&quot;   (dropdown list).   </pre>
