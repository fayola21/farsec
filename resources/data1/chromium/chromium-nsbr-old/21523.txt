<title>Issue 21523 -   chromium -    Blank page when going fullscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.208.0 (25904)  OS version               : 10.6      1. Create a window with 2 tabs.  2. Drag one tab out to form a new window.  3. Go fullscreen.      See content      See empty white screen    I tested this with 4.0.203.0 (203.0) for example and the effect is different. Instead of the white   screen  I get the toolbar gradient repeated all over the screen. </pre>
