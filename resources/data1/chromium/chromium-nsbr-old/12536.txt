<title>Issue 12536 -   chromium -    cannot tell if Chrome window is incognito or not - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.182.1    As of the moment  if two chrome windows are opened and one is incognito  there's no way to tell   which one is incognito. Right now  the only way to tell is if you open a new tab and it will say   &quot;you've gone incognito....&quot;      </pre>
