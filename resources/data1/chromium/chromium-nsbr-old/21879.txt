<title>Issue 21879 -   chromium -    When java is loading the back/close/forward buttons and hyperlinks don't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   If you go to a page with an java applet it does these things:  1. Java (or the java runtime environment) is initialized  2. The applet starts loading  3. The applet has loaded and you can use it.

Step 1 takes about 0.5 seconds on my computer.    <b>Please provide
