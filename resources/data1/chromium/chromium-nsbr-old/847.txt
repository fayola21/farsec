<title>Issue 847 -   chromium -    Import Settings should allow user to choose source browser's data directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not everyone has Firefox installed to the default directory.  Portable   Firefox (<a href="http://portablefirefox.mozdev.org/">http://portablefirefox.mozdev.org/</a>) is one example.  I've seen two   requests so far for the ability to choose the Firefox install directory in   the Import Settings dialog.  Seems reasonable enough. </pre>
