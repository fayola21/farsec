<title>Issue 8536 -   chromium -    Mini-previews on blogger do not work in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Log on to blogger.com  2. Click on &quot;edit posts&quot; to see the list of posts  3. Click on the triangle before the title of the post -- in other browsers   (IE/FF/Safari)  the user sees a mini text preview of the post.    I also tried masquerading the user-agent and it didn't work  either.    Original report and screenshot  thanks to Lubos Motl:    You may have to copy-and-paste the URL. Do you see the entries for  individual blog posts? They say &quot;Edit View [Triangle] [Title]&quot;. In  other browsers  clicking the triangle shows a minipreview of the post.  In Chrome  it does nothing.    Consequently  I can't really preview and moderate comments posted to  my <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/">http://motls.blogspot.com/</a> blog in Chrome  so this is the most  frequent activity for which I have to run Firefox or MSIE.    By looking at the HTML  I believe that the JavaScript function that  doesn't work right is setSelected  as in    [td class=&quot;title&quot; onclick=&quot;setSelected(this   &amp;#39;5111973760542708511&amp;#39;)&quot;]       </pre>
