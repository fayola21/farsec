<title>Issue 7537 -   chromium -    put grit generated headers in a subdir named grit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  GRIT generated headers are included just by name.  E.g.:    #include &quot;chrome_strings.h&quot;    It would be more obvious if this were:    #include &quot;grit/chrome_strings.h&quot;    This is better than the comment I've been adding. </pre>
