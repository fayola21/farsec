<title>Issue 9704 -   chromium -    resolving a query string against about:blank results in about:blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> resolving a query string against about:blank results in about:blank    this explains why LayoutTests/http/tests/navigation/onload-navigation-iframe-  timeout.html times out for us.    Firefox and Safari both support the about:blank?  and so it seems like we   probably should as well.    this involves changes to GURL's relative resolving code. </pre>
