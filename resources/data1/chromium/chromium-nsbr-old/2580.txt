<title>Issue 2580 -   chromium -    Scroll up on the mouse trackball does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Using a Kensington (all I had) as a wireless mouse (slim version)  2. The track ball on the mouse will scroll down  but not up.  You can use   the slide bar to pull it back up  but not the track ball.  It does not work   in this box or any page that allows scrolling.  I would think it might be   an options  but it allows to scroll down  but never up.    What is the expected result? The page should scroll in the direction of the   track ball on the mouse. It is reading the motion because i am able to zoom   in and out while holding the CTL key.      What happens instead? Nothing      Please provide
