<title>Issue 4897 -   chromium -    Chrome Middle-click Defeated on My.Yahoo! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. With a customized &quot;My Yahoo!&quot; page  add several panels from RSS feeds.  2. Initialize the panels with different blog feeds. My Yahoo! will show     the latest entries in each set RSS feed.  3. Middle-click on each item entry.  4. Not all middle-clicks are respected  over 50% of clicks do not result in            a new tab being opened.    NOTE: Because these steps require a Yahoo! account  I saved the resulting   page and edited it  see below.      - A new tab is created for each item which was middle-clicked.      - Many items that were middle-clicked did not open a new tab.    Please provide
