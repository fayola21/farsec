<title>Issue 6708 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Links in GMail chat open in the same tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On TOT (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=8212">r8212</a>)  links in chat windows within Gmail are clobbering the Gmail   frame.  I have no clue when this started  but I've been using trunk builds   recently  so I suspect sometime after <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=8000">r8000</a>.    I'm blaming a recent WebKit merge until someone comes up with something   better.    1. Open Gmail  2. Chat with someone  get a URL  3. Click the URL    EXPECTED:  Link opens in a new tab.    ACTUAL:  Link opens in the same tab. Click back to go back to Gmail and discover   that all your chat windows are closed. Grrrr. Lose messages people just   sent to you. Grrr. </pre>
