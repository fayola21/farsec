<title>Issue 22797 -   chromium -    Feature request: accept header and meta tag enhancements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the user feedback  I see two demand for a couple of enhancements:    1. Chrome Frame should send accept header: application/xhtml+xml  2. Meta tag should allow specification of selective IE versions. For e.g   allow the developer to switch to chrome frame for specific IE versions. One   way to do this is have the meta tag like this: &lt;meta  http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-  Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE8=1;IE7=1;chrome=1&quot;&gt; So that Chrome Frame is switched   in only for IE6. Note that the meta tag should also co-exist with   content=&quot;IE=EmulateIE7&quot;      </pre>
