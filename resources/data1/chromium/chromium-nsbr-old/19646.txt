<title>Issue 19646 -   chromium -    Maximise/Restore problem when double clicking title bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.201.1 (Vista)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a (Not app view  normal view)  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Open a window (I had one tab) have it maximised.  2. Double click the title bar twice to restore then maximise the UI        Doesn't look messed up ;-)        The omni-box appears double height. (Picture 1)  If a new page loads while this is happening  the title bar goes double   height. (Picture 2)  If minimised the appearance changes. (Picture 3) </pre>
