<title>Issue 3837 -   chromium -    Gears not detected @ http://aaronboodman.com/gearpad/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9   Gears Version        : 0.5.2.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://aaronboodman.com/gearpad/">http://aaronboodman.com/gearpad/</a>  Other browsers tested:     Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 3: n/a      Firefox 3 with Gears 0.4.2.0: ok            IE 7 with Gears 0.4.2.0: ok      1. Go to <a href="http://aaronboodman.com/gearpad/">http://aaronboodman.com/gearpad/</a>    What is the expected result?   Loading the page should give Gears Permission dialog    What happens instead?  Chrome doesn't show the dialog in the first place and when trying to go   offline  it says to install Google Gears. Looks like gears is somehow not   getting detected   </pre>
