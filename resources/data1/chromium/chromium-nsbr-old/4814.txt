<title>Issue 4814 -   chromium -    tabs stick to mouse when clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3:N/A           IE 7:N/A    Hi  whatever change you made in this new version now causes each tab to   stick to the cursor when it is clicked. I am running Windows 7 pre-beta and   there have been no problems whatsoever up until today.     But sometime today when I click on a tab to move to it  the tab &quot;sticks&quot; to   the cursor and moves off the tab bar  as if I had clicked on a tab to move   it on purpose - when all I'm doing is simply clicking on a tab to select   it.     I now have to double click on a tab to remove the &quot;stickiness&quot;. I've   checked my mouse settings etc and other Google Chrome options  including   uninstall and re-install to no avail.     Chrome is my default browser so this new bug  even though I am using a pre-  beta OS  is disheartening because it has arrived for no particular reason -    unless there was an update on your end that is causing this problem.     Please fix it - I don't want to go back to Firefox  IE  Safari  Opera or   anything else!    Cheers and many thanks    Alex. </pre>
