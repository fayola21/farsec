<title>Issue 3026 -   chromium -    Normalize cookie expiration dates based on the server's date field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I recall correctly  Firefox does this.  The basic idea being that the   local time and the server time can mismatch.  So if the server sent a Date   header with the response  then use this to calculate the expiration delta    and normalize this to local time.  This is basically what max-age achieves    but it hasn't always been supported  so everyone still uses GMT expiration   dates :   </pre>
