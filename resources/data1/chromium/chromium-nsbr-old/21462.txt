<title>Issue 21462 -   chromium -    Clear Browsing Data is modal and not in a good way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Application Menu:Clear Browsing Data��_��__ or Preferences:Personal   Stuff:Clear Browsing Data��_��__  2. Press command-T a few times      Expect: Clear Browsing Data should not be app-modal.  If it's supposedto   be app-modal  command-T should not do anything.  It doesn't seem to be   app-modal on Windows or Linux  but it is window-modal on the Options   window  which on those platforms is the only way to access this dialog.  Observe: command-T brings up a new browser window with a new tab.    You can interact with this window with the keyboard  but not the mouse.    The second command-T press opens another new tab - sort of.  The   animations never actually happen (go go gadget unexpected event loop!)    so the tab strip just winds up looking stupid.    If raised from the Preferences  we probably want Clear Browsing Data to be   window-modal (a sheet).    If raised from the application menu  we probably want it to not be modal at   all.    It is currently possible to raise multiple Clear Browsing Data dialogs from   the application menu: the application menu item remains available even   when a Clear Browsing Data window is open.  We should fix this.    Also  if we do what I'm suggesting (Clear Browsing Data sheet in the   Preferences  or a non-modal dialog from the app menu)  we should ensure   that bad things don't happen when you try to get (or succeed in getting)   two instances at once.      4.0.206.1 official release (206 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25349">r25349</a>)  4.0.208.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25632">r25632</a> </pre>
