<title>Issue 7702 -   chromium -    Chrome saves form data in HTTPS pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.162.0 (Build oficial 9536) (and all the earlier versions with form   autocompleting)      1. Enable form autocompleting  2. Enter any HTTPS site  for example  an online store and enter sensitive data (i.e. credit card   numbers) to use it  3. The next time you visit that site  the card number is remembered      That kind of sensitive data should not be saved  or at least the user should have the option to choose   to save it or not. Only passwords that the user explicitly accepts should be saved when visiting HTTPS   sites.      You get a list with suggestions (card numbers) to fill the field. </pre>
