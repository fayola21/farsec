<title>Issue 13367 -   chromium -    Chrome 2.0.172.30 hangs too much on page loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Simply visit some sites with any animated or complex contents  e.g   Google News        It should load pages as fast as it used to          It hangs and takes much longer to complete  circle-icon in the tab keeps   spinning and spinning  hourglass-arrow never goes away...  It seems due to V8 changes in 2.0.172.30.  2.0.172.28 is fine  instead. I had to downgrade.      <b>Please provide
