<title>Issue 20905 -   chromium -    sync_integration_tests should use launcher from browser_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> from phajdan.jr:    sync_integration_tests don't use correct launcher (that's bad and will   induce flakiness). See chrome/test/browser/browser_test_launcher_* files    and also how browser_tests binary is built in chrome.gyp.   sync_integration_tests should use the same launcher.    This bug is to fix that up.    Because we run the sync_integration_tests one at a time (via gtest_filter)    this may be lower priority.    jcampan may be working on a change to make the browser test launcher more   reusable; it is important to coordinate with him. </pre>
