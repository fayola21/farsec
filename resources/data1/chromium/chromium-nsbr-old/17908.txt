<title>Issue 17908 -   chromium -    Improvements to History and Downloads pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (21852)    To make navigation in History and Downloads easier and more productive  I   suggest the following:    1) Downloads history should be kept for as long as the navigation history is.    2) There should be a link for each day  for the current week; a link for each   week  for the remaining of the month; and a link for each month  for the rest   of history. This would apply to whatever date was being currently displayed.    Navigation links should be at both the top and bottom of the page and a link   to the last page should also exist. </pre>
