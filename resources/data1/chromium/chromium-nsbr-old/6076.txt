<title>Issue 6076 -   chromium -    Remove the tld prebuild step and check in the generated output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Prebuild steps are kind of janky in visual studio.  It would be nice if we  could just check in the generated output of tld_cleanup.exe.    Alternately  we could replace the data file with a c++ file with static  allocated data that does what we want.  This would save parsing the data  file and remove the data resource completely. </pre>
