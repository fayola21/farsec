<title>Issue 9933 -   chromium -    Remove Oriya native name from accept-language list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off <a title="Block Oriya Chrome in Windows XP" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7325"> issue 7325 </a>.    Currently  we have blocked Oriya on XP  but in the accept-language list  we   still have Oriya with a native name showing as boxes there on XP  having   Oriya in A-L is fine  but perhaps we shouldn't show 'Oriya wrriten in   Oriya'   </pre>
