<title>Issue 1127 -   chromium -    Have option to show a status bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate to some page  2. Take a look at statusbar  3. Take a look on it after a navigation is complete      I wish there would be a setting to make statusbar be visible all the time.   And maybe even option to add a border  sometimes it is hard to see it   because of webpage background.      Statusbar disappears after the navigation is complete. And there is no   setting to make it visible permanently.    Please provide
