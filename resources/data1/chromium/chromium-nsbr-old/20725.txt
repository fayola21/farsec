<title>Issue 20725 -   chromium -    Web pages render as blank until browser window is manually resized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0 (24881)    OS version               :  10.6      1. This is a hard issue to reliably reproduce. What happens is whenever I open a window   in a new tab (usually using Ctrl+clicking)--the new tab opens  the spinner stops   indicating the page has finished loading  but when I switch to the tab it's completely   white/blank.  2. I grab the bottom corner of the browser and resize the page slightly  then everything   appears      I expect webpages to be visible immediately after they've finished loading    This never happens in Safari or Firefox. It started happening sometime last week (I've   been keeping up with regularly builds) but before that it never occurred  so I think it's a   recent bug.    It was *not* occurring in this version of Chrome: 4.0.202.0 (202.0)    I recently upgraded to Snow Leopard but this issue was occurring before I upgraded so   it's not related to that. </pre>
