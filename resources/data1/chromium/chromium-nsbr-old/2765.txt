<title>Issue 2765 -   chromium -    crash on closing tab after closing the window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just killed the top level window (of many windows) and there was a lag on   my machine so the top level window didn't disappear right away. While it   was still around  I tried killing a tab in that window. This caused chrome   to crash (probably because the event to kill the tab went in after chrome   had already killed its window).
