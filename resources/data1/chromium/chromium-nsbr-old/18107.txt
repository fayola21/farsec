<title>Issue 18107 -   chromium -    Add POST support for TemplateURLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some search engines (e.g. dir.bg) use POST instead of GET.  Firefox supports   search engines (or bookmark keywords  or both  I can't remember) doing POST    and we have support for it at the URLFetcher layer  so mostly we'd just need   to add something to TemplateURLs.  I don't know if the OpenSearch spec says   something about this. </pre>
