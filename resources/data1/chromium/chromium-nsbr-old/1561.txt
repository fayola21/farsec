<title>Issue 1561 -   chromium -    Dialog box tab sequence is not set to the first highlighted button in window frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Any dialog box with at least one button (e.g. alert box  etc)          Pressing the &quot;space&quot; key does not in fact press the first highlighted   button in the window frame.      Instead  when &quot;space&quot; button is pressed  nothing happens. The first button   (which is highlighted) can be pressed with &quot;space&quot; key only after the   sequence is set to it by pressing the &quot;tab&quot; key once.      Please provide
