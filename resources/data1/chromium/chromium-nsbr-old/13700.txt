<title>Issue 13700 -   chromium -    URL bar misses final keystrokes when typing quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;include svn revno; e.g. dpkg -s chromium-browser&gt;    Version: 3.0.183.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17570">r17570</a>    OS + version : gHardy latest  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : WindowMaker      1. Type something into the URL bar quickly  2. Hit enter as fast as possible    If I type fast enough  the end of the search terms are missed.    One extreme example was I types &quot;monkey&lt;enter&gt;&quot; and I ended up searching   google for &quot;mo&quot;.    I have also done things like &quot;google.com&lt;enter&gt;&quot; and ended up searching   google for &quot;google.&quot;.    This is very repeatable for me. I'm using a Kinesis keyboard  so maybe my   typing patterns differ from most people.    I just tried reproducing this on the latest Mac build  but no such luck. I   don't have a Windows PC here  but I'm pretty sure I saw this behavior on   Windows as well  but I can't really be sure.     </pre>
