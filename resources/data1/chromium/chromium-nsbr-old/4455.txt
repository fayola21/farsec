<title>Issue 4455 -   chromium -    Dialogs blocking other tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.18    It may not be a bug  but...    When using multiple tabs  if one tab displays a dialog (like a   confirmation)  you can't switch to other tabs. Is that the intended   behaviour? Shouldn't tabs be more independent of each other? Won't this   mean that if one dialog freezes (for whatever reason)  then all the tabs   become unusable?    Vista 64  4GB ram  dual core cpu </pre>
