<title>Issue 19171 -   chromium -    ��_��_��_Import bookmarks from��_��_��_ pop-up should have disabled appearance when its checkbox is deselected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Remove profile at ~/Library/Application Support/Chromium.  2. Launch Chromium.app.  3. Uncheck the ��_��_��_Import bookmarks from��_��_��_ checkbox.      Expect: The popup menu allowing choices such as ��_��_��_Safari��_��_��_ and ��_��_��_Mozilla   Firefox��_��_��_ should be disabled.  It should take on the grayed-out appearance.  Observe: Said popup menu remains active and it is possible to interact with   it.    For an example of a popup menu controlled by a checkbox  see System   Preferences:Desktop &amp; Screen Saver.  The ��_��_��_Change picture every��_��_��_ checkbox   and pop-up behave appropriately.    4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23183">r23183</a> </pre>
