<title>Issue 21424 -   chromium -    moles: handle relative URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Relative URLs within an extension don't work with chrome.toolbar.expand.  You   currently have to use chrome.extension.getURL() in order to get a full URL.    For example:  chrome.toolbar.expand({url: &quot;foo.html&quot;});   fails to open a relative URL &quot;foo.html&quot; within the extension.   </pre>
