<title>Issue 8845 -   chromium -    The test shell of Chrome needs functions which support IME-related tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;See b/1193346&gt;    The current test shell cannot test IME-related issues since it does not   provide interfaces to emulate IME behaviors.  Even though I'm not an expert of the test shell  I'm adding some IME-  related functions to the EventSendingController class to let an eventSender   object send IME events as well as send normal input events.  Please feel free to give me your comments and ideas.   </pre>
