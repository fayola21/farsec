<title>Issue 23038 -   chromium -    about:version improvement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be really useful if about:version listed the revisions of all the   dependencies used to build the binary below the information that is   currently there  instead of just listing the revision of the chromium   trunk. The information could be made to expand on mouse click so that it   doesn't bother users.    Since I don't know which would be easier to implement I propose two   formats.    Either a long format like this  with info taken from the DEPS file:    Dependencies:   <a href="http://google-breakpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src@346">http://google-breakpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src@346</a>  /trunk/deps/third_party/icu38@25921  /trunk/deps/page_cycler/acid3@19546  /trunk/deps/third_party/python_24@19441  ...    Or a short format like this  with info taken from svn/git files:    Dependencies: breakpad@346  icu38@25921  acid3@19546  python_24@19441  ... </pre>
