<title>Issue 13763 -   chromium -    make renderer backing store cache be based on total bytes rather than number of renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you add a bunch of toolstrips  the tab contents are of the browser will   flash quickly to black as you change window focus.  This is because each   toolstrip is a separate render widget and BackingStoreManager uses a fixed   number of bitmaps rather than using a total size in bytes to control its   cache.  On high memory machines  this is 5  so to reproduce just add 5   toolstrips  which means that by default one of the renderers is always   uncached and will flash as it repaints.    The flash looks worse than it should because of bug:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13762">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13762</a> </pre>
