<title>Issue 6830 -   chromium -    Use native file locking semantic for logging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In LogMessage::~LogMessage()  the mutex log_mutex is used to coordinate   multi-process writing to a file.    This is overkill.    LockFileEx() / UnlockFile() should be used instead. This way  in   logging.cc  log_mutex could be removed and DCHECK(r != WAIT_ABANDONED);   could never be hit again. This DCHECK is flaky  hides the original message   and causes recursion in the logging system. </pre>
