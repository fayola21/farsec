<title>Issue 21123 -   chromium -    Sync creates duplicates due to race condition while setting up sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Sync Integration Test   'MC_FirstUse_ExistingSameBMModel_BothClients_373507'. This test case re-  produces the race condition every time it's being run.      What is the expected output?  Sync should not create duplicate bookmarks.    What do you see instead?  Sync creates duplicate bookmarks. As both clients setup sync happens at the   same time  this race condition happens.       </pre>
