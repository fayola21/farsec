<title>Issue 20024 -   chromium -    Sluggish scrolling when dragging by using touchpad or scroll bar on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> (for example; any site with  a layout beyond the very simplest)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Very smooth scrolling  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Very smooth scrolling  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Smooth scrolling      1. Visit a site like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> och <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>  2. Scroll vertically (or probably horizontally  although this is untested  by me) by using the scroll bar or touchpad.    (note: please don't confuse this bug with the one requesting a smooth  scrolling feature; this bug is not about using the mouse wheel or keys)        Page refreshing seemingly instantly as you scroll by not using the up/down  arrow keys or mouse wheel  such as by using the scroll bar or touchpad with  two fingers.        Slow speed as the page redraws as you scroll  i.e. comparatevily high  delays between each refresh. The result being that the page doesn't follow  &quot;with you&quot; as you scroll  but rather falling sluggishly behind. Compare to  e.g. Firefox or Safari performance. These browsers seem to use a much more  pleasant &quot;refresh rate&quot; to me. Chrome seemingly hovering somewhere around  10-15 fps (just guessing here)  while the compeition at 40+ fps when  redrawing a scrolling page. While Google Chrome quickly *renders* pages   the performance of *scrolling* them on a Mac compared to other browsers is  an entirely different story on my system.
