<title>Issue 8026 -   chromium -    Don't save autocomplete values for credit cards and SSNs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At some point  we should provide a secure way to autofill credit card   numbers (Google Toolbar does this). In the meantime  we should try to avoid   saving them by accident.    When we see a field of 16 digits  don't save them to the autofill database   if they correspond to a valid credit card. You can check this using the   mod(10)/Luhn algorithm:    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm</a>    We may also want to make this work for four 4-digit fields in a single   form.   </pre>
