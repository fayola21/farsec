<title>Issue 7781 -   chromium -    Feature request: Chrome's app-mode should prevent the BACKSPACE KEY from going backwards in the history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi Folks!    When running a ONE-page 100%-javascript controlled Web-application  it   would be a great feature if the BACKSPACE won't trigger a history-back   action when Chrome is started in app-mode (e.g. command line option --app)    TIA    Bert Moorthaemer         </pre>
