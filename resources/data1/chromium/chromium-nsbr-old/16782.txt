<title>Issue 16782 -   chromium -    after adding a bookmark to a bookmark bar folder  the folder should flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On windows if you click the star button and it sticks the new bookmark in a   bookmark bar folder  then the folder starts glowing to let you know where   the bookmark went. This sounds like a small detail but I personally have   more than once clicked the star button during testing  not realizing it   would default to sticking the bookmark in a folder  and thought &quot;wtf just   happened where is my bookmark&quot;. </pre>
