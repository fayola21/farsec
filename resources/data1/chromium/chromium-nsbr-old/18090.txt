<title>Issue 18090 -   chromium -    http://www.masrawy.com/new/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to  <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/new/">http://www.masrawy.com/new/</a> (in Arabic)    2. At the lower-left corner  there are two drop menus.     Select a city in the left drop down menu    What's expected:       The weather (in centigrade) next to the menu changes when a city is   selected.    Actual: No change at all.    Note: The website is one of the top 5 in visits in Egypt.    IE8  Firefox3  Opera : work as intended  Safari : not work    So  it's a webkit issue.          </pre>
