<title>Issue 16233 -   chromium -    omnibox autocomplete should not muck with selection clipboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Type in half an address that gets autocompleted. (e.g. googl  which is   autocompleted to google.com/ if you have typed that before)  2. Note that your PRIMARY selection has something weird in it (for example    &quot;gle.com/&quot;)    The most common way this comes up for me in practice is that typing   google.com/ leaves &quot;m/&quot; on the PRIMARY selection. </pre>
