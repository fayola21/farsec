<title>Issue 21857 -   chromium -    Feature request: Automatic hover text line highlighter to improve reading eye movement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I  and perhaps a couple of other people  would like to have an automatic   text line highligher  that would highlight the line of text  that I have   mouse cursor over it.    In addition to that  it would be nice  to allow to control which line is   highlighted with cursors  or as you wish with j  k keys (vi style!).    It is a very helpful  little feature  that would make reading big chunks of   text more easily  without having the eye fixing on the improper line of   text.    Today  I highlight text with mouse (button + drag)  to keep track of where   I am in the text  which is not very comfortable.    A configurable colors for both background and text color would be a plus. </pre>
