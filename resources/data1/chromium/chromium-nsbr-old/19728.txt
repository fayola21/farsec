Apply multiple themes one after the other.  4. Try reverting back to the default theme by clicking &quot;undo&quot; in the info   bar.    Expected:  You should get an info bar saying &quot;Installed theme xxx&quot; with an undo   button at the end. And clicking on the undo button should take you to the   previous theme.    Actual:  We get the info bar  but when we click undo more than ones  Chrome   crashes.      The info bar does not refresh if we apply themes back to back.  Crash log is attached.   </pre>
