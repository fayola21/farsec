<title>Issue 17665 -   chromium -    Extensions windows api cannot open a new window at a bundled page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     The following sample code should be self documenting:    // imagine our extension comes bundles with a page called &quot;mypage.html&quot;.  // We want to open a window whose initial url is mypage.html  // It does not seem to work. No window opens.  chrome.windows.create({url: &quot;mypage.html&quot;                          left: 0                          top: 0                          width: 800                          height: 700}  function(wnd) {    });  });    // HOWEVER! The tabs api seems to be able to do it just fine.  chrome.windows.create({url: &quot;about:blank&quot;                          left: 0                          top: 0                          width: 800                          height: 700}  function(wnd) {       // This successfully opens a new tab in the new window  at mypage.html          chrome.tabs.create({url: &quot;mypage.html&quot;                            windowId: wnd.windowId});    });  });        That the windows api be able to open a new window at a bundled page.      No window opens at all.    <b>Please provide
