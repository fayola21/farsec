<title>Issue 5527 -   chromium -    opacity doesn't work on PNG - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a PNG image has transparent pixels with an opacity between 1% and 99%   an opacity effect (in css or javascript) won't work well.    For exemple :    &lt;img  src=&quot;<a href="http://www.hazardaaclan.com/smf/Themes/phobos/images/img/hazard-logo-chrome.png">http://www.hazardaaclan.com/smf/Themes/phobos/images/img/hazard-logo-chrome.png</a>&quot;  style=&quot;opacity: 0.5&quot; /&gt;    The image won't be well loaded ! </pre>
