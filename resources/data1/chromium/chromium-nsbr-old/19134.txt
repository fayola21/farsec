<title>Issue 19134 -   chromium -    pictures of RSS in Google Reader continue loading after hit ESC key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open a feed in Google Reader with a lot of pictures  2. Picture is loading one by one  and feed height is growing  3. Hit Esc  4. Pic still loading.    This is very annoying when viewing the next feed post when the previous   feed's height is growing thus broke the scroll position.    Chromium 3.0.197.0 (22359) </pre>
