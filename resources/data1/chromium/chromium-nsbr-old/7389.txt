<title>Issue 7389 -   chromium -    Pages with a long list of links returns you to the wrong part of the page when you press back after visiting another page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a any url having a long list of links (thousands)  i suggest the   one listed above  since I've made it and have been able to reproduce the   problem on this page.  2. Scroll down to a link midways in the page and click it.  3. After the page loads  click back      The expected result is that chrome should scroll down to the same page   where you clicked the link. Say you clicked link 29727 you would expect to   be returned to the part of the page that displays link 29727.      Sometimes  quite often  chrome will either return you to the top of the   page  or scroll down a few pages  and not down to where the link you   pressed is located. Say you click link 29792  when you press back you are   either at link 1  or link 6048 or similar.       Please provide
