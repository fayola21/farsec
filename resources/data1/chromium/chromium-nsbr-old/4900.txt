<title>Issue 4900 -   chromium -    HTML select delayed rendering  crashing browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load a page that has an HTML select element (i.e. a drop down list)  2. Click on the drop down arrow to expand the select options      The drop down should instantly display the options with no rendering delay.   The browser should not hang.      In all cases  the browser &quot;paints&quot; a white box where the drop down options   should appear  then a second or two later  the options are painted to the   screen. During that delay  the browser is not responsive. In many cases   (though not all)  the browser crashes after attempting to expand the HTML   select.    Please provide
