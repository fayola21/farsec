<title>Issue 8856 -   chromium -    Download Percentage not displaying correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0                  1. Download any file  2. Hit &quot;Show Downloads&quot;        File that is currently downloading will show newest at the top  and a   history of downloads below it. Currently downloading files will indicate   rounded size and speed (i.e. &quot;20MB at 337KBs&quot; or &quot;1.2GB at 1.2MBs).      Latest builds are showing newest to the bottom with history on top  and is   showing something similar to &quot;20MB at 33765.&quot;    This happens on both Vista Ultimate 64 Bit and Windows 7 64 Bit. I don't   have any 32-bit machines laying around  can anyone confirm this on 32-bit   as well?   </pre>
