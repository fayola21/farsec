<title>Issue 22796 -   chromium -    &quot;The server's security certificate is revoked!&quot; error if the system time is off by hours or days - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug affects Linux only and is caused by NSS bug 515279:  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515279">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515279</a>    If the system time is off by hours or days  Chromium may  incorrectly report some certificates as revoked.  For example   if I turn the system clock backward (into the past) by 8 hours   I get this SSL error page when I try to log in to gmail:    =====  The server's security certificate is revoked!  You attempted to reach mail.google.com  but the certificate that the server  presented has been revoked by its issuer. This means that the security  credentials the server presented absolutely should not be trusted. You may  be communicating with an attacker. You should not proceed.  =====    Technical details: the OCSP response for the certificate  for mail.google.com appears to be produced in the future   so the NSS function ocsp_VerifySingleResponse fails with  the SEC_ERROR_OCSP_FUTURE_RESPONSE error.  Then  the NSS  function pkix_OcspChecker_CheckExternal sets revStatus  to PKIX_RevStatus_Revoked without checking resultCode  (which is SEC_ERROR_OCSP_FUTURE_RESPONSE).    Workaround: this bug has to be fixed in NSS.  I am working  with the NSS developer responsible for that code to fix this  bug.  Since Chromium is using system NSS libraries  it'll  be a while before this NSS fix makes it into various Linux  distributions.  Until then  please keep your system time  correct  for example  by using NTP.    Note: I believe the problems that caioromao and aaron.toponce  reported in comments 19 and 20 of <a title="All SSL certificates revoked on systems with NSS 3.12.3" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13336"> issue 13336 </a> are this bug.
