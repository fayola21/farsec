<title>Issue 679 -   chromium -    Should respect monitor DPI settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Display any web page      Fonts are sized depending on the Windows/X11 screen DPI setting.  In Windows  this is 96 dpi by default  but it is changeable      Fonts are sized based on a 96 or 100 dpi screen and thus appear too small   when viewed on high resolution monitors even with DPI appropriately set.    Ideally  you should let the user specify an alternative DPI/zoom setting.  Note that this is distinct from specifying a default font size since   DPI/zoom should apply to all text (just like the current &quot;zoom&quot; feature    but with a DPI-based or user-settable default setting).    There should also be an option to scale images according to DPI or user   settings (like IE has in the registry).     </pre>
