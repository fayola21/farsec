<title>Issue 4573 -   chromium -    CRASH: searching on news.google.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> CRASH: searching on news.google.com    Using a very recent trunk build:  0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 5673)    When searching on news.google.com  I get a sad tab after hitting the ENTER   key.  I see the autofill dropdown flickering prior to this crash.  (The   flickering is probably a separate bug.)    I cannot reproduce this crash in test_shell  so I suspect autofill is   somehow to blame. </pre>
