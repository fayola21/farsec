<title>Issue 19459 -   chromium -    Modify the &quot;Thanks for trying Google Chrome...&quot; message for update scenario - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> when you use chrome stable channel to update to the beta channel  you get to   a page saying  &quot;Thanks for trying Google Chrome!  The Google Chrome installer should complete in seconds and start your new   browser automatically.&quot;    a new browser window is indeed started but the old one is still open  so in   fact the &quot;new browser&quot; that was automatically started is the same old one   (about:version in the new window still shows the old version) </pre>
