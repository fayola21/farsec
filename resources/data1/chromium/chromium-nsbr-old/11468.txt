<title>Issue 11468 -   chromium -    Wrong cursor movement on selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.0 (Developer Build 13025)    1. Enter some text into the location bar and move focus to something else.  2. Restore focus to the location bar with the mouse. The text will be   selected.  3. Press the left arrow.      Normal behavior is  as far as I know  to move the cursor to the left of the   last character in the location bar.      The cursor gets moved to the left of the text box.    Bonus: shouldn't moving the focus to the location bar with the keyboard   (tab/shift-tab) also select the text?   </pre>
