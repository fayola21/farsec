<title>Issue 14815 -   chromium -    [freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com]: Rendering error in blog titles/headings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?      For some elements of blog titles in the blog Freakonomics  the rendering is   incorrect  wrapping the date around the post title when the date should be   placed before the post title.      What is the expected result?      The date line appears before the blog post title. The line that begins the   blog post text is then on the same line as the blog post title instead of   awkwardly wrapping around it.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com</a>  2. Scroll to a short blog post that has the issue    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Tested on FF3 and IE7 and both produce the expected rendering.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
