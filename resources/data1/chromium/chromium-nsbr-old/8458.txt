<title>Issue 8458 -   chromium -    Key shortcut for Clear browser history should be added - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 2.0.169.0  11074      Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.    It will be comfortable if a key shortcut for the Clear History command is   added...    Also: did &quot;print selection&quot; option (as of <a title="Cannot print selection" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1682"> issue 1682 </a>) make any progress? </pre>
