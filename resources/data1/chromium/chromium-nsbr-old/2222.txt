<title>Issue 2222 -   chromium -    Chrome usability  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I downloaded CHROME a week or so ago and I am finding that browsing is  fantastic  I love the look and &quot;feel&quot; of the application  however  and I am  not sure if it's just me  but I don't seem to be able to access sound and  my touchpad's &quot;Scrolling&quot; capability works for scrolling down but not back  upwards.  Is this a common problem or will there be settings that I need to  change?  It's a bit annoying not to have these functions when they are fine  in Firefox and IE.  If it is a development issue then ok  but I prefer to  use CHROME so a solution would be greatly appreciated!  Good work though.   From an end-user's point of view (Layman)  it is an absolute GEM :) </pre>
