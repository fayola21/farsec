<title>Issue 23191 -   chromium -    Chromium spawns new windows for each new page unless a window is first Focused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : 4.0.219.3 (27332)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: UNKNOWN      1. Close all Chromium windows  but leave Chromium running.  2. From an external application (such as a newsreader) open a new link   without focusing Chromium (open link behind window)  3. Do the same thing with another link      Chromium would open one window  with two tabs open.      Chromium opens two windows  with one tab open in each.    This occurs whenever Chromium has no windows open. As soon as you   focus a window  then switch back to a newsreader/mail/etc.  it will behave   as expected  with the last window that received focus getting new tabs for   each link opened.    Ask if I didn't explain this well. I can reproduce it every time. </pre>
