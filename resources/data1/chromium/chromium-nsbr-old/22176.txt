<title>Issue 22176 -   chromium -    Audit sync logging in release builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make sure we audit sync logging in release builds soon. We log a pretty huge   volume of data in debug  we should look at what we log in release clients. If   it's a lot  we should turn off the logging. Users won't be too happy if we chew   up all their disk space with logs. </pre>
