<title>Issue 2001 -   chromium -    Password Manager won't work with &quot;vBulletin&quot;-based forum pages. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a site using vBulletin forum software  such as   <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com">http://forum.teamxbox.com</a>  forums.freshalloy.com  and others.  2. Enter username/password and sign in.        The &quot;Do you want to save your password?&quot; infobar should show up  but it   doesn't. Safari 3.1 appears to have the same problem.    The root of the problem (for Chromium): an empty value is returned by   HTMLInputElement's value() method for the username and password.    This has been filed against WebCore at <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20096">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20096</a> . It's not totally clear if   the same WebKit issue is what's causing Safari to fail on these pages  but   it is likely. By contrast  FF2/3 work fine.         This is http://b/1178352   </pre>
