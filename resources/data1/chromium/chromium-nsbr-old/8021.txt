<title>Issue 8021 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager panes are initially sized incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.167.0 (Developer Build 10261)  Regression happened between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10179">r10179</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10261">r10261</a>.        1. Ctrl+Shift+B to bring up Bookmark Manager.     What is the expected output?     The left-hand pane should initially be wide enough to fit the displayed  folders (when the Bookmark Manager is first popped up).    What do you see instead?    Left-hand pane is not wide enough to fit the displayed folders.    See attached picture.   </pre>
