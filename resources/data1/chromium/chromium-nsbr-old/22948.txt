<title>Issue 22948 -   chromium -    web pages eating lots of CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version: 4.0.211.7    I can't reproduce the problem  but several times a day calendar pins half of   my wimpy CPU at 50%. Often it toodles along eating ~20-30%. Sometimes this   will go aways on its own after several minutes  sometimes I need to quit   calendar to make it stop. Not sure how to debug. Feel free to come by for a   demonstration.    Did we break timers again? </pre>
