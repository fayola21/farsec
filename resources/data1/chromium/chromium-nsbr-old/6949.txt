<title>Issue 6949 -   chromium -    Tabs loose their titles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Really  I do not know how to repro. I was opening and closing tabs    navigating using links  that's it. At one moment  I've noticed that all tab   headers are collapsed and lost their icons and titles.  2. Moving tabs out of window and back  I've noticed that icons appeared    but not titles.    Screenshots are attached. </pre>
