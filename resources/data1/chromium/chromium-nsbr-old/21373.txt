<title>Issue 21373 -   chromium -    Command line flags not displayed with --help - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.208.0 (Developer Build 25716)  OS + version : Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Enlightenment      1. Run `chrome --help` (or '-h' or '-help') on the command line        A list of available command line options will be printed.         Message is returned &quot;No manual entry for chrome&quot;.  Even if this is a path   issue  the 'chromium-browser.1' man page included in the package only lists   two options '--user-data-dir=DIR' and '--app=URL'  which is not an   exhaustive (or even particularly helpful) list.  Basic command line   documentation should be internal to the application.   </pre>
