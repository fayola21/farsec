<title>Issue 19268 -   chromium -    Throbbing takes a lot of CPU time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm finding that animating a throbber eats 10% of a CPU.      1. Open the Cracktivity Monitor  /Applications/Utilities/Activity   Monitor.app.  2. Open Chromium.app or Google Chrome.app.  Get a new tab page.  3. Verify that the process shows up in the Cracktivity Monitor.  Wait until   the CPU column drops to 0.0 or something close to it.  4. Type http://127.0.0.2/ into the omnibox and press return.  This is an IP   address that doesn't exist  so the browser will attempt to connect to it until   it times out.  5. Observe the value in the CPU column.      Expect: the %CPU value should stay low-ish.  Observe: the %CPU value is high-ish.  On my laptop  it's generally at least   10.  10% of one CPU is a lot of time to spend animating this silly throbber.    I've verified that disabling the throbber brings the %CPU value back down   into the 0.2-0.3 range.    4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23310">r23310</a> </pre>
