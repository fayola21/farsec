<title>Issue 7982 -   chromium -    Popups shown from app-mode windows should be in popup mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit popuptest.com.  Make the page an app.    Now click one of the popup tests and open a blocked popup.  Note how the   popup is itself opened without an address bar (and with the wrong size).    It should be opened as a standard popup window. </pre>
