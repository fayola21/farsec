<title>Issue 14002 -   chromium -    Can't reorder tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.187.0  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Metacity      1. Open a window and a new tab in that window  2. Attempt to move the second tab to the first spot by dragging it        The tabs should be reorderable  as in past versions  within the same window        With the latest update  instead of the tabs reordering  the tab is promoted   to a new window immediately  no matter which direction I drag it in.    This bug is probably related to the fact that you can't drag tabs from   window to window. In the past you could only drag them around in the same   window  but now I can't do that -- they're instantly promoted to new   windows upon release of the mouse  no matter what I do. </pre>
