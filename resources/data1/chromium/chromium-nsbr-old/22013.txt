<title>Issue 22013 -   chromium -    networking stack seems to be failing in http auth case - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load <a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/http_authentication/index.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/http_authentication/index.html</a>  2. Click 'My Secret Stuff '        Page just spins and spins  never loads.  The spinner is the reverse spinner  so   I believe that means we're sitting down in the network layers  not even getting   anything back.    <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26351">r26351</a> fails like this  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26220">r26220</a> has no problems   </pre>
