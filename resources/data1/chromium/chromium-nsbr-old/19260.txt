<title>Issue 19260 -   chromium -    ��_��_��_First run��_��_��_ should be tied to profile  not plist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Substitute Google Chrome.app  ~/Library/Application   Support/Google/Chrome  and   ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist as needed.      1. Launch Chromium.app.  If you've never launched it before  get past the   first run window.  Use it for a while.  2. Quit Chromium.  3. Remove your profile  ~/Library/Application Support/Chromium.  4. Launch Chromium.app.      Expect: first run window  offering to import bookmarks and set the browser   as the default.  Observe: no first run window.  How are you supposed to import   bookmarks?    Because the bookmarks live in the profile  it would make sense to tie first-  run to the profile as well.    The first-run behavior is actually triggered by the plist    ~/Library/Preferences/org.chromium.Chromium.plist  but this plist does   not contain the bookmarks.    If you remove the plist instead of the profile  you will see the first run   window offering to perform the import.  If you proceed with a bookmark   import  what happens to your existing bookmarks?
