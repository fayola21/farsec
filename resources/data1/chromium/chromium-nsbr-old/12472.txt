<title>Issue 12472 -   chromium -    Toolbar5Importer.BookmarkParse fails on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Starting at   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Mac/builds/72">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Mac/builds/72</a>  04   I think  Toolbar5Importer.BookmarkParse began failing on Mac only.  We   don't know why.  We tried backing out <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=16666">r16666</a> and that didn't help.  That   leaves 19 other possible revisions.  CCing the relevant people.  We've   disabled the test for now to open the tree.   </pre>
