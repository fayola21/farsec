<title>Issue 20211 -   chromium -    Chrome &quot;flashes&quot; rapidly in/out of focus when using mouse-focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23795">r23795</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  Debian Unstable  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : fluxbox            1. Setup mouse-focus in fluxbox  2. Open Chrome  3. Move your mouse to another window  4. Move your mouse over Chrome (without clicking)        Chrome comes into focus        Chrome flashes very fast  over and over  in and out of focus  as if your  mouse was... on some boundary of in/out of the window. It stops once you  click in chrome  but when you mouse out and then in again  it flashes again.    This makes chrome basically unusable for me. </pre>
