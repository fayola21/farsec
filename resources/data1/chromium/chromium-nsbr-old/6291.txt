<title>Issue 6291 -   chromium -    Assertion in SkFontHost_fontconfig - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FileIdAndStyleToUniqueId has an assertion:    SkASSERT(style &amp; 0xff == style);  which  when I enabled Skia assertions  fails on ChromeFontTest.LoadArial on   Linux.    This assertion possibly indicates something is wrong  so we need to fix it.   The assertion is currently commented out so I could land my assertion-  enabling patch without breaking anything. </pre>
