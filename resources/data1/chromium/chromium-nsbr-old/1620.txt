<title>Issue 1620 -   chromium -    Nero Burning Rom clash? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I installed Chrome  and since that moment I couldn't burn CDs.  First  Nero complained about a driver error in the CDW  so I updated that +  firmware  and the message changed to &quot;Could not Complete Fixation&quot;.     Removing Chrome and re-installing Nero seems to work.  Can someone verify this? Anyone else encountered the problem?    nero version is: Nero 7 Ultra Edition (7.0.0.0)   </pre>
