<title>Issue 19211 -   chromium -    Changes to files loaded from --load-extension should cause the extension to reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we have some support for this (toolstrip changes are reflected in   newly opened windows but not currently open ones  and content scripts   apparently used to handle changes properly on page refresh).     The experience would be better  and less likely to break over time  if when   the directory watching code noticed any changes  it did the a reload of the   extension (or the equivalent of uninstall followed by install).    Note that this is related to <a title="User Scripts not reloaded on refresh." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16212"> Issue 16212 </a>     </pre>
