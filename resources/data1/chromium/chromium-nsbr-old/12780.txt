<title>Issue 12780 -   chromium -    Extensions auto-update extra unit tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a few more cases we want to cover with unit tests:    -prodversionmin (shouldn't update if browser version too old)  -manifests &amp; updates arriving out of order / interleaved  -Profile::GetDefaultRequestContext() returning null   (should not crash  but just do check later)  -malformed update url (empty  file://  has query  has a # fragment  etc.)  -An extension gets uninstalled while updates are in progress (so it doesn't   &quot;come back from the dead&quot;)  -An extension gets manually updated to v3 while we're downloading v2 (ie   you don't get downgraded accidentally)  -An update manifest mentions multiple updates     </pre>
