<title>Issue 20307 -   chromium -    proxy.pac file is downloaded every little connection during chrome navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39             Safari 4: OK     Firefox 3.x: OK            IE 7: OK            IE 8: OK       1. set a proxy.pac in your system Intenet Options  2. trace your network activity to the adress of the proxy.pac you set  (using wireshark for example)  3. run Google Chrome and navigate on internet  4. Wait for your Network administrator for complaining of too much activity  on its proxy.pac server ;)      There is a connection to the proxy.pac server for every little image in page.    One update of this file when starting the application should be enough. At  least only on hard refresh     </pre>
