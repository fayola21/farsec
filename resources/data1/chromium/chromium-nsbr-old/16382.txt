<title>Issue 16382 -   chromium -    Strange button rendering with native GTK theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.194.0 (Developer Build 20304)  OS + version: Linux  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works      1. run latest chromium with the &quot;Inverted&quot; GTK theme (part of gnome-themes package)      Toolbar buttons should look nice.       The &lt;-  -&gt; and refresh buttons have a weird blue &quot;shadow&quot; around them. The page and wrench buttons display the same   when hovered.    I also wonder why the &lt;-  -&gt; and refresh buttons &quot;stand out&quot; (e.g. have a border) and the page/wrench buttons do   not have this. My GTK theme normally displays toolbar buttons flat  e.g. no border  until I hover over them.    Note: when I first tried the native GTK theme support  hover was not implemented I think but the &lt;-  -&gt; and refresh   buttons looked correctly  so there may be a small regression here. </pre>
