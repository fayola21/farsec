<title>Issue 23112 -   chromium -    First user input after tab switch / waking after sleep shouldn't take more than 250 milliseconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open Chrome  then put the computer on sleep (if using a laptop  close it)  2.  Wake the computer  3.  Try to switch tabs  or take any UI action      Some events are lost or response happens much later (several seconds later)    Some kind of response should happen within 250ms.    This is likely the same root issue as 11700  but we should be measuring this   anyway. </pre>
