<title>Issue 19382 -   chromium -    Add browsertests  for extension blacklist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We could do some test using browsertest frame work. Some item that Aaron   suggested:  - Load an extension  - Simulate it getting blacklisted  - Notice that it is gone from extensions()  - Notice an unload got sent  - Notice any toolstrips are torn down  - Reload the extension  notice that it did not get loaded  - Unblacklist  - See that the extension was loaded    There could be more. </pre>
