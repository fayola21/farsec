<title>Issue 7484 -   chromium -    Caret  selection highlighting invisible in UI text entry fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.160.1 (Developer Build 9325)  Issue is observed only on trunk build  not Dev build.    This is a problem in the Chrome UI  not on the web pages themselves.  It  appears to affect (possibly all) text entry fields throughout the Chrome UI.    Repro  -----  1. Open the History page.  2. Click on the History Search box.  3. Enter some text.  4. Try to select some text by clicking and dragging the cursor over the text.    Note that the caret is not visible.  You can enter text  but you can't  highlight it.  It looks like the highlight is not there (not just  invisible).  It also appears that you can't change the caret position using  the mouse (but you can change it with the right/left arrow keys). The  functionality of the text fields is severely impaired.    It can be observed in these text entry fields (at least):    1. History page search box  2. Downloads page search box  3. Any text entry field in the Options dialog.  4. Add/Edit Search Engine dialog.   </pre>
