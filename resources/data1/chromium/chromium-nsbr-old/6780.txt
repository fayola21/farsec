<title>Issue 6780 -   chromium -    Simplify clobbering in buildbot's chromium_commands - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tony writes:  It seems a bit excessive to call python to remove or rename directories. It   might be cleaner to have it sometimes run external commands and sometimes   to just call a function by having command be a closure. *shrug* not a big   deal either way.  -----    It's currently set up as an independent process to fit into the buildbot   notion of steps and callbacks and such for scheduling on a slave  but it   should be able to be simplified. </pre>
