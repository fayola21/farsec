<title>Issue 5231 -   chromium -    Chrome incompatible with MSN TV guide - Page freeze  browser crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide">http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide</a>        Firefox 3: OK      1. Browse to <a href="http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide">http://tv.msn.com/tv/guide</a>  2. Enter your tv provider zip code (on the right: e.g. 94131 -&gt; satellite -  &gt; Dish). The page refreshes and shows the tv schedule for your area /   timezone/ tv provider.  3. CTRL+F (use Chrome's built-in &quot;search within page&quot; feature) and search   for some name of a tv show that is listed.      The search term is found and highlighted. I can then search for something   else  scroll the page up / down as usual. Etc.      The search term is found and highlighted.  But I can not change the search term  nor can I scroll the page up or down.   I cannot do anything in that browser tab. It's dead.  After closing the tab (that still works)  other tabs might not work well   anymore either.  E.g. 2 other tabs that have no flash start to consume 50% CPU each (on an   Intel core duo power laptop)  maxing out both CPU cores.  If I close those two tabs  other tabs will start to eat up all CPU.  Only exiting Chrome and starting it again will &quot;heal&quot; the other tabs.    How deterministic is this?  I can reproduce the basic &quot;MSN page doesn't respond anymore&quot; issue every   time I visit it.  But it doesn't always affect the whole browser. I had to restart Chrome   twice this week because the issue with the MSN page affected the browser   even after the MSN tab has been closed. </pre>
