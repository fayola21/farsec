<title>Issue 13953 -   chromium -    UI messed up on small dispays when downloading more than one &quot;dangerous&quot; file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a small Chrome window (800x600)  2. Go to a site that start a download of a &quot;dangerous&quot; file (eg an .exe)  3. Start two downloads (before clicking anywhere in the download bar at the   bottom of the screen).  4. Click &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Discard&quot; on the first download.    What is the expected output?  The second download should show either the &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Discard&quot; button or   neither.    What do you see instead?  A warning and the &quot;Save&quot; button (the &quot;Discard button&quot; falls off the   screen).    See attached screenshot.   </pre>
