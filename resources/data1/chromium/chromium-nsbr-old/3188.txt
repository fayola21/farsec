<title>Issue 3188 -   chromium -    User agent slow to compute - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I measured that computing the default user agent string in the renderer   takes 1ms. This is kind of unreasonable. This is because it gets the file   version info  which is a filesystem call  goes walking through resources    etc.    We should somehow precompute our default user agent string so we can start   faster. Even if 1ms isn't significant  it could be if the system is loaded   in I/O  and these calls do I/O. </pre>
