<title>Issue 3078 -   chromium -    replace file_util::CreateTemporaryFileName with file_util::CreateTemporaryFile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From &lt;b/1312878&gt;:    There's no good reason to not just go ahead and create the file here.  From   another engineer:  Ugh  this is the kind of interface that leads to races and people doing   stupid things.  Why don't we have something that actually creates a file   with O_CREAT |O_EXCL?  Sorry  I'm venting  but can we get a bug on this or   a TODO in the header to replace this with a better interface?   </pre>
