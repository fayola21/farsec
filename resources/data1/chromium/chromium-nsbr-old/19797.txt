<title>Issue 19797 -   chromium -    Skia assert being hit (until I disabled it) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47386/">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47386/</a> caused an assert to be compiled in   that didn't used to be.  This caused the mapquest.com portion of the page   cycler to crash (because it was hitting the assert).  I disabled the assert again   in <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47546">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47546</a> so that the page cycler would   continue working.    Given that the page cycler was the ONLY thing that failed  this is probably a   fairly obscure bug  but I think it's important we track it down.  Unfortunately    it's been there for a long time  so I don't really have a clue where to begin. </pre>
