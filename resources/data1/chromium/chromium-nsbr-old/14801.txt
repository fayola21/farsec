<title>Issue 14801 -   chromium -    bzip2 encoded results may be corrupted by proxies (such as Vodaphone (UK) Mobile Broadband) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Use a proxy with an ISP such as Vodaphone (UK) Mobile Broadband  2.Visit a page that is bzip2 encoded  such as   <a href="http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html">http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html</a>  3. Page will be corrupted.        Garbled characters.    To repro  use another ISP  and visit the above URL:  <a href="http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html">http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html</a>  Then modify the URL to read:  view-cache:<a href="http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html">http://ukcp09.defra.gov.uk/content/view/16/6/index.html</a>  You should see it was bzip2 encoded.    Repeat the process using a problematic proxy.  You'll (incorrectly) see a content encoding of gzip.  Extract the gzip decoded file.  Run bzip2 on it  and it should decompress   porperly.    The above bug was deduced from reports in the following forum thread:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=24436bd4ef660e1e&amp;hl=en    Possible remedition: Terminate support for bzip2. ...or convince Vodaphone   to stop trashing content... or find a way to tell Vodaphone and others like   it to not damage content.  Perhaps there is a way (for example) to to have   serving sites add an HTTP header when serving bzip2:    Warning: 214 msgwsl11 &quot;Transformation applied&quot;    and that would discourage Vodaphone. Alternatively  perhaps the above   warning header can be detected by chrome  and then bzip can be   discontinued. </pre>
