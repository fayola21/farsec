<title>Issue 21687 -   chromium -    Most visited thumbnail titles don't respond to cleared browsing history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have filled some of the most visited thumbnails.  2. Clear browsing history.      One thumbnail is still present (Chrome themes gallery)  and pinned titles are   still there.  Thumbnails and titles in between have been cleared.  The titles   remain even after browser restart.   </pre>
