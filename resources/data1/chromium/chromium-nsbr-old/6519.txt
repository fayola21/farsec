<title>Issue 6519 -   chromium -    Downloaded exe files disappear when finished - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-">http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-</a>  history.htm                   IE 7: ok    I downloaded Magic Disk (32 bit version) from the above link.  Afterwards I could not find the file. I have my download locations  set to c:Ta hand om in Chrome.  I tried again and watched the download directory during the download  and there was a file  &quot;unconfirmed download ...&quot; but instead of that file   being renamed to the real name it just disappeared when the download was   finished.   Right-clicking on the download link and choosing Save As works ok.    I'm running on Vista Ultimate 32bit on a Dell Studio laptop.    Best regards  Bengt </pre>
