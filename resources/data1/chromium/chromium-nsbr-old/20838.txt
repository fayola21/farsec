<title>Issue 20838 -   chromium -    After gyp conversion locale projects do not build when changing respective xtb files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open text file locale_settings_bg.xtb in visual studio.  2. Change the width settings of some dialog  3. Build the bg project  4. Run chrome with --lang=bg    The dialog should now have a different size. However  if you look closely Visual Studio tells   you the project is up to date when it clearly isn't.    To get it to work you have to compile locale_settings.grd first and then it detects that project bg has changed.     This makes iterating very slow and painful. :(   </pre>
