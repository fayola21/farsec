<title>Issue 20244 -   chromium -    OSX Omnibox border wrong in popup windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse to www.popuptest.com  2. Click &quot;Multi-PopUp Test #2&quot;  3. In the lower-right of the Chrome window  open one of the blocked popups.        On Windows  the popup has only an omnibox without the rest of the location bar  and the border   has a light layer then a dark layer.  On Mac  the top and bottom look right  but the left and right   sides are flush against the edges of the window.  They should be pulled in a pixel or so on each   edge. </pre>
