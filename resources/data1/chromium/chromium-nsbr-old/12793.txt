<title>Issue 12793 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: listbox and textfield borders aren't painted properly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Affected version: 16446+  Last known working Version: 16445    Open the Options dialog box and select the Basics tab.    Notice the &quot;start with these pages&quot; listbox has no border and the scrollbar   has no buttons.    Notice the homepage text field doesn't have a border until you mouse over it.    I've traced this regression to this checkin: 16446  John's changes to how   painting works. </pre>
