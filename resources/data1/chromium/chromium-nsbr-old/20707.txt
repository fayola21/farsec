<title>Issue 20707 -   chromium -    First Incognito tab text appears as white - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a new incognito window with one empty tab.    Expected:  - tab title is black    Actual:  - tab title is white. If you create a 2nd tab  the 2nd tab's title is black.    Not sure if this is theme related or just fall-out from Cole's ui CL landing. </pre>
