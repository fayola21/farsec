<title>Issue 9525 -   chromium -    Setting opacity for html  head  and objects alike screw up rendering of page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	1.0.154.53 (Official Build 11798)  WebKit	525.19  V8	0.3.9.4  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)   AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.53 Safari/525.19    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/4420/results.jpg">http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/4420/results.jpg</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. set the opacity level to ALL html objects including the html tag itself        What is the expected result:  Alright  above I included a link to an image  so first I'll explain that.  The image above shows 2 input boxes and 2 textareas and I had a javascript   function set the opacity level of all objects(via   getElementsByTagName('*')) to about 50% and when I hover the input and   textareas  they change colors and stuff. Example  the above example  they   changed from default white to gray(NOTHING on that page is supposed to be   gray).    I also ran into the problem of the page being rendered wrong  it'd have   like a ghost image of the entire page or the image of another page loaded   in another tab being displayed on the page but distorted. Distorted how you   say ?  ever seen in movies where the tv goes fuzzy and the image gets   skewed and you can see another program showing in the background? that's   &quot;distorted&quot;     </pre>
