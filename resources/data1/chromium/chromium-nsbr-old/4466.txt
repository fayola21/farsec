<title>Issue 4466 -   chromium -    frameborder showing thinner  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open <a href="http://www.rsdn.ru">http://www.rsdn.ru</a>            Width of vertical splitter is 3-4 pixels.        Look at vertical splitter width. In IE and FF it is 3-4 pixels in width  in   Chromium it is 1 pixel so it is very hard to position a mouse cursor to   catch this splitter. I consider it as bug because it is very annoying.    Please provide
