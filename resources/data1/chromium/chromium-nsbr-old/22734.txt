<title>Issue 22734 -   chromium -    Implement a shortcut (e.g. cmd+#) to open a bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 213.0 (Developer Build 26907)  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): FAIL  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: FAIL      1. Create a new bookmark if there is no page bookmarked  2. Press cmd+1 to open the first bookmark      Like in Safari it should open the first bookmark.      Since it was implemented for <a title="Support Cmd+# to switch tabs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13480"> issue 13480 </a> the first tab is selected.    More details:  I can understand why users want to have a shortcut for tabs  but seriously: how can &quot;power   users&quot; (in other word: people using the keyboard most of the time) work with this behavior? I   often know which page I want to open and to nudge around the mouse every time to open a   bookmarked page is not a real option. Maybe I'm missing the fact that there is already a shortcut   for bookmarked pages?   </pre>
