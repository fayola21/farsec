<title>Issue 11510 -   chromium -    Should be able to run chrome w/o disk write access - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently chrome requires disk write access to the profile dir.  We refuse to   run when we don't have disk access (giving the user an option to pick a   different user data dir first).  Ideally  we would just run in a special mode   w/o disk access (maybe similar to incognito mode?). </pre>
