<title>Issue 144 -   chromium -    Right click - &quot;open in new tab&quot; inconsistent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Right click a link in Chromium - open in new tab is at the top of the   list.  2. Right click a bookmark in Chromium - open in new tab is second in the   the list.        Some consistency would be nice - I'm a firefox user  so I am used to going   to the second item in the list for a new tab. Having different lists is   extremely frustrating.          Please provide
