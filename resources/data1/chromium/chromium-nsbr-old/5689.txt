<title>Issue 5689 -   chromium -    RevocableStore::StoreRef was incorrectly made to subclass RefCountedThreadSafe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> RevocableStore::StoreRef was incorrectly made to subclass   RefCountedThreadSafe    The RevocableStore class was not designed to be used across threads.    I fear that we are papering over some larger problem by making StoreRef use   thread-safe ref counting. </pre>
