<title>Issue 18186 -   chromium -    NNTP: Favicons of thumbnails missing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (Official Build 22005)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://newtab        On the left of a thumbnail's page name there should be the favicon of the   page.      Nothing is shown ...    If this is intended i think at least the list-mode should have favicons.   </pre>
