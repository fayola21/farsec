<title>Issue 18669 -   chromium -    Keychain items have to be re-authorized individually for new builds of Chromium.app - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Modal key chain dialog rampage when using Chromium.app    Every time I browse to a site with a login form  I get a modal key chain dialog   popup.  If I don't answer it quickly  then I also get a Chrome hung renderer   dialog.  I have only seen this while using Chromium.app.  It doesn't seem to   happen when using Google Chrome on the dev channel  presumably because   Google chrome is signed.    Needless to say  this makes Chromium.app unusable for dogfood.    Modal dialogs are evil! </pre>
