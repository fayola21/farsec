<title>Issue 11009 -   chromium -    David M. Gay's (dmg) dtoa.c is incompatible with gcc 4.4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This page explains the problem:  <a href="http://patrakov.blogspot.com/2009/03/dont-use-old-dtoac.html">http://patrakov.blogspot.com/2009/03/dont-use-old-dtoac.html</a>    Options:  1) Upgrade dtoa.c  2) turn on -fno-strict-aliasing  3) don't use gcc 4.4 when we release    (1) is the best approach.  I tried this with the version copy on  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c">http://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c</a> (April 24  2009)  but it doesn't seem to  handle inf and -inf properly (1e999 is nan rather than inf).    Just filing so we don't forget. </pre>
