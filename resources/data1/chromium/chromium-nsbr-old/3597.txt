<title>Issue 3597 -   chromium -    Perf plots misbehave when missing data for traces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The perf history plots don't behave well when some of the traces are   missing data.  This is important not only in the short term  when some of   the plots don't have historical data for all their traces  but also in   order to keep them working properly even when the perf tests fail to   produce all the results they're expecting (e.g. when the reference-build   test doesn't complete).    See <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-</a>  core/startup/report.html?history=150 (as of <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=3340">r3340</a> or so) for an example of   a bad display. </pre>
