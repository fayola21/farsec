<title>Issue 16176 -   chromium -    Browser window does not retain its position across quit/restart on Mac OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  but N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  but N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Run Chrome and open a single browser window  2. Note specifically where the browser window is on the screen  3. Quit Chrome and restart it  [4. Repeat as many times as necessary to move the browser window as far   as desired]        The window should reappear where it had previously been. I believe that in   the previous version (3.0.190.x) this was the behavior  but I might be   mistaken.        The window reappears a small distance (about the height of the menu bar    actually) above where it had previously been. </pre>
