<title>Issue 9013 -   chromium -    Edit box lines do not draw in &quot;New Issue&quot; page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>           Safari 3: Not Tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: Not Tested      1. Go to the URL specified above. This will take you to the page to create   a new issue for the chromium project.  2. You will see 3 categories: &quot;Template&quot;  &quot;Summary&quot;  and &quot;Description&quot;. To   the right of each of these  there are edit fields and combo boxes. The   borders for these widgets do not draw. Only when you bring them to focus by   clicking them does a yellow border draw around them.      When tested in Firefox 3  a black border is drawn around each of the   widgets in question. I expect the same behavior from Chromium.      The borders do not draw when they are not in focus. </pre>
