<title>Issue 13504 -   chromium -    Clicking sound is played on mouse-down on UI elements under Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.183.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17570">r17570</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : ion3 20080825-1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A      1. Turn on sound if it's muted.  2. Click on a back  forward  reload  or tab-close button.  3. A weird hollow-ish clicking sound gets played.      I'd expect for no sound to get played when clicking on things  or for there   to be a way for me to disable this behavior.  I just showed this to Tony   and Evan  and they were both initially stumped about where it was coming   from. </pre>
