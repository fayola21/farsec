<title>Issue 6175 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Google Spreadsheets doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may be a spreadsheets bug (UA sniffing?) rather than a Chrome bug.    Using build 156  I can't do much editing with Google spreadsheets.  Right-  clicking doesn't do anything  I can't edit by double-clicking  and most   menu options are greyed out. </pre>
