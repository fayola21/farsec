<title>Issue 2148 -   chromium -    File URLs should open documents for editing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Here's an example link:    file://///server/share/quote.xls    In IE  clicking on a link will open that document in Excel with a  single click  whether you use the five slashes or two. The five  slashes works in Firefox if you fiddle with the settings in prefs.js -  if you don't edit the prefs you have to paste the link into the  address bar for it to work.    If you paste the link into the omnibox in Chrome  which is difficult  from the start because you can't copy the address from the html link  without viewing page source  it prompts you to download the file -  which defies the point of using a file:// link in the first place.    In IE and Firefox  when you click on the link  the file opens directly  from the server  allowing you to make edits and hit Save.
