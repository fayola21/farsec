<title>Issue 8840 -   chromium -    EventSender::contextClick doesn't hit the same codepath as rightclick. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of the editing tests that test right-click do different things when  you run the test versus doing the right-click in the test manually in  test_shell.    For example  in LayoutTests/editing/selection/5109817.html  the whole word  is selected when you right click (which is wrong)  but in the test  the  cursor is placed where you right-click (which is right). </pre>
