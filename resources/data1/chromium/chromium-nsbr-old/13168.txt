<title>Issue 13168 -   chromium -    Mac: Contents of incognito-mode NTP are truncated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 3.0.182.4 (Developer Build )        1. Start with 1 non-incognito window open.  2. File &gt; New incognito window    What is the expected output?    New tab page (NTP) for incognito should be drawn correctly.    What do you see instead?    Right half of incognito NTP contents is truncated.  Repro is pretty reliable  but make sure there   are no incognito windows open yet when you try.     </pre>
