<title>Issue 13936 -   chromium -    Implement extension specific events - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The extension event system is broadcasting events to every extension that adds a   listener (basically ExtensionMessageService::DispatchEventToRenderers  cycles through the event-type vector and sends events to each listener   subscribed).     For page actions  this means every page action gets OnExecute(page_action_id) when   *any* page action is executed (even if that page action is in a different   extension) so each page action has to filter out id's it doesn't care about. It   also means there can be overlap  when two extensions have registered with the same   page action ID.    We want this to be more fine-grained  so that page actions don't receive events   from other extensions  but that requires changing the way we subscribe as listener   and send events and is still being fleshed out.    Assigning to aa who's thinking about how to tackle this problem. :)   </pre>
