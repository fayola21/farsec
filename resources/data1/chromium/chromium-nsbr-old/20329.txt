<title>Issue 20329 -   chromium -    [REGRESSION] Closing multiple tabs quickly fails because tabs resize slightly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was mentioned in passing in <a title="Closing tabs do not affect the width of title bars of tabs." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12089"> bug 12089 </a>.    On Linux and windows  4.0.202.0 resizes the tabs  slightly as you close them.  This means that by the  3rd or so tab you close  you have to move your mouse.    To repeat: open three or more new tabs  then put the  mouse on the X of the leftmost tab  and try to close them  all by clicking without moving the mouse again.   </pre>
