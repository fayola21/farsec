<title>Issue 11439 -   chromium -    Mouse back and forward buttons don't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If your mouse has a back and forwards button it doesn't work on Chrome.  Rather than figuring out what buttons those map to  it would be good to   check the Mozilla code to make sure there isn't anything tricky (e.g. &quot;if   it's a 7-button mouse  then it's buttons 6 and 7  but it's a 9-button   mouse...&quot;). </pre>
