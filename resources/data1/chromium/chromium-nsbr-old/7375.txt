<title>Issue 7375 -   chromium -    Throbbers stop spinning while loading full page plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure when it is broken  but works fine in 154.8    Reproduces on Beta(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9072">r9072</a>)  Dev(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9102">r9102</a>)  Stable channels (154.46).    Navigate to any full page plugins which takes longer time to load (Eg:  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69117/poissonmatting_siggraph04.pdf">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69117/poissonmatting_siggraph04.pdf</a>)    Issue:  Once the URL is committed  the throbber stops spinning  that confuses the  user either the page is still loading or got struck up !!     </pre>
