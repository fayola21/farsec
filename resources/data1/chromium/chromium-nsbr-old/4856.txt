<title>Issue 4856 -   chromium -    Tabs get stuck to my mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25      Sometimes  if I click a tab  it gets stuck to the mouse and drags into a   new page.  It's like the mouseUp event isn't registering so it drags even   though I'm not clicking.      The tab is selected  but doesn't drag.      The tab drags.    I have a Toshiba Tablet PC running Vista Ultimate. </pre>
