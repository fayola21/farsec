<title>Issue 6385 -   chromium -    Generate tarball more regularly  and automatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our svn tarball is 3 months old  because although Tony creates a new one   every night  nothing uploads it.    We should create a fresh one *and* upload it at least weekly  if not daily.   Ideally this would happen on one of the server machines rather than in   Tony's homedir. </pre>
