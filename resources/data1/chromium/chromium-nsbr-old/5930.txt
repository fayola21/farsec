<title>Issue 5930 -   chromium -    RTL: forwad delete key doesn't allow deletion of hebrew letter and diacritical mark separately - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Other browsers tested:      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Type a Hebrew letter then add a diacritical mark (Nikud).  This can be  done by pressing the caps lock key and then pressing the keys 1..9.  2. Place the cursor at the start of the text entry field.  3. Press the forward delete key.    What is the expected result?  The letter should be deleted and the diacritical mark should remain in place.    What happens instead?  Both the letter and it's diacritical mark will be deleted at once.
