<title>Issue 19478 -   chromium -    Back button does not work in Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Copied from google's site.Updated with                          version  3.0.195.6  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Open your inbox in Gmail account.  2. Click on one mail to open it.  3. Check the mail  and then browser back button to return back to inbox.      We should come back to the inbox which shows the list of the mails.      We remain on the same page and don't move to inbox.    This is not a big issue though because by clicking the link &quot;&lt;&lt; Back to   Inbox&quot; at the bottom of the mail or the &quot;Inbox&quot; link at the left of the   page  we can go to the inbox again. </pre>
