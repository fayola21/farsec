<title>Issue 15449 -   chromium -    Default browser check is case sensitive (and shouldn't be) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have Chrome already installed and set as default browser  2. Launch Chrome calling the EXE as UPPER CASE (C:PATHTOCHROME.EXE   instead of c:pathtochrome.exe)  3. When chrome loads  it checks its executable name against   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREClientsStartMenuInternet(Default). Chrome   determines if it is the default browser based on if its executable name   matches exactly (case sensitive) the value of that registry key. When   Chrome is launched using an upper case executable string  the comparison   fails and Chrome thinks it is not the default browser.      I would expect that Chrome would identify itself in a case-insensitive   manner and see itself as the default browser.      Chrome loads and does not see itself as the default browser because the   registry key does not equal the executable name (&quot;CHROME.EXE&quot; !=   &quot;chrome.exe&quot;)    <b>Please provide
