<title>Issue 154 -   chromium -    Remove Windows-specific parts of Linux source download to decrease size. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was trying to download this package  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.tgz">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.tgz</a> and it's 429 MB.  Why Google didn't take out from sources software like lighthtppd  perl   cygwin and others in WINDOWS (.exe) version? </pre>
