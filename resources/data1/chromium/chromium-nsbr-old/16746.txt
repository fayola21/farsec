<title>Issue 16746 -   chromium -    Strange highlighting in suggestions sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Type &quot;comcast.net&quot; into the omnibox.  Observe the Suggest results near the   bottom of the popup for things like &quot;comcast.net sign in&quot;  where the matching   string is dimmed and the rest is in normal type.    Now type a slash.  Observe that the entire suggestion becomes bold.  Weird. </pre>
