Clicking on any A to Z anchor link does not do anything (see how it   should work with the attached screenshot).          What is the expected result?    Clicking should directly display the country names starting with that   letter.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Click on any letter  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Not in Firefox.  It works in IE6 though.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
