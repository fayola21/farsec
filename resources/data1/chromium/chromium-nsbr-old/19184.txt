<title>Issue 19184 -   chromium -    Omnibox: popup font smaller than field  cells spaced out more  use en-dash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pulling a piece out of <a href="http://crbug.com/14898">http://crbug.com/14898</a> .    EnDash separator instead of EmDash.    Field font should be bigger (I think it used to be).  Popup font slightly smaller than field font   (current popup uses field font).    Wider spacing in popup cells.   </pre>
