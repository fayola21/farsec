<title>Issue 19121 -   chromium -    Tooltips annoyingly persistent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-Stock-Items.html">http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-Stock-Items.html</a>  2. For some reason (their fault) there are tooltips on like everything  3. Move the mouse around  4. Scroll around with the wheel     - All: When scrolling  it would be nice if the tooltip would go away. It   does in Firefox.   - All: When I move the mouse more than a certain threshhold  the tooltip   should go away  and not come back until I stop. Again  Firefox does this.   - Linux only: When moving around  the tooltip should move with me (at   least when moving from element to element). It doesn't. It stays in the   same place until I roll over something that doesn't produce a tooltip (or   the tooltip itself). This conflicts with Chrome on Windows and with   Firefox.   - Linux only: Tooltips never time out. This is sometimes nice for reading   the qwantz.com tooltips  but usually annoying.    Haven't tested on Mac  but I'm sure it has some of the above issues. </pre>
