<title>Issue 22660 -   chromium -    on[Before]Copy/on[Before]Paste handlers should allow rich access to clipboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Feature request)    In browser onCopy/onPaste handlers  rich access to/from the system   clipboard should be provided. All content types which are available to   desktop apps should be made available to javascript apps running in the   browser. For example  or paste  JS apps should be able to enumerate the   types on the clipboard  and fetch one (or more) formats  even if they can   only be treated as binary blobs (images  etc.). Similarly  on copy  js   should be able to specify explicit data types (mime-types/flavors) and   blobs to be placed on the system clipboard.    Doing this within the event handlers should pose no additional security   risk  and would allow richer interoperability between browser-based apps   and the desktop.    Note that Mac Safari currently lets you enumerate *all* the flavors   available on paste  although you can't necessarily /fetch/ all of the   renderings. IE allows clipboard access at on[Before]Copy time  although   still only to text or html content. Chrome should do better as an app   platform  by allowing full  rich access to the clipboard during these   events.   </pre>
