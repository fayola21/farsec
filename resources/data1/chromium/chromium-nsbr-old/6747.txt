<title>Issue 6747 -   chromium -    consolidate code for copying command line args to sub processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In render_process_host.cc  plugin_process_host.cc  and first_run.cc  we  have code for copying command line from the browser process to the child  process.  It's not a lot of code  but we should refactor this into a helper  function. </pre>
