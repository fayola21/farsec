<title>Issue 6518 -   chromium -    test_shell appears to eat a few chars in stdout. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This became evident after 39953:39972 merge. To reproduce:    1. Load LayoutTests/fast/dom/css-selectorText.html test in test_shell.exe.   The output should start with &quot;*&quot;  then &quot;div&quot; on next line.    2. Run the same test using test_shell.exe --layout-tests. The text dump is   missing a few characters  now starting with &quot;iv&quot;.   </pre>
