<title>Issue 3809 -   chromium -    Should search with Latvian search engine delfi.lv - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.9(4058)      1. Set your sys locals to Latvian.  2. Install Google Chrome (with Clean profile).  3. Try to search for any Latvian word (Eg: N��_kamais) with DELFI.lv search  engine.    What is the expected output?  User should be provided with search results.  What do you see instead?  User is not provided with search results.    See the attached screenshot.    PS: If you go to directly to the page: <a href="http://smart.delfi.lv/">http://smart.delfi.lv/</a>  then search  works for fine. </pre>
