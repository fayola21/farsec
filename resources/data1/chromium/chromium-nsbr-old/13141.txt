<title>Issue 13141 -   chromium -    Capture First Install and Previous Version info in Crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Purpose: I'd like the ability to isolate crashes which predominately affect   first time users  and also those which affect upgraded users.    Ask: That we report a value with the crash that tells us: 1) The first   installation version 2) The previous installation version.  If there is no   first or previous we could set a &quot;0&quot; value or not set the meta field. </pre>
