<title>Issue 2659 -   chromium -    Cant extract or execute a Zip file from Download folder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When I download a RAR file   chrome download it to a directory names   &quot;T��__��_i xu��_��_��_ng&quot;    After download   I can't extract this file by WinRar . It appears a message   : The filename directory a volume label systax is incorrect    If I copy this file to another location   I can extract .   So I think the name &quot;T��__��_i xu��_��_��_ng &quot; of download folder is not work well with   some program because of its character.   Please provide
