<title>Issue 4007 -   chromium -    Regression: Popup blocker blocks popup too aggressively - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using 0.3.154.9      1. Visit www.mlslistings.com  2. Type &quot;Los Altos Hills&quot; into the City search box and click Search  3. Scroll down to  &quot;26459 Taaffe Rd&quot; and click on the thumbnail  4. On the listing page  click the &quot;Virtual Tour&quot; link.    (Sadly due to the site's design there's no way to direct-link to the   listing - you need to search every time).        Expected is the virtual tour popup appears.  Actual is the virtual tour popup briefly appears at the wrong size  then   disappears.    I think the code is opening a popup from a popup or something like that    and we're squishing it. </pre>
