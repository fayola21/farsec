<title>Issue 21314 -   chromium -    'History menu -&gt; Recently closed' lists duplicate sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 4.0.207.0 SVN Revision: 25607  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Clear Chromium data.      rm -rf Library/Application Support/Chromium/     rm ~/Library/Preferences/org.chromium.Chromium.plist  2. Start Chrome.  3. Open yahoo.com  wired.com  aol.com in different tabs. (Total four tabs  including default opened Google.com)  4. Close Google.com.  5. Verify History menu.  6. Close wired.com.  7. Verify History menu.    Expected result:  5.1 History menu list 'Google' under recently closed section.  7.2 History menu list 'Wired News' and 'Google' under recently closed section.    Actual result:  7.3 History menu list 'Google'  'Wired News' and 'Google' under recently  closed section.    Note:    - I think repetition happens until we don't close four tabs with different  sites.  </pre>
