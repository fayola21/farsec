<title>Issue 11833 -   chromium -    Some directories should be world/group readable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We now create all directories as only readable/writable by the user.  This   is because most of our data is private (e.g. cookies  history contents    passwords).    It could make sense for some data to just obey the umask.   - the Downloads directory  if we create it?   - web archive-like downloads  where we create the subdirectory?    However  on the other hand  since we auto-download stuff I'd hate to (for   example) be browsing my TurboTax returns  have Chrome auto-download my tax   info as a PDF  and have that written into a world-readable directory   without my knowledge.    So maybe our current behavior is correct (?). </pre>
