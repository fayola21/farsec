<title>Issue 4666 -   chromium -    Possible crash on new window creation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Brett showed me this crash this morning.    When the Browser creates the BrowserWindow it's possible for the   BrowserWindow to ask the delegate to save the window position   (SaveWindowPlacement). If this happens Browser::SaveWindowPlacement is   invoked when the window_ is NULL. If SessionService is running its possible   the SessionService will query for the BrowserWindow and we end up crashing   because the window is null and SessionService assumes it's non null. </pre>
