<title>Issue 17001 -   chromium -    Regression: IME contexts mismanaged between tabs and omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make sure a sufficiently complex IME is installed. SCIM or UIM with   Japanese input enabled are good.  2. For best result  make sure the IME shows some kind of indication of what   mode it is in  such as SCIM's toolbar. UIM with &quot;show input mode nearby   cursor&quot; enabled works best  as it shows exactly which window triggered the   IME change. A compositing WM with drop-shadows enabled will also let you   estimate visually the number of changes that happen.  3. Run chromium from the commandline as GTK_IM_MODULE=uim ./chrome. This   forces uim to be the default IME. Verify it worked by right-clicking on the   omnibox and checking if in &quot;Input methods&quot; submenu &quot;System (uim)&quot; is   selected.  4. Open a chromium window with 20+ tabs. The contents don't matter  they   can be empty.  5. In the last tab navigate to an URL  so that there's something to select   in the omnibox.  6. Try double-clicking to select the URL in omnibox. Then try clicking on   the content area and omnibox again. Notice the time it took to complete and   the CPU usage.      Nothing special happens. The current IME context switches away from the tab   and into the omnibox  as indicated by the UIM input mode popup. The process   is immediate.      The popup appears over the omnibox  then several times (3?) back over the   tab content area. This happens for every click  and *every tab open in the   window*. This means that with 20+ tabs  double-clicking on the URL might   take 5s-10s to complete  during which the popups stack (as evidenced by the   very dark composited drop-shadow) before they're dismissed. The CPU usage   is at 100%.    Please provide
