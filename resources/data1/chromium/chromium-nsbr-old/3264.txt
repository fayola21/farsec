<title>Issue 3264 -   chromium -    standard window controls and grey line rendered when right clicking on caption area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run the browser with --magic_browzR for a while  with many tabs  2. Right click on the caption area.      - observe that the standard windows window controls are painted over the  Chrome window controls  as well as a grey line across the entire window.  The glitch disappears when the window is repainted.    This appears to be painting done by WM_ENTERMENULOOP. </pre>
