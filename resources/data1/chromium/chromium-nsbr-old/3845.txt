<title>Issue 3845 -   chromium -    crash when trying to load JS Shell bookmarklet on an https page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From tony in b/1450626:    1) Navigate to <a href="https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html">https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html</a>  2) Click on the shell bookmarklet (green text button).  3) browser process crash in SSLManager::OnMixedContent    I think the active NavigationEntry is junk/null so entry-&gt;url() is a null   pointer exception.      ------------------------------    Note: this does not crash for me on the release branch (154.6). </pre>
