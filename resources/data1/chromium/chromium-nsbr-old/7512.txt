<title>Issue 7512 -   chromium -    Ctrl should not trigger TLD addition with explicit user selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48    - Type the keyword to a search engine  don't type the whole keyword  - When the suggested search engine appears at the bottom  - Select it via arrow/mouse    1) Ctrl + V problem  - Hold Ctrl  assume you have some string in clipboard to paste  ! While pressng the Ctrl button  the omnibar cleared out  # Solution: hold Ctrl while choosing the search engine  then paste your text  ## Note: If you release the Ctrl button without pasting  the omnibar will still be cleared   out    2) Typing problem  - Type a letter  ! After typing a letter  the search engine converted to it's keyword  # Solution: delete the last letter (now you got the full keyword)  then hit Tab to fix the   search engine activation  * This happens only to some search      In conclusion  the search engine should not disappear if the user didn't hit the backspace   button.     </pre>
