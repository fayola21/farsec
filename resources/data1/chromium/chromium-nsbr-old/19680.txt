<title>Issue 19680 -   chromium -    Ctrl-left &amp; right does not work correctly in text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (202.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Go to any webpage that has a textarea (such as this bug report box)  2. Click to put the cursor in the middle of a sentence and  while holding   the control key  press the left arrow      - It should skip the cursor one word at a time       - It goes to the beginning or end of the line    Once this is fixed  the same should also hold true for holding Shift+Ctrl   and pressing left &amp; right--this should highlight one word at a time.    The ctrl-left &amp; right word navigation works properly in Firefox 3+ and   Safari 4+ on my Mac </pre>
