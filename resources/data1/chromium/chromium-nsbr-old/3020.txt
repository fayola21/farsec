Open chrome and make sure you've selected the auto restore previous tabs   session option.  2. Log on to your Gmail account.  3. Open 2 or 3 more tabs to other websites.  4. Close chrome (All processes)  5. Disconnect the pc from the internet.  6. Open chrome while still being disconnected.  7. Connect back to the internet.  8. Refresh your gmail tab.  9. Dettach one of the 2 or 3 already opened tabs  or even close one of   them  just do any action on the tab bar that will require title refresh for   all tabs.  10. Notice the immediate revert to the old title.        As Gmail is logged off  the title should show &quot;Gmail: Email from Google&quot;.      An incorrect title is shown  one that would normally show if you're logged   on. Chrome should render the current appropriate title rather than   retreiving a cached one.     </pre>
