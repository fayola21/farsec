<title>Issue 2194 -   chromium -    Incompatible with Gameguard (gaming protect system) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Run and online game that have Gameguard (like Mapleglobal.com   gunbound.ijji.com or trickster.ntreev.net)  2. Open a New tab or change the URL of the current tab.        The page load normally.      The Aw  Snap! page display says &quot;Something went wrong went display this  page...&quot;  If you try change the URL  a blank page will load with no loading.  Click on a link in current page (load before the game start) that open a  new tab or change the url of the current tab  it works fine.  Maybe the problem only because of the Adress bar. </pre>
