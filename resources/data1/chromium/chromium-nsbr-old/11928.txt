<title>Issue 11928 -   chromium -    Investigate using gtk_widget_set_redraw_on_allocate for performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-">http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-set-</a>  redraw-on-allocate    &quot;Sets whether the entire widget is queued for drawing when its size   allocation changes. By default  this setting is TRUE and the entire widget is   redrawn on every size change. If your widget leaves the upper left unchanged   when made bigger  turning this setting off will improve performance.&quot; </pre>
