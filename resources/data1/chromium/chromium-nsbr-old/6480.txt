<title>Issue 6480 -   chromium -    Bootstrap tarball is out of date and doesn't work  despite strong recommendations on &quot;Get the Code&quot; page to use it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The &quot;Get the Code&quot; page (&lt;<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-</a>  code&gt;) strongly recommends using the bootstrap tarball to set up a new   Chromium checkout. But the tarball is quite out of date and using it results   in a non-working build. Probably the page should be updated not to mention   the tarball anymore. Once &lt;<a href="http://crbug.com/6385">http://crbug.com/6385</a>&gt; is fixed the page could be   reverted to its current form. </pre>
