<title>Issue 14425 -   chromium -    [www.unfogged.com]: Chrome doesn't follow #tags in displaying page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments_9852.html#1046615">http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments_9852.html#1046615</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?    Chrome doesn't follow the #tag to position the page it is displaying - this   means that the user is left wondering where in the page the link pointed   to.  Shown particularly here where the #tag is used to identify a   particular comment (#459) in a long comment string.          What is the expected result?  The page should be positioned at comment #459 when loading.              What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Load the above URL in Chrome - the page is positioned at the bottom of   the 800+ long comment page  with no indication of which comment was meant.    Also try scrolling up to comment 459 (by Blume) and clicking on the link to   the other comment embedded there - again  you can't tell which comment on   that page was indicated.  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  it works fine in Firefox 3 and IE6.    Please provide any additional information below.  I suspect this is a general problem that affects many other web pages; it's   just particularly annoying here.         </pre>
