<title>Issue 12608 -   chromium -    Chromium should handle creating desktop shorcuts for apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the [Page menu] &gt; Create application shortcuts... action is handled   by Gears.    This action simply asks the user to select 0-3 locations for an app shortcut    then creates shortcuts to launch chrome.exe with --app=&lt;current URL&gt;.    There's no reason we need to delegate to Gears here. The same function could   be handled by the browser.    I don't know how much code we could lift directly from Gears  but we should   make sure to look at it in case it encapsulates knowledge about strange error   conditions and other edge cases.  </pre>
