<title>Issue 9601 -   chromium -    Bookmark dialog accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set keyboard focus to the toolbar using SHIFT+ALT+T  2. Use right arrow key to move focus to the star button  3. Hit Space key to bring up the Bookmark dialog  4. Use the Tab key to move through the dialog  and use a tool like Inspect32 to see the MSAA   information for each object.        Issues:  1. 'Remove' link is not keyboard accessible.  2. For the 'Name' field  MSAA name should be the label ('Name:') and the MSAA value should be   the string entered in the field. The MSAA role should be 'editable text' (ROLE_SYSTEM_TEXT).  3. For the 'Folder' combobox  the name should be the label (Folder:). MSAA value is correct  as is   the MSAA role.     </pre>
