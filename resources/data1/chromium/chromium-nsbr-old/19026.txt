<title>Issue 19026 -   chromium -    Summary of double-clicking selection bugs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Double-clicking to select text has (or should have) different behaviour on different platforms    and has various bugs. Since they're related  here's a summary of the expected behaviour and the   existing behaviour.    Big warning:  - Many apps implement some form of &quot;smart&quot; pasting (this includes Notepad on Windows and   TextEdit on Mac)  making it more difficult to test copy/paste bugs.    On Windows  expected:  1) Double-clicking a word selects it and the following space (possibly multiple spaces)  if any.  2) Words are also terminated by punctuation  which is not selected.  3) If the word is at the end of a line which is wrapped (i.e.  the text continues on the next line   without an explicit line break)  the (invisible) space following it should be selected.  4) If the word is at the end of a line terminated by an explicit line break  the word should be   selected but not the CR/LF.    Windows  actual:  1) is usually fine  but see <a title="Space added after double clicking  another space added after pasting" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6396"> issue 6396 </a>. (Safari/Win acts like on a Mac -- see below.)  2) is fine.  3) We usually copy to clipboard fine. However (possibly new): (sometimes?) fails when the   following line begins with a link (or possibly other elements as well). However: selection doesn't   show that a space is (or spaces are) selected; IE does  FF doesn't  Safari n/a.  4) We select the CR/LF  which is typically annoying; IE doesn't  FF doesn't  Safari n/a.    Windows note: Triple-clicking selects the paragraph in IE  line (including CR/LF) in various other   apps (including us). We're fine.    Mac (and probably Linux?)  expected:  1) Double-clicking selects the word  not including following space.  2) Punctuation as above.  3) N/a since it shouldn't select following space.  4) N/a also.    Mac  actual:  We behave like on Windows  Windows-behaviour bugs included.    Note: Triple-clicking selects a line  which we do.    Related issues: 72  6396  16624. (Others?) </pre>
