<title>Issue 9611 -   chromium -    Unexpected grey border on images when src attribute was originally blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53 (Official Build 11798)         Safari 4: OK      1. Open the attached page (testcase.html). The page includes an img element   with an empty src attribute  so that it's initially given the default light   grey border indicating its dimensions. The body's onload attribute contains   some JS to set the src attribute of the img to a non-empty value.      Setting the src attribute should remove the grey border entirely  just as   if the src had been specified directly in the markup of the page.      The grey border often remains (see screenshot attached). It always remains   for me in this test case  but in other cases it only remains some of the   time  or only part of it remains. In all cases the border disappears if the   window is resized or min-/maximized.     </pre>
