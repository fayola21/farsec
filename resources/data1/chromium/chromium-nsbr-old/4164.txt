<title>Issue 4164 -   chromium -    ImporterObserver::ImportCanceled is never invoked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In adding support for importing bookmarks.html I realized this method is   never invoked. I would remove it  but it looks like the first run dialogs   override these. We should analyze whether this method should be invoked and   if not  rip it out. </pre>
