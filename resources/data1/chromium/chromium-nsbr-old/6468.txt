<title>Issue 6468 -   chromium -    Remove the zombie hunter. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> HuntForZombieChromeProcesses can be slow on startup  because it needs to   ask the OS for all processing running system wide  etc.    I had chatted to MA about it  and he seemed to think our zombie situation   should be OK these day  and perhaps we are better without it. </pre>
