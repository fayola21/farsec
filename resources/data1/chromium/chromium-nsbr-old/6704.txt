<title>Issue 6704 -   chromium -    Change name in taskbar when page is loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL      1. Go to a URL  2. Switch to another application  3. Glance at the taskbar and try to figure out if your page is ready      If the page is not yet loaded  the taskbar provides notification (via a changed   icon or adding the prefix 'Loading:' to the page title).      The title of the open tab is displayed  regardless of load state.      Ironically  Google App Engine necessitates this request.  It takes so painfully   long for the SDK to render a page  I often switch into my code editor and   continue working while it's loading.  It would be really nice if I could glance   at the taskbar and know if the page has rendered without switching between   apps. </pre>
