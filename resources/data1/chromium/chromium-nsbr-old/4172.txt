<title>Issue 4172 -   chromium -    Tab flickering on move - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a 154.9 Chrome window with multiple tabs  2. Drag the first tab a few pixels to the right and let go  3. Repeat until you see the tab flicker (a frame where it's not drawn  and   you can see the blue titlebar through where the tab is meant to be).  4. On my computer  this reproduces about 30-40% of the time - I've only   noticed it when moving tabs.   </pre>
