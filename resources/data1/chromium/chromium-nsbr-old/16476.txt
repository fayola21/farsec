<title>Issue 16476 -   chromium -    Pages requiring authentication hang brower when opened as new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0  Operating System     : Windows XP Home Edition SP3  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://authme.turnwheel.com/">http://authme.turnwheel.com/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open a link to a page that requires HTTP authentication in a new tab   (Using mouse middle-click or right click and select Open in new tab)  2. Attempt to navigate to the page you just opened  3. and wait for browser to respond...        The page opens as expected  asking for username/password in the HTTP auth   window that opens in the center of the window  and displaying the correct   URL I opened.        The entire browser hangs for a few seconds before allowing me to navigate   to the tab  or any other tab. When I wait and navigate to the page  the   authentication box is up in the top left corner  and the URL displays as   &quot;about:blank&quot; </pre>
