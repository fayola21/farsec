<title>Issue 2854 -   chromium -    100% CPU usage. GTalk suspect. Not videos related. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Unfortunately Unknown. The only apparent reason I've found is   1. Have gmail opened ( logged in gtalk ) .  2. Have gtalk opened.  3. Receive a message from someone.    But I cannot be sure.  This has happens every day.  It gets fixed by closing Chrome.        Work normally.        Chromes takes up to 100% of my CPU.    Please provide
