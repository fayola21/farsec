<title>Issue 22301 -   chromium -    about:credits should display libs actually used during build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> about:credits displays a list of libs which is both incomplete  and   include unnecessary libs.    For example  it currently displays:    bsdiff and bspatch  bzip2  libpng  ICU  Chinese and Japanese word frequency list  libxslt  lzma_sdk  modp_b64  pthreads-win32  tlslite  zlib  webkit  WTL  V8 assembler  DTOA  ffmpeg  parseftp    on linux  it should not list win/mac libs  like pthreads-win32 &amp; WTL.  It probably should not list the system libs either (in case of Ubuntu    bzip2  png  etc.)    there are also a lot of gaps  for ex sqlite  libjpeg  hunspell  xdg-*    expat  etc. </pre>
