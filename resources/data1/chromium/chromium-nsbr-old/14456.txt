<title>Issue 14456 -   chromium -    Typing too fast in address bar results in dropped characters when I hit Enter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Type very quickly in the address/search bar and press enter  also   quickly.  For example  top coder&lt;enter&gt; results in a search for &quot;top cod&quot;      All the characters I typed get passed through to the search/URL lookup   functionality.      The last couple characters I typed get left off of my search term.  Looks   like the message generated by the Enter key interrupts the UI-&gt;model update   and stale data gets used to resolve the URL or search.       </pre>
