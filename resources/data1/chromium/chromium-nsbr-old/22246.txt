<title>Issue 22246 -   chromium -    &lt;button&gt; tag is not present in request form during ajax request in asp.net ajax. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2             Safari 4:FAIL    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK    I implemented ASP.net ajax control which uses   &lt;button&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt; to render itself. This was done to   have custom button style.    If this Button used in asp.net ajax iterations then it is not present in   request form and could not handle post back and raise event.    If it is not ajax request then all works fine. </pre>
