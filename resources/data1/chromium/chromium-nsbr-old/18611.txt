<title>Issue 18611 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar is visible  but disappears when tabs are switched - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.0 (Developer Build 22546)  Other browsers tested: None      1. Uncheck always show bookmarks bar  2. Open the homepage  3. Click on a link to open or go to a URL in the navigation bar  4. Switch tab or toggle always show bookmarks bar      I expect the bookmarks bar to not be shown unless explicitly told to do so.   I don't mind it on the home page  but I would prefer not having it there   either.      The bookmarks bar will not disappear unless you switch to a different tab   and return back or toggle the checkbox to always show bookmarks bar. </pre>
