<title>Issue 5904 -   chromium -    Comcast does not recognize Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to comcast.net      No browser error screen will be shown.  Error screen is shown  not listing   Chrome even though it does list Safari for Mac.    Comcast probably just needs to update their Browser detection Javascript to   recognize Chrome.  I will try to reach out to them. </pre>
