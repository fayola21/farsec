<title>Issue 18293 -   chromium -    Make ExtensionPrefs the one truth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If we close or crash shortly after installing or uninstalling an extension    we can get into a situation where the Extensions dir and the prefs disagree   as to what is installed.    We should make the prefs the one truth:    - We can remove the Current Version file and store the version and path of   the currently installed version in the prefs.    - If we ever try to manipulate the directory structure and find it doesn't   meet our expectations based on what was in the prefs  we can mercilessly   change it until it does. </pre>
