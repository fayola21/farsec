<title>Issue 728 -   chromium -    Takes over Windows XP and creates errors in Firefox 3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>             Turn on my computer and have everything start as normal.      (1) Google Updater now takes over my system.  It takes my computer over 1  minute longer to start up and become ready.  (2) It makes me very  uncomfortable that Google has to connect with google several times for  'updates'.  I don't know what information is being transferred and because  of this alone  I will uninstall ALL Google applications.  I seriously hope  Google's not turning into another Microsoft in order to advance their  advertising.  (3) When I tried to start Firefox 3  there were errors.  I  had to open my task manager  end all Google processes  then restart Firefox      Please provide
