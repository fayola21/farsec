<title>Issue 21344 -   chromium -    authentication popup &amp; minimize problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. at slow connection  we want to enter some secured page require a popup   authentication. for example cpanel etc. sometimes we minimize to do another   task (because it takes long time for slow connection). when want to come   back to the page the browser (chrome) crash and cannot recovered even the   dialog box says &quot;Chrome is not responsive. Restart now?&quot; click OK and   nothing happened.    the way to recover is remove process in task manager (winxp). there is   about 2 chrome instance. one is 10mb memory and another one is 9mb. when   close the 10mb process others will close automatically and can run another   chrome.     if we close 9mb process  nothing happened until 10mb process is closed.    please correct minimize problem when authentication popup appear.  thanks.            -correct the authentication popup minimize then crash.          -restart when not responsive is not functioning when this happened.    <b>Please provide
