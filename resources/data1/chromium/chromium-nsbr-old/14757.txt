<title>Issue 14757 -   chromium -    [www.ebay.de]: Can't copy text from Microsoft Word into ebay  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.ebay.de/">http://www.ebay.de/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?  If you are selling something on ebay and use Microsoft word to create the   text  you can't copy the text into ebay. It occasionally works but then all   the formatting is gone.        What is the expected result?  Same as in IE and FF it should be possible to copy from a word doc.            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Create an account on ebay  log in and follow the steps to sell an item.  2. Try to copy information from a word file into the description box.  3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  This works fine in IE and FF.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
