<title>Issue 6648 -   chromium -    All folders expanded in Bookmark Manager / Edit Bookmark by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    When the Bookmark Manager is opened  or a bookmark is being edited  the   list of bookmarks has all folders expanded. This reduces the functionality   of folders because they don't make it quicker to find your intended   destination  or allow you to filter out potential destinations as easily.   Folders should start collapsed when the list is opened  or Chrome should   remember which folders were open and which ones were closed when the list   was last viewed. </pre>
