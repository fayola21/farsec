<title>Issue 5067 -   chromium -    RTL: Bookmarks manager context menu is displayed far away with context menu key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:0.4.154.31(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)      1. Run Chrome for any RTL LANG (Arabic is fine)  2. Bring up Bookmarks Manager (Ctrl+Shift+b)  3. Set keyboard focus to any row in the ListView (Right Hand side)  4. Hit context menu key and to get the context menu.    What do you see instead?  Context menu is displayed outside of the bookmarks manager (Screenshot  attached)      Not sure  it is regression because of the fix for the <a title="RTL: Bookmarks manager context menu should be displayed next to the mouse pointer" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4750"> issue 4750 </a> ?    This is used works fine (okey) in the previous builds.   </pre>
