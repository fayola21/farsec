<title>Issue 12343 -   chromium -    ProcessSingleton Linux cleanups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) We only handle one reader at a time. See the TODO in   process_singleton_linux.cc:109  2) We should send back an ACK to the second process.  If the second process   doesn't get an ACK in the given timeout  it should kill the first process   and go ahead and start.   </pre>
