<title>Issue 19454 -   chromium -    Map command-left/right arrow to back/forward; map delete (backspace) to back - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Command-left/right are standard history navigation keys in other Mac   browsers  including Safari  Firefox  and Camino.  The delete (backspace) key is   history back in these same browsers.    When a text field does not have focus  these combinations should perform   history navigation in Chromium too.    If we're going to support all of the silly tab-changing keyboard combinations   used by other Mac browsers  there's no reason to not support these   combinations.  There's actually more reason to support these  because I'm   accustomed to them. </pre>
