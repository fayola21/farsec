<title>Issue 19990 -   chromium -    remove HttpBridge's support for curl-based cookie parsing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A previous implementation of sync api used libcurl for network communication    and HttpBridge was developed and added in-flight  so for a period of time   both libraries were in use.  This meant some components in syncapi that   parsed cookies expected the curl format (which seems really weird and non   standard  and has lots of tabs in it!)  so HttpBridge actually converted to   this format (see HttpBridge::OnURLFetchComplete).  HttpBridge is now the only   net-layer interface used by sync api  so this can be removed. </pre>
