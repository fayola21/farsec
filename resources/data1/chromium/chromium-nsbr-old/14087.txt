<title>Issue 14087 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Session history gets hosed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe the patches to eliminate redirects from the back/forward list   caused this.  I don't remember who wrote these but I'm pretty sure Brett   reviewed.    Visit bugs.webkit.org by typing it in and hitting alt-enter (so it is the   only thing in your navigation history).  Type anything into the bugzilla   search box and hit return.  After navigating to the resulting page  your   session history is empty  so you can't go back.    (This affects a large number of pages I visit  this happens to be an easy   repro.) </pre>
