<title>Issue 22465 -   chromium -    Should support option to force links from external applications to be opened in a new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (26670)  OS version               : 10.6.1      In Safari 4.0.3  the preferences provide an option &quot;Open links from   applications: in a new window/in a new tab in the current window&quot;.      Unknown      1. Click a URL in an external program  2. Notice that the resulting web page is always opened in a new tab on the   current window  and that if the only Chromium window is minimised  it is   raised and a new web page opened in a new tab in that window.        A preference option would be available to have incoming links from   external applications open in a new window and not in the current.        No option is available  so  for instance  if the only Chromium window is   minimised  it is raised and a new tab is opened in it. This is not desirable. </pre>
