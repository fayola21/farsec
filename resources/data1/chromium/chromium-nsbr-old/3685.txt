<title>Issue 3685 -   chromium -    Two Context menus (Omnibox &amp; Tab Strip) can be shown at a time  If a window has more than one tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.154.6 (Official Build 3810)      1. Have two tabs.  2. Get Keyboard focus on Omnibox.  3. Right Click on tab strip to get the Tab Strip context menu (Don't close  this context menu).  4. [Notice Omnibox is still having keyboard focus] now hit the context menu  key to get the Omnibox context  menu.    What is the expected output?   User is not able to get the Omnibox context menu as long as Tab Strip  Context menu is not dismissed as this is true in case of single tab window.    What do you see instead?  User is able to get the two context menus at a time.       </pre>
