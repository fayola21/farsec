<title>Issue 22223 -   chromium -    Cleanup python scripts in layout_package - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The python scripts in webkit/tools/layout_tests/layout_package are in not  so good shape. We need to clean it up.    Examples:  What is test_types_unittest.py testing?  lots of unnecessary imports.  references to undefined functions and variables.  #!/bin/env/python in failure_finder_test.py    Ojan  can you assign this to the right person? </pre>
