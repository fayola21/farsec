<title>Issue 13754 -   chromium -    Wake from sleep - &quot;unknown plugin unresponsive&quot; dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On waking up my laptop from sleep  I frequently (more than half the time) get   an &quot;Unknown plugin unresponsive&quot; dialog. When I choose to kill the &quot;unknown   plugin&quot;  I get an infobar telling me that Gears has crashed.     I always have Gmail running and have offline enabled.       </pre>
