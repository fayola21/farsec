<title>Issue 12269 -   chromium -    Selection highlighting is ugly  selecting large whitespace regions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.x      Firefox 3.x: OK     WebKit/GTK: OK      1. go to <a href="http://adsweep.org/">http://adsweep.org/</a> for example  2. mark some text  3. compare with other browsers      IMHO selections should work and be displayed like in other browsers. Even  the WebKit/GTK based Epiphany does this.      Chrome highlights too much and not only the text.      Attaching screenshots of Chromium and Epiphany/WebKit. </pre>
