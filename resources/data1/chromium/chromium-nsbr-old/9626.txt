<title>Issue 9626 -   chromium -    scons: *** [Hammer/dbg/obj/chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.o] Error 1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : I do not know. svn version 12966                    1.get the source  2.type hammer  3.scons: building terminated because of errors.    I get this message  and I do not know what's causing this. I've been  building my own system with LinuxFromScratch  and normally you'll get a  clue what's wrong. But this build system does not give any message.     The only error I see in the output (long before this break):  scons: *** [Hammer/dbg/obj/chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.o] Error 1  But this looks like a windows error  and I'm building on a Linux system.
