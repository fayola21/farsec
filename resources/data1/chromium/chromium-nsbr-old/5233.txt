<title>Issue 5233 -   chromium -    Move DOM constructor cache out of V8Proxy. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The lifetime of a DOM constructor is bounded by a Context  currently it is in V8Proxy. There are   situation that context is available  but V8Proxy is not accessible  so the code cannot access the   DOM constructor cache.    Current V8Proxy::InstantiateV8Object has following code:     2419   v8::Local&lt;v8::Function&gt; function = desc-&gt;GetFunction();   2473   V8Proxy* proxy = V8Proxy::retrieve();   2474   if (proxy) {   2475     // Constructor is configured.   2476     function = proxy-&gt;GetConstructor(desc_type);   2477   } else {   2478     function = GetTemplate(desc_type)-&gt;GetFunction();    We'd like to get rid of proxy==NULL case.     </pre>
