<title>Issue 14678 -   chromium -    StartToFinish histogram has incorrect data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There was a large change (regression?) between Google Chrome 3.0.183.x and   3.0.189.x.  Suddenly  RequestToFinish histogram is reported almost all its   samples at roughly 0.    I reviewed the code in that area  and noted that the current defintion   seems wrong  as the following two lines appear to have the same values:     TimeDelta start_to_finish = finish_load_time - start_load_time;   TimeDelta request_to_finish = finish_load_time - start_load_time;    Reviewing blame  the above typo landed in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13116">revision 13116</a> (i.e.  these two   data values have been the same for a while).    In addition  the effective metric (start_to_finish and/or   request_to_finish) changed dramatically between the above two version.    I considered the possibility that my recent change in which histogram macro   was used might have caused the regression... but after staring at the code    I'm sure it was not the cause.  In addition  the second histogram  with the   same value (due to the above typo) also changed dramatically (regressed?)   even though I didn't change its macro (which means the regression is in the   data source  not the histogram macro details).    This problem is blocking several optimization experiments  and really needs   to be looked at asap.  I could fix the above typo... but that is not the   major problem/regression.    Thanks in advance     Jim </pre>
