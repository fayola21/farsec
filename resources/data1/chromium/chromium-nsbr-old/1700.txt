<title>Issue 1700 -   chromium -    Synchronization problem in Google Reader - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Google Reader and find a feed with more than one unread items  say   reddit.com. On the left hand side showing the subscription list  you'll see   reddit.com (10)  meaning 10 unread items. On the right hand side  above the   subscribed articles  you'll see a line saying Show: 10 new items - all   items.  2. Click on the first article  or press j. Google Reader automatically mark   this article as read. The top line on the right now shows 9 new items. But    the subscription list still shows reddit.com (10).  3. You can play with marking more items as read or unread  and you'll   likely see the same synchronization problem.        The counts on the left and on the right should be the same.
