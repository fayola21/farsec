<title>Issue 8825 -   chromium -    All urls need http:// prefix  which is annoying - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  every url you type has to have the &quot;http:// prefix otherwise it  fails to load. Dang that's annoying!    Putting on dogfood list. We can hack this even before we get the full  omnibox working. </pre>
