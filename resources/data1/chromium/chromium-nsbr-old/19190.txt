<title>Issue 19190 -   chromium -    &quot;Font Script&quot; Is Stuck On &quot;Western&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Open Google Chrome Options  switch to &quot;Under the Hood&quot; tab.  2. Click on &quot;Change font and language settings&quot;.  3. Click on one of the 3 &quot;Change...&quot; buttons.  4. Change the &quot;Script&quot; to something else then &quot;Western&quot;  say &quot;Turkish&quot;.  5. Click &quot;OK&quot; to close.  6. Click back on the same &quot;Change...&quot; button you just clicked.        The &quot;Script&quot; should have been showing &quot;Turkish&quot; since we choosed &quot;Turkish&quot;   from the &quot;Script&quot; menu and applied it via the &quot;OK&quot; button.        The &quot;Script&quot; stays on &quot;Western&quot; no matter which &quot;Script&quot; we choose. It is   simply stuck on &quot;Western&quot; and cannot be changed.    <b>Please provide
