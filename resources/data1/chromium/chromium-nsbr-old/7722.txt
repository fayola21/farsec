<title>Issue 7722 -   chromium -    Corrupt SDCH dictionary download should cause exponential backoff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a site supporting SDCH  and get a suggestion for a dicitionary   download.  2. Have a MITM (censorship filter?? AV software?) corrupt the downloaded   dictionary.  3. Each additional visit will induce yet another attempt to fetch the   dictionary      In a *similar* way to what we do with blacklisting support for SDCH  we   should blacklist dictionary fetching for progressively longer periods of   time (or attempts) with each corruption.  This blacklisting might be  global (applicable to all domains  assuming the filter is global)  or might   be domain specific (assuming the dictionary server on a site is providing   corrupt dictionaries  that are not worth fetching.    Perhaps the existing domain-based blacklisting should be extended to cover   dictionary downloads. </pre>
