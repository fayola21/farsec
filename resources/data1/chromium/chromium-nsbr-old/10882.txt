<title>Issue 10882 -   chromium -    CSS Bug  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0             Safari 4: NOT TESTED    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: NOT TESTED      1. I've attached the files that can recreate the problem.  (chrome_error.html and contact.png)  2. Put the html file in any folder  and then the contact.png image into an   &quot;images&quot; folder. Eg: Confirm/chrome_error.html and   Confirm/images/contact.png      The 3 types of contacting (Email  Facebook  MSN) light up when you hover   over it  as if it was a rollover image. In firefox  it works perfectly  the   image changes successfully when hovered over.       In Google Chrome  the image that should appear exactly over the old image   is further down  and each one is further down than the last. (Please ignore   how only half the MSN one changes  as that's my fault in the coding  not   Chrome's)    Extra Information:   It's using CSS  if that helps.    </pre>
