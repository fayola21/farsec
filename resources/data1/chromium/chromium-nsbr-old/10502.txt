<title>Issue 10502 -   chromium -    Ability to make all cookies session cookies without entering incognito mode requested - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently incognito mode provides privacy protection from websites by making all cookies session cookies   and privacy from local data by making sure data does not outlive the incognito session locally.    There should be an additional option in the cookie settings to get the session cookie behavior without   having to enter incognito mode. This is much better than having fine-grained cookie options which are too   tedious to be practical and rejecting cookies all-together which makes things stop working. Plus  it lets   users get the advantage of Chrome keeping history while preventing websites for tracking them beyond one   session.    This is a branch off of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5528">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5528</a> where the user experienced   this behavior and reported it as an issue while it clearly has advantages as well. There is an option to do   this in Firefox and Seamonkey.     </pre>
