<title>Issue 6683 -   chromium -    Reduce flakiness in OsCachesLookupsTest in dns_master_unittest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run dns_master_unittest   2. Some rare times (more often on linux??) the test fails      I need to make the test automatically repeat until the ratio of cache   successes to failures demonstrates that the cache is working.  If this   takes &quot;too long &quot; then the test will fail  but that should be a real   failure  an not caused by a rare murphy thread delay.    As currently implemented  a single murphy thread (pause) can cause a   failure by adding delay into the cached lookup.     </pre>
