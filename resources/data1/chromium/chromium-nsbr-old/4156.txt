<title>Issue 4156 -   chromium -    Google Chrome command line --Incognito - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9    Google Chrome only opens in Incognito mode for the shortcut in which the   command line --Incognito is enabled. You have to change all other Google   Chrome shortcuts for them to also open in Incognito mode. Also  when Google   Chrome is set as your computer's default browser  any link to a web page   from any program opens in a non-incognito browser.   </pre>
