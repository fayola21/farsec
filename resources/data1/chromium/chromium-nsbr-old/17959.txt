<title>Issue 17959 -   chromium -    While clearing a large amount of personal data  browser UI is unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have a cache that you've never cleared before.  Ever.  2. Wrench &gt; Clear Browsing Data...  3. Check only &quot;Empty the cache&quot; and &quot;Everything&quot; as the period  4. Click Clear Browsing Data  5. Switch back to the browser and try to close/create new tabs      I expect to be able to close/create tabs.  Instead nothing happened until   the cache was finished clearing (~1 minute)  then all UI actions took   place.  In other words  big jank.    Without digging into it too much  I imagine there's some contention between   the IO and UI threads.  It's an edge case  but maybe it's symptomatic of   other jank issues. </pre>
