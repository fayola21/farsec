<title>Issue 4234 -   chromium -    Unable to check for updates and so... to update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install 0.3.154.6  2. I do not know really...        When opening the about box  it should check for updates each time we   display it.      When I display the about box in order to check for updates  I always have   &quot;Update server unavailable (code 3)&quot;  for more than one week now. I was   thinking before that it was just a temporary server failure but it appears   that other people can update. This message is instantaneously displayed so   I don't think that Chrome actually check for the server availability So I   think that's a bug  and I can't update when there will a patch. What can I   do ?    Please provide
