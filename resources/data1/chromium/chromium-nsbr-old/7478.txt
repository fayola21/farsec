<title>Issue 7478 -   chromium -    Attempt to fix caption button position on Aero glass by making whole window client area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Fallout from my work on <a title="[magic_browzr] Window frame drawn incorrectly" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5054"> issue 5054 </a>.    The caption buttons on Aero glass are too close to the window edge.  This   looks wrong.  If we made the whole window client area  instead of trying to   preserve 5 px or so of nonclient area along three of the edges  we could   fix this (and probably simplify all the aero glass nonclient code).  Well    technically  we'd make the buttons be positioned too far the _other_   direction  but I think that looks a lot less wrong. </pre>
