<title>Issue 17419 -   chromium -    Hovering over names in &quot;People with access&quot; tab of Google Document shows no popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Version info is at the bottom)    Using Firefox  I'm able to hover over names of collaborators in the &quot;People   with access&quot; tab of the share dialog in a Google Document and get a popup   (tooltip) that shows the email address of that person. However  in Chromium   I instead get a text selection cursor (as if it will let me edit the text    but it really won't) and no popup appears.
