<title>Issue 21790 -   chromium -    Verify disabled UI/unit tests; make sure they're still broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a lot of disabled UI and unit tests. We should verify that they still   need to be disabled and re-activate those that are no longer failing.    Watch out for flaky tests. Some of them fail very rarely.    Also see <a title="need dashboard that shows a list + total numbers of disabled UI/unittests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4063">issue 4063</a>: dashboard to track number of disabled tests </pre>
