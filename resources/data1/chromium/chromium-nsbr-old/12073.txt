<title>Issue 12073 -   chromium -    Add a function to assemble a host and port string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In many network protocol situations we need to concatenate  a host and port as      host:port  or eliding the port if it's the default port      host[:port]    We should add a function to do that.  It is not just a  straightforward concatenation because if the host is an  IPv6 literal address  which contains colons (:)  then it  needs to be put inside square brackets ([]). </pre>
