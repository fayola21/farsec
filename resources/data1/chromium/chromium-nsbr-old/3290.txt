<title>Issue 3290 -   chromium -    Image tab titles are incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After the WebKit merge  these became incorrect. See  <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif">http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif</a>    The function is imageTitle in localized_strings.cc The filename should be   first  and then the dimensions. The multiplication sign doesn't seem to be   getting converted to 16-bit characters properly. </pre>
