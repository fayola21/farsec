Click on some link from Bookmarks Toolbar.  2. Meanwhile when page is loading  click on address bar and press Enter.  On Firefox I'm always using this method to refresh the page when there is   some problem with loading.      Try to open current page again.      Address dissappearing and page is blank.   </pre>
