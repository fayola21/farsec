<title>Issue 8376 -   chromium -    Find across all tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lots of tabbed text editors have a feature that allows the user to search   for a string across all open documents.  It might be useful to have   something similar in Chromium  allowing a user to search for a string   across all open tabs.    Could be a candidate for an extension. </pre>
