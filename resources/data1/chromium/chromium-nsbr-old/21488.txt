<title>Issue 21488 -   chromium -    Theme is corrupted on browser crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the browser does not exit normally in a session during which a theme is   installed  the theme will be corrupted when the browser is reopened.  This is   because the new theme data is written to disk in the same slot as the old   theme data at the time of theme install  but the new preferences are not   written to disk until browser shutdown.    The preferences file should always refer to the images of a single theme.   </pre>
