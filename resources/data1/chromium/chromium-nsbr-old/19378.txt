<title>Issue 19378 -   chromium -    Feature request: Open text in new tab (not only links) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested    I think Chrome should have an option to open text (non link) on a new tab   when selecting a text and clinking on it with right mouse button.   For now we only have an option to search on Google and copy.  Obs: Opera Browser have this option and is great.    See the video uploaded to see an irratating situation that could be solved   if we had this option on Chrome.       </pre>
