<title>Issue 8337 -   chromium -    Add Keep Browsing Data support in Clear Browsing Data Screen... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At the bottom of the Clear Browsing Data screen  chrome lets you   &quot;Clear Data From This Period: [This Day  This Week  This Month    Everything]&quot; this should be changed to....     &quot;Keep Data From This Period: [This Day  This Week  This Month  Past   Six Months  This Year  Delete Everything]&quot;     This would enable you to clear your OLDEST browsing data but still   keep your recent browsing activities in tact. When you think about it    you'd want to save the most recent data because it would be the most   relevant. As it currently stands you only have the option of deleting the   new data such as clearing the data from This Month which doesn't really   make much sense.    Making this change would fix the problem of stale &quot;Most Viewed Sites&quot; list   in the new tab page. For example if you kept data from This Month you'd   delete all the other data thus leaving just the Most Visited Sites from   this month which would be more relevant.     </pre>
