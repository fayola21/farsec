<title>Issue 8636 -   chromium -    History UI should query for next available block of data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the History UI dumbly queries for pages - it requests a day-block   of browsing information at a time until it has enough to fill the current   page. This is inefficient in cases where there are gaps in the user's   history  as many of these day queries return false.    We should either query for a month at a time (aligned with our history DB   boundaries) and feed it to the page in smaller blocks  or change the query   so that it requests &quot;the next day with data in it&quot;.     </pre>
