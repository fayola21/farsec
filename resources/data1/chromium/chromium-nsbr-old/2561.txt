<title>Issue 2561 -   chromium -    Title Bar  other UI elements look funny when run in 256 colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.2.153.0 (Developer Build 2391)  OS: Vista (non-Aero) or XP Pro (on VMWare)  Colors: Low (8 bit)(256)    Precondition:    Start with Chrome not running.          1. Right-click on Chrome or Chromium icon on Windows Desktop or Explorer.  2. Select &quot;Properties&quot; from context menu.  3. Select the &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab in the Properties dialog.  4. Under &quot;Settings &quot; check the &quot;Run in 256 colors&quot; checkbox.  5. Hit the &quot;OK&quot; button.  6. Launch Chrome or Chromium.      What is the expected output?     Normal colors in title bar  dialog boxes  etc.      What do you see instead?    Funky colors ... if colors used in icons and other UI elements don't happen  to be one of the 256 colors  the drawing system will have to &quot;interpret&quot;  them.      Other programs  such as IE and FF have some problems as well  but we should  at least be aware of the issue.    See attached pictures.     </pre>
