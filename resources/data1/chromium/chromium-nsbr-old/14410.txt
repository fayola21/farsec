<title>Issue 14410 -   chromium -    [www.netflix.com]: Cannot watch &quot;Instant Browse&quot; movies via Netflix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMessage?msg=51">http://www.netflix.com/WiMessage?msg=51</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?  Cannot watch movies directly from Chrome.            What is the expected result?  Normally when you log into Netflix  you should be able to watch &quot;Instant   Browse&quot; movies directly from the browser after installing a plugin.  I am   able to watch movies from Firefox and IE.                What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Someone with a certain Netflix membership (that allows you to watch   Instant Browse) should be able to log into his/her account.  2. Click on the &quot;Instant Browse&quot; tab at the top of the page.  3. Select a movie and press the &quot;Play&quot; button.  4.  The user will then be directed to a page that asks for a plugin to be   installed.  (I unfortunately have already installed the plugin so do not   know the specific name)  5.  Once the plugin is installed  the movie should play.  In Chrome I   receive a message that says &quot;Our apologies ��_��_��_ instant watching is not   supported on this browser.&quot;    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  I have been able to watch movies via IE and Firefox without a problem.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
