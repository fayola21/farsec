<title>Issue 14204 -   chromium -    Scrollbar triggers onmousedown  but fails to trigger onmouseup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0 (Official Build 18043)    <a href="http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_up_down_bug.html">http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_up_down_bug.html</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Visit the above URL  2. Click the mouse all over the page  and note that &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; are   triggered correctly.  3. Use the scrollbars surrounding the test image  and note that &quot;Down&quot; is   triggered  but never &quot;Up&quot;.      A scrollbar should trigger both (or neither?) Down and Up  but the current   asymmetric behavior is definitely wrong.   </pre>
