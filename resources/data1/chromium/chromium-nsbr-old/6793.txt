<title>Issue 6793 -   chromium -    textarea resize gripper has an extra 1px border - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Here's an example page:  <a href="http://ponderer.org/tests/textarea.html">http://ponderer.org/tests/textarea.html</a>    There's a one pixel grey border on the top and left of the image (drawn in  WebCore/renderer/RenderLayer.cpp).  For some reason it extends above and to  the left of our scrollbar making it look really ugly.    This only seems to show up on non-default color backgrounds (in the test  above  it's only on the white text area  not the black one).  Not sure why  this is happening. </pre>
