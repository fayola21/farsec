<title>Issue 18064 -   chromium -    Remove the KeyDown type from &quot;WebInputEvent.h&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We refactored the keyboard-input code of our Linux and Mac front-ends to   support input methods (or IMEs). After this refactoring  we don't need the   KeyDown type defined in &quot;WebInputEvent.h&quot; any longer. We need to remove this   type from our code. </pre>
