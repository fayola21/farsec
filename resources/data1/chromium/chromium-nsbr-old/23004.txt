<title>Issue 23004 -   chromium -    Remove hidden files when packaging extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This would let us remove any non-listed files during packaging  for a  smaller file size  and reduced risk of including unwanted content. On the  other hand  it adds some hassle for developers (currently they don't have  to list pages  imgs  css  etc).    Thought prompted by this discussion on chromium-extensions:    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/ecd238781ee78bd6?hl=en">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/ecd238781ee78bd6?hl=en</a>    &quot;Ignore hidden files and folder when packing extensions:    I often use Google Code + Tortoise SVN to store and retrieve the code  of my extensions and  because TortoiseSVN creates an hidden folder  ( .svn ) into each directory  every time I package the extension those  hidden folders are archived inside the .crx file.    That is not what I desire  I would like the packager to strip hidden  file and folders ( maybe a new command line option ? )    Is that possibile?&quot;   </pre>
