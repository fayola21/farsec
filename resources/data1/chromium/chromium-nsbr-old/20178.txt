<title>Issue 20178 -   chromium -    First run home page experimental conditions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For mstone3  we are going to turn on the home button and set the home page to   google.com (and set the start page to the home page). However  we need to   verify that those changes are successful so we need two experimental   conditions.  1. do not enable the home button (but still set the home page to google.com   and set the home page to the start page)  2. do not enable the home button and do not set the home page to google.com   (but leave it set to the NTP). </pre>
