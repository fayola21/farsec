<title>Issue 2917 -   chromium -    List the fonts supporting the script and matching the CSS generic family before listing all other fonts.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1185948&gt;    In Firefox  user can select font based on which script the language is  using  it catalog the common used font for each script and list them at the  beginning of the font selection drop down list  it is very convenient for user.    In Chrome  user don't select font based on script  but we will initialize  the default font base on what language Chrome is using  shall we also  optimize our font selection drop down list like Firefox does? </pre>
