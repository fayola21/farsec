<title>Issue 10555 -   chromium -    Remove option 2 (phishing) from report-a-bug dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The &quot;phishy  phishy&quot; option in the report-a-bug dialog isn't being used --   in fact  we haven't seen any reports with this option!     Most likely  the anti-phishing support is picking up/blocking most phishing   sites.    Since this option isn't being used  we probably want to simplify the drop   down by removing it. </pre>
