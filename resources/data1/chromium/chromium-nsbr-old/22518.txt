<title>Issue 22518 -   chromium -    keyboard bindings involving more than one shortcut (&quot;chorded shortcuts&quot;) don't work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The fake nsresponder we use only looks at one single keyboard even  so   chorded events (e.g. c-x c-s) don't work. The default keyboard bindings don't   contain chorded shortcuts  so this is only noticeable to people who add their   own shortcuts (hence not high-priority).    One way to implement this would be to have several responders  one that   gets the last 1 keyboard event  one that gets the last 2  and one that gets the   last 3 (3 keyboard events in a row are enough for everybody! ;-) )  and then   send selectors executed by any of those. </pre>
