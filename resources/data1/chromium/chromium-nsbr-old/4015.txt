<title>Issue 4015 -   chromium -    Dragging a tab to the top edge of a screen should maximize it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a dual monitor setup. I like to keep all of my windows maximized all   the time. The ability top pop out a tab is very nice  but I always have to   re-maximize it. It would be very nice if I could drag out a tab to the   second monitor and it would stay maximized. If I already have a maximized   Chrome window on the other monitor  I can accomplish this by dragging to   the other tab bar. That works nice  but it should also work simply by   touching the mouse to the top of the other screen.       </pre>
