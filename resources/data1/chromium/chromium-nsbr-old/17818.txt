<title>Issue 17818 -   chromium -    Enabled dynamic / web font support in a secure manner - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In issue 1303  web / dynamic font was enabled  but was disabled by default   (unless the command line options --enable-remote-font is used) in <a title="Disable web fonts by default" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9633"> issue 9633 </a>.     There's a work going on to enable web / dynamic font support again with a   security issue taken care of. Takuya  can you assign this to the engineer   working on this?      I couldn't find a bug on this (re-enabling web/dynamic font in a secure   manner). If there's one filed already  please dupe this away. Thanks !     </pre>
