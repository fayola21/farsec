<title>Issue 15070 -   chromium -    Batch removal of passwords from keychain by date range - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The &quot;clear browsing data&quot; code needs to be able to clear passwords from the  password store given a date range. Stuart said on IRC we'll need to do some  work in order to be able to get this hooked up to Keychain on Mac.    Once we start being able to store passwords in Keychain  we need to track  this work as it will affect the Google privacy policy for Mac. </pre>
