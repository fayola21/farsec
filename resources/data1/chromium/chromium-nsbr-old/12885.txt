<title>Issue 12885 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Upgrade to 2.0.172.28 won't connect / load pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Loaded Chrome 1.0.154.53 then Tools  About  Upgrade to new version  2. Restarted Chrome - hangs - will not connect  open pages. Other browsers  still work.   3. Did this 2x - removed chrome - re-installed 1.0.154.53 - it works fine.  I was able to reload version 1.0.154.53 because that is what the google  updater pointed to.  Then upgraded as above to 2.0.172.28 a second time and  still cannot get it to work.        Expect upgrade to install a working version of the application        hangs on opening - does not look like it attempts to connect to web  address. Hot spots on the 'Most Visited' page are inactive. Select page  from bookmarks and nothing happens. This version does not appear to be  ready for prime time!     <b>Please provide
