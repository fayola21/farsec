<title>Issue 15933 -   chromium -    Keyboard layout not handled consistently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0~svn20090703r19907-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Linux Debian/unstable  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Compiz      1. Change the keyboard layout to something different than hardware (qwerty?  ). I use USA Dvorak layout with a regular QWERTY keyboard (enable with   &quot;setxkbmap dvorak&quot;  but make sure to have the layout handy:   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg</a>). For this   test it suffices that C and V are mapped to a different key on the   keyboard.  2. Go to www.google.com.  3. Enter some text in the search box in the page.  4. Select the text and try to copy and paste using keyboard bindings   (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V respectively).      The text can be copied and pasted.      It depends on the actual mapping  but basically Chrome user the hardware   (qwerty?) key instead of the mapped one. For instance  if your &quot;soft&quot; C key   is mapped to hardware key X  Ctrl-C (copy) will be interpreted as Ctrl-X   (cut).    It gets more confusing from here. Web applications that catch single-key   presses have different behavior. In GMail &quot;soft&quot; j/k go up and down the   mail list  as expected  however  on Google Reader &quot;soft&quot; j/k are   interpreted as the hardware (qwerty?) key instead.    This was working properly with version 3.0.190.0~svn20090617r18622-  0ubuntu1~ucd2~jaunty (the previous version I was running). I suspect the   fix for <a title="Dead keys and accents input not working" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11226"> issue #11226 </a> is the culprit (fix which otherwise is very welcome!).    Note that the URL bar and other widgets outside the page always works   properly. This is probably not surprising  since  for instance  <a title="Dead keys and accents input not working" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11226"> issue   #11226 </a> didn't affect the URL bar either. For example Ctrl-D (bookmark this   page) always seems to use the soft mapping. </pre>
