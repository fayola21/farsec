<title>Issue 7796 -   chromium -    CollapseWhitespace replaces ZWNJ with U+0020 (ascii space)  in the middle of a string  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> CollapseWhitespace replaces a sequence of 'whitespace characters' with a   single ascii space (U+0020).  It relies on IsWhitespace in string_util.cc    which in turn uses kWhitespaceWide to tell if a given character is   whitespace or not. kWhitespaceWide contains ZWNJ and replacing it with   U+0020 is problematic for some Arabic and Indian words.
