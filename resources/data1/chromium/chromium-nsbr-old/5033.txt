<title>Issue 5033 -   chromium -    The address box hint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;              Firefox 3: OK        I have viewed page: <a href="http://g.cn/music/;">http://g.cn/music/;</a> When I typed the url with &quot;music&quot;   again  the address-box did not pop the page hint. While it is OK in FF3    Could you improve it?     </pre>
