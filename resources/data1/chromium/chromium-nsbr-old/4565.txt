<title>Issue 4565 -   chromium -    can't scroll through long (100 000 line) files in chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  (Windows XP on Thinkpad T60)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  see attached           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 2: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open the attached file in Chrome.  (I tried this file as a text file   from local disk  as a URL served from Apache  and as an HTML file with a   giant &quot;PRE&quot; tag.  The result was the same in all cases.)    2. Wait for the circle cursor in the tab to stop spinning    3. Using the mouse  drag the scroll bar thumb downward to scroll through   the document.    4. Note that once you have dragged approximately 60% of the way down the   document  the scroll action is suddenly cancelled and the scroll thumb pops   back to the top of the document.  There is no way to reach the latter 40%   of the document.    5. For extra credit  drag the scroll thumb to the point immediately before   it would exhibit the above bug  and then use the Page Down key on the   keyboard to continue from there.  Note that after a few pages  the   scrollbar thumb vanishes  and the top arrow icon on the scroll bar turns   into a strange multi-colored pixel pattern.  See screenshot attached.      I should be able to scroll to the end of the file.      Scrollbar pops to the top of the file  and/or weird drawing bugs ensue.    I assume you're hitting some kind of out-of-range problem with the   scrollbar... good luck guys!     </pre>
