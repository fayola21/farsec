<title>Issue 15840 -   chromium -    iframe shims don't work if contained inside a div with absolute positioning. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33    Other browsers tested: IE7 IE8 FF3.5 Safari4 Chrome3.0(dev channel)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK     Chrome 3.x: FAIL      1. Open attached file.  (if you put file on a webserver  you'll need a new   maps API key)  2. See that the google logo doesn't show up through the iframe shim.         The google logo fails to appear.      It seems that if the plugin is contained in a &lt;div&gt; with absolute   positioning  the iframe shim does not work.  If you remove the absolute   positioning  the iframe shim works fine.     </pre>
