<title>Issue 275 -   chromium -    Cpanel 11 login does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm unable to use my shiny new chrome browswer to login to my Cpanel   control panel for my dedicated server. A quick check of my Firefox verified   that the Cpanel (version 11) does work properly with Firefox 3.0.1 and not   with Chrome.     My dedicated server control panel is at <a href="https://XX.XX.XX.XX:2087/">https://XX.XX.XX.XX:2087/</a> and using   my root user name and password I get:  Internal Server Error  Could not fetch uid or gid for : root        cpsrvd/11.18.3 Server at 69.65.40.70    whereas the same address with the same username and password gives me the   correct Cpanel.        </pre>
