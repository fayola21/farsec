<title>Issue 6964 -   chromium -    New issues with tab display while window is maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Short Tabs    1. Load this version of Chrome  2. Maximize the window  3. You should already see that the tops of the tabs are cut off.    The next issue I can't seem to reproduce reliably  but it's happened twice:    All of the names of the tabs and the favicons disappear and there are just   tiny tabs with a close button that appears when you hover over them.  I had   this happen twice  once with only five tabs open.    Neither of these issues were there until the last update.        I should be able to see the tops of the tabs line up with the top of the   screen  but instead the tops of the letters on the tab titles are hitting   the top of the screen.            Please provide
