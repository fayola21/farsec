<title>Issue 9268 -   chromium -    Linux: crash on invalid page id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. start up chrome  2. type any url in the omnibox  hit enter  3. press ctrl-t    this causes a crash on a NOTREACHED in navigation_controller.cc (nothing  noticeably bad happens in opt mode). It appears that the renderer is  sending back a bad page id (also  the active_contents_ reports a max page  id of 1  while entries_ is empty  which probably shouldn't happen).    The new tab navigation page id is 1. On windows  if you do the same  sequence of commands the page id for the new tab navigation is 2. </pre>
