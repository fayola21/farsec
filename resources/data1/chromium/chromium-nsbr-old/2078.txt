<title>Issue 2078 -   chromium -    rebuild ICU data file to include a minimum set of locale data for locales chrome is not localized to  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Add 'Ukrainian' to 'Accept-languages' list in Options | ... | Languages   2. Type '___�܁___��_____.com' in the omnibar          It should be rendered as it is.    Instead  punycode ('xn--....') shows up .      This is because we don't include the locale data for uk at all in our ICU  data file. We should include exemplar character set and some other minimal  data for locales listed in our accept-langauge menu.           </pre>
