<title>Issue 8941 -   chromium -    Failing layout test LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/web-apps/013.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We started failing this layout test once <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/41665">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/41665</a> landed.   The test is expecting the httpd server to return a status code of 400 with the text   'Good work'. 'Good Work' is coming from the cgi script 013-test.cgi. We are returning a   status code of 400  but the string 'Bad Request' instead of 'Good Work'. It looks like   lighthttpd always returns status text of 'Bad Request'  hence we now fail this. Prior   to 41665 the code ignored the returned string from the server and always returned 'OK'    which is why we passed it.    I've DEFERd this as while it's a new failure  our code is still doing the right thing.   We just need to find a way to get lighthttp to return the right thing. </pre>
