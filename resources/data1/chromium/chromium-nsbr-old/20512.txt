<title>Issue 20512 -   chromium -    crbug/Reitveld: Make it clearer which file I'm in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I always find it hard to find which file I'm in and which file comments apply to.    There are 2 problems here.    1. The document.title currently have the whole path so the filename usually gets cut   off. For example my tab shows 'chrome/browser/history/...'. It would be better if it   said 'download_types.h - chrome/browse...'    2. The URL to the page I'm currently viewing is something like   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/178001/diff/4064/3058#newcode568">http://codereview.chromium.org/178001/diff/4064/3058#newcode568</a>. It would be nice if   the URL contained the filename in it as well. (Mondrian has this and I'm used to   glancing at the address bar for this information).    This are probably just Reitveld bugs but I thought I would bring it up here first. </pre>
