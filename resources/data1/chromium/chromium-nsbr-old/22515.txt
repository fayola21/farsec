<title>Issue 22515 -   chromium -    Keyboard handling needs unit tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our keyboard handling is pretty complex by now  we should have some tests.    One suggestion by playmobil about testing the &quot;emacs shortcuts&quot; responder:   &quot;&quot;&quot;I don't know of any framework  but how about synthesizing an NSEvent   using the +[NSEvent keyEventWithType:...] method and then using that to test   the NSResponder subclass?&quot;&quot;&quot;   </pre>
