<title>Issue 16329 -   chromium -    Tab at bottom of popup window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - log into gmail  view inbox  - at bottom where it says &quot;last account activity&quot;  click the details button    Actual:  - inactive tab drawn at bottom of window.    This might be a side-effect/regression of the chroming popups work that jrg  recently landed. Not sure if we want to roll this into the bug that's  already open  but this is certainly an easy test case to reproduce bad  behavior. </pre>
