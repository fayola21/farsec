<title>Issue 14230 -   chromium -    Page action tooltips inconsistent with other tooltips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Page actions (and the SSL status padlock/warning icon) display tooltips in a   different style to other toolbar buttons  and with a different delay time.    They also take focus away from the window which is quite jarring.    This is on Windows XP - not sure about other platforms. </pre>
