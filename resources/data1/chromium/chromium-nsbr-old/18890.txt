<title>Issue 18890 -   chromium -    Unable to type into omnibar search engine with Chinese (Traditional  Taiwan) input method (IME) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Region/language options in control panel  keyboard/input   languages.  2. Add the keyboard input: Chinese (Traditional  Taiwan) - New Phonetic. (I   believe this is one of the default inputs in Chinese-Taiwan Windows.)  3. In Chrome  type in the omnibar the beginning of a website with a search   engine saved in Chrome  such as: &quot;books.googl&quot;  and then &quot;Press TAB to   search books.google.com&quot;  4. Ensure that the earlier input method (Chinese Taiwan New Phonetic) is   turned on  and begin to type.      Phonetic characters are expected to appear  followed by matching words.      The cursor flashes  and nothing happens.    <b>Please provide
