<title>Issue 16362 -   chromium -    about:config page (or something similar) needed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the past many feature requests ended up as &quot;wontfixes&quot; because chromium   developers didn't want to add another option in the options menu. Firefox   solved this with the about:config page with a huge amount of configureable   things. It would be perfect if this or something similar will get implemented   in the future.    However  keep on your good work! </pre>
