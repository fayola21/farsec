<title>Issue 2286 -   chromium -    Windows toolbar disappears after coming back from sleep - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open one or several Chrome windows  maximized.  2. Go to &quot;sleep&quot; in Windows.  3. Go back from sleep.      Everything should be like it was before sleep.      Chrome is &quot;over-maximized&quot;  hiding the toolbar. I have to &quot;unmaximize&quot; and   maximize back one or more Chrome windows  to normalize toolbar.    Please provide
