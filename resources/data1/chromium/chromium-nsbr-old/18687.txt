<title>Issue 18687 -   chromium -    GMail triage seems slow in McChrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I receive a lot of mail. I tend to scan the subject lines  select messages I don't   need to actually read then archive it in batches.    Flow:  - click some checkboxes  - click archive  - repeat    This flow is noticably laggy in Chrome 198.0 (Developer Build 22501)... I   press down on the archive button and it seems like 1/5-1/4rd of a second   before it presses down. </pre>
