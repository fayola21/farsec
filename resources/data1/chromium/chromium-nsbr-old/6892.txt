<title>Issue 6892 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behavior with &quot;most visited&quot; ranking algorithm. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1219309&gt;    [On clean profile or clearing browsing data]  --if user visits any three different webpages  then we start ranking them  as &quot;most visited&quot; webpages and even we continue ranking them as &quot;most  visited&quot; from now onwards.  --If user visits same page three times or visits 2 different pages  then we  don't rank them as most visited.    See the video for more info @ http://go/bug_videos/MostVisitedRankingAlg.avi    In the video you will also notice that  after step1 (I have 3 most visited   I will clear the profile)  then I will refresh (hitting refresh button) all  of them  then we don't rank them as most visited. The funny part is  when I  visit them in new tabs  then again we start ranking from count 3. </pre>
