<title>Issue 14142 -   chromium -    Autocomplete suggestions ought to elide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you type something really long into an input that uses autocomplete  then   the next time you start typing it the autocomplete popup can be absurdly   wide. We should elide the suggestions. This would require something like   text_elider.cc  but I couldn't find such a thing in webkit after poking   around a little. </pre>
