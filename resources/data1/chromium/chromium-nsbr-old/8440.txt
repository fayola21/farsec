<title>Issue 8440 -   chromium -    TODO: Check if 1xx needs to set message_body_length_ to 0. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From &lt;<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/40161">http://codereview.chromium.org/40161</a>&gt; wtc comments:    At least  we should find out why we have 205 here but don't  have 1xx.  Section 10.2.6 205 Reset Content says:      ... The response MUST NOT include an entity.    So I believe it is correct to have 205 here (no entity  seems to be stronger than no message-body).  So we just  need to find out if we should add 1xx here.     </pre>
