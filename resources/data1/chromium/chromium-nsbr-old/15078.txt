<title>Issue 15078 -   chromium -    Implement prefs that impact Google privacy policy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to implement the following privacy prefs:    - disabling the suggestion service (google suggest)  - disabling suggestions for navigation errors  - disabling DNS pre-fetching  - disabling phishing/malware  - changing cookie settings/restrictions  - disabling sending usage statistics (chrome-only)    They require forking the privacy policy for Mac and Win  so the faster we  fix these the better. </pre>
