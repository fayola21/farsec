<title>Issue 4480 -   chromium -    Duplicate Bookmark Entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Chrome browser with bookmarks being imported from Firefox.   2. Uninstall Chrome browser.  3. Re-install Chrome Browser and during installation I have chosen to   import Firefox bookmarks  as I did it in step 1.
