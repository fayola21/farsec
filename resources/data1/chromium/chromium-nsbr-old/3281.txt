<title>Issue 3281 -   chromium -     On Windows  Safari 3.1.2 and Chrome 0.2.149.30 both use the same user-agent string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   The URL is relevant only because that particular URL sticks the user-agent  string in an HTML comment in the page source.  1. Install Safari 3.1.2 on a Windows system.  2. Install Chrome 0.2.149.30 on the same system. I did it in this order   but I don't know whether that matters.  3. Both Safari and Chrome use the same user-agent string. I have seen both  the Safari user-agent string and the Chrome user-agent string used by both  browsers. I think after a reboot  the first of the two browsers to come up  defines the user-agent string used by both.      I expect Safari to have:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML   like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.21  and Chrome to have:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML   like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.30 Safari/525.13      They both have the same user-agent string. Which one they both have seems  to depend on which browser came up first after reboot  but I'm not sure of  that.    Please provide
