<title>Issue 5438 -   chromium -    Hebrew punctuation is deleted along with the letter itself - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33    <a href="http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/3682/chromepunctuation1jq7.jpg">http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/3682/chromepunctuation1jq7.jpg</a>  <a href="http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/3032/chromepunctuation2xa3.jpg">http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/3032/chromepunctuation2xa3.jpg</a>        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    1. Add Hebrew punctuation to Hebrew text and try to delete a punctuation   mark using the Backspace key.  2. OR Try to delete the letter itself instead while keeping the punctuation mark using the delete key.        chrome deletes the punctuation along with the letter itself (and vise   versa)  Have a look at the Images i made for this issue  should be a lot more   understandable than anything i can come up with in plain text.  <a href="http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/3682/chromepunctuation1jq7.jpg">http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/3682/chromepunctuation1jq7.jpg</a>  <a href="http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/3032/chromepunctuation2xa3.jpg">http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/3032/chromepunctuation2xa3.jpg</a>    Hebrew punctuation is added (in chrome too) this way:  1. While your keyboard input is set to Hebrew  2. Make sure the &quot;Caps Lock&quot; key is ON  3. Put the caret after the letter you would like to punctuate.  4. Hold the Shift key pressed.  5. Hit any of the keys from the ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+ line (the line on the   keyboard with the numbers...)  each key represent a different Hebrew punctuation mark.    The Omnibox BTW is working as it should  the deletion is only a problem   with text fields inside web pages </pre>
