<title>Issue 7980 -   chromium -    input box loses focus when embedded sound plays - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I have a page where first statement in body is an &lt;embed&gt; tag which causes   a sound to be played. &lt;embed src=&quot;&lt;?php print $strSoundFile; ?&gt;&quot;   hidden=&quot;true&quot; autostart=&quot;true&quot; mastersound&gt;    Last thing in the body is Javascript to set focus to input field on the   form.  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;   document.checkin_copy.part_tag.focus();  &lt;/script&gt;          The focus should be set on the input field and the sound should play.      The focus does initially go to the input field  but there's a slight delay   before the sound plays.  When the sound does play  focus is lost from the   input field and no field appears to have the focus.  The focus should stay   on the input field.      Please provide
