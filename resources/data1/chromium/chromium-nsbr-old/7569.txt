<title>Issue 7569 -   chromium -    Fix visual appearance of popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The recent frame changes have reverted the omnibox treatment for popups to   pre-magicbrowzr state. I know Glen said &quot;pre magic browzr dimensions are   correct&quot; but this is one deviance from that. The pre-magic browzr popup   toolbar was ad-hoc rather than being explicitly designed that way. Glen and   I would like the post-magic-browzr appearance restored. </pre>
