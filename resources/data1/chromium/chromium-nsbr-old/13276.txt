<title>Issue 13276 -   chromium -    DNS prefetch needs congestion avoidance  and a priority queue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On some systems  DNS resolution can be very slow  and our action to perform   DNS prefetching can negatively impact the system.  One such example is   where a user has a 5MB file for /etc/hosts  and that file is read   &quot;regularly&quot; by the OS after some(?) number of resolutions.    It is a waste of time to try to pre-resolve sub-resource names if a large   queue delays the resolution.  Such names are needed VERY quickly (during   the resolution or fetching of the parent resource).  To facilitate this  we   need to put speculative names (example: names found on a page that a user   might click on) in a low priority queue  and we need subresource names to   be placed in a high priority queue.    When we see that a system is getting congested and a large backlog of names   are held by the prefetch system  we should discard the present queue (other   than names that are currently being resolved).  This will tend to cause   laggard systems to do less thrashing with long queues attempting to resolve   names long after they are useful.       </pre>
