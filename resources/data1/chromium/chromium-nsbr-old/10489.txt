<title>Issue 10489 -   chromium -    Layout test regression from WebKit merge 42403:42440 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test fails:    chrome/fast/dom/messageport-gc.html    It is probably because the MessageChannel constructor binding got moved into   ENABLE_CHANNEL_MESSAGING by <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42428">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42428</a>  so we no   longer generate it in the v8 bindings.    In which case  it is just a matter of turning on that define. </pre>
