<title>Issue 4112 -   chromium -    Crash in InstallUtil::IsPerUserInstall if install directory is too short - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you put Chrome in a very short directory such as &quot;c:a&quot;  it will crash  on startup. The offending code is:        if (std::equal(program_files_path_copy.begin()                      program_files_path_copy.end()  exe_path_copy.begin()                      CaseInsensitiveCompare&lt;wchar_t&gt;())) {    std::equal assumes the exe_path_copy is at least as long as the input sequence. </pre>
