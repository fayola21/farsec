<title>Issue 3677 -   chromium -    Constrained HTTP Auth dialogs seem to break tab switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a page  2. Open another page that uses HTTP auth in a new tab.  3. Switch to the first page.  4. Switch back.    The first page is displayed in the second tab instead of the tab with the   auth showing. Switching back and forth fixes this.    I am filling this because I'm currently ripping out the constrained window   implementation and I want to note that this isn't a regression caused by   me. </pre>
