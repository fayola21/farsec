<title>Issue 11737 -   chromium -    Explorer &quot;Tile Windows&quot; commands do not work with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a couple Chrome windows on your desktop  2. right-click the taskbar and select &quot;Tile Windows Horizontally&quot; or &quot;Tile   Windows Vertically&quot;  3. Nothing happens.  Its as though Chrome isn't responding to the messages   being sent when you use this command.  Note that I tested this with other   apps on the same machine (Windows Explorer  Thunderbird  IE) and it worked   so its likely not a machine issue.                  <b>Please provide
