<title>Issue 833 -   chromium -    Could not create a second application shortcut with www.titook.net for a different URI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to www.titook.net  2. Create an application shortcut for www.titook.net  3. Shortcut is created successfully (<a href="http://www.titook.net/index.php">http://www.titook.net/index.php</a>)  4. Now select the Favorites Button   5. URL <a href="http://www.titook.net/ws/rest/bookmark">http://www.titook.net/ws/rest/bookmark</a> is reached and you could view   the online favorites  6. Create an application shortcut this URL  7. NO application shortcut is created!?        We expect to see the second appication shortcut created on the Windows   Desktop.      What happens is that Google Gear is open and allow us to create the   shortcut.  The Title seems to indicate the same one as the first   application shortcut (titOOk.net website).  No error message is displayed   however we don't see a second shortcut create for the second   URL:<a href="http://www.titook.net/ws/rest/bookmark">http://www.titook.net/ws/rest/bookmark</a> .      Actually  we tried with other URI within this web application and get the   same result.    Please provide
