<title>Issue 4472 -   chromium -    JComboBox doesn't work in an Applet - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9    Other browsers tested: IE           IE 7: OK      1. Create Java Applet with JComboBox with for example two values to select.  2. Run html page with that applet.  3. Try to select value in JComboBox with mouse.      You are able to select value in JComboBox using mouse.      You are not able to select any value  because focus is lost as only someone   clicks on poped up drop down list.     </pre>
