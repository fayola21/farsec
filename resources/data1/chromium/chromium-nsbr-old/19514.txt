Open the URL.  2. Hover over the User / Forum / View div.  3. A hidden menu apperas right below the div from #2.  4. Now zoom in or out.  5. Repeat step #2. The hidden menu is misplaced.      The hidden menu should be properly placed.      The hidden menu is misplaced.    Note:  dpr1.jpg is normal font size  dpr2.jpg is zoomed in.    The site uses Javascript to determine the exact location of the hidden   menu. It seems that something is wrong on the Chrome scaling calculation. </pre>
