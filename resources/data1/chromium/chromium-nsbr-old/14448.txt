<title>Issue 14448 -   chromium -    Allow extensions to store additional information with bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.187.1 (Official Build 18142)    As an extension developer  I'd love to be able to store additional  information with a bookmark.  For example  if I wanted to create an  extension that adds tags or a description to Chrome's bookmarks  that data  needs to go somewhere.  Additionally  I think that most bookmark related  extensions will have some notion of a bookmark ID that they'll want to persist.    Currently I don't think it's possible to associate data with with a  bookmark.  We can't use the bookmark's Chrome ID and local storage (when  it's available) to store information since the Chrome ID aren't persisted  across browser sessions.  And there's no API to add custom fields to  existing bookmarks.    An API to add custom fields to the bookmarks would certainly make life  easy  but really any way that we can reliably associate data with a  bookmark will solve the problem.   </pre>
