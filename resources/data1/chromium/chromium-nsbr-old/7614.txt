<title>Issue 7614 -   chromium -    Crazy tab ordering for find box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the find box.    Hit shift-tab several times.  Note that focus simply toggles between the   textfield and the close box  never reaching anywhere else.    Now hit tab several times.  Note that after the close box  focus next moves   to the location bar (instead of the webpage)  and after that  no amount of   tabbing (or shift-tabbing) will return focus to the find box.    Side note: I find it bizarre that the find box close button is in the tab   order  but the tab and window close buttons aren't.  I'd prefer the find   box' wasn't either. </pre>
