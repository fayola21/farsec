<title>Issue 19611 -   chromium -    Investigate and possibly remove extra call to URLRequestJob::Kill in URLRequest::OrphanJob - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Investigate and possibly remove extra call to URLRequestJob::Kill in   URLRequest::OrphanJob    It looks like PrepareToRestart also calls Kill  so the call to Kill in   OrphanJob is redundant.  Perhaps one of the Kills should be removed. </pre>
