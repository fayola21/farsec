<title>Issue 15360 -   chromium -    Impl Show Cookies dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For prefs  we need the &quot;show cookies&quot; dialog to allow users to search and  manage cookies. Not required for beta or to make legal happy about our  privacy policy.    I'd like to do a cookie dialog more akin to Safari and Camino (table with  multiple columns) rather than a separate table/detail view like winChrome  and Firefox. That doesn't feel very Mac-like  but Im sure will require more  UI review scrutiny.    Adding helpWanted since this is probably something someone could pick up as  a good first UI bug. It's entirely self-contained. </pre>
