<title>Issue 19726 -   chromium -    Find bar width doesn't change on theme change. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing bug since you requested it.    When changing themes  it looks like the preferred width of the bar isn't   being updated. I'm assuming it has something to do with having a GtkFixed in   a GtkFixed plus other hackery around this area.    estade: &quot;Also note in the bug the label text is too low and the entry text   is too high.&quot; </pre>
