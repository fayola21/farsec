<title>Issue 23110 -   chromium -    Add chrome:// URLs to History if typed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It'd be nice to allow chrome:// URLs to go into history (see <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=27131">r27131</a>)  but we   need to only do that if they've been TYPED.  Unfortunately right now the   whole UI uses TYPED as a default transition  which doesn't work well.  We   need a new transition type like UI_ACTION. </pre>
