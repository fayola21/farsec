<title>Issue 5928 -   chromium -    Password manager is slow to appear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : Any website with a login form            Firefox 3: OK        1. Log into a site (you havent logged into before).  2. The prompt for saving the password takes a while to appear  it seems it   appears after all the page content loads.      The password manager should appear instantly after logging in  so that   actions can be taken on the page as quickly as possible (e.g. If you want   it to remember the password  but also need to navigate somewhere quickly    you must wait for the password manager box to drop down before you can go   anywhere).      The password manager appears to load only after all the page content loads.       </pre>
