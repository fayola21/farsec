<title>Issue 19021 -   chromium -    No longer getting memory data for Mac renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?</a>  builder=Mac10.5%20Perf    Starting with build 2033 (when the renderer bundle landed)  we stopped   getting memory data for the renderer.  This means we're currently not   tracking data for size regressions  etc.   </pre>
