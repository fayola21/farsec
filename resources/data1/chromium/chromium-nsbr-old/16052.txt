<title>Issue 16052 -   chromium -    Tab closes  if a new url is navigated on page loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19942">r19942</a>)    -Navigate to a page which takes longer time to load. While page is loading    navigate to different page.    Before the 2nd page rendering is committed  the tab closes. If you have   single tab opened  then browser window closes in this case.    Marking this as DEV release blocker.    PS: this happens to me consistently.  </pre>
