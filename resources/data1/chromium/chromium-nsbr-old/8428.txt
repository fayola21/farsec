<title>Issue 8428 -   chromium -    Focus is not given to the address bar when opening a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10987)  OS : Windows Vista 64bit with Aero enabled.      1. Open a new tab      The address bar is given focus for easy and quick searching in a new tab or   specifying a new address.      I don't know which part gets the focus but it's not the address bar.    NOTE: I don't report bugs often enough  please tell me if this report is good   enough  thanks! </pre>
