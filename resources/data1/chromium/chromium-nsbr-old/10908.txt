<title>Issue 10908 -   chromium -    Verify SSL certificates and handle SSL certificate errors in SSLClientSocketMac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SSLClientSocketMac is relying on SecureTransport to verify certificates.  We need to verify certificates ourselves so that we can allow users to  accept bad certificates.    In <a title="Implement and use SSLClientSocket::ReconnectIgnoringLastError" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3006"> issue 3006 </a>  Markus added a new member allowed_bad_certs_ to  the SSLConfig structure.  SSLClientSocketMac can use the new  ssl_config_.allowed_bad_certs_ member when handling SSL certificate  errors. </pre>
