<title>Issue 18402 -   chromium -    Cannot use Ctrl+I in Japanese IME on Omnibox for adding more texts. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22377">r22377</a>    OS version               : 10.5.7            1. Input a word (Japanese or English) on Omnibox.  2. After that word  input a Japanese word with IME on  then press Ctrl+I to convert uncommitted characters to   Katakana.        By Pressing Ctrl+I  uncommited characters should be converted to Katakana and committed.      Uncommitted characters are committed without conversion to Katakana.  In fact  it happens by pressing just control key. So I cannot use other shortcuts like Ctrl+U  Ctrl+O.    By the way  this issue does not happen for input texts in web pages. And this does not happen when there is no text   Omnibox. It happens only in Omnibox with some text inputted.    This is annoying. Please fix this. </pre>
