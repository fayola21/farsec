<title>Issue 131 -   chromium -    Lots of links on facebook.com don't work  including friends display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. login to a facebook user account &quot;friends&quot; page   <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/friends/">http://www.new.facebook.com/friends/</a>  2. The page defaults to showing &quot;Status Updates&quot; with options   for &quot;Recently Updated&quot; &quot;Phonebook&quot; and &quot;Everyone&quot;  3. Selecting any of the other options results in no change.    What is the expected result? A different selection of friends should be   displayed    Also - this was tested on the &quot;new facebook&quot; screen - the switch to the   old one doesn't appear to do anything  although switching from old to new   does work.            Please provide
