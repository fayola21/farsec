<title>Issue 10746 -   chromium -    Default Browser Chrome can't open profile or any other links from Windows Live Messenger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	2.1.169.6 (Developer Build 12463)  WebKit	530.1  V8	1.0.3.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.1 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.1.169.6 Safari/530.1                     IE 8: OK      (Ensure Chrome is default browser)  1. Download latest Windows live messenger (One I had was 14.0.8064.206)  2. Login using valid ID to live messenger  3. Right click on any contact and try to launch profile of any contact      Chrome should launch profile page of contact      Chrome window doesn't show up (i.e. link is not opened)    IE 8 works perfectly fine if IE is set as default browser. So this has to   do with chrome being default browser here.   </pre>
