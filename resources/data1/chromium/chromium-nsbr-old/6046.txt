<title>Issue 6046 -   chromium -    Alt+F4 should close the App windnow. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.156.0 (Developer Build 7591)    Looks like the App window is not grabbing keyboard focus as soon as it is  launched.      1. Install Google home page as app shortcut.  2. Launch the app shortcut[DON'T click any where on the app window.]  3. Press Alt +F4 to close the window.    What is the expected output?   Alt+f4 fails to close the window.    What do you see instead?  The window remains opened. If user clicks on the rendered page  then it  works fine.         </pre>
