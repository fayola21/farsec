<title>Issue 9244 -   chromium -    Single process mode is broken on Mac and linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Launch chrome with the --single-process command line flag  2. Navigate to any web page  3. Notice that nothing renders for Mac  and apparently segfaults on linux    This mode has been particularly useful for me when debugging from WebKit to   the browser and back  so I think it's worth some time figuring out what   broke. </pre>
