<title>Issue 9531 -   chromium -    Cannot get reference in one window to another window eventhough both originate from the same domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;               Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. open a web page at example.com/a.html (��_��_��_Window A��_��_��_)  which has javascript  that sets the window��_��_��_s name to ��_��_��_window_a��_��_��_ using window.name = ��_��_��_window_a��_��_��_  2. open another web page in a new tab or window at example.com/b.html  (��_��_��_Window B��_��_��_)  3. Window B contains javascript that tries to access Window A��_��_��_s DOM as follows:    -----------------  var window_a = open(''  'window_a');    if(window_a &amp;&amp; window_a.location.href.indexOf('http') &gt;= 0){  	alert(��_��_��_have access��_��_��_);  }else{  	alert(��_��_��_no access��_��_��_);  }    -----------------        alert('have access') fires      alert(��_��_��_no access��_��_��_) fires      This code above fails to get access to Window A��_��_��_s DOM.  It is successful in  other browsers (Firefox  IE  etc).  The only time this code is successful  is when there��_��_��_s a link in Window A that opens Window B in a new window or  tab.  If you open Window B in a new tab or window manually  the code fails.    There are next generation web applications that use a bookmarklet to  transfer data from one window to another  which cannot be used in Chrome  due to this issue.   </pre>
