<title>Issue 6782 -   chromium -    Don't default to navigate for numeric input of previously-visited IPs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Numeric input defaults to navigating when it converts to a dotted quad that   the user has visited before.  I think this is probably wrong and only   dotted quads should have this behavior; numeric input should always search.   </pre>
