<title>Issue 22557 -   chromium -    Clipping issue with extension shelf when detached on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The horizontal clipping of the extension shelf (when detached on the NTP)   isn't working properly when you resize the browser window.    I was going to tackle this as a part of the overflow solution  but now that   is on hold I thought I should separate this out.     I have a fix already.   </pre>
