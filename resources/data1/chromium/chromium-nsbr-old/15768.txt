<title>Issue 15768 -   chromium -    Linux: short drag/release on New Tab page leaves browser UI stuck in drag mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.191.0~svn20090630r19587-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version: 2.6.28-13-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 2 07:55:09 UTC 2009   x86_64 GNU/Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager: GNOME      1. Open a new tab  2. Drag one of the mini page previews for a very short distance and time    dropping it onto itself. Happens to me when a jittery click goes awry.      Browser returns to normal.      Browser remains in drag mode  locking up the entire GNOME UI until I kill   the chromium-browser process from a text-only console.    I cannot reproduce this consistently  but I managed at least twice in a   row.    (OTOH  kudos for making the crash restore also restore this here textbox -   I tried to reproduce just now and had to kill the browser again. :) </pre>
