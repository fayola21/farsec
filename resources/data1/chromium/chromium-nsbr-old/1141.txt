<title>Issue 1141 -   chromium -    Session saving/loading - enhancement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please create the ability to save and load sessions; I find that to be an   invaluable tool in Opera and Firefox. I frequently read through large   amounts of webcomics  and the ability to save sessions helps immensely.   Also  in the remote event of a full browser crash  saving the last known   session state (saved automatically every x minutes) can come in handy. </pre>
