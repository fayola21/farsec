<title>Issue 9409 -   chromium -    Application shortcut error when --user-data-dir command flag is used. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (Official Build 12323)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Start up Chrome/Chromium in a new user profile via the --user-data-dir   command flag.  2. Create an application shortcut for a web service (eg. Gmail).  3. Open the newly created application shortcut.      The newly created shortcut should open the web application in Chrome's   application window.      The resulting shortcut opens up a Chrome window with multiple tabs filled   with erroneous URLs.    Additional details:  The problem seems to be with the target properties of the application   shortcut that was created. When I checked  I saw the following line in the   target properties of the created application shortcut:    &quot;C:Documents and SettingsUserLocal SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; --user-data-dir=C:Documents and   SettingsUserLocal SettingsApplication DataGoogleChromeUser   DataNew_Profile--app=<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail">https://mail.google.com/mail</a>    I was able to fix the issue by editing the target properties to:    &quot;C:Documents and SettingsUserLocal SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; --  app=<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail">https://mail.google.com/mail</a>    Note that only the --user-data-dir command flag causes the issue  other   command flags don't seem to affect the application shortcuts at all. </pre>
