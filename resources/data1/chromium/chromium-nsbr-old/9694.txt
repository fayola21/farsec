<title>Issue 9694 -   chromium -    Show calculator results inline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We already have a way of knowing (in search_provider.cc) that some returned   suggestion is a calculator result.  Instead of displaying this like a   suggestion we should display it inline  in gray  unselectable text  a la   mocks today.    From a technical level  it may actually be easier to do this using a second   edit control  just so that we don't have issues like ctrl-a/drag   selection/etc. doing the wrong thing (we can simply forward those events over   to the first edit as we already do with other events in pieces of the   location bar). </pre>
