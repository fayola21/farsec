<title>Issue 14058 -   chromium -    Browser Ball behaving oddly in OS X Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load the page and start the experiment  2. Create some child windows   3. Resize and move the windows around      The ball moves between windows based on them occupying a space   dictated by the screen. IE the ball occupies a position on the screen  and   all browser windows that overlap that space display the ball.      The ball behaves as if each window is another copy of the same space  so if   the ball is in the top left of one window  it will be at the top left of every   window regardless of where on the screen each window is.    <b>Please provide
