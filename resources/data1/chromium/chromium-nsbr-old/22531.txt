<title>Issue 22531 -   chromium -    tools menu gets obscured when at top of bottom monitor. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Use two monitors  using TwinView in xorg.conf  with one monitor positioned   above the other. Put browser window at top edge of bottom window. Click on   the tool or page control icons on location bar.       The menu of options opens up and is completely visible  preferably   stretching down below the point where it was clicked  or alternatively   stretching up  crossing the fold between the two monitors.       The menu that opens opens above the cursor  stretching up. However at the   point where the two monitors meet it does not continue scrolling up into   the top monitor  but gets cut off.       <b>Please provide
