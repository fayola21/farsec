<title>Issue 12356 -   chromium -    DCHECK while browsing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With today's svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=16486">r16486</a>  I got a DCHECK during a long session:    [21401:21401:2593148050437:FATAL:src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/web_cache_manager.cc(363)]   Check failed: elmt != stats_.end().     Peeking at the code  elmt-&gt;second gets dereferenced shortly  after the DCHECK  which I think would turn into a crash on release  builds. </pre>
