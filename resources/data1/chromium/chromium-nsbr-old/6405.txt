<title>Issue 6405 -   chromium -    Status bubble annoying when trying to click on download shelf button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. download a file  2. do some sort of operation that triggers the status bubble to appear  3. move the mouse over the download button on the download shelf        Notice how the status bubble slides down to obscure the download button. If   you move the mouse over the download button the status bubble should snap   back up.       </pre>
