<title>Issue 14262 -   chromium -    [bankhapoalim.co.il]: bankhapoalim.co.il - encoding wrong on the &quot;wrong user/password&quot; page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: bankhapoalim.co.il Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?  Some of the text is shown in Hebrew  but with the wrong encoding so it   renders in reverse (think &quot;gnorw si drowssap rouy&quot;  but in Hebrew). This is   a common issue with &quot;logical&quot; vs &quot;visual&quot; ordering of the letters in RTL   languages.  The automatically selected encoding is &quot;Hebrew (ISO-8859-8)&quot;. Manually   selecting &quot;Hebrew (ISO-8859-8-I)&quot; or &quot;Hebrew (windows-1255)&quot; fixes the   wrong text  but then the text that was originally ok is now reversed.          What is the expected result?    The correct encoding to be selected  and probably all text should use the   same encoding on the page.           What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="https://www.bankhapoalim.co.il/">https://www.bankhapoalim.co.il/</a>  2. fill in random username  ID number and password on the 3 boxes on the   right (in some cases a JS verification is popping up an alert  probably if   the entered strings are too short).  3. Resulting page has the issue  see attached screenshot.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  FF3.0 is worse - it selects a wrong encoding all together  most text   appears as boxes and '?'  including the page title. Selecting the encodings   manually as above has the same effect as in chrome.  Safari 4.0 - same as Chrome.        Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
