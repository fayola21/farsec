<title>Issue 21509 -   chromium -    regression: clicking links from sync setup dialog opens inside dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Clicking on any link from within the sync setup dialog  such as the '?' link displayed when invalid   credentials are entered  used to open the link in a new tab.  I just tried this (@<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25857">r25857</a>) and it opens   inside the dialog  which looks horrible.      This was likely caused by a non-sync related CL to infrastructure  but I have no clue what yet... </pre>
