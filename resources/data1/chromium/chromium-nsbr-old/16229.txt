<title>Issue 16229 -   chromium -    Custom frame context menu should show same thing as title bar context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3 (Official Build 19935)  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : Metacity      1. Open chrome  enable custom frame  2. Right click on frame  note the list of options  3. Disable custom frame and right click on title bar  note list of options      Things like minimize  maximize  close  resize  always on top  always on   visible workspace  etc etc should be in the menu on the custom frame      Only a few chrome specific items are present    This is similar to <a title="&quot;Always on top&quot; with custom frame" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13495"> issue 13495 </a> (and would solve it at least for metacity   and probably kwin)  but I don't like that that is a feature request. I   think the behavior on Linux should be like the behavior on Windows here  if   possible. </pre>
