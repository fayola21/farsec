<title>Issue 7114 -   chromium -    Multiple SSLClientSocketTest are disabled. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug was originally filed by maruel:      A unit test can't access the outside world.      SSLClientSocketTest.Connect/Read/Read_SmallChunks/Interrupted    are all accessing bugs.webkit.org. When the site goes offline     like it did on the morning of September 02 2008  we are all    staring at which change caused the failure.    dank already has a CL under review to fix this:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/16207/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/16207/show</a> </pre>
