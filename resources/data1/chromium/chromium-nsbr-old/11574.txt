<title>Issue 11574 -   chromium -    Drag &amp; drop download link allowed  but nothing happens - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.172.18  Chromium 2.0.178.0 (Developer Build 15411)        1. Open Downloads page.  2. Drag a download link and drop it on the content area of another Chrome  window.    What is the expected output?     File associated with link should be opened. Alternatively  the drop could  be disallowed.  Please note that if you try to perform the same operation  from the download shelf  it is disallowed.  Ideally  the behavior would be  consistent across the Downloads page and the Download shelf.    What do you see instead?    The drop is allowed  but nothing happens.   </pre>
