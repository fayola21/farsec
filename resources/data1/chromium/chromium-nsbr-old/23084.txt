<title>Issue 23084 -   chromium -    extensions that contain files or directories that start with an underscore will crash the browser when they're installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We disallow leading underscores in filenames in directories since they're   reserved names.  However  this should simply cause the extension to fail to   load.  It seems to lead to a crash.  Here's the stack:     	chrome.dll!scoped_ptr&lt;Extension&gt;::operator-&gt;()  Line 93 + 0x19   bytes	C++  &gt;	chrome.dll!CrxInstaller::CompleteInstall()  Line 248 + 0x15 bytes	  C++   	chrome.dll!DispatchToMethod&lt;CrxInstaller void (__thiscall   CrxInstaller::*)(void)&gt;(CrxInstaller * obj=0x137a3300  void (void)*   method=0x5b5df180  const Tuple0 &amp; arg={...})  Line 412 + 0xb bytes	C++   	chrome.dll!RunnableMethod&lt;CrxInstaller void (__thiscall   CrxInstaller::*)(void) Tuple0&gt;::Run()  Line 307 + 0x1e bytes	C++    and the code:    std::string error;    extension_.reset(extension_file_util::LoadExtension(version_dir  true                                                         &amp;error));    DCHECK(error.empty());  &gt;&gt;  extension_-&gt;set_location(install_source_);      Apparently error_ is not empty and extension_ is NULL.  It looks like some   code is failing to properly report the failure since CompleteInstall   shouldn't be called on error. </pre>
