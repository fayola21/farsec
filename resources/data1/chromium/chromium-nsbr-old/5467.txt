<title>Issue 5467 -   chromium -    Strange delay when reusing a tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab  2. Go to any site  it comes up immediately  3. In the same tab  go to a different site.  Approximately 30 second delay   before any actions take place.      - Pages should load immediately  just as they do when I open a new tab and   type in a URL.      - If I have already visited any other site  typing in a new URL results in   a 20-30 second delay before any noticeable activity.    Please provide
