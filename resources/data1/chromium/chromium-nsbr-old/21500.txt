<title>Issue 21500 -   chromium -    drop 'NN' (version number) from the name of the ICU data dll name  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The icu data dll on Windows has 'NN' (the version number suffix). We used   to have 'icudt38.dll' hard-coded in many places (chrome  sqlite  googleurl   and build files  bot scripts). While upgrading to ICU 4.2  I removed all of   them in C++/C files with ICU's version number macro. However  there are   still some left in gyp and slave scripts.     It'd be a maintenance headache (see <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/200074">http://codereview.chromium.org/200074</a>).     Because we will never have two versions of ICU data dll around in Chrome    there's no point of having the version number suffix.            </pre>
