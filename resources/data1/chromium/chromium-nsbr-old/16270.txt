<title>Issue 16270 -   chromium -    Mac RTL: Should implement &quot;Writing Direction&quot; context menu for web page input box; disable it or make it work correctly for Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 193.0 (Developer Build 20177)     OS: Mac OS X 10.5.7    Other Browsers:      Webkit: OK  Firefox3.5: OK         IE8: N/A    Steps:  1. Launch Chrome on Mac  2. Right click inside the Omnibox  3. Select &quot;Writing Direction -&gt; Right to Left&quot;     &gt;&gt;The cursor should jump to the right of Omnibox now  4. Switch input language to Hebrew  5. Type some Hebrew letter into Omnibox  6. Observe  7. Navigate to any webpage which has an input box  say  google.com  8. Right click inside the input box  9. Observe    Results:  Step6: We implement &quot;Writing Direction&quot; menu for Chrome UI input box  but   it doesn't work correctly  the Hebrew letter typed in this step jumped to   the left of Omnibox    Step9: We didn't implement &quot;Writing Direction&quot; menu yet for web page input   box    Expected:  Step6: I am not sure if we really want to enable &quot;Writing Direction&quot; menu   for Omnibox  if yes  it should work correctly.    Please not that  even though Safari also implement &quot;Writing Direction&quot; menu   when you right-click URL box and the search box  the correspnoding sub-  menus are actually disabled.    Step9: We should implement &quot;Writing Direction&quot; menu for web page input box   where it is more necessary    Notes:  For Firefox  after set bidi.browser.ui = true via about:config:    1. It will add a sub-menu &quot;Switch Text Direction&quot; when right-click a web   page input box rather than URL box    2. It will also add this sub-menu under &quot;Edit&quot; menu  and it works for both   web page input box and browser UI input box </pre>
