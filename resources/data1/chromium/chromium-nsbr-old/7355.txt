<title>Issue 7355 -   chromium -    JSON objects are Changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi    I got a json object like:    var imgs = {  &quot;400&quot;: {&quot;img&quot;:&quot;400x200.gif&quot;  &quot;alt&quot;  &quot;meh&quot;}   &quot;200&quot;: {&quot;img&quot;:&quot;400x200.gif&quot;  &quot;alt&quot;  &quot;meh&quot;}  };      But  the thing is that when i:    for (img in this.imgs)  alert (&quot;img&quot;);    Firefox  IEs  Opera  Safari and most of browsers returs:  1st: 400  2nd: 200    Great!     But Chrome:  1st: 200  2nd: 400    :(    I assume that Chrome orders it (but by conecept JSON isn't an array.. and   isn't &quot;orderable&quot; ... This is a BUG? ).      *cheers* </pre>
