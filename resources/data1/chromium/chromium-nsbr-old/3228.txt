<title>Issue 3228 -   chromium -    Each ViewHost message is filtered twice in the I/O thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SyncChannel::SyncContext::OnMessageReceived calls TryFilters at the   beginning. If this fails  it falls through to the end and it calls to the   superclass Context::OnMessageReceived. Context::OnMessageReceived calls   TryFilters *again*.    This is unnecessary and we get a boatload of IPC messages  and they all   have to go through this large switch statement twice. It would be really   nice if this only happened once. </pre>
