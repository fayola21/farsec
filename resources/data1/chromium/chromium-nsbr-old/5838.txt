<title>Issue 5838 -   chromium -    Recently closed tabs: drag and drop Window( ) entry on Desktop creates non-functional Internet Shortcut - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 1.0.156.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7453">r7453</a>)    Repro  -----  1. Add multiple tabs to a browser window and load pages in these tabs.  2. Click Close button on title bar (NOT on tab) to close the window.  3. Open a New Tab. Note the Window( ) entry corresponding to the window  just closed.  4. From Recently Closed section  drag Window( ) entry and drop on Windows  Desktop.    An Internet Shortcut is created with URL=chrome://new-tab/window. When  double-clicked  a warning pops up  &quot;Unable to open this Internet Shortcut.  The protocol &quot;chrome&quot; does not have a registered program.&quot;    The only expected action that makes sense in this context is to open a  Chrome browser window with multiple tabs.    SUGGESTIONS    Either:  1. Register the &quot;chrome&quot; protocol with Windows and associate it with  Chrome.  Then alter the URL to include a list of URLs to tell Chrome what  pages to open  or  2. Disallow the drop onto the Desktop.    Choice #2 is probably sufficient  but choice #1 would provide a  functionality consistent with dragging a Single Tab entry to the Desktop.   </pre>
