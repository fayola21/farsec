<title>Issue 8127 -   chromium -    Remove extra language under &quot;Spell-checker options&quot; context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Beta and Dev builds issue  no this feature on Stable build yet.    Build: 2.0.164.1  (Official Build 10303)         2.0.167.0  (Developer Build 10433)     OS: Any    Other Browsers:    Safari: N/A  Firefox3: N/A       IE7: N/A    Steps:  1. Launch Dutch Chrome  2. Observe the default accept-language list  there will be four items   there: (I translated them back to English)     Dutch (Dutch)     Dutch      English (United State)     English  3. Go to a text box which has &quot;Spell-checker options&quot; context menu enabled  4. Observe    Result:  Under &quot;Spell-checker options&quot; context menu  there will be three items:  English (United State)  Dutch   Dutch (Dutch)    Hmm  is Dutch necessary here?    Expected:  Remove Dutch since we actually mean Dutch (Dutch) here I think.    Notes:  If we decide to remove it  perhaps  we also need to check other languages    I just checked German which has the same problem. </pre>
