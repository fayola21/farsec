<title>Issue 15759 -   chromium -    Worker process does not get killed when GC collects the Worker object in the renderer. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repro:    1. download  attached files  load test.html in Chrome  2. Click 'Create worker' button. This creates a worker but does not keep  the reference around so it's eligible for GC.  3. Observe the worker process created.  4. (Optional) Attach to renderer process and set breakpoint to  Worker::~Worker() to see when a worker is destroyed.  5. Click &quot;Create lots of strings&quot; button  maybe more then once - to cause  GC to happen. The ~Worker() is executed.    However  the worker process is still around. It should be terminated.       </pre>
