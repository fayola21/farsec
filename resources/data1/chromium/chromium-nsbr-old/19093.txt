<title>Issue 19093 -   chromium -    Per-tab sheets should be movable between windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Requires changing GTMWindowSheetController to support this  then hooking   up the change in chromium  and then enabling tab-dragging and fullscreen   mode for tabs with sheets again.    Probably not very urgent  as people probably don't keep sheets around for a   long time  and won't notice that tabs with sheets have some stuff diabled. </pre>
