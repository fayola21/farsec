<title>Issue 19326 -   chromium -    Video control UI does not go away if video is paused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. play a video with controls. ie  <a href="http://fbarchard-v64.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/index.html">http://fbarchard-v64.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/index.html</a>  2. pause  3. move mouse off screen    the controls do not go away  expected the controls to go away.    tested in both beta and todays build build.  safari is the same.  firefox makes the control fade out.    its not clear if this was intentional in webkit  but I would prefer the   controls go away  because sometimes I pause in order to look closely at a   frame and the controls cover part of the video.   </pre>
