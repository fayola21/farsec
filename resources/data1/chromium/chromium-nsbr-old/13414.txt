<title>Issue 13414 -   chromium -    chrome-amd64 on linux is linked against a 32-bit libgconf-2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The 64-bit version of the developer snapshot of Chrome/Linux that was just  released was linked with a 32-bit version of libgconf-2.  The following  errors are encountered on Fedora 11 for x86_64 (after converting the .deb  to a .rpm using alien):    ./chrome: error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4: cannot  open shared object file: No such file or directory    Forcing it to link with libgconf-2.so.4 in /usr/lib64 using LD_LIBRARY_PATH  gives an error about wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64.  The problem is remedied  by parallel-installing the 32-bit rpms for gconf2  ORBit and libIDL  after  which Chrome starts fine.    The same issue was mentioned as one of the problems in <a title="Linux snapshots don't work on Fedora" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12562"> issue 12562 </a>  but  this particular problem probably deserves its own issue.   </pre>
