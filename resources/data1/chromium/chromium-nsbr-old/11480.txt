<title>Issue 11480 -   chromium -    Support GTK keyboard themes (emacs keybindings) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GTK lets the user specify keyboard bindings via their config file.

It's probably a lot of work to  but optimistically you could imagine   hooks to convert a keystroke into an editing command and we could send the   editing commands over IPC. </pre>
