<title>Issue 17573 -   chromium -    New Tab page missing bookmarks bar  bookmark related info - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: chromium-3.0.195.0-0.1.20090720svn21073.fc11.i586  v8-  1.2.14-1.20090720svn2510.fc11.i586  OS + version: Fedora 11  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32bit  window manager: Metacity    The New Tab page is great  but most of the time when I open a new tab it's   because I want to access one of my bookmarks.  It seems on Linux the   bookmarks bar is either always showing or hidden  but I prefer the Windows   behavior where I can hide the bookmarks bar and it will reappear when I am   on the New Tab page.  This way I can conveniently access my favorite   bookmarks without the hassle of opening and closing the bar all the time; I   could leave it open  but I like saving screen space and appreciate Chrome's   minimal UI (one big reason why I use Chrome instead of FF).    Also  it would be nice if the New Tab page showed some some more bookmark   info as it does on Windows (eg recent bookmarks)  but of chief concern to   me is the bookmarks bar. </pre>
