<title>Issue 5141 -   chromium -    Clear download list command - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29          Firefox 3: OK          Opera: OK    Need function to clear download list. May be variants: delete all   successfully downloaded items  delete all successfully downloaded and   cancelled items (i.e. items that currently isn't being downloaded) and may   be delete all items. First variant is most necesary.    Also ability to delete items from download list with &quot;Delete&quot; or   &quot;Backspace&quot; key will be nice.   </pre>
