<title>Issue 2214 -   chromium -    Need better alternative than moving Find box horizontally when obscuring matches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open gmail  2. Search for &quot;er&quot;  without the quotes  3. Keep pressing down to go down in the list of matches  4. Notice the location of the find box      The user shouldn't move the mouse to focus on the new down button location    the find box location with its buttons shouldn't move horizontally as the   user's main focus is the find result. However  there should be a way to   show the currently selected search results without moving the find box.      The find box along with all the controls moves horizontally to show the   current highlighted search result  which is in our case Old'er' V'er'sion.  In this case the user is stuck between previous and next buttons as the   mouse focuses on the next button  due to the spacing between both results    if you don't move the mouse  which is the expected behaviour you are stuck   between those results.
