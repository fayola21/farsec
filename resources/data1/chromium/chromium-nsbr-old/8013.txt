<title>Issue 8013 -   chromium -    Future: profile options in context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current possibilities for opening a new profile window are:  - Click 'customize and control Chrome' / 'new window in profile' / the   profile  OR  - Press the shortcut of a profile    First option needs several clicks  second one needs you to remind which   shortcut belongs to each profile. When we want to open a link in another   profile  we need to copy-paste the link. Not very satisfying at all.     The future request is: list each profile in context menu. When right   clicked on a link: the option to open that link in one of your profiles.   When right clicked somewhere else: the option to open a new profile window. </pre>
