<title>Issue 7543 -   chromium -    Set up data file and log rotation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's getting to be a lot of data to sync between the web servers. We   should delete some of it regularly.    Nicolas's proposal:    File older than 14 days:  master.*/twisted.log.*    File older than 28 days:  buildbot/master.*/*/*-stdio    File older than 70 days:  www/layout_test_results  www/snapshots  (make sure it deletes the empty dirs too  and fix broken symlinks in   www/continuous) </pre>
