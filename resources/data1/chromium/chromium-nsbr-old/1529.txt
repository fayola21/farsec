<title>Issue 1529 -   chromium -    Port build/localized_strings/SConscript for linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   This is how we localize text on Windows.  We have a list of English  strings in src/webkit/glue/webkit_strings.grd (xml).  We use a tool call  GRIT (in src/tools/grit) which reads the grd file and generates a .rc and a  .h file used by Visual Studio's resource compiler.  What we want to do for  linux is:    1) determine how to externally store strings (preferably one file per locale)    2) extend grit to convert the grd file to this format    3) incorporate the generated files into the C++ source (most of the code  for the Windows side of this is in src/chrome/common/resource_bundle.*)    If you have a proposal for this  discuss it with one of the ops on  #chromium-linux </pre>
