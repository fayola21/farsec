<title>Issue 11257 -   chromium -    &quot;Show full history &gt;&gt;&quot; opens History in current tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.178.0 (Developer Build 14964)      1. Open New Tab page (NTP).  2. Click &quot;Show full history &gt;&gt;&quot;.    What is the expected output?     Behavior should be consistent with Ctrl+J  Wrench Menu behavior.  Should  open History in a new tab.  If a History tab already exists  should switch  to it.    What do you see instead?    History opens in same tab.  Can result in multiple History tabs in same  window if History tab already exists.   </pre>
