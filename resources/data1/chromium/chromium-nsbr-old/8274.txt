<title>Issue 8274 -   chromium -    Email addresses should not be shown as incorrect with compox boxes (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry  if it is a dupe  I could not able to find one.    Email addresses are shown as incorrect in compose box of an email!    Safari 4.x behaves like Chrome.  IE7.x and FF3/x  they don't show email addresses as incorrect.    Looks like webkit bug ??       </pre>
