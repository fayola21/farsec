<title>Issue 17936 -   chromium -    titlebar context menu needs to show shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The right-click context menu in the tab strip doesn't show keyboard   shortcuts on Linux (e.g. Windows shows SHIFT-CTRL-T for &quot;Reopen closed   tab&quot;).    In a related bug  the web page context menu doesn't show keyboard shortcuts   on either platform (e.g. there should be CTRL-P next to &quot;Print&quot;).    This makes keyboard shortcuts hard to discover. That's especially true for   the more unusual keyboard shortcuts that are often specific to Chrome. </pre>
