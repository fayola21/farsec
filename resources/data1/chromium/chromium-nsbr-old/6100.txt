<title>Issue 6100 -   chromium -    Regression: canvas.getContext(&amp;amp;quot;2d&amp;amp;quot;).getImageData(...).data is &amp;amp;#39;undefined&amp;amp;#39; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With WebKit merge (revisions 39606:39660) we lost the 'data' property   getter on ImageData object  so no more access to a bitmap data of a Canvas.  Upstream change removed the CanvasPixelArray and this property should be   implemented anew now. See <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/39625">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/39625</a> for more   info on the original change.
