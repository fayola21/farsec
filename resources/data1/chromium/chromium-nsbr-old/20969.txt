<title>Issue 20969 -   chromium -    Devtools: No visual selection when using magnifier - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a split from <a title="Select an element in the page to inspect it - doesn't work." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17639"> Issue 17639 </a> by murray.nuttall :  &quot;  1. Open Elements tab.  2. Click black magnifier to make it blue.  3. Mouse over part of page in browser window [does not display blue   boundary boxes as  expected]  4. Click element. Source in Elements tab jumps to highlight what I've just   click.  [Still no display of blue boundary box in browser window.]    If I click the code in the Elements tab the blue highlights do appear  but   never when  I'm hovering over to browser window when I have the magnifier selected.  &quot;    confirmed using 4.0.207.0 (Developer Build 25300) </pre>
