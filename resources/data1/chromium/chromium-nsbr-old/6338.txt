<title>Issue 6338 -   chromium -    history search needs normalization/folding of index terms and query terms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b/665869&gt;      1. Open Hebrew Chrome  2. Open the attached hebrew_with_vowel.html and regular_hebrew.html  3. Open &quot;history&quot; page  4. Type &quot;_��_��___��_��___��__��_&quot; (or copy other frequently appeared Hebrew characters in   hebrew_with_vowel.html) in the search box and press &quot;search history&quot;.  5. only hebrew_with_vowel.html appears as search result  although there are    equivalent hebrew characters without vowel exist in regular_hebrew.html  6. Type &quot;_��__��__��_&quot; (or copy other frequently appeared Hebrew characters in   regular_hebrew.html) in the search box and press &quot;search history&quot;.  7. Only regular_hebrew.html appears as search result  although there are   equivalent hebrew characters with vowel exist in hebrew_with_vowel.html    8. For the correct search result  open the attached hebrew_test.html in   Chrome (need use Chrome trunk which includes webkit patch <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/3953">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/3953</a>)  and try search the above characters   in &quot;Find in Page&quot;.        History search does not folding/normalization on the text for search  and   search only for the exact string.    We need to do folding/normalization. That folding needs to be done for both   indices and queries.    In the first step   just applying NFC (Normalization Form Composed) would   suffice.
