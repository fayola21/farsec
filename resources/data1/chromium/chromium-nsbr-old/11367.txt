<title>Issue 11367 -   chromium -    Incognito window size seems to override normal window size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.59                    1. Open Chrome and maximize the window.  2. Now open an incognito window (normally it shouldn't be maximized).  3. Close the original (maximized) window.  4. Close the incognito window.  5. Reopen Chrome.      Chrome should remember the normal size setting.      The size isn't the last size of the normal window  but of the incognito   window.   </pre>
