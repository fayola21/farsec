<title>Issue 6011 -   chromium -    Consider USE(ICU_UNICODE) to control use of TEC in ThreadGlobalData - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In third_partyWebKitWebCoreplatformThreadGlobalData.h  the use of TEC   is currently controlled by PLATFORM(DARWIN) (locally -- upstream it's   PLATFORM(MAC)  but that breaks our build). amanda reports:    &quot;&quot;&quot;  TEC isn't really a Darwin feature  so this may not be acceptable upstream.    We should probably look at turning on USE(ICU_UNICODE) instead.  &quot;&quot;&quot; </pre>
