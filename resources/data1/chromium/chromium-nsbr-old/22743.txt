<title>Issue 22743 -   chromium -    TinyMCE causes 100% cpu usage? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/09/introducing-google-chrome-frame.html">http://blog.chromium.org/2009/09/introducing-google-chrome-frame.html</a>  a user said he couldn't use Chrome Frame until it worked  better with TinyMCE  and that currently TinyMCE uses too much CPU  on Chrome (and Safari). He linked to a post about this here:  <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=17311">http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=17311</a>  which has a demo of the problem here:  <a href="http://www.upyourimage.com/tinymce/example.html">http://www.upyourimage.com/tinymce/example.html</a>  and sure enough  it uses 100% cpu on my machine  (and makes the cursor in the omnibox blocky afterwards?!) </pre>
