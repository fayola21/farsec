<title>Issue 16490 -   chromium -    Problem with opening CHrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.192.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Not applicable  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Not applicable  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not applicable      1. Opening the Chrome icon from the dock      Well  when opening any application from the dock and it loads. It should   keep jumping or something.      Well  I clicked on the application in the dock. It didn't open  after 1-5   seconds it opens. With FireFox  it takes also the same time  but it keeps   jumping  as it's loading then the window opens.    It's probably a stupid bug report  but I think that should happen.   </pre>
