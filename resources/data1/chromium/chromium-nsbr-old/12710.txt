<title>Issue 12710 -   chromium -    Implement better test isolation  to make them more solid and easier to debug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may prevent things like <a title="Crash in base_unittests involving SystemMonitor observer and NowSingleton" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12187"> issue 12187 </a> in the future.    I'm waiting for necessary support in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">http://code.google.com/p/googletest/</a>  (observer api).    The whitelist would include Time and TimeTicks singletons  and maybe some  other required things  but I'll try to make this set as small as possible   and maybe smaller in the future. </pre>
