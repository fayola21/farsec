<title>Issue 2023 -   chromium -    Cookie expire date bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)           Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Change your computer date or the server date to have the computer date   more recent than the server date  2. go to the website  3. check the cookies      Get the website cookie(s)      Don't get the cookie(s) because the Google Chrome browser compare the   cookie expire date to the client computer system date instead of comparing   to the server date (using the Date field of the HTTP headers).  That's a bug and even more weird because this way of checking the cookie   validity the developer have to handle the different time zones so  have to   convert the cookie date to the time zone used by the client   computer...that's more complex than the logic way of checking the cookie   validity and that's a bug... hard work to create a bug ;) lol  Good luck guys.
