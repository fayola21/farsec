<title>Issue 10111 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   This test finishes while in the middle of a CSS animation. This is  intentional  but it makes pixel results unreliable.  <a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21491">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21491</a>  CSS animations should not block our next release.   DEFER SKIP : LayoutTests/transitions/opacity-transition-zindex.html = PASS  (Automatically generated from line 1005 to line 1011 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
