<title>Issue 18882 -   chromium -    Browser window deactivates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.12  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">http://arstechnica.com/</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. cmd-T to create a new tab  2. type &quot;ars&quot; in omnibox and select autocompletion for arstechnica.com  3. after the Ars Technica homepage appears  the window is deactivated      The window should remain active  so that the keybindings work on the   window. For most things  I need to click to activate the window  then   click/type to perform an action.    This happens in many  many situations. Ars is simple an example that   always causes the failure situation.    I've also just tested: the autocompletion has no effect. If I type the URL   completely  and press &lt;Return&gt;  then it still loses activation after the page   appears.      The window deactivates.   </pre>
