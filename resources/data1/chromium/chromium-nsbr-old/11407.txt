<title>Issue 11407 -   chromium -    Mouse cursor not updated properly on window switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Put the mouse over a text field  like this bug entry form.  2) Switch windows using the keyboard to a winodw .  (I use xmonad  it might   be specific to that if alt-tab doesn't work.)  3) Switch back.    The mouse cursor will become an arrow instead of an i-beam  and will stay   that way until you move the mouse outside of the text field.  (Guessing: I   think that means we think we've updated the cursor and are caching the   updated status so we ignore subsequent &quot;change to i-beam&quot; request?) </pre>
