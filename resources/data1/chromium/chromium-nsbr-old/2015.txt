<title>Issue 2015 -   chromium -    BOM processing error in the middle of a script with UTF-8 encoding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29           Safari 3: ??      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Create html page that has link to javascript file.  2. Javascript file must be in UTF-8 encoding and must contain BOM (byte   order mask - EF BB BF) in the middle of the file.  3. Open html page that reads and executes that javascript.      Javascript code should be successfully executed.      JavaScript console shows errors like: &quot;Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected   token ILLEGAL&quot;.    Removing BOM from the middle of a file isn't a solution because broken   files isn't accessible by user.     </pre>
