<title>Issue 12069 -   chromium -    Download shelf should position &quot;Show all downloads&quot; link on the left when too small to show downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make the Chrome window fairly small  2. Download an exe so that the download shelf show the dangerous download   message    If there is not enough room for the download item to show  then it is not   shown. This is annoying in some locales (such as ml) for which the strings   are fairly long  making that case potentially common.    On Windows in that case we display the &quot;Show all downloads...&quot; link on the   left  to make it more obvious that something happened.  We should do the same on Linux and Mac. </pre>
