<title>Issue 18132 -   chromium -    Find bar's markings in scrollbar stuck in iframes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use ctrl+F to find something on a page with a scrollbar  2. Either    a. Backspace out the text in the find box     b. Close the find bar      When the find bar is empty or has been closed  I expect no highlighting in   the scroll bar.    Sorry if this is a dupe. I thought I saw something about this before  but I   can't find it now.   </pre>
