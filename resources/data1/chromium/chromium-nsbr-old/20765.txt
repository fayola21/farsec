<title>Issue 20765 -   chromium -    Using a NPObject as an event listener crashes the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have a plugin that produces a NPObject that implements at least  NP_HasProperty  NP_GetProperty  	* (&quot;0&quot; in npObject) should be &quot;true&quot;  i.e. NP_HasProperty(npObject 0)  should return true.  	* npObject[0] should be &quot;undefined&quot;  i.e.  NP_GetProperty(npObject 0 &amp;result) should return true and result.type  should be Void    2. Load the plugin in an out of process Chrome browser (the issue does not  reproduce for an in-process instance)  3. Obtain a reference npObject to the implemented NPObject  for example  calling a plugin function like: npObject = plugin.getNPObject();  4. Call el.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;  npObject  false);  5. The browser crashes        The browser should not crash and it should invoke &quot;handleEvent&quot; when the  event is fired.          The browser crashes.      <b>Please provide
