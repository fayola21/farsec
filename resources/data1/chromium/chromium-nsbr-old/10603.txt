<title>Issue 10603 -   chromium -    BookmarkModel should support changing the URL on BookmarkNode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For historical reasons  BookmarkModel doesn't support changing the URL of an   existing bookmark.  Instead you need to create a new bookmark and delete the   old one.  As we expose bookmarks to extension writers  this model is overly   confusing and painful to work with.    Adding another setter isn't hard.  The issue is going through all of the   model observers and making sure that they properly handle the BookmarkNodeChanged notification when this change is made.  It's a bit too   easy to cause a regression in the UI.   </pre>
