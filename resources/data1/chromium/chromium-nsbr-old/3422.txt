<title>Issue 3422 -   chromium -    Allow users to stop carpet bombing sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a dialog that is shown when a site tries to download more than one file without any user   interaction. Here's the details:    . Each new page is allowed one download with no user interaction.  . Navigating to a different page  clicking on a page (or pressing enter/space)  resets the state to   allowing a download.  . If more than one download is attempted with no user interaction the download(s) are paused and the   user prompted as to whether they want to allow/disallow the download.  . Allowing the download results in all subsequent downloads for the same host being allowed with no   prompts. Similarly disallowing the download results in all downloads being blocked (with no dialog)   until the user navigates to a different host.     </pre>
