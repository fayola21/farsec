<title>Issue 18413 -   chromium -    Linux bookmark bar separator looks wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The bookmark bar separator between &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; and the bookmarks to the   left looks like a standard separator. If you look at Chrome on windows you'll   notice it is not really a standard bevel but a line that dissolves at either   end. </pre>
