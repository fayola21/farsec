<title>Issue 8447 -   chromium -    Traditional Chinese: Use a better font for the URLs in the auto-complete suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Probably  this is related to internal bug b/796849  but I am filing a   separated bug for Traditional Chinese URL now.    All channels issue.    Build: 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10990)     OS: Traditional Chinese XP    Other Browsers:    Safari: N/A  Firefox3: OK       IE7: OK    Steps:  1. Launch Chrome on Traditional Chinese XP  2. Navigate to below pages:     &gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/thankyou.html">http://www.google.com/chrome/thankyou.html</a>     &gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.beelink.com/20090305/2650253.shtml">http://www.beelink.com/20090305/2650253.shtml</a>  3. Type www in Omnibox  4. Observe the auto-complete suggestions     &gt;&gt;The URL visited in step 2 should show up now    Result:  The font used for URL looks weird  especially pay attention to the shape of   letter &quot;w&quot; and numbers in the URL (Seems it is using Traditional Chinese   font __����__��___��_)    Expected:  Use a better font for URL    Notes:  1. For Firefox3: OK       The auto-complete suggestions show the title of the page in first line    and show the URL in the second line  the font used for them seems   different  but the URL looks good.    2. For IE7: OK       Auto-complete shows URL without title  and the URL looks good too.     </pre>
