<title>Issue 14117 -   chromium -    Problem with American Express online bill pay - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) :americanexpress.com          Firefox 3.x: OK        American Express-- I tried to pay my Amex Bill online but when I select the   bank it does not populate (ie the screen always says &quot;Select Bank&quot; which   essentially prohibits me from paying online).  I Contacted Amex and they   said they have had multiple complaints and have tried to escalate to   Google.  They think it is a problem with most recent version of Chrome.  As   I have used Chrome since it was being tested and always pay online  this   makes sense (this started happening this month  last month it worked fine)   </pre>
