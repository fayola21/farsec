<title>Issue 16994 -   chromium -    SoccerManager site not displayed properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>             Icons for club jerseys and friend icons should be on the left  besides the   name of friend/club      As shown on screenshot  icons are over the text  making it unreadable  and   only on this site fonts are smaller than on others. In other browsers (FF    Opera  IE) this doesn't happen  only in Chrome. I tried on 3 PC's  it's the   same problem.    <b>Please provide
