<title>Issue 15741 -   chromium -    RFE: awkward location of toolbar icons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4    I find the toolbar icons' position for the page- and settings menu in   Chrome not very user friendly.  Currently the are on the far right  but all other buttons are on the far   left.    Usually  menus are on the left side (=in reading direction) where I   instinctly always want to go  but then realize that in Chrome they are on   the other side of the page.    This is inconsistent with well established and working UI principles and   should be changed  i.e. all icons (as they are only 2 more and very   important ones) should be on the left side.    I am sure it would not clutter up the toolbar and make for a much more   direct and fluent user interface.  At least  as we say in Linux land  please make it configurable/draggable -)   </pre>
