<title>Issue 14165 -   chromium -    [proprietary systems (university of utrecht was the source)]: Web-Outlook totally different layout for same page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: proprietary systems (university of utrecht was the source) Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?  Where an Internet Explorer shows something that looks just like offline Outlook  the chrome version has a Times New Roman layout and totally different navigation. Because I don't use it myself  a friend of mine had to point it out to me.    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Open WebOutlook in IE  2. Open WebOutlook in chrome :)    It is probably good to get an account somewhere to test it.. For some university professors it is the main reason not to switch to chrome.    Good luck!     Tim </pre>
