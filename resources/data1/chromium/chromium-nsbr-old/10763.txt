<title>Issue 10763 -   chromium -    Crbug's comment text area eats mouse click. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.176.0 (14039)                         2.0.174.0    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5607">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5607</a>  Other browsers tested: NA      1. Enter an issue here in Google Code with a download link for example  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5607">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5607</a>  2. Click on the file attached to Comment#4 there to download it  3. After the html file is downloaded (the download bar should appear in the bottom of the tab)  click on the text area of that issue (the one used to   post a reply) and try to enter some text in it.       The gray &quot;Enter your comments&quot; text should disappear once you click on it    and the new text should be black.        the Gray text doesn't disappear and the new text to be entered is gray too        while you are at it  please review that bug as nobody commented to it and   it looks legit ;) </pre>
