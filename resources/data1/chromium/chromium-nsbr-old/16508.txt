<title>Issue 16508 -   chromium -    Implement a proper clock for the media pipeline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we base our clock on the audio hardware.    This introduces issues when hardware isn't present or when playing a video   without an audio track.    For starters  the clock logic should be extracted from the pipeline and   moved into a separate interface + implementation.  Clocks should also be   injected into the pipeline for testing/mocking purposes.    In essence  the clock should use the system time as a basis for all time-  related calculations  as opposed to being manually updated when the audio   hardware responds.    The end result should be that videos without audio should play at nearly   the same rate as videos with audio that are clocked to the hardware. </pre>
