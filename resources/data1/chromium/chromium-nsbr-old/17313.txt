<title>Issue 17313 -   chromium -    Option dialog to control rOpen Link in a New Tab Behavior is Missing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Right click on a link and select open in a new tab  2. Web page opens on top of existing page obscuring it from view  3. Original tab must then be reselected to view it.      Open in a new tab BEHIND / Beneath the existing web page  if that is my   preference        There is no option available to change how new tabs are opened.      I do not understand the logic of creating a new tab behavior without   allowing a user to determine his or her preference. Personally  I want new   web pages to open behind what I'm doing  but with the new builds this is   apparently not possible.   </pre>
