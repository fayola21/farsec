<title>Issue 18213 -   chromium -    Ugly animation when installing multiple themes in a row - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install a theme  2. Observe infobar animation  but don't close the infobar  3. Install another theme        The infobars do a really ugly animation because one is closing while the   other is opening. This results in the content kinda bouncing up and down.    The infobar should just be swapped out immediately  no animation.       </pre>
