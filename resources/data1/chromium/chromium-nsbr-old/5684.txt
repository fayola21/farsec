<title>Issue 5684 -   chromium -    BUG: Rapid harddisk read or writes for a minute or two on startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Since forever and still on 1.0.154.39    Start Google Chrome  browse the web and after a few seconds  notice your   harddisk activity indication going on nonstop until it finishes.  I checked in the Windows task manager and Chrome reads and writes more   than 150 MBs of data  apparently the size of my User Data directory.    No browser (that I tried) does that and it is really not suitable for Google   Chrome.      Thank you!   </pre>
