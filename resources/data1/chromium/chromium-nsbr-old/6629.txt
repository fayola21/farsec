<title>Issue 6629 -   chromium -    Feature request: Manual progressive update that does not depend on GoogleUpdater - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://dl.google.com/chrome/install/154.36/chrome_installer.exe">http://dl.google.com/chrome/install/154.36/chrome_installer.exe</a>    I downloaded Google Chrome from the above URL  instead of the usual one    for the because I had read that it does not include GoogleUpdater. I like   to be informed about updates  but do not want them silently installed   without my knowledge or consent. I also don't like resident programs    regardless of the level of commitment of the developers to keeping the   cycles or memory used minimal.    Unfortunately  choosing to install Chrome without GoogleUpdater means that   it is impossible to update Chrome without downloading the new version in   its entirety and running the installer again. It would be nice to be able   to manually perform an update process that does a progressive update like   GoogleUpdater.    GoogleUpdater could be made to meet the desired specifications:  1. Does not autorun  or stay resident.  2. Automatically checks for  but does install updates unless requested.  3. Could be run manually to update Chrome when a recent bug or change has   made Chrome non-functional.    These changes could be made optional through some part of the interface    whether in individual products supported by GoogleUpdater  or through a   separate GoogleUpdater user interface. </pre>
