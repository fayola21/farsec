<title>Issue 13296 -   chromium -    Implement content-sniffing for crx files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per the decision in this thread:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/8019683ccd207fdc/653c42ee1219bb28">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/8019683ccd207fdc/653c42ee1219bb28</a>    We need to implement content sniffing for .crx files. The logic will be:    if (the content-type is &quot;application/x-chrome-extension&quot;):    the file is an extension    else if (the file ends in &quot;.crx&quot; AND           the content type is in (&lt;none&gt;  text/plain  application/octet-stream) AND           the response starts with the crx magic header)    the file is an extension    else    the file is not an extension </pre>
