<title>Issue 16704 -   chromium -    Mac &amp; Linux testing doesn't support reusing existing browsers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The automation support we use for unittesting can request a new browser or   an existing one.  Currently  Mac and Linux always start/stop the browser for   each test in a unittest.  This means things are slower  but probably not a big   deal.  But  in the case of valgrind unittests  that extra startup/shutdown is   probably contributing a large amount to the reason the tests are so slow  as   we take time to validate the startup/shutdown code paths over and over   (when once would be enough).  If we can find a way to support that on both   platforms  it could greatly help valgrind cycle times.   </pre>
