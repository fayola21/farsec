<title>Issue 2959 -   chromium -    NavSuggest result being shown after it should have been canceled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I haven't tracked this down closely yet.  On my machine  I can type   &quot;google.com&quot; and hit tab (to go into keyword UI mode for a google search)    then type &quot;foo&quot; very fast and get a NavSuggest result for   &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot;  which came from the original &quot;google.com&quot; input   string. </pre>
