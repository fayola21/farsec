<title>Issue 4169 -   chromium -    Can't delete all bookmarks with single stretch in &quot;Recently Added&quot; folder (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make sure you have a bunch of URLs in &quot;Recently Added&quot; folder of    Bookmark    Manager.   You can do this by performing imports couple of times from IE/FF  2. Highlight the &quot;Recently Added&quot; folder in Bookmarks Manager.  3. Hit Ctrl+a in ListView to select all of URLs  4. Now hit delete key to delete all of them.  You will still notice bookmarks available.    What is the expected output?   All of them should be deleted.    What do you see instead?  Only visible URLs are deleted.      If you apply the same technique on any folder (eg: Imported From IE)  you  will notice the listview is auto scrolled to delete all of the URLs. We  should do the same for &quot;Recently Added&quot; folder too.   </pre>
