<title>Issue 11478 -   chromium -    Fix DomSerializerTests disabled for WebKit merge 43114:43242 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Fix DomSerializerTests disabled for WebKit merge 43114:43242    I ended up disabling the following tests so that I could land the merge:    SerialzeHTMLDOMWithEntitiesInText    SerialzeHTMLDOMWithEntitiesInAttributeValue    I think the failures are caused by the fact that WebCore now always inserts a   HEAD element to a HTML DOM. </pre>
