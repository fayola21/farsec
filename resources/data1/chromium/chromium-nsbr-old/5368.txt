<title>Issue 5368 -   chromium -    The download history changes should apply on fly to incognito mode (?). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.36 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6676">r6676</a>).  This could be related to <a title="Regression: User can't search downloads page in Incognito mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2313"> Issue 2313 </a>.    The download history changes made in procognito (Normal Browser window)  should apply on fly in incognito mode also and VICE VERSA.      1. Open normal browser window and incognito window (ctrl+shift+n)  2. Ctrl+J to open downloads page in both of the windows.  3. Clear the downloads history from normal window.    What is the expected output?   The downloads history in Incognito window should be cleared.    What do you see instead?  The download history lives until the (Incognito)window is restarted.    Step3 is applicable from Incognito window also.    FYI:  The issue is not just limited to clearing download history but also  downloads too.   </pre>
