<title>Issue 20421 -   chromium -    Closing tabs with Ctrl-w repeatedly gets &quot;stuck&quot; if a tab has a search open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2    1. Open many tabs.  2. Randomly pick one in the middle  and start a find (Ctrl-f) and leave it   open.  3. Go to a tab further to the right.  4. Hit Ctrl-w repeatedly to close a bunch of tabs.      Each press of Ctrl-w closes a tab.      Each press of Ctrl-w closes a tab until it hits the tab where the find   dialog was open. On that tab  the search text gets highlighted. Pressing   Ctrl-w clears the text. Repeatedly pressing Ctrl-w does nothing. </pre>
