<title>Issue 3280 -   chromium -    Feature: Make it so you can tab through the address bar that drops down when you type. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox and IE have always supported this. Not everyone wants to have to  move their hand over to their mouse and click to pick what they want  we  should be able to tab through what drops down and hit enter. Its better  usability especially since I'm typing and dont want to have to move my hand  over to the mouse when typing. </pre>
