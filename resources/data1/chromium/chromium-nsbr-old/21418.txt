<title>Issue 21418 -   chromium -    Show a real HTML preview in the RSS extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the preview in the RSS extension shows the HTML as plain-text.    We should do a real HTML preview  but we are concerned about XSS. To do it   safely  we can use an IFRAME  but set its source to a data URL. Data URLs   have no authority  so this is the safest way to show an HTML preview. </pre>
