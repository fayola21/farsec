<title>Issue 3019 -   chromium -    Improper timestamps on the disk cache. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The disk cache uses Time::Now() to obtain the timestamp of every entry  but    that function doesn't return the current time because it is based on the   computer uptime. As a result  all timestamps are currently meaningless   across sessions.    Currently  this bug doesn't affect the cache performance  just our ability   to evaluate the performance. </pre>
