<title>Issue 14730 -   chromium -    History tab needs to display throbber when searching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 3.0.189.0 (Official Build 18569)    After building up lots of History  entering search terms on the History page   and then clicking &quot;Search History&quot; can take some time.    When performing a history search  the tab icon should display the throbber.    This provides consistency with other tabs while they are working loading   content  and the actively moving throbber lets the user know that the search   is in progress and working.    I believe right now the tab icon just changes to the generic page icon  which    is not as useful. </pre>
