<title>Issue 12369 -   chromium -    Extension messaging startup racey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I installed the customize new tab page extension (attached) and noticed that   sometimes the ntp renders completely blank.    The reason for this is that the content script is waiting for a message from   its extension  but the extension is not always available at the moment the   content script runs.    This is a common problem. See also: <a title="Content scripts race and do not always apply to first page load" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11547"> issue 11547 </a> and <a title="Extensions: Race between toolstrip and bookmark system startup" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12353"> issue 12353 </a>. I don't see   a general solution  though. </pre>
