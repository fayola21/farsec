<title>Issue 19487 -   chromium -    koreabaseball.com : javascript syntax error leading functions defined after the error not to be recognized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. go to <a href="http://www.koreabaseball.com">http://www.koreabaseball.com</a>  2. In the center column below the large photo section  hover over a button  named '��___��_�� ��_��_��_��_��_��_��_��_' (the button about 2&quot;/5cm right of the blue 'more' button)    3. the status bar shows 'javascript:showDivMenu(2 3)'    4. Press the button    Expected: there's a change (I don't know what will pop up/change. it does  not work in any of browsers I have on linux/mac :-). Apparently  it only  works with IE)    Actual: nothing happens    Probable cause: showDivMenu is defined  but before its definition  there's  a syntax error at line 89 of <a href="http://www.koreabaseball.com/index.asp">http://www.koreabaseball.com/index.asp</a>  which  reads    function window::onload() {    Apparently  the above error gets the rest of Javascript ignored or at least  the definition showDivMenu  (starting at line 177) ignored.       I'll write to the web master. There are other issues at the site although  it's mostly usable.      </pre>
