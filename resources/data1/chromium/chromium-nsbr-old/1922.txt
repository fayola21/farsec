<title>Issue 1922 -   chromium -    'view source' should open next to the parent tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Right-click on web page  2. Select &quot;View page source&quot;      I expected the source code tab to open next to the parent tab. This is the   normal behaviour of the browser when opening page links in new tabs.      The source code tab is opened as the last tab. This is annoying because   when I close tab I often won't go back to the page that I opened the source   code from.    Please provide
