<title>Issue 16494 -   chromium -    New field trial tests are ignored by renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm starting a new browser and following the data collected by *.Renderer4   histograms and I'm seeing that a good part of the navigations are missing.    If the browser restores a lot of tabs (at least after a crash)  most   (sometimes all) of the renderers will not include all the data that I'm   trying to gather. The problem is that the field trial info is passed as a   command line when the renderer is created  and the test that I'm interested   in is only declared when the first resource fetch happens  so my test is   not included in the list of tests even though it is active for the whole   life of every network request performed by all renderers (or at least    impacts every request and it is active by the time the histogram should be   declared for the first time in the renderer).    This is important because one of the things that I'm interested in is the   behavior of the browser during startup  when we may have a lot of tabs   making simultaneous requests. In addition  if the process limit is reached   with the browser launch  I'm pretty much losing all info from that client.    As an alternative  we could consider an ipc message that tells existing   renderers about new test being added.   </pre>
