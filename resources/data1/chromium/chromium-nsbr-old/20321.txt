<title>Issue 20321 -   chromium -    Chromium goes CPU bound on MacOS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 204.0 (Developer Build 24421)    MacOS Version        : 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)        1. Start up Chromium  2. It soon becomes CPU bound  3. Quit Chromium  the process still exists.  4. Have to force quit it        Not CPU Bound        Chromium process is CPU Bound. New Tab window doesn't complete the previews.    I don't know how this started  but here's the things I've attempted to  correct it:     1. Restarted - it works for maybe a minute and then goes cpu bound again.  Doesn't matter what URL's I go to.  2. Cleared cache  3. Upgraded to a newer nightly version. It originally started while running  version 203.0 (Developer Build 23709)    I haven't cleared all history and data yet since I want to be able to  reproduce the issue to help get it resolved. Attached is the stack traces  from the report which MacOS creates when I force quit it from Activity Monitor. </pre>
