<title>Issue 3187 -   chromium -    chrome.exe code bloat - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At the beginning of Oct  we've bloated chrome.exe (NOT dll) by 92KB of code   and 22KB of data. This should be unnecessary.    I found a bounch of ICU stuff gets pulled in now  I think because of our   additional UTF-32 conversions as well as using ICU for our regular UTF-8/16   conversions. We should investigate whether sys_string_conversions can be   used for code in chrome_exe. </pre>
