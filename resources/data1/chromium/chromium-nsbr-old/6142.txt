<title>Issue 6142 -   chromium -    System level Chrome gets uninstalled even when a Chrome instance is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ***This is for System Level and don't have any Chrome instances running in   any user***    1. Launch uninstaller through Admin and stop when the confirmation dialog   pops up  2. Switch to NonAdmin and launch Chrome  3. Switch back to Admin and click on OK      I think we should close the confirmation dialog for the uninstall. Instead   we uninstall Chrome which leaves it in messed up state and can't install   Chrome unless we manually delete the left over files(Application Folder)    Happening with Google Chrome 2.0.156.1 (Official Build 7653)    Log file  ---------  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClassesApplicationschrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClasses.htmOpenWithListchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClasses.htmlOpenWithListchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClasses.shtmlOpenWithListchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClasses.xhtOpenWithListchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClasses.xhtmlOpenWithListchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClientsStartMenuInternetchrome.exe  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(133)] Failed to delete registry key:   SoftwareClassesChromeHTML  [0108/112131:ERROR:uninstall.cc(147)] Failed to delete registry value:   Google Chrome  [0108/112132:ERROR:uninstall.cc(104)] Failed to delete folder (1st try):   C:Program FilesGoogleChromeApplication  [0108/112133:ERROR:uninstall.cc(108)] Failed to delete folder (2nd try):   C:Program FilesGoogleChromeApplication   </pre>
