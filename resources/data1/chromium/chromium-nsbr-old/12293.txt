<title>Issue 12293 -   chromium -    PAC script is not re-fetched when switching networks. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't believe (at least for chrome 2.0) that switching networks will   always do the right thing with respect to proxy configurations.    For example  if you started out in network &quot;A&quot;  and downloaded   &quot;http://wpad/wpad.dat (because you are using &quot;auto-detect&quot; proxy   settings)  then now when you switch to network &quot;B&quot; you will continue to use   that same PAC script (downloaded from network A). This is because from the   perspective of ProxyConfigService the settings have not changed.    Probably what needs to happen is that when the user switches networks  the   proxy service  and re-run the &quot;auto-detect&quot; steps.    (Also  ProxyScriptFetcher should be setting the flag to bypass the disk-  cache  we can't use the cached response off of old network). </pre>
