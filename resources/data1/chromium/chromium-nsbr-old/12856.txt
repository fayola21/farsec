<title>Issue 12856 -   chromium -    Chrome window size goes crazy when maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Maximize Chrome (using Gnome + compiz)  2. Attempt to un-maximize    What do you see instead?  The window stays the huge size and gets confused as to whether it's maximized   or not.    I have to alt-tab and ctl-C the terminal to get it to go away. </pre>
