<title>Issue 18623 -   chromium -    Ctrl+N on maximized window opens large but unmaximized window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a chrome window  2. Maximize it  3. Press Ctrl+N      I expect either (a) a maximized window or (b) a smaller-than-my-screen   unmaximized window. (probably a good size would be the size I get when I   restore my maximized chrome window). Instead  I get an unmaximized window   that takes up my entire screen anyway.    Personally  I would prefer (a). If I've maximized the window  I probably   want future windows to be maximized.    Haven't tested on Windows  but assuming it's linux only. </pre>
