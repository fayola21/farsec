<title>Issue 18797 -   chromium -    ExternalTabTestType.CreateExternalTab is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [ RUN      ] ExternalTabTestType.CreateExternalTab  C:bslavechromium-rel-  builderbuildsrcchrometestautomationautomation_proxy_uitest.cc(804):   error: Value of: tab-&gt;is_valid()    Actual: true  Expected: false  [  FAILED  ] ExternalTabTestType.CreateExternalTab (2351 ms)    I see a Sleep(1000) in here  which makes alarm bells go off.    Can't figure out who originally wrote this code  so passing to Jay in hopes   he can make some of this stuff not-a-ui-test (and thus less flaky) or else   triage to someone better. </pre>
