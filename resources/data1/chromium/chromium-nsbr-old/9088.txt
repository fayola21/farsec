<title>Issue 9088 -   chromium -    Linux keyboard input in render view broken in opt mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Kayboard input in opt mode stopped working for me some time recently (debug  mode still works). The browser is sending key events to webkit  but webkit  doesn't seem to use them or give them back to us.    I'm leaving this unconfirmed because I haven't found anyone else that has  the same problem. </pre>
