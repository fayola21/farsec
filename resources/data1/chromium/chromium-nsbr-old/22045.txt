<title>Issue 22045 -   chromium -    Path-handling functions for OS X need cleaning up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When looking at my patch for   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14545">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14545</a>   Mark suggested   making all path-handling functions use GetUserDirectory().  It wasn't   trivial enough to include in that patch  so this bug is for the follow-up   work. </pre>
