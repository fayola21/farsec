<title>Issue 18597 -   chromium -    A performance regression should turn the buildbot red - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A performance regression should turn the buildbot red    We have lived too long being dependent on sheriffs watching the perf graphs   for regressions.  With the growing number of configurations and ports  this   simply doesn't scale.  We should find a way to automate the flagging of a   performance regression.    We should probably only do this for tests that have a reference build and for   which there is a variance measurement.  If the delta between the new build   and the reference build exceeds some multiple of the variance  then we can   call it a regression. </pre>
