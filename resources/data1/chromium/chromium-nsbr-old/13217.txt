<title>Issue 13217 -   chromium -    Dangerous File warning on the shelf in RTL seems to misplace the buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.0 (17405)��_��_��_        download an .exe file from the web    you will see the localized version of &quot;this file could harm ....&quot;  with 2 options to discard or allow (all localized)      the 2 buttons should be on the left of the warning      the 2 buttons appear to the right of it  like it should in english  but we are talking hebrew UI of chrome (RTL)    More info:  this happens on hebrew enables vista (and maybe on english versions of   windows with a hebrew UI)  i am not sure this is a bug  but it seems inconsistent with where the   buttons should appear </pre>
