Link on web page must invoke Javascript to open a popup window   containing HTML form and Javascript code for form validation. There is no   problem in Google Chrome if the link is opened in a new window or tab using   target=&quot;blank&quot;.  2. Form validation Javascript code in the popup window invokes   alert(message) upon encountering an error within the form and sets focus to   the appropriate form element.      Google Chrome should display the alert box.      Google Chrome will execute all Javascript code EXCEPT for opening the alert   box.     </pre>
