<title>Issue 18220 -   chromium -    Context Menu causes playback rate shift erroneously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start playing a video  2. Right click  then hit mute.  3. Unmute.  Playback sets itself to 0.5      Playback rate should be unchanged.    Also  it seems the A/V gets desynced pretty badly.    This was discovered on linux  but I'm marking at all OS since this code is   common to all OSes.   </pre>
