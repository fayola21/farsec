Load a page that will crash the renderer  eg. <a href="http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/Issue%2010731%20-">http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/Issue%2010731%20-</a>  %20ReadAV%20[NULL+8]@chrome!SkShader%20resetLocalMatrix+0x11/repro.html  2. Press and hold F5 to refresh the page continuously or click on the   refresh button in rapid succession.  3. Within a minute you should get a kr0m message:  FATAL:renderer_security_poilcy.cc(103) - Check failed:false. Add renderers   at most once.    What is the expected output?   Refresh the page until the user has had enough.  What do you see instead?  Refresh the page until the browser crashes.     </pre>
