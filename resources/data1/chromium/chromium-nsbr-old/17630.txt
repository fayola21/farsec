<title>Issue 17630 -   chromium -    Make pre populated thumbnails localized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm about to check in some (2) hard coded thumbnails to use on the new tab   page when there isn't enough thumbnails.    This needs to be localized and refactored to make it easier to provide these   resources.   </pre>
