<title>Issue 5278 -   chromium -    Reopen closed tab in its original position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: don't know if it can reopen tabs at all        Opera 9: OK      1. Open 2 or more tabs.  2. Close one of them  but not the last.  3. Press Ctrl+Shift+T.      Tab is opened in that position in tab bar  where it was before it was closed.      Tab is opened in the last position.    It is very useful to get accidentally closed tab opened in that very place where it   was. </pre>
