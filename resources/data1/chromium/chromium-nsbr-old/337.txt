It appears the CPU usage on the system goes high when you try to   load a pdf document in chrome. Didn't get any such problem with Firfox  IE and Opera. </pre>      </td>  </tr>        <tr class="cursor_off">  <td class="vt issuecomment">        <span class="author">Comment <a name="c2"  href="#c2">2</a>  by  <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/u/mattzada/">mattzada</a></span>   <span class="date" title="Sat Sep  6 09:04:10 2008">Sep 06  2008</span>   <pre> same problem occurs with me too </pre>      </td>  </tr>        <tr class="cursor_off">  <td class="vt issuecomment">        <span class="author">Comment <a name="c3"  href="#c3">3</a>  by  <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/u/joseph.jameson/">joseph.jameson</a></span>   <span class="date" title="Sun Sep  7 06:11:35 2008">Sep 07  2008</span>   <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Keynote08_UserGuide.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Keynote08_UserGuide.pdf</a>  Other browsers tested:     Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Open a PDF  2. Scroll using a scroll wheel on a mouse or touchpad  3.     What is the expected result?     The Browser process in Chrome's Task Manager should not spike and the browser should   not freeze for several seconds.    What happens instead?    The first scroll (1-3 lines as defined in the Mouse settings in Windows) is   successful. If you scroll more than one increment the Browser process in Chrome's   Task Manager spikes (60-70%) and the browser freezes for several seconds. When the   browser unfreezes it is scrolled to the position of the last scroll. So  if I scroll   1 increment using a scroll wheel the PDF scrolls and everything is fine. I can repeat   this single increment scroll several times with no problems. If I scroll more than   one increment (say 5 increments) the PDF scrolls one increment and then the browser   freezes for several seconds. When the browser unfreezes it is scrolled the full 5   increments (I never actually see the last 4 increments scroll). While getting a   screenshot I also received a popup about Acrobat being unresponsive.    Please provide
