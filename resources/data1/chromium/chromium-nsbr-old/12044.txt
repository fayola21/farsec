<title>Issue 12044 -   chromium -    Use auto-reset events in tcp_client_socket_win.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we are using manual-reset event objects in   tcp_client_socket_win.cc.  This was necessary before because we used to wait   for cancelled async IO to complete with a WaitForSingleObject call.  Because   the ObjectWatcher's wait for the event object might have returned before we   called StopWatching  the event object had to be manual-reset so it could   remain in the signaled state for our WaitForSingleObject call.    Now that our WaitForSingleObject call is gone  we can use auto-reset event   objects and get rid of the WSAResetEvent calls  saving a few system calls.    In DidCompleteConnect  we can pass NULL instead of the event handle as the hEventObject argument to WSAEnumNetworkEvents. </pre>
