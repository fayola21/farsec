Press Ctrl+F.  2. Dismiss search box by pressing Esc.      Search box hides  and focus returned to the page  so that you can navigate   it with PgUp/PgDn/Left/Right/Up/Down.      Search box hides  but focus remains in it. As a result  page navigation   from keyboard doesn't work. When you type some text  it is being searched   and highlighted. If you press Esc again  the search box is being shown and   hidden again.    </pre>
