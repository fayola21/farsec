<title>Issue 16200 -   chromium -    Make pinned thumbnails in new &quot;New Tab&quot; page visible without hovering  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3    Other browsers tested: N/A                1. In the new 'New Tab' page the user cannot tell if a thumbnail is 'pinned' without   focusing on the thumbnail.          You should be able to tell if a thumbnail is 'pinned' even without hovering over the   thumbnail. Perhaps a border color change or some other indicator.       The pinned option is only visible when hovering over thumbnail.   </pre>
