<title>Issue 11029 -   chromium -    Purpose of GoogleUpdate.exe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53    What is the purpose of GoogleUpdate.exe?    Even if i disable it from msconfig it still pops up again.    1--i have disabled &quot;Help make Google Chrome better ... to Google&quot; in   options. so it shouldn't be running.    2--it does not at all download or check for the latest version. i have to   do it from &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; from many many previous versions.    so what does it do........?????????? </pre>
