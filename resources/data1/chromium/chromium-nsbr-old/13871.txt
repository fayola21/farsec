<title>Issue 13871 -   chromium -    signalize &quot;end of document reached&quot; when searching for text on a page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1    When searching for a text on a web page  moving between occurences doesn't   display anything when end of document is reached  and we start over from the   beginning of the page. The only way to understand that is to watch scrollbar   which is not where user attention is when searching for a text.    For large pages with many occurences  it would be very helpful if some   alertbox is given / infobar is shown / mouse cursor changes its shape for a   second--upon reaching the end of the page (or even better when we complete   the cycle and the next occurences shown will be the same as already   reviewed). </pre>
