<title>Issue 20038 -   chromium -    Web content UI jank when 'automatically detect settings' (proxy) is enabled. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm on a fast but non-standard connection (Desktop wired to another Desktop   and sharing its USB-wifi-to-DSL connection[1])  and Chrome 4.0.202.0 has   super UI jank.    When loading a complex page[2]  the tab  and the content of other tabs    becomes unresponsive on and off until the link is loaded - 'unresponsive'   includes input being ignored (e.g. I can't type in this report field while   another tab is loading). Browser UI responds correctly.    Reloading the page (either by pressing reload or by going back and clicking    on the link to the page) produces the same result  though frequently less   pronounced (load time is significantly less).    [1] On paper  the connection is fast (constant 23ms pings to site in   question  0% packetloss)  as is the machine (I7/4ghz/12GB)  though the first   load takes 10+ seconds  which makes me think the connection has other issues   that exacerbate the jank.
