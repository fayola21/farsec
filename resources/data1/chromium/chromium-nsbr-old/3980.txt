<title>Issue 3980 -   chromium -    BSOD at various times when using Chromium builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I don't have a reliable way to reproduce the issue. It has occurred two  times  on different builds of Chromium on XP  once last week in the high  3000s range and most recently on build 4384. The first time this occurred   I was restarting the browser with about 150 tabs (spread over 4 windows)  loading. The most recent occurrence was when I attempted to drag a window  playing a flash video (<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/825756">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/825756</a>) into another  window with about 8 tabs. This immediately produced a blue screen with the  following error codes:    STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005  0xBF81246E  0xA5AB11DC  0x00000000)  Win32k.sys Address BF81246E base at BF800000    Please provide
