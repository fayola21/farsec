<title>Issue 20153 -   chromium -    Opening new page causes too much I/O operations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all    When you open a new tab Chrome/Chromium does too much I/O reads (or maybe   writes). This is main cause of Chrome slowness during I/O peaks (while   copying big files or something). Opening a page = about a second on a   decent box.    Thats too much.    New page should open IMMEDIATELY and user should be allowed to enter his   query or http addres WHILE the Chrome/Chromium is loading the data like   history or speed dial.     I think this is already what it does but it is not working properly yet.    Steps to reproduce:    1) Extract some very big archive or copy some big file like ISO  2) Start up a clean instance of Chrome/Chromium  3) Open a page  4) There is 500-900ms lag between new page appears    I have tested this on Linux  on Windows the lag is not so big (maybe a   hudred of ms). </pre>
