<title>Issue 4590 -   chromium -    Different sizes of SSL info dialogs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.23(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5672">r5672</a>)  This has been reproducing in the last two builds  but finally got the repro  steps.      1. Install Google Chrome WITH clean profile [This is important]  2. Navigate to any SSL webpage     (eg: <a href="https://www.sourceforge.net">https://www.sourceforge.net</a> )  3. Click TWICE on Security lock button to display security info dialog.    Notice you will be displayed with two different sizes of Info dialogs.  [screenshot attached].    Please note  this reproduces only once after installation with clean  profile. Not sure  regression or not (?).   </pre>
