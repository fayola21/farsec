<title>Issue 20774 -   chromium -    [Linux] Highlighting off low-opacity text glitches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.203.2 Safari/532.0             Safari 4: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://c6.org/toogle/index.php?phrase=google">http://c6.org/toogle/index.php?phrase=google</a>  2. Slowly highlight from bottom to top the google lines  3. Without releasing the mouse  slowly highlight off from top to bottom      The picture shouldn't have changed      Some text glitches - see screenshot.    I'll do a reduction later this week hopefully - no time right now. But my   bets are on css opacity abuse.  Note highlighting off faster (or clicking it away) makes it happen a lot   less. </pre>
