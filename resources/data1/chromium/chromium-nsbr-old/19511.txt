<title>Issue 19511 -   chromium -    Force databases and local storage ON for chrome-extension:// pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  we are coercing the --enable-databases and --enable-local-storage   flags to true if --enable-extensions is also present.    However  it is looking like we will want to enable extensions on dev before   these two are on by default on dev. So we should instead just always enable   local storage and databases on chrome-extension:// pages. That way  we can   enable extensions on dev w/o also enabling these two features for all web   pages. </pre>
