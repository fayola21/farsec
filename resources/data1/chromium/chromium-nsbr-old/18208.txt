<title>Issue 18208 -   chromium -    Audio/video sync breaks down on ogv with large gaps between valid timestamps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Play sync2.ogv from the test matrix  2. Video plays fine until 9sec when the second (or first  rather  since we   ignore 0) valid timestamp comes in  3. Video slows down like crazy until the next valid timestamp (around 18sec)   when it speeds up again to try to catch up.  4. It eventually settles out after a few of these iterations.      Video shouldn't do this. The framerate should be pretty even.    I believe this is an issue with the pipeline clock (or the edge case video   file)  not my pending algorithm CL  but I could be wrong. </pre>
