<title>Issue 4727 -   chromium -    Saving Files with Proper File Extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.23            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      Open any website and try to download a file from a link.  This can be via 2   options.  1) Through clicking a link and a window will prompt where to save   the file (ex. email attachments  etc.)  2) Right click a link  and select   &quot;Save link as...&quot;      The prompt should come up and allow you to rename the file and save   wherever.      When changing the name of the file  the file extension will be saved as   part of the file  but only the file name.  Therefore a PDF document that   should normally save as &quot;File.pdf&quot; will become saved as &quot;Filepdf&quot;.    Therefore  obviously  to open it  adding a period is required.  This is   also true of JPG files  it will save the file as &quot;ImageJPG&quot; instead of   &quot;Image.JPG&quot;   </pre>
