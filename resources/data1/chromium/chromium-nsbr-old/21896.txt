<title>Issue 21896 -   chromium -    Download shelf should behave nicely for theme install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  the download shelf appears and then disappears on theme install.    When installing a theme from a safe source  the download shelf should never   appear.  When installing from an untrusted shelf  the download shelf should   appear and give the user the chance to say NO to the untrusted theme.    On Linux  the download shelf doesn't pay attention to themes yet at all.    Windows and Linux should exhibit the same thoughtful and correct behavior. </pre>
