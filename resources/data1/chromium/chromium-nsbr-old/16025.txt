<title>Issue 16025 -   chromium -    Downmix or drop multichannel audio into stereo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of fully supporting multichannel audio  we can atleast downmix into   stereo or simply drop the extra channels when renderering.    This way we can still play content that has 5.1 audio (think movie trailers    etc...)    We might be able to use FFmpeg's av_audio_resample() function  or write   something ourselves. </pre>
