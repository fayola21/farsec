I could not catch the exact reproductive step  it looks like it happens   randomly after a while having a few tabs you are working on           Tab widths on the tab pane should be proper      Tab widths gets shrink and the new tab button goes to the right most   instead of being placed right after the tabs.    Right now I have facebook  gmail  techcrunch  a blank page and this page is   open  the issue is observable  see screenshot attached.   </pre>
