<title>Issue 7088 -   chromium -    Tabs do not display any any tax for the respected page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0      1. I opened different pages by middle clicking or CTRL+Left clicking  on links and some times closed other tabs and all of a sudden Chrome  collapses all of the tabs down to just the page icons.      The results that I expect is that Chrome does not collapse the tab down  to just the images and displays Icon of the page + the title of the page.      Chrome collapses the tabs down to only displaying the images.   </pre>
