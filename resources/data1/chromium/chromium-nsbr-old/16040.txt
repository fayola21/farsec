<title>Issue 16040 -   chromium -    Dragging a tab to a new window doesn't show popup blocker bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - create a window with a couple of tabs  - go to a test site with popups  eg popuptest.com  - generate a few popups  watch them be blocked with popup blocker bubble  - drag tab with blocked popups out to a new window    expected:  - tab in new window should still have popup blocker bubble    actual:  - tab no longer has popup blocker bubble.    We're not being told to create one by the backend  I need to see how  windows does this. </pre>
