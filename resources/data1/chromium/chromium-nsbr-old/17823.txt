<title>Issue 17823 -   chromium -    Media controls overlap the video incorrectly when viewing the video inside the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enter any supported video into the omnibox URL.    Expected: when mousing over  the controls properly overlap the &lt;video&gt;   element and are flush with the bottom.    Actual: the controls are lowered by ~16px than normal.    Refer to screenshot. </pre>
