<title>Issue 10536 -   chromium -    Windowless Flash plugin videos don't paint at times if the plugin initially has a zero clip rect. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Navigate to   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=in+plain+sight">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=in+plain+sight</a>    In the first sponsored link  click &quot;Watch preview&quot; -- plugin area is drawn    has a right-click context menu  but doesn't start.  But hitting &quot;hide   preview&quot; then &quot;watch preview&quot; again makes the movie start.    This problem does not happen in test_shell or single-process mode.     I have a fix for this on my machine. </pre>
