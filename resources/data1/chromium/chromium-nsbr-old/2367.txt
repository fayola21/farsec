<title>Issue 2367 -   chromium -    Repeated authorization requests with Kerio firewall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. User's system: a desktop system  Asus MB M2N-MX SE  Athlon64 X2  4000+  HD SATA 160 GB  1 GB RAM DDR2  Windows XP SP3 fully patched  and  Sunbelt Kerio Personal Firewall 4.6.1845.0.  2.  User installed Chrome  and a window keeps popping asking for  authorization.  User gives the authorization  creating a rule to not ask  me again about it.  The window keeps popping  it's impossible to  browse with it.  User changed the rules manually  but the problem  persists  somehow the rule changes on its own to keep asking for  authorization.
