<title>Issue 10558 -   chromium -    Sanitize schemes in URLs from all autocomplete providers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we strip &quot;http:// from the displayed URL when the user didn't type   it -- but only from some autocomplete providers (e.g. history URL).  At least   history fulltext  and maybe others  need to do a better job here.  Perhaps   the right answer is to hoist some of this stuff to a global helper function. </pre>
