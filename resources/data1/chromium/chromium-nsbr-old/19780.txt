<title>Issue 19780 -   chromium -    Invalid or non-canonical URL in a bookmark will cause sync failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1956147    Chromium        3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19432)    Repro Steps:  1) Client A is connected to sync and Client B is connected to sync also   with same account. Both client has just 1 bookmark 'Google' with URL   'www.google.com' and both clients are in sync.  2) Client A - Close chrome and go to JSON file and change URL to  'http://www.goog%25%24/#$%$@$$@$!#!# .  9-0-  9089878978^$^%$%@$#!@#!~@(*()+)+)+_)_+(__~~~&gt;&lt;le.com/'    Expected:  Chrome should not create any duplicate and should handle this gracefully.    Actual:  BM got duplicated (Google.com and Invalid URL) . So total 2 bookmarks in   the end. Client B crashed eventually when I tried to add another bookmark   to client A using UI.    [/from internal bug]    This crash probably (?) occurs before the URL even gets to the sync code    when parsing the URLs. </pre>
