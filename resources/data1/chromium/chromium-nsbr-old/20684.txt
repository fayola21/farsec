<title>Issue 20684 -   chromium -    Browsing locked while deleting history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.203.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24690">r24690</a>  OS + version : gHardy  CPU architecture : 64-bit  window manager : metacity      1. CTRL-H  to open the History tab  2. Choose a day and click on &quot;Delete history for this day&quot;  3. Go to another tab or browser window.  4. Try to do something  like click a link or navigate to a new URL.      The actions performed in the browsing tab are satisfied (e.g. a web page is   opened).      The browsing tab  or any tab or window in the same Chrome session  just   sits there until the &quot;History Delete&quot; operation is done (which in my   testing  takes way too long  at 30-40 seconds for an average day's   history).   </pre>
