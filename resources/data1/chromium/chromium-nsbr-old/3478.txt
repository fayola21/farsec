<title>Issue 3478 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] Support 3rd party font engine to improve render smoother - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  discuss/browse_thread/thread/66b3337822264049        As you know  there are some 3rd party font engines  such as GDI++   &lt;<a href="http://www39.atwiki.jp/gdiplusplus/">http://www39.atwiki.jp/gdiplusplus/</a>&gt;  which could hook Windows font   related APIs  and render font more smoother.       In my opinion  that engine seems better than ClearType or other   build-in Windows font engine.       For Chromium  it use multi-processes structure  a standalone   render process will render the page in sandbox. It means that we   should know which process need be hooked for font smoother.       So I made some slight changes in Chromium to support GDI++       1. a new command line parameter &quot;--use-gdipp=&lt;filename&gt;&quot;  which   give a setting file for GDI++       2. the initialize and finalize code in RendererMain function    which load and free the font engine       3. a customized GDI++ library which will be linked as static   library in chrome.dll library     The detail steps     <a href="http://flierlu.blogspot.com/2008/10/use-3rd-party-font-render-engine-">http://flierlu.blogspot.com/2008/10/use-3rd-party-font-render-engine-</a>  in.html     </pre>
