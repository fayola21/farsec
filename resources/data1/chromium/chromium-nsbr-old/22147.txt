<title>Issue 22147 -   chromium -    [Leopard Only] Clicking Chrome Dock icon doesn't switch spaces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testing-102.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)  - Only.    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 4.0.209.0 SVN Revision: 26105      QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32.18      1. Select System Preferences  Expose and Spaces.  2. Select the Spaces Tab and check the box that says &quot;Enable Spaces.&quot;  3. Assign Chromium to Space 1  iTunes(or another app of your choice) to        Space 2 and Safari to Space 3 Preview to space 4.  4. Download a mp3 song.  5. On the download bar click on download and select &quot; Always Open type&quot;  6. Download another mp3 song.  7. The song is opend in iTunse in space 2  8. Click on the Chromium icon on doc to go back to space 1.    What is the expected output?   Clicking on Chromium icon on the doc should take back to space 1 where   chromium is already open.      What do you see instead?  Does not go back to space 1 when clicked on the chromium dock icon.    additional information.    1. On the top of the wrong space it shows only the menu bar of Chromium    when clicked on the Doc Icon.    2. When we try the same in Safari   and we click on safari it goes back to   safari .    3. Same issue if we try with other apps like preview.    4. In many instances when moving between spaces with space1 in   Chromium and space 3 with Chrome  clicking on the dock icons of   Chromium or Chrome some times do not take us to the expected space.    5. This is only on Leopard and works fine on SnowLeopard. </pre>
