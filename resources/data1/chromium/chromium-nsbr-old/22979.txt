Install 'Mappy' extension.  2. Open any page which has valid address. (ie.  <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html">http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html</a>)  3. Click on Mappy extension.    Expected result:  3.1 Mappy opens new Google maps page with address located.    Actual result:  3.2 Looks like Mappy opens a map page in extension bar itself.
