<title>Issue 1746 -   chromium -    Update check doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Tools &gt; About Chromium      Chromium should check the current version and compare it with the latest   version. It should then inform me if I have the latest version.      Chromium says &quot;Checking for updates...&quot;  and stays stuck in this mode - it   just perennially keeps doing this...    Please provide
