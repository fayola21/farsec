<title>Issue 17271 -   chromium -    detect 'font-size: small' (x-small  xx-small) in &quot;pre-html5&quot; pages  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off <a title="[chinese.usembassy-china.org.cn]: Font size too small on chinese.usembassy-china.org.cn"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14851">issue 14851</a> (see my comment 10 there).     'small' (and 'medium'  'large'  etc)  in   Webkit/Gecko and the IE8 mode is different from 'small' in the IE6/7 mode.    'font-size: small' in IE6/7 mode (of IE8) is larger than in Webkit/Gecko.   For Chinese characters  'small'  'x-small'  'xx-small' are too small in   Webkit/Gecko.     It appears that some websites use small  x-small and so forth extensively   without testing their sites in Chrome/Safari/Firefox.      Johny  you may want to consider detecting web pages meeting the following   two conditions with your compat/evangelism issue   finding tool.       - No Doctype or html4 or ealier doctype (I'm not sure how IE8 treats   HTML4 strict  as opposed to HTML4 transitional doctype)    - font-size is set to 'small'  'medium'  'large'  'x-small'  etc     </pre>
