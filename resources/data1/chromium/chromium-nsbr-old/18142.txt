<title>Issue 18142 -   chromium -    Socks4a not being activated. DNS requests leak even if DNS packets blocked.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :    Google Chrome	3.0.196.0 (Official Build 22005)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)  AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.196.0 Safari/532.0        1. Use a socks proxy setting.  2. Go to any website.      Chrome is supposed to have socks4a which means DNS requests do not leak and  are forwarded to the proxy.        DNS requests leak. Someone told me that socks4a is only enabled when the  host name fails to resolve. So I used my firewall to block port 53 (DNS).  But then chrome stopped working and I couldn't visit any websites at all. </pre>
