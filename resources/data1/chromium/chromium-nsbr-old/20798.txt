<title>Issue 20798 -   chromium -    Plugin-opened windows (e.g.  Gmail upload) don't come forward on app switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Click &quot;Attach a file&quot; in Gmail  2. When the window comes up  switch to another app  3. Switch back to Chrome by clicking on the Dock icon (or a Chrome window)        The upload window is &quot;gone&quot; (it's actually still there  but behind other   windows  with no way of bringing it forward other than digging it out by   moving other windows).    We need to keep track of when we have a modal plugin window open  and   force it forward when we are activated. </pre>
