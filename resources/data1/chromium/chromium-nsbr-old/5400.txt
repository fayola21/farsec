<title>Issue 5400 -   chromium -    Mananger Download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome is perfect  no more use Firefox and not the Internet   Explorer  I love all the functions  but there is only a function that I   sad to him  is that when you put it to download and   without wanting to close all tabs the download is interrupted so   silent. And sometimes things have to be repeated because   that. I think it would be very important if a message was displayed   in this case that the download is underway and the user tries to close the   browser.   ;)   </pre>
