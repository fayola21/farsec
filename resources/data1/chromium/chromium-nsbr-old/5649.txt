<title>Issue 5649 -   chromium -    Two trivial issues with Default Search Dropdown box. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   I will observe two trivial issues with &quot;Default Search&quot; dropdown box of  Options/Basics tab.    Issue 1:  Per every launch of Options dialog  -Click on Dropdown box to expand the list.  -Press any 1st letter (excluding with that of the current default search  engine) (Eg: if google is ur current default one  press y to select yahoo)    Expected:  Yahoo should be selected in the dropdown box  but the list should be still  expanded.    Result:  The list auto closes.    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue 2 </a>:  [Hoping after demonstrating the issue 1]  -Click on the dropdown list to expand the list and keep your mouse pointer  out of the list.  -Press any 1st character  say: L to live Search (hoping google is ur  current default one)  -click down the mouse to select the Live search as the default one.    Result:   -Live Search is selected in the dropdown box as along as the list is  expanded. Once you mouse click  then the option in the dropdown box is set  back to its previous option (in this case google)    Expected:  Live Search should be selected in the dropdown box  for mouse click out  side the box.         </pre>
