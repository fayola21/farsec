<title>Issue 8652 -   chromium -    Can't resize from bottom border when browser window is minimum height - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.170.0 (Developer Build 11328)        1. Pass the mouse cursor over the top or bottom border until you get a  Resize cursor.   2. Grab the top or bottom border and resize the window to its minimum  possible height.    What is the expected output?     Should be able to get a Resize cursor on the bottom border when window is  sized to its minimum height.    What do you see instead?    Can't get a Resize cursor on the bottom border (therefore  can't grab and  resize from the bottom).   </pre>
