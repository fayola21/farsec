<title>Issue 23162 -   chromium -    Cache ignored on page-refresh for some dynamic scripts with cache-headers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Dynamically add a few script-elements to the DOM (via   document.createElement)  whose URL is a dynamic script (.php for instance)   with url ? paramaters. Generate random-number url parameters for the   scripts so that on each page load  a new set of scripts is guaranteed.  2. Make sure in the server script to output valid cache headers with far-  future-expires.  3. Attempt to re-add later *to the same page* one or more of the scripts   that should have been cached by #1 above.  4. Watch server logs  notice that all scripts were reloaded from cache   (nearly immediately) without hits to the server. Good!  5. Now  hit F5 or click the refresh button  refreshing the page (and thus   generating a fresh set of script urls to download for that new page   instance).  6. Then  re-add those same script urls to the page a second time (same as   #3)  and watch server logs.  7. Close the page/browser  and reopen to the page  again obviously   regenerating a fresh set of urls to download for the page instance.  8. Then  again  re-add the same script urls to the page a second time (as   with #3 and #6)  and watch server logs.        In #6 and #8  I expect all scripts to be reloaded from cache in the same   page instance  when added to the page the second time  just like in #4.       In #8 (after a clean opening of the page) they are  but in #6 (after a   F5/refrehs)  one or more of the scripts are *not* reloaded from cache when   added the second time  but are instead reloaded from server as if missing   from cache. This same behavior persists on the page through mulitple   refrehes. But  once the page is closed and reopened  the happy behavior of   using the cache for reloads in the same page instance comes back. It only   starts being flaky after a F5/refresh.    <b>Please provide
