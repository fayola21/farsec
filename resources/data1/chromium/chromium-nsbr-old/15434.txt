<title>Issue 15434 -   chromium -    Custom frame drawing corruption on resize in metacity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> a user reported this in channel today. He said he was using metacity with   compositing (as I understand it  when you turn on compositing in gnome it   switches to compiz?). He said he was using ToT.    Perhaps the one known as shenki_ will come here to offer more details  such   as whether the resize was a &quot;make larger&quot; or &quot;make smaller&quot; drag. </pre>
