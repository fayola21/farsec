<title>Issue 1139 -   chromium -    Bookmark favorite &quot;save as&quot; locations - enhancement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like the ability to quickly select favorited folders that I   frequently save files to. I download a lot of different types of data from   the internet in a short amount of time  and switching between my folders   can become a hassle when I want to quickly save a file. </pre>
