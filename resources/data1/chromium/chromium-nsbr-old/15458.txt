<title>Issue 15458 -   chromium -    Gratuitous transparency on NNTP menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The menu used on the NNTP is partially transparent  making text behind the   menu obscure the text in the menu.  I have crusaded against this for years   in Chrome; for example  the omnibox drop-down used to be partially   transparent and it was fixed.    Transparency just makes things harder to read.  Just say no.  :D </pre>
