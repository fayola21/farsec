<title>Issue 17373 -   chromium -    [feature request] debugging content script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request.  Debugging toolstrip extension script works seamlessly. But I cannot debug  content script.  When there's an error in content script  usually the console does not  tell me which line is wrong. It just shows a red circle with a cross  inside  and [object Object] next to it. That makes debugging clueless.  console.log works in content script. This is a work-around  but tedious for  large extension code. </pre>
