<title>Issue 6955 -   chromium -    Menus don't quite function like normal Windows menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0      1. Click on one of the menu buttons (wrench  back button etc.)  but don't   release the mouse button  2. Hover pointer over a menu item  and THEN release the mouse button      Menu item is selected.  E.g. if it was &quot;About Google Chrome&quot;  the about   dialog appears.      The menu item isn't selected.  You have to click on it.    If this was a deliberate decision made so you don't have to hold the button   down while looking at the back-button's weird dropdown menu  please   reconsider it.  Surely we can think of a way to have the convenience of   normal menus AND a simple back/forward interface. </pre>
