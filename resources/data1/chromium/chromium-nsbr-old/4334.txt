<title>Issue 4334 -   chromium -    Crash when clicking empty select element. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Here is a very simple example that triggers it:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    Load that and click on the select element and it will crash.  From  PopupMenuChromium.cpp getRowHeight  we pass -1 to itemStyle on  RenderMenuList which expects an unsigned int.  We use the resulting very  big value to index into a Vector.  Something most have changed in the  interface in one of the last merges. </pre>
