<title>Issue 6242 -   chromium -    Open user created bookmark toolbar folders cannot be closed with a second click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1        Firefox 3: OK    Steps to reproduce:  1. Click a user-created bookmark toolbar folder; a dropdown menu appears.  2. Click the user-created bookmark toolbar folder again; notice the   drowpdown menu opens again  with a flicker.  3. Click the &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; folder; a dropdown menu appears.  4. Click the &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; folder again; notice the drowpdown menu   closes.    What shoud occur:  All open bookmark folders residing inside the bookmark toolbar should close   when clicked for a second time.  This is the way the bookmark toolbar in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 works.    How to fix it:   Make the open user-created bookmark toolbar folders close on a second   click.    [1] This folder contains imported bookmarks and is created and populated by   Chrome. If bookmarks from another browser have been imported  this folder   will appear on the far right of the bookmark toolbar and inside the   Bookmark Manager. I guess this is why Chrome treats this folder   differently. </pre>
