<title>Issue 6855 -   chromium -    Revert default security style for intranet host certs to &quot;auth broken&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pages served over SSL with a cert which name is a intranet host should be considered   as auth broken by default.    This was the actual behavior and has been changed for the beta as it was causing an   other bug 1177908.  The problem is that we do not have an error status for this case or error strings   (since it is not a real SSL generated error).  Also  from a user perspective  the page info would not explain why the page is   insecure.  Since IE reports the page as OK  Ian has agreed on also reporting such pages as safe.    This should be reverted after beta and error strings and cert status created   accordingly.  (see ssl_policy.cc SSLPolicy::GetDefaultStyle(const GURL&amp; url))    Note: bug imported from Buganizer #1178228 </pre>
