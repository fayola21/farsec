<title>Issue 3018 -   chromium -    Closing tab freezes all tabs for about five seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a new tab  2. Close the new tab (either immediately or after some time)      I expect some slight degree of higher CPU usage from whatever cleanup tasks   the tab needs to perform.      CPU usage (as seen through the Windows Task Manager) is unchanged  but all   of Chrome remains unresponsive for about 5 seconds.  I can't switch to any   other tabs  bring up the Chrome Task Manager  or click on any buttons or   menus in Chrome.  If I minimize the Chrome window and restore  the window   will not redraw until the ~5 seconds have passed.  Then everything works   normally again.    Please provide
