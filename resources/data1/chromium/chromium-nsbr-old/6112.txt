<title>Issue 6112 -   chromium -    The AutocompletePopup class breaks ligatures in an Arabic word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1109823&gt;    Reported by hbono:    Many Arabic character codes have two or more shapes. When Windows displays   an Arabic string  Windows scans the characters in the string  chooses the   best shape  and use them. For example  when Windows displays an Arabic word   &quot;��__��_��_��_��_&quot; (U+��_��_0633  U+0644  U+0627  U+0645)  which means &quot;peace&quot;  it scans four   Arabic characters '��__' (U+0633)  '��_��_' (U+0644)  '��__' (U+0627)  '��_����_' (U+0645)    chooses the best shape for each character with surrounding characters  and   displays their combined script. (It is a reason why it is not so easy to   read Arabic scripts.)  On the other hand  when the AutocompletePopup class displays a matching   text  it splits the text into a matching parts and non-matching parts  and   calls the TextOut() function separately for each part. This breaks Arabic   ligatures and I do need a generic solution to avoid this problem without   using a large &quot;if () {...}&quot; block.  (Even though I have not tested yet  I assume Hebrew Niqquds cause the same   problem but I'm wondering if this problem is so fatal for Hebrews because I   have heard Hebrews can read Hebrew words without Niqquds.)       </pre>
