<title>Issue 15709 -   chromium -    NNTP: Thumbnails swapping should trigger in all opened NNTPs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Swapping the thumbnails in one NNTP  should trigger the change in all opened   NNTPs. Right now user has to refresh the NNTP to get swap to be reflected.    We should do this  as we do incase of most recent activities (recently closed   and downloads).  </pre>
