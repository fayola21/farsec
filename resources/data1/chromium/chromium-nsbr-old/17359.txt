<title>Issue 17359 -   chromium -    chromium fails to start if %APPDATA%Google doesn't exist [and it's sub folders] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Install chrome as one user  2. switch to new user [i.e. %APPDATA%Google doesn't exist nor its   subfolders]  3. Attempt to start chrome      It should auto-create those files  I'd imagine.        Chrome responds by doing nothing.  No error message  but also no startup--  somewhat bewildering of an answer :)  Thanks.  =r </pre>
