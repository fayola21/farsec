<title>Issue 11216 -   chromium -    impossible not to get the layout tests  they just come with the source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i am just getting the source code  and i cannot prevent my machine from getting the layout tests    <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code</a>    you said :   &quot;custom_deps&quot; : {        &quot;src/webkit/data/layout_tests/LayoutTests&quot;: None       }    i have 2 things to say  1- it doesn't work  you still get the layout tests  not just the directory   structure  but i mean all the files in them  2- even the name layout_tests/LayoutTests looks suspicious as there is no   such folder in your trunk build    here is my entire .gclient file     # An element of this array (a &quot;solution&quot;) describes a repository directory  # that will be checked out into your working copy.  Each solution may  # optionally define additional dependencies (via its DEPS file) to be  # checked out alongside the solution's directory.  A solution may also  # specify custom dependencies (via the &quot;custom_deps&quot; property) that  # override or augment the dependencies specified by the DEPS file.  # If a &quot;safesync_url&quot; is specified  it is assumed to reference the location   of  # a text file which contains nothing but the last known good SCM revision   to  # sync against. It is fetched if specified and used unless --head is passed  solutions = [    { &quot;name&quot;        : &quot;src&quot;       &quot;url&quot;         : &quot;<a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src</a>&quot;       &quot;custom_deps&quot; : {        # To use the trunk of a component instead of what's in DEPS:        #&quot;component&quot;: &quot;https://svnserver/component/trunk/        # To exclude a component from your working copy:        &quot;src/webkit/data/layout_tests/LayoutTests&quot;: None       }       &quot;safesync_url&quot;: &quot;&quot;    }  ]    i am aware of the possibility this is a gclient bug  but whatever....    any clean machine will reproduce this  i have Vista 32 SP1  and i opened it all in &quot;c:chromiumtrunk&quot;    thanx   </pre>
