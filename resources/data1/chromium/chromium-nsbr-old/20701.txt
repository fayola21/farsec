<title>Issue 20701 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: ctl-l while focus in omnibox doesn't select text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4.0.203.2  64-bit  gnome.      1. Type in a prefix of a site you visit frequently; omnibox highlights the   completion.  2. Hit ctl-L.      Expected: All text selected in omnibox.  Actual: only tail is selected.    Would it help to make a list of expected omnibox behaviors so you can run   through them before making a commit?  It feels like each change introduces   more regressions. </pre>
