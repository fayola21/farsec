<title>Issue 18895 -   chromium -    Inhibit power management when downloading or playing videos (Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GNOME has an API for preventing temporarily the computer from automatically going into power saving mode   (such as sleep/hibernate/poweroff).    In particular  <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~mccann/gnome-session/docs/gnome-">http://www.gnome.org/~mccann/gnome-session/docs/gnome-</a>  session.html#org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibit     gnome session has a D-Bus interface called org.gnome.SessionManager.Inhibitor (to know why this is not   done using gnome-power-manager  see <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2009/01/28/inhibits-and-the-new-">http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2009/01/28/inhibits-and-the-new-</a>  world-order/)    It would be very nice if Chromium inhibited suspend when downloading files (or anything that really   shouldn't be interrupted). </pre>
