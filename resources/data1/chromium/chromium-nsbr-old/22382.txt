<title>Issue 22382 -   chromium -    Create a context menu for toolstrips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a context menu when you right click on toolstrips.  In it we   could put things like &quot;hide toolstrip&quot;  &quot;uninstall extension&quot;  &quot;inspect   element&quot;  etc.    We used to hardcode right click to bringing up the inspector.  Now that   that's removed (iss 20634)  we can add a real menu. </pre>
