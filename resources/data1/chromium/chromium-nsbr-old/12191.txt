<title>Issue 12191 -   chromium -    Bad dependency in src/app/test_suite.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> src/app/test_suite.h has a bad soft dependency on the existence of  Chromium.app.    test_suite.h has setup code that associates the test executable with  Chromium.app's application bundle. Since src/app is a lower level component  than src/chrome  a dependency shouldn't exist in that direction even if  it's soft like this one  since not all src/app clients eventually may build  src/chrome.    Instead  src/app should provide its own app bundle for testing purposes. </pre>
