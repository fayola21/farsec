<title>Issue 17867 -   chromium -    extensions auto-update has a min frequency of 1 hour in release builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You can specify the update frequency on the command line for testing  but in   release mode the minimum is still 1 hour.

The right solution to this problem is really to fix <a title="Add UI to trigger extensions auto-update" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17853"> Issue   17853 </a>   but for now it's probably enough to just lower this to 60 seconds. </pre>
