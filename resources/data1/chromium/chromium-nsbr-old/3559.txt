<title>Issue 3559 -   chromium -    Minimize button is highlighted when the browser window is &quot;restored&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Based on Ben's request  I'm filing this as a separate issue.    --launch Chorme and maximize the browser window.  --Minimize the browser window by clicking on the minimize button.  --Click on the chrome button on task bar to restore it.    You can notice the minimize button is highlighted.    See the attached screenshot.   </pre>
