<title>Issue 10530 -   chromium -    Layout test regression form webkit merge 42440:42523 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test was changed upstream in <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42447">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/42447</a> to   include window.showModalDialog  which we give as undefined.    LayoutTests/fast/dom/Window/window-function-frame-getter-precedence.html    We need to investigate if this is wrong  or needs re-baselining. </pre>
