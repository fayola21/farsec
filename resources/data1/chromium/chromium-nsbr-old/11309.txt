<title>Issue 11309 -   chromium -    Localhost don't open when offline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.0 (Vers��_��_o do desenvolvedor 14495)  URLs (if applicable) : http://localhost/           Safari 4: WORK    Firefox 3.x: WORK           IE 7: WORK           IE 8: WORK      1. Try http://localhost/ it don't work  2. Try http://127.0.0.1/ it work  The question is: HOSTS say that &quot;localhost&quot; is &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  Chromium don't   understand this WHEN you is OFFLINE  if you is ONLINE  open correctly.  I tested online in XP and work; I tested offline in VISTA and don't work.   Maybe bug on VISTA ou OFFLINE  I belive BELIVE.      That open 127.0.0.1 when write localhost      Page error when offline.   </pre>
