<title>Issue 18218 -   chromium -    Memory leak in _pthread_exit on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Goodness knows why  but this seems to be tickled specifically  and reliably by the ui tests DownloadTest.* and SavePageTest.*.    I would think it's just a system problem to not worry  about  but why is it specific to those particular tests?    Valgrind complains:    144 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 6 382 of 7 708    malloc (coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:194)    __addHandler2  (/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation)    __NSFinalizeThreadData  (/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation)    _pthread_tsd_cleanup (/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib)    _pthread_exit (/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib)    thread_start (/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib)   </pre>
