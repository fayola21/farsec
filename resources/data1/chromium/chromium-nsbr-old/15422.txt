<title>Issue 15422 -   chromium -    Clickable menus don't expand in Wordpress 2.0.7 admin interface for editing posts (wp-admin/post.php) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190  on both Linux and OSX          Safari 4: OK      Firefox 3.x: OK      IE 7 and IE8: [did not test]      1. install version 2.0.7 of Wordpress  2. go the wp-admin/post.php page  3. click on any of the &quot;+&quot;-marked menu items on the right-hand column   in the Wordpress UI for that page (e.g.  Discussion  Password-Protect Post    Post Slug  Categories  Post Status  etc.)        The expected result is that clicking on one of those menu items should   cause it to expand to reveal some form controls that you can set or enter   date into.          What happens instead is that the menus don't expand when you click on   them. </pre>
