<title>Issue 6141 -   chromium -    Two feature requests for &quot;New Window in Profile&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing as feature requests only.    We know &quot;New Window in Profile&quot; feature is really very handy for the  people  who deal with multiple profiles. But  I see  it will be more  convenient  if we support the following two feature requests.     [This usecase is applicable  if user is in non-incognito mode]  1. Create a new profile window  IFF it does not exist for that profile:  If user selects different profile  then bring up that profile's window (if  exists) otherwise create a new window for that particular profile.  It that way  we can make sure  user does not end up with multiple windows  finally and we can make sure user is really getting the feeling of  switching among profiles instead of messing of profiles by creating so many  different windows for different profiles and finally the user has to search  for his/her profile��_��_��_s window.   [If user wants explicitly to create a new window for any profile  we have  the option ��_��_��_New Window��_��_��_ for that.]    [This usecase is applicable  if user is in incognito mode ]  2. New Profile selected from  Incognito mode should start in Incognito mode  only.  If user is in incognito mode  selecting a different profile should start in  incognito mode only for that profile  in that way there is no need for the  user to launch incognito mode in that profile also.   If user is in incognito mode and selects another  profile  I don��_��_��_t see any  reason to launch that  profile in non-incognito mode which is our current  behavior.           </pre>
