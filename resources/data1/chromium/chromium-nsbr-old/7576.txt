<title>Issue 7576 -   chromium -    When not specified as default browser on install  Chrome does not register with Windows correctly (Vista+) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Insall and uncheck &quot;Make Chrome default browser&quot;  2. Open Start-&gt;Default Programs          Chrome should be available from the Windows dialog  and one should be able   to set Chrome as the default browser.    Chrome does not install its class and capability information   (HKLMSoftwareClasseschrome.exe).  Further  it does not register itself   as an application &quot;SoftwareRegisteredApplications&quot; and is hence invisible   to Windows Internet Options dialog.    Not checking the button should simply not change the &quot;UserChoice&quot; values   (in Vista) and not register as a protocol handler.  However it should still   register the class and capability information.  Without it  the only means   of making Chrome the default browser is to do it through Chrome:Wrench-  &gt;Options.      This works properly in XP.    It seems there this an inappropriate code fork in the install logic.         </pre>
