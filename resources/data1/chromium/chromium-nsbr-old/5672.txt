<title>Issue 5672 -   chromium -    Socket Operations differ from Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.155.0 (6886)    We analyzed the socket operations by Iron in an LSP (Layered Service   Provider). What we see in distinction from Chrome is that most socket   operations will be executed in overlapped mode (WSPSend()) except of direct   mode. Is this behavior by design or a misbehavior? In fact no other browser    acts like this.    regards   Thomas Kluge  Berlin </pre>
