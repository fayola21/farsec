<title>Issue 12045 -   chromium -    New tab fonts change size 3 times when loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Close Chrome.  Start it  find the location on the screen where the &quot;Most   visited&quot; text comes up  close it again  start again and watch that position   carefully.    The text goes from large to small in one flicker  then changes again after   the page loads (the second one is more subtle  but you can see the &quot;i&quot; in   &quot;visited&quot; changing their width by a pixel or two).      Glen said he knew about this so maybe there's a bug filed already but it's   pretty hideous and still unfixed so maybe not?    I can't repro this on Linux right now but that may be because our new tab   takes so long to start. </pre>
