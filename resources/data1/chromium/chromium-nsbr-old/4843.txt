<title>Issue 4843 -   chromium -    Autofill code should use a RefPtr on the input element used in the task - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In editor_client_impl.cc  textDidChangeInTextField() post a task to do the   autofill with an Element* as parameter.  We should use a RefPtr or make sure to increase the ref count to make sure   the element cannot be deleted before the task is executed.    Would be good to write a test to validate that behavior (and also a test   that ensure we don't crash with input element not part of forms see <a title="REGRESSION: Renderer crash on blogger" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4825"> bug 4825 </a>).   </pre>
