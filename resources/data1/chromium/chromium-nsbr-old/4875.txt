<title>Issue 4875 -   chromium -    307 redirect resets method to GET - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to the HTTP RFC at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-</a>  sec10.html  an HTTP 307 redirect should keep the current HTTP method.    However  Safari resets the method to GET.  I haven't debugged this enough   to know whether this is a WebKit bug or a URLRequest bug.  I also haven't   tested --new-http yet.    Test case:    <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/test/redirection/">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/test/redirection/</a>   </pre>
