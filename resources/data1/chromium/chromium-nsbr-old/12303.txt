<title>Issue 12303 -   chromium -    Chrome falls back to DIRECT connections once all proxies have failed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome has an implicit fallback to DIRECT for proxy lists. This policy is   different from other browsers (IE and Firefox)  which give up rather than   falling back to direct if it wasn't explicit.    For example  given the proxy list:    &quot;PROXY proxy:6233; PROXY fallbackproxy:6234&quot;    If both of those proxy servers are dead  then IE/Firefox will display an   error page. Whereas Chrome will try using a direct connection.    So in essense  chrome behaves as if the list were:    &quot;PROXY proxy:6233; PROXY fallbackproxy:6234; DIRECT&quot;    I think it would be best to match this behavior if for nothing else than to   be consistent/compatible with other browsers.   </pre>
