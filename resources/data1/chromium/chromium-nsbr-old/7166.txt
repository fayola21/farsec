<title>Issue 7166 -   chromium -    A message coming from a web page should inherit its directionality from that of the web page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since Chrome UI strings are localized strings  they inherit directionality   from Chrome UI's.     But a message coming from a web page should inherit its directionality from   that of the web page  disregarding what the Chrome UI directionality is.    For example  a JS alert message should inherit its directionality from the   overall web page document directionality. Please refer to   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6099">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6099</a> for more   information.     The current fix of <a title="bad display of multi-line English message in pop-ups" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6099"> issue 6099 </a> is to use heuristics to determine the   message's directionality. The directionality is based on the first   character with strong directionality in the message.    The right fix should be inheriting the directionality from web page's.       </pre>
