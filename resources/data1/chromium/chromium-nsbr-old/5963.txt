<title>Issue 5963 -   chromium -    Login forms: backspace does not trigger the autocompetion engine  like other keys would do. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium build 7477 (bug has always been there)  URLs (if applicable) : NA  Other browsers tested: NA        --------------------------------------    1. Have two accounts on a website  with a common prefix.     For example  consider the gmail accounts &quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;FooBar&quot;.    2. Go to the gmail.com  log-in  and let Chromium remember both accounts/passwords.    3. Whenever you go back to gmail.com  note that the login is pre-filled with the last username you used.    If &quot;Foo&quot; is the prefilled value  let's say you want to log-in with &quot;FooBar&quot;. Adding the letter &quot;B&quot; will   automatically change the user to &quot;FooBar&quot; and set the corresponding password.    Now the other way around: &quot;FooBar&quot; is the prefilled value  and you want to log-in using &quot;Foo&quot;. Press backspace   a few times until you're left with &quot;Foo&quot;.        ----------------------------    Chromium should realize &quot;Foo&quot; is another remembered user  and change the password accordingly.        ---------------------    Nothing happens  and the password box still contains the password for &quot;FooBar&quot;.      Suggested fix  -------------    When we add letters in a username field  Chromium checks if this matches a &quot;remembered&quot; user  and uses auto-  completion. This sould also be the case when we hit the backspace or delete key.     </pre>
