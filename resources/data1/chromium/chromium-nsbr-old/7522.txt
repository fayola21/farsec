<title>Issue 7522 -   chromium -    Text cannot be selected in bot Bookmark entry and internal Bug Entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.1 (9376)    What steps will reproduce the problem (on the internal bug report)?  1. Clicking the Page menu  2. Selecting &quot;Report bug or broken website...&quot;  3. In the above dialog the text entry does not work correctly  4. No matter where do I click in the description box the carret is still at   the initial position (top right corner) and blinking  5. Furthermore  writing some text in the description and try to select it   with Shift + Arrow (Only happened with the right arrow) crashed the entire   browser.    Same thing happens with Editing Bookmarks  there is no text beam (carret)   and the selected text is not hilighted so I can't tell what text is   selected (The selection problem happens with both).    Hmmm the ability to select text I guess.      Crashed or unexpected behavior. </pre>
