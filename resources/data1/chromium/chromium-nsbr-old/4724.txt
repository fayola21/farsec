Close all other applications &amp; tabs  including software firewall and   anti-virus software to isolate problem.  2. Open single Google Chrome tab  3.

Click on a folder in the list on the left hand side  5b. OR  click a sort by file name if you have a lot of files  6. Open task manager  and see 98 to 100% CPU usage on single core devices    50% CPU usage on dual core devices  etc.      Chrome should function proper  and render the updated data      Web content area (IE: where we see webpages) gets locked up  and tab must   be closed or killed via task manager to release the CPU it is using.
