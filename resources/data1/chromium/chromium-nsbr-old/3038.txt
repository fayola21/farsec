<title>Issue 3038 -   chromium -    Could not save router settings successfully when used default page of router for settings  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Using AirLink router   please run the default page of router settings   using chrome  and try to set e.g. user name and password for ISP (PPPoE)   and click Apply( these are the settings which i tried). Settings doesnt   save successfully where as saved using IE on same steps.          Expected result is whatever changes I make for my router should get   reflected in the settings giving me appropriate message.          I get Error message saying Unknown response ( where as it should prompt me   a successful completion of changes in setting and should suggest some page   redirection as it happened with other browser )      Please provide
