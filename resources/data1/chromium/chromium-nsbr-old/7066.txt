<title>Issue 7066 -   chromium -    Don't generate URL-sensitive characters when converting character sets for URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A URL with the query &quot;&amp;#x695A;&quot; on a web page will generate the string   &quot;%1B$BA?%1B(B&quot;. Notice that there is a &quot;?&quot; in that string  which we're not   supposed to do.    Another example is &quot;&amp;#x85A6;&quot; which generates &quot;%1B$BA&amp;%1B(B&quot;. There is an   '&amp;' which will change the parsing of the query on the server.    When these characters that change the meaning of queries are generated by   the encoder  we should escape them. It was suggested that we can use the   &quot;offsets&quot; array ICU generates when you run the encoder to see if a given   character was generated by the encoding conversion or it was originally in   the URL (in which case we should preserve it).    This only refers to URLs on web pages and NOT URLs that are generated by   the form code. In 99.999% of the cases  the non-ASCII characters in a URL   all come from the form code (based on user input). So this is not actually   a very high priority bug. </pre>
