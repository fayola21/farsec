<title>Issue 2191 -   chromium -    Omnibar does not autocomplete to URLs not explicitly typed in before - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit a page (for example  www.example.one.com) by typing in the URL.  2. Visit another page (for example  www.example.two.com) by following a hyperlink (or   opening a bookmark). Do it say one hundred times.  3. Open a new tab. Most Visited will likely show www.example.two.com  because you   visited it 100 times. It will likely not show www.example.one.com  because you   visited it only once.  4. Start typing in the Omnibar: example      Omnibar autocompletes &quot;example&quot; to &quot;www.example.two.com&quot; (possibly among other   results)  because you visited it 100 times already  and it is displayed in the &quot;Most   Visited&quot; thumbnail gallery.      Omnibar autocompletes &quot;example&quot; to &quot;www.example.one.com&quot; (possibly among other   results)  although you've been there only once. &quot;www.example.two.com&quot; is not   displayed at all.    <b>Please provide
