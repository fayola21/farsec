<title>Issue 3093 -   chromium -    Pasting a Downloadable URL straight in a new tab does not reloads the new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.153.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/2744/chrome-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/2744/chrome-</a>  win32.zip           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: FAILS      1. Press Control+T  2. Put the URL - <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-</a>  xp/2744/chrome-win32.zip  3. Press Enter      The file will downloadwhatever the download process needs so it would   begin.      The new tab page sort of reloads.          When opening it in an existing tab that has content  it downloads.    Once I even got the &quot;waiting for cache&quot; message in the sort of status bar    stalling. </pre>
