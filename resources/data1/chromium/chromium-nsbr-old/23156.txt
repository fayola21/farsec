<title>Issue 23156 -   chromium -    Large downloads (&gt;10 MB) are occasionally failing in Google Chrome Dev (build 4.0.211.4) on Windows XP SP3 Pro. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4          Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Try downloading a large file (&gt;10 MB) from a site such as RapidShare.      The download should complete successfully.      The download occasionally fails  in which case I have to switch to Firefox   3.5.3 where it always completes successfully. Very annoying on sites like   RapidShare where you have to wait as long as 15 minutes before you can try   again.   </pre>
