<title>Issue 9510 -   chromium -    setting Chrome at startup shows about:blank page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  Browsers    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Set Chrome at startup and set a valid homepage  2. Restart your operating system  3. Upon startup  Chrome will load with your desired homepage    What happens?  I tried this on both Windows XP and Vista  XP works fine but in Vista it   shows an about:blank page and doesn't seem to load pages until you close   and relaunch it again.
