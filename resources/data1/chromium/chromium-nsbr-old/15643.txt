<title>Issue 15643 -   chromium -    tabs freeze - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've had this happen to me twice today. The tab I'm on freezes. I can't scroll   or select text. One time it happened on just one page  the second time  it   was both of my open gmail tabs (i.e. personal and work gmails).    In the first case  I closed the tab and reopened the page in a new tab and it   was fine. In the second case  I waited (minutes) and it finally fixed itself.    I ran top and nothing on my machine seemed to be using &gt;10% cpu. The   second time I hit this  I was building  but it fixed itself well before my build   finished.    I was also unable to go to the about:version page until the gmail tabs fixed   themselves.
