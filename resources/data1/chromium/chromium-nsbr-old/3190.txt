<title>Issue 3190 -   chromium -    Add a &quot;Getting Started&quot; bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Report from a Googler):  When users get Chrome installed  they might like a link  to a page that gives hints on how to use it.    For comparison  Firefox gives a bookmark to such a page (and Chrome's  import brought that over; I entered bug http://b/1413369 that we should not  import that bookmark). </pre>
