<title>Issue 14053 -   chromium -    load extensions based on prefs  not directory scan - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Rather than scanning the installed directory  we should trust preferences   with the current state of what's installed.  This should have less of a   performance drag at startup and make it easier for us to implement features   such as disabling extensions. </pre>
