<title>Issue 15912 -   chromium -    DevToolsHost.activateWindow should not change focused element when the window is already active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Stop on a breakpoint in a script.  2. Focus on Scripts panel.  3. Press F10 to go to next step  4. Repeat the previous action.       Second F10 doesn't cause 'step over' action and that is because     DevToolsHost.activateWindow() called from devtools.DebuggerAgent.prototype.handleBacktraceResponse_ causes Scripts   panel to lose focus.   </pre>
