<title>Issue 9920 -   chromium -    Middle click should not close a tab  if title bar's context menu shows up. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on Stable (1.0.154.53)  DEV: 2.0.173.1 (Official Build 13271) and   Trunk(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13423">r13423</a>).    -To better reproduce this  please have 5 or 6 tabs opened.  -Right click on title bar to show up context menu (don't dismiss it)  -Middle click on a tabstrip to close it.    Expected:  Middle click should be ignored  as context menu shows up.    Result:  Middle click closes the tab  besides context menu.    I believe we regresses here ??  as I can't able to repro in 1.0.154.48   (Official Build 9043) </pre>
