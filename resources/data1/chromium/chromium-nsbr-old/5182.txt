<title>Issue 5182 -   chromium -    run_webkit_tests.py should have a --dry_run option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The goal here is to parse the test_lists and run the bit at the end of spitting out the results to   ensure that they test_list format is correct. This is so people quickly fixing red builders can add to   the test list and run this to ensure they got the syntax right and have no duplicates without actually   needing to build test_shell and run the tests. Ideally  this would run the check pretending to be   release and debug mode for each platform.    This bug is mainly here to discuss whether this is a good idea and worth doing. </pre>
