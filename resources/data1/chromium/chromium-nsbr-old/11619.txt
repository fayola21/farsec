<title>Issue 11619 -   chromium -    Blank screen on window.open followed by document.write() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 2.0.169.1             Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK     Opera 9.63: OK    &lt;html&gt;   &lt;head&gt;     &lt;script type='text/javascript' language='javascript'&gt;         var popup;         function openPopup() {         popup = window.open(''  'foo'  '');         popup.document.write('foo bar');       }     &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;     &lt;input type='button' value='  Test  ' onclick='openPopup()'/&gt;   &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;          &quot;foo bar&quot; should appear in the popup window.          The popup window remains blank.          <a href="http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/webkit-unassigned/2009-">http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/webkit-unassigned/2009-</a>  February/099385.html (2/6/2009) seems to be related:    &quot;If a window opened with javascript window.open has all its contents   overwritten with document.write() by the opening script  the page contents   can't be saved  and the View Source option is greyed out and disabled.&quot;    but this talks only to saving and viewing the source  where we get a blank   page altogether.    More specifically  the above reference states: &quot;This bug does NOT affect   windows opened with an empty URL (about:blank)&quot; such that the code in   question should work  no? </pre>
