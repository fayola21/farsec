<title>Issue 14729 -   chromium -    Popup-menu doesn't appear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest3.html">http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest3.html</a>      1. Go to <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest3.html">http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest3.html</a>      The popup menu should appear with the FIRST generated popup      The popup menu appears not until 2 or more popups are generated.      It's the same with the 'popup-manager' which should appear if the site is   whitelisted for popups.    I think this regressed.   </pre>
