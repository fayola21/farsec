<title>Issue 18807 -   chromium -    No more capslock indicator for password fields (on Mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22780)  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): has password-field capslock indicator  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): doesn't  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: doesn't      1. Go to a webpage with a password field (e.g.  gmail login  slashdot login).  2. Select said password field.  3. Cycle capslock key.      The capslock indicator should cycle.      Nothing.
