<title>Issue 11673 -   chromium -    WebWorkers can consume 100% cpu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load page with continually running workers      1. Browser does not consume 100% cpu      1. Browser consumes 100% cpu  2. Users system and other chrome tabs and general operation bog down.    Note this issue is also filed against webkit  but the model is diff in   chrome (processes vs threads).    Also  this could be a pretty bad thing (DOS-like) by either malicious or   poorly written scripts. </pre>
