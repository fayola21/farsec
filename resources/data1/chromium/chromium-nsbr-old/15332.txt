<title>Issue 15332 -   chromium -    [not specific. all text boxes]: Displaying right-to-left content properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: not specific. all text boxes/web pages Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?  In firefox  users can switch the orientation of web pages to right-to-left   for languages like Arabic and Hebrew to be displayed properly. However  this   is not possible in Chrome. Therefore  those who read/write in these languages   find it difficult to read/write.       What is the expected result?    For right to left languages to be displayed properly in text boxes (when   writing an e-mail  using Google Docs..etc).          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Write in Arabic/Hebrew in any text box.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  There's an option to switch page/text field orientation in FF and IE.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
