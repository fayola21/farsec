<title>Issue 11466 -   chromium -    Dragging tabs into a window causes a crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chromium.  Open a new tab so you have two tabs open.  2. Drag one tab out into its own window.  3. Drag that tab back into the first window.  4. Click to select the other tab  then click to select the first tab.   Watch the crash.    The crash is in TabContentsViewMac::SetInitialFocus():     tab_contents()-&gt;delegate()-&gt;SetFocusToLocationBar();    I think we're not setting delegate correctly when dragging tabs back into a  window.   </pre>
