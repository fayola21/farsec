<title>Issue 9539 -   chromium -    [WinQual] Foxit reader plugin crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the WinQual site is the top issue #1128628685    With 76356 crashes since feb 3  2009  an average 848/day  current value is   higher around 1200/day.    Crash in foxitr~1.ocx (1.0.0.1) error: c0000005  at: 0x2c8e    74.2% of the crashes are in Windows Vista SP1  and 15% on Windows 7. It   appears we suffer no or very little crashes on XP.    Foxit v2 was not integrated with Firefox but Foxit v3 is and chrome picks   up on that and now foxit manages to load their ocx into our plugin process.    I have been trying out with 2.0.169.1 and I cannot make it crash just by   loading random pdfs.    Winqual is not giving me dumps (error) but being so common we should be   able to repro in house.   </pre>
