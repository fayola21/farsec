<title>Issue 20055 -   chromium -    DOM Storage should not crash the browser when it gets an invalid storage/namespace id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DOM Storage should not crash the browser when it gets an invalid   storage/namespace id.  This currently happens because we use CHECKs.    Instead  we should crash the renderer and ignore the IPC.  IIRC  the helper   function that does this should be callable from any thread  so this shouldn't   be hard to do. </pre>
