<title>Issue 22269 -   chromium -    Keyword editor should remember its window placement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just added prefs::kKeywordEditorWindowPlacement to the Mac version to   have the search engine/keyword manager remember its window placement. I   also set the preference to be registered in brower_prefs.cc. The window   should remember its placement on Windows and Linux at this preference   path. </pre>
