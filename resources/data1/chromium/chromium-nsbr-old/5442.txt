<title>Issue 5442 -   chromium -    Open bookmarks from tab area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36                  1. Middle-click in the tab area  not over any button or tab. (This opens   the right-click menu)  2. Without closing the menu  middle click again  elsewhere in the tab area.      Nothing.      Bookmarks from the bookmarks menu are opened  or a prompt for opening many   bookmarks from a folder appears.    Additional Information:    This is probably related to an earlier bug I reported; I discovered it   earlier but forgot to report it  and assumed it would be (unintentionally)   fixed alongside it anyway. It also affects the far right  the &quot;Other   Bookmarks&quot; folder.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=362">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=362</a>   </pre>
