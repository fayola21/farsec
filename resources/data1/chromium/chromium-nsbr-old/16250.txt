<title>Issue 16250 -   chromium -    Popup info bar goes away far too fast in certain cases. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Put the attached file somewhere.  2. Browse to it.    What I see is that the popup does not popup  but the little &quot;pop-ups blocked:&quot; notification comes   up and dissappears too fast for me to get my mouse way down there and click on it.    Seems to happen on Mac and Windows.  I've managed to get popups in other situations where the   notification sits down there until I dismiss it  so it seems like there's something up WRT what my   example page is doing  not with popup-blocking-notification in general. </pre>
