<title>Issue 11741 -   chromium -    import saved passwords from Firefox crashes Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1    I performed import saved passwords from Firefox  and it crashed Chrome.    I am using Chrome for several months now  and one of the possible reasons is   that I have saved passwords in Chrome for some of the domains I had passwords   in Firefox for.    The issue reproduces every time I try with my Chrome/Firefox profiles. </pre>
