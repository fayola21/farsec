<title>Issue 675 -   chromium -    Chrome Gear Application does not have a visible BACK button  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to www.titook.net   2. Create an application shortcut for a web application   3. Click on the Application shortcut on Windows Desktop  4. Click on the Blog button      The application launched properly and I was able to access the   www.titook.net web site.  However  when clicking on many links inside the   web application  the web application brings the user to a different page or   domains.      When this happens  their is no visible button that allows a user to go back   to the original application.  The only mechanism is to RIGHT-Click then   select the Back option.    It would be nice to have something (like a button) that allows users to go   back to the original application or that they see a back button that allows   user to go back to the previous page.      Please provide
