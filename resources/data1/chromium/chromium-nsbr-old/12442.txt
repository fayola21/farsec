<title>Issue 12442 -   chromium -    &quot;Remove thumbnails&quot; sounds scary - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've had a number of users ask me how to remove thumbnails on the NTP  and   when I told them &quot;Remove Thumbnails&quot; they were surprised  since they said   that sounded like it removed everything and they were scared to click it.    TBH  this is what I thought too.    Perhaps a simple wording change could help here:  &quot;Remove a thumbnail&quot; (my preference)  &quot;Change thumbnails&quot;  &quot;Edit thumbnails&quot;    All of these sound less drastic and irreversible.    One user suggested right-clicking a thumbnail should allow removing it    which seemed nice to me but out-of-scope for right now; we should consider   this in the new NTP design.    Filing against brakowski at beng's recommendation in hopes of coming to   some agreement and patching this into an upcoming stable push. </pre>
