<title>Issue 21624 -   chromium -    accesskey attributes conflict with browser shortcuts (like tab-switching) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.207.0 (Official Build 25617)  OS + version : Hardy  CPU architecture : 64-bit  window manager : metacity      1. Open a few tabs.  2. Open a page that uses numeric 'accesskey' attributes (e.g.   <a href="http://djmitche.github.com/buildbot/docs/0.7.11/">http://djmitche.github.com/buildbot/docs/0.7.11/</a>).  3. With that page active  use an 'Alt-#' key combination to switch to   another tab.  4. Switch back to the tab with the &quot;accesskey page&quot;.      The &quot;accesskey page&quot; should be just as you left it before switching tabs.      The &quot;accesskey page&quot; has triggered the tag with accesskey=&quot;#&quot;  where &quot;#&quot;   matches the &quot;#&quot; of the 'Alt-#' keyboard shortcut you used to switch tabs   (in the example page  it scrolls to a different section of the document).    Not sure what the right solution is for accesskey conflicts in general  but   performing both a browser action (i.e. tab switching) and the 'accesskey'   action probably isn't it. </pre>
