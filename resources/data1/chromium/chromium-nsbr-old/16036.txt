<title>Issue 16036 -   chromium -    Alsa Audio Output leaks on shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Audio Output Stream's shutdown code does not correctly delete the output  stream object after the thread is shutdown.  This causes a resource leak.    Because the data source has been modified to be non-blocking  we should now  remove the per-stream output thread  and use a single message loop over all  output streams for writing audio data.   </pre>
