<title>Issue 19746 -   chromium -    Feature request: Chrome could look and run programs or plugins installed with Wine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox          I'll suggest a feature request that can and cannot be &quot;crazy&quot;    I was thinking if is possible Chrome Linux look at Wine  <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">http://www.winehq.org/</a> directories and scan for programs/plugins and use it  on Chrome Linux browser.   So advanced users could choose use for example flash from Wine or the one  installed on Linux.   But I requested this feature thinking in one thing: Recently was released a  program called Bhuvan: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuvan</a>  I really would like to use it  but to run the program is necessary  Windows/Directx..  As I can see the problem doesn't work with Wine yet:  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19754">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19754</a>.   But I would like to know if the program worked with Wine  could be possible  to run this on Chrome changing Chrome user agent to IE?   </pre>
