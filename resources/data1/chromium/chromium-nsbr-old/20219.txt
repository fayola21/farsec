<title>Issue 20219 -   chromium -    Google Maps occasionally displays only part of the map - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	4.0.203.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build   24095)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?">http://maps.google.com/maps?</a>  f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=25+Rathbone+Place +London +W1T+1DG +London +United+Kingdom      1. Goto somewhere with Google maps (above URL for example)  2. Sometimes  close the tab and then re-open it with Ctrl+Shift+T        Full map displayed.        Sometimes (best guess between 1/3rd and half the time) only the top-left   quadrant of the map is shown  and it's not like an image loading issue as   you're unenable to drag the grey bits around. See screenshot. </pre>
