<title>Issue 9548 -   chromium -    Clicking dock icon with no windows open should create new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. close all chrome windows but leave app running  2. click dock icon    expected:    - new window with one tab    actual:    - nothing happens.    Not major  but annoying and probably something we should fix for dogfood  since it should be really easy. </pre>
