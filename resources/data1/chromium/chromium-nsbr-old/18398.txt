<title>Issue 18398 -   chromium -    amd64 version is 32-bit binary - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  google-chrome-unstable_current_amd64.deb 2009-08-04  OS + version : Slackware64 -current  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE4            1. Download unstable_current_amd64 version  2. Unpack with ar  lzma and tar  because have only .deb packages (why?)  3. file opt/google/chrome/chrome      Something like: ELF 64-bit LSB executable  x86-64  version 1 (SYSV)   dynamically linked (uses shared libs)  stripped      ELF 32-bit LSB executable  Intel 80386  version 1 (SYSV)  dynamically  linked (uses shared libs)  stripped    Why amd64 is not 64-bit binary? It's never run at a pure 64-bit system.   </pre>
