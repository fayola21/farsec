<title>Issue 7308 -   chromium -    CHROMIUM is resizing my background-image (Examplefile is a div-box with image-shaddow) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0 (9019)  URLs (if applicable) : [Attached File &quot;TestedWebsite.zip&quot;]           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 6: OK        Opera 9: OK      1. Open my attached website with CHROMIUM and one browser I've addet above.  2. Resize CHROMIUM horizontally and take a look at the center-background...  3. I hope you see the problem :D othervise look at the screenshots ...      The expected result should be a box (shown by the background-image) with   shaddow...  -&gt; See the Opera-Screenshot      The TOP-image and BOTTOM-image is placed correctly ...  But the CENTER-image is resized -- I don't know why !  -&gt; Pleace compare the attached files &quot;CHROME_large.png&quot; and   &quot;CHROME_small.png&quot;. I think they describes the problem itself ... </pre>
