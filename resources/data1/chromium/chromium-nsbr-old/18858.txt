<title>Issue 18858 -   chromium -    GTK+ Theme: inactive tab shouldn't use active window color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the GTK+ theme  the active tab is light grey  which is used elsewhere   to indicate an _inactive_ window. The inactive tabs are colored using the   _active_ window color  even if the entire chrome window is inactive.    I think this should probably be switched. </pre>
