<title>Issue 22802 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame should accept X-UA-Compatible HTTP response header if the X-UA-Compatible meta is missing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Frame      1. Send response header X-UA-Compatible: chrome=1;IE=Edge  2. View in IE8 with Google Chrome Frame installed.      Page should be rendered by Google Chrome Frame      Page is rendered by IE8      Additional Information:  An X-UA-Compatible response header should enable  Chrome-Frame for IE8 but it doesn't seem that this works. HTTP servers may  use the property name specified by the http-equiv attribute to create an  [<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=FC822">RFC822</a>]-style header in the HTTP response  &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-http-equiv">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-http-equiv</a>&gt;    The response header would be:  X-UA-Compatible: chrome=1;IE=Edge  IE8 w/out Chrome-Frame should render as IE8 with compatibility view  button removed.  IE8 w/ Chrome-Frame should render as Chrome with compatibility view  button removed.    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-frame/t/91ee803e3147eb9b">http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-frame/t/91ee803e3147eb9b</a>  describes the issue regarding the use of meta tags.    Note: I couldn't find any information on the priority of values in the  X-UA-Compatible header. If chrome=1 is first and IE=Edge second should  the browser render as Chrome or should chrome=1 be overridden by  IE=Edge and thus render as IE? Also  I couldn't find any information  on what to use as a value separator so I went with a semi-colon  (though a comma should work as well [it does for cookies]).  </pre>
