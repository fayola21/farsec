<title>Issue 5636 -   chromium -    encoding--&gt;font mapping for form controls doesn't match IE for some encodings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This causes us to use the wrong font and causes problems with tests like:  LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-type-text-min-width.html    We get the width wrong because we get the font wrong for that encoding   (ISO-8859-1). </pre>
