<title>Issue 12315 -   chromium -    Copying/cutting text broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.182 (182.0) - build 16467  OS version               : OS X 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x: OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Select any text on a web page  text field or the OmniBox  2. Copy or cut the selected text  3. Try to paste the text somewhere else (e.g. TextEdit)      The selected text should be in the clipboard.      The &quot;Edit&quot; menu bar item highlights shortly. If you've cut the text it   disappears. But the text is not in the clipboard.    Is there no (WebKit) test case for the copy / paste workflow? </pre>
