Visit the above URL in Chrome  2. Click on the Size and/or Color dropdown        -The expected behavior is for the dropdowns to be populated with the Size and Color options.      -In Chrome  the only option for both dropdowns is &quot;Manage Pop-ups&quot;. When I first loaded the   page  the dropdown also included the URL of a pop-up that was blocked from another tab I had   open  completely unrelated to the site I was on now. Selecting on &quot;Manage Pop-ups&quot; does   nothing. In Safari  this page is working as intended. </pre>
