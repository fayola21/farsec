<title>Issue 8154 -   chromium -    File paths in PrefService might be in the wrong encoding on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently store file paths in the pref service as wstrings (or soon to  be string16).  This isn't right as the actual path on disk could be in any  encoding.    We should add getters/setters on PrefService to take a FilePath  which we  then serialize to std::string on linux/mac and std:;wstring on windows. </pre>
