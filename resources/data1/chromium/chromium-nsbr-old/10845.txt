<title>Issue 10845 -   chromium -    http://www.bikechatter.com renders 'incorrectly' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.176.0 (Developer Build 14190)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.bikechatter.com">http://www.bikechatter.com</a>           Safari 4: ??? (don't have it)    Firefox 3.x: Works fine           IE 7: (don't have it)           IE 8: (don't have it)        The div with the 'results' in it should be lined up with everything else.        It's way off to the right.          I'm wary of submitting bugs for this kind of thing  as I never know if it's  my own CSS and HTML gone awry...  Hope it's something real  and thanks for  your time! </pre>
