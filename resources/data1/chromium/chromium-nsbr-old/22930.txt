<title>Issue 22930 -   chromium -    Chromium crashes on forms with autofilling - browser is absolutely unusable! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open any page with forms and &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; elements where browser  suggests you variants for filling text fields. Usually it's forms you have  filled before.  2. Try to type some text in the field you've entered before  so browser  shows you autofill suggestions. After some letters browser tab crashes and  loses all the information on it.  3. If you type new text so browser can't suggest you anything  all works fine.      Standard working - filling variant.      Tab is crashed.    <b>Please provide
