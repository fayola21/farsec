Find a page with a &lt;select&gt; element which needs a scrollbar  i.e. has   more than 20 items or so.  2. Click on the &lt;select&gt; element to display the pulldown.  3. Click on the slider of the pulldown's scrollbar and drag it down all the   way to the bottom. Release the mouse below the pulldown area (or more   generally anywhere outside the pulldown area).      Pulldown stays open and scrolled all the way to the bottom when you release   the mouse button.      Pulldown disappears if you release the mouse outside the pulldown area.   </pre>
