<title>Issue 22932 -   chromium -    small amount of memory leaks found between r27050 and r27060 while running 'chrome --type=zygote'  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry for the vague description and copying you all to Cc. The linux   valgrind bot timed out in build 156-159 and you landed something in   between.    (time-out issue was taken care of).     After identifying the cause  the description has to be chnaged. If there   are multiple causes  it has to be split to multiple bugs.     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valg">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valg</a>  rind)(2)/builds/160/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio    has 6 valgrind errors. The last one is not new and a bug was filed against   the leak (<a title="memory leak in WorkerTest"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22923">bug 22923</a>)     The first 4 all come from running chrome --type=zygote --enable-logging=   and the amount of memory leaked is small. (a dozen bytes each).    The 5th comes from running WorkerTest.MultipleWorkers and leaks tens of   kBs.    chrome --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check --enable-file-cookies --  testing-channel=ChromeTestingInterface:32038.1 --homepage=about:blank --  disable-web-resources --user-data-  dir=/tmp/org.chromium.5RDWCM/test_user_data --metrics-recording-only --  enable-logging --test-name=WorkerTest.MultipleWorkers      The 6th one (which is not new) also comes from the same test  but has a   different stack. Perhaps  the 5th one has to be merged to <a title="memory leak in WorkerTest"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22923">issue 22923</a>.              </pre>
