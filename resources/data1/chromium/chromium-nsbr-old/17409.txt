<title>Issue 17409 -   chromium -    Coverity FORWARD_NULL defect in ImageButton::SetBackground() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In src/views/controls/button/image_button.cc  we have:    void ImageButton::SetBackground(SkColor color                                   SkBitmap* image                                   SkBitmap* mask) {    if (!color &amp;&amp; !image)      background_image_.reset(NULL);      background_image_.reset(new SkBitmap(        skia::ImageOperations::CreateButtonBackground(color  *image    *mask)));  }    Coverity reports a FORWARD_NULL defect on the function argument 'image'  because we have a null check for 'image'  which shows we think 'image'  may be NULL  but later dereference 'image' without a null check.    I don't know how to fix this  so I'm asking Jay to look at this. </pre>
