<title>Issue 11413 -   chromium -    when opening a link (remote/slow page) in a new tab/window  'about:blank' is in the omnibox before we get a first chunk of a response - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Pick a site whose response is pretty slow (the slower the better) from  where you're. For me  <a href="http://mail.ru">http://mail.ru</a> works well for this purpose.     2. Go to the site  3. Open a link in the site in a new tab  4. Observe that 'about:blank' is in the omnibox before Chrome receives the  first(?) chunk of response (or html file?).    5. If you're quick enough (or the site is slow enough)  you can stop the  page load before anything comes back from the server.     What's expected (by some users. I've seen two users complaining loudly  about this in the Korean Chrome U2U group)  which is the same as what IE8  does:     - A new tab/window opens with the omnibox (and tab title) populated with a  target url    - In step 5  omnibox has a target url instead of 'about:blank'    What Firefox does:    - Its url bar is just empty rather than showing 'about:blank'    When I first saw this complaint a couple of weeks ago  I wasn't sure what  they meant. (I hadn't noticed this behavior at all before I saw that  posting). Later trying with some slow sites  I got to understand them.     Still  I'm not sure if we want to do what IE8 does in this case. </pre>
