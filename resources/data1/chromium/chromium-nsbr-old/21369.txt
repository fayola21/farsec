<title>Issue 21369 -   chromium -    Links in default NTP theme should use standard blue (#00E) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.17  URLs (if applicable) : (new tab page)      1. Open New Tab Page in default theme      In the default theme  links in the &quot;Recently closed&quot; and &quot;tips&quot; section   should use the default blue (#00E) that's consistent with other pages in   Chrome's UI (History  Downloads). Links should use this color for both text   and underlines (text-decoration: underline). The same color should also be   used for the links in the text-only version of the &quot;Most visited&quot; section.   This all only applies to the default theme.  </pre>
