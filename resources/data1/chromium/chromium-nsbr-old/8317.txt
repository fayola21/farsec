<title>Issue 8317 -   chromium -    Figure out where to store spellcheck dictionaries on Mac. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For unit testing purposes  we're pushing the english bdic into the build dir under Dictionaries.    When running Chrome.app  the spellcheck code appears to be creating the Dictionaries directory in   the bundle.  My guess is that the spellchecker is being asked to locate dictionaries in the bundle    and when it finds nothing it swings into action to download dictionaries.     </pre>
