<title>Issue 18365 -   chromium -    Add support for mocking link doctor URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add support for mocking link doctor URLs    Some of the tests in errorpage_uitest.cc may fail if link doctor does not   respond in a reasonable amount of time.  It would probably be good to take   advantage of URLRequestFilter to mock these URL requests. </pre>
