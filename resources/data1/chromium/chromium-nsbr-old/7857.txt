<title>Issue 7857 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar goes black after Chrome has been running for a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open latest Chromium developer build  like 2.0.164.0 (Developer Build   9902).    On a new tab page  there's a black box where the bookmarks bar should go.    If you Ctrl+B  you'll see a black box animate out instead of a pretty   bookmarks bar. </pre>
