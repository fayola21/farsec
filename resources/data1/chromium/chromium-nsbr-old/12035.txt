<title>Issue 12035 -   chromium -    Close tab button on the wrong side - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 2.0.181 (181.0)  OS version               : 10.5.7    Standard behavior for Mac applications is that the close buttons are always on the left side. This is even true for the   main Chromium window. But when it comes to the tabs  they are placed on the right (wrong) side.    This should be changed.      1. Close the tab by going to the left corner of the tab using muscle memory  2. Click it      The tab closes      Nothing  you pause and notice that the close button somehow is on the right corner. Who would have thought that? </pre>
