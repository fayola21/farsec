<title>Issue 2592 -   chromium -    spell checker must be optional! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30    While typing everybody might not want the spell checker because of the   automatic red underline especially if the users language is not included.   In others words when typing in a language other than the ones in the spell   checker menu  it is a problem.    Best Regards      </pre>
