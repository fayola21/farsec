<title>Issue 1538 -   chromium -    Browser does not have option for full screen. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      :   Google Chrome  0.2.149.27 (1583)  Official Build  Google Inc.

I'm unable to do this with Chrome.  I   use this feature for presentations when I only want my content on the   screen without distractions from the browser. </pre>
