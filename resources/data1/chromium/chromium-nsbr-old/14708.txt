<title>Issue 14708 -   chromium -    No animated progress indicator (throbber) on current tab if too many tabs are open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0 (18678)  OS + version : openSUSE 11.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Metacity      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Identical from what I hear  but   I'm not sure so I'm filing as a Linux bug.      1. Open 50 or so tabs (enough to reduce them down to &quot;...&quot;).  2. Load a slow-loading page.        See the spinning throbber on the current tab  to indicate progress.        Just see static &quot;Connecting...&quot; label in lower-left corner  though that   goes away if you are hovering over links  etc.      Note that if I switch to a different tab  I can see the throbber on the   loading tab.  It just doesn't work if my current tab is the one that's   loading.    Having no animated progress indicator makes me feel like the page is   missing or something is wrong with the browser. </pre>
