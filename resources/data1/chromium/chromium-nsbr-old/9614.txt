<title>Issue 9614 -   chromium -    Report bug or broken website dialog accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit ALT + SHIFT + T to set the focus to the toolbar.  2. Use right arrow to move focus to the page menu.  3. Open page menu (with the document icon) by using down arrow.  4. Hit up arrow once to select 'Report bug or broken website'. Hit Enter to activate.  5. Tab through the fields  using a tool like Inspect32 to verify the MSAA information exposed.        Issues:  1. Page URL edit box reported as role client  which is the default role  when none is provided by   the programmer. Expected behavior: get_accRole should return ROLE_SYSTEM_TEXT.  2. Description textarea reported as role client  which is the default role  when none is provided   by the programmer. Expected behavior: get_accRole should return ROLE_SYSTEM_TEXT.  3. The labels connected to the form fields are not programmatically connected to the   corresponding field. Expected behavior: get_accName for each form field will return the label   string.  4. The string value contained in the 'Bug type' combobox is reported as the name  not the value.   Expected behavior: get_accValue should return the value currently selected in the combobox.  5. The close (X) button in the top-right corner does not report any MSAA name. Expected   behavior: get_accName for the button should return 'Close'.  6. MSAA focus cannot get to the 'Send screen shot of current page' checkbox.     </pre>
