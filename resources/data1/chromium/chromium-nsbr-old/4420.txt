<title>Issue 4420 -   chromium -    chrome crashes when it is closed while a file is being downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open the link given above  2. to download the new version of firefox  click download  3. as the download starts( after you hit save on the prompt )  the download   starts.  4. close the browser window. Rather than asking that are you sure to close   as it will terminate the download  i got a prompt asking : google chrome   crashed  restart chrome?    What is the expected result? expected is a prompt asking to continue as the   continuation of the action will result in the cancellation of the download      What happens instead? google chrome crashes and a prompt appears asking   whether to restart chrome or not.      Please provide
