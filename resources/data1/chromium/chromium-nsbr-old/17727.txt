<title>Issue 17727 -   chromium -    Closing a tab is slow while page content is still loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 21614)      1. Middle-click a bookmark from the bookmark bar to open a new tab  2. Don't open the tab  but allow the page to start loading.  3. Before the page finishes loading  close it with middle-click or the X   button.      The tab should close immediately      There is a noticeable delay from when you click the mouse button to when   the tab actually closes.  This only seems to affect pages that are still   loading.  If the page is allowed to load completely  the tab closes just   fine.  Just started very recently. </pre>
