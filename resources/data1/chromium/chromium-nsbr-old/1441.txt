<title>Issue 1441 -   chromium -    Wishlist: Variable tooltip life - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tooltip life should vary based on the amount of text in the tooltip.   Currently tooltips fade after a hard five seconds and that is not always   enough time to read a long tooltip.    So I'm a Dinosaur Comics[1] fan and some of the comics' tooltips can conservatively be called paragraphs. Reading those tooltips is rather   stressful because I have five seconds to get as much as I can before I have   to move the mouse off of and back on to the image and find my place again.   It would be nice if Chrome increased the tooltip life in linear proportion   to the amount of text.    [1] <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/">http://www.qwantz.com/</a> </pre>
