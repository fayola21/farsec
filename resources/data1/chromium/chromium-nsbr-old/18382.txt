<title>Issue 18382 -   chromium -    Correctly merge GDI layers when printing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When restoring a semi-transparent layer  i.e. merging it  we need to rasterize it because GDI doesn't support   transparency except for AlphaBlend(). Right now  a BitmapPlatformDevice is created when VectorCanvas thinks a   saveLayers() call is being done. The way to save a layer would be to create an EMF-based VectorDevice and have   this device registers the drawing. When playing back the device into a bitmap  do it at the printer's dpi   instead of the layout's dpi (which is much lower).    Note that with GDI+ this is a non-issue but this is not always available on Windows XP. </pre>
