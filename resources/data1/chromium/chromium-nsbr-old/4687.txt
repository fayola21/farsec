<title>Issue 4687 -   chromium -    Return key on &quot;Customize these settings&quot; [of FRUI] should show up settings dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.23    1. Launch Chrome with FRUI (First Run UI)  2. Do tabbing to &quot;Customize these settings&quot;   3. Hit return key.    What is the expected output?   Should show up &quot;Customize your settings&quot; dialog.    What do you see instead?  Performs imports from the default browser.    Bumping this to P1  as the issue is with First UI.    PS: This is not regression. </pre>
