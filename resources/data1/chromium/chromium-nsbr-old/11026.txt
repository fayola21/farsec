<title>Issue 11026 -   chromium -    if the flash player has focus you cannot use hotkeys (like Ctrl +F  F1) .... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0  URLs (if applicable) : any youtube video (example <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlh8gSF_hhE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlh8gSF_hhE</a>)    Firefox 3.9: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      this is more of a FYI post  as all browsers fail in this  just watch a YT video for example  and click with the mouse  inside the video  it seems nothing bad happens but all the hot keys  of chrome will not work anymore till you click somewhere outside the flash   player  i am sure it is because you have the input focus on flash player    but i post it here because it took me a long time myself to figure out why   sometimes Ctrl+F does not work....  </pre>
