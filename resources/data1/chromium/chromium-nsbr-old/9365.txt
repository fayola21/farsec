<title>Issue 9365 -   chromium -    Mem leak in ipc_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Valgrind on Mac thinks that ipc_tests leaks memory.  We want to enable auto-analysis on valgrind output  before which the detected leaks need to   be fixed (or suppressed).    I'm marking it to you since you were the last person to have touched this. If this is an error    please feel free to reassign to someone more appropriate (or bounce back to me).    The leaking test is: IPCChannelTest.ChannelProxyTest  The following is valgrind's output. (Refer waterfall for latest).      ==4179== Thread 1:  ==4179==  ==4179== 108 (32 direct  76 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 37 of   107  ==4179==    at 0xECB42F: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:217)  ==4179==    by 0x3715A: CancelableTask* NewRunnableMethod&lt;IPC::ChannelProxy::Context    void (IPC::ChannelProxy::Context::*)()&gt;(IPC::ChannelProxy::Context*  void   (IPC::ChannelProxy::Context::*)()) (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0x34BA9: IPC::ChannelProxy::Context::OnChannelError() (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0x2E58E: IPC::Channel::ChannelImpl::OnFileCanReadWithoutBlocking(int) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xB7E4C: base::MessagePumpLibevent::OnLibeventNotification(int  short  void*)   (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0x1CB90C: event_process_active (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0x1CBC3F: event_base_loop (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xB8483: base::MessagePumpLibevent::Run(base::MessagePump::Delegate*) (in   src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xAED6D: MessageLoop::RunInternal() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xAED88: MessageLoop::RunHandler() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xAEE13: MessageLoop::Run() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xE52DD: base::Thread::ThreadMain() (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0xC3B97: ThreadFunc(void*) (in src/xcodebuild/Debug/ipc_tests)  ==4179==    by 0x28D86F4: _pthread_start (in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib)  ==4179==    by 0x28D85B1: thread_start (in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib)  ==4179==    by 0xFFFFFFFF: ???   </pre>
