<title>Issue 19983 -   chromium -    URL obscures links when download bar is shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Official Build 23673)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Make download bar visible (download a file).  2. Open a page with a link at the very bottom left of the page.  3. Hover over the link.      Should be able to click on the link.      The popup with the URL appears above the download bar and obscures the   link. If the page content cannot be scrolled any further  the link is   impossible to click.
