<title>Issue 4035 -   chromium -    User reports of GMail hangs on loading.... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User description:  -------------------  Some recent chrome push or gmail push has introduced a significant problem   with the combination:    - regularly  chrome gmail stalls when doing a search or even reading a   message... the stall is _many_ seconds long  - in the interim  I start FF3  login to gmail  do the search  and get the   results _before_ chrome comes back    I've repro-ed this on 3 computers on my google account.      I just tried my gmail.com account and chrome has been spinning for over a   minute w/o giving me the login page (or the already logged in page  not   sure what the state of chrome's cookies are there).  Interestingly  I went   to my gmail.com page on FF3 and FF3 _crashed_.  I restarted and logged in   successfully to gmail on FF3.  I hit shift-reload on chrome and it has now   gone directly to my gmail account  but it took several seconds.   Is chrome   dropping some responses or failing to retry?    I also tried disabling proxies on chrome at work and that had no effect  so   it isn't a proxy problem.  -----------------------      There has been some consideration that this may be related to gears offline   access  but some users (Linus) report that this is happening even when not   using Gears.     </pre>
