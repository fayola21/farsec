<title>Issue 22399 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Doesn't Allow Me to Use the Beta - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm trying to use the beta  and I can't get the beta version to actually  work. My operating system is windows vista 32-bit home premium. Please let  me know if there is a fix for this.    Thanks    (I tried doing the registry edit  and using the automatic channel changer.  Both failed on me.) </pre>
