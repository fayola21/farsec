<title>Issue 17484 -   chromium -    chrome_tests.py is taking too long to analyze log files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So long  in fact  that it's timing itself out  I think.    Top says:    PID   USER �_ �_ �_PR �_NI �_VIRT �_RES �_SHR S %CPU %MEM �_ �_TIME+ �_COMMAND �_ �_  27430 chrome-b �_20 �_ 0 1411m 1.4g 1952 R �_100 37.1 �_ 8:38.99 chrome_tests.py    strace says it's slowly reading in errors and parsing them.  df says it's trying to chew through 700MB of XML.    My favorite idea is to have valgrind not output errors we don't care about.  I have a feature request in that would do that:  <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201170">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201170</a>    I'm also trying raising the timeout in chrome_tests.py temporarily. </pre>
