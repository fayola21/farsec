<title>Issue 17433 -   chromium -    Problem with relative css imports - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Common style does not appear to work in Chrome.  Seems to be a problem with relative css imports.  e.g.  @import url(&quot;stylesheet.css&quot;);        View page with correct style.        Style from the imported stylesheet is not available   </pre>
