<title>Issue 7699 -   chromium -    make the list of 'most visited' (?) sites accessible in omnibox with &quot;mouse only&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request in the Korean U2U group for Chrome. I'm copying   to a couple of Japanese to see if Japanese users have a similar request.    Firefox and IE have a downward arrow at the far (rightmost in LTR) end of   their url input box which list 'most visited'(?) sites when clicked on.   Then  a user can select one of them by a mouse click.     Some users really likes &quot;click'n'go mode of browsing&quot; with the minimum   number of keystrokes (which may mean '0') [1].  Even now  they can do that   by clicking on a new tab button and choose from the list there  but even   that is regarded less convenient than what IE/FF have in the post I saw.     Needless to say  a single user complaint does not carry much weight and I'm   aware that the current design of omnibox is the result of many hours of   discussion and experiments.  Nonetheless  I'm passing along this request as   a data point and a seed for discussion in case this 'feature' hasn't been   considered before.      [1] Some Chinese and Japanese users are known to like this mode of   browsing.     </pre>
