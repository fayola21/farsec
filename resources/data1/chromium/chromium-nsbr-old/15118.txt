<title>Issue 15118 -   chromium -    Page rendered wrong when opening it with (open link in new tab) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://wikimapia.org/beta/#lat=-16.3618977&amp;lon=-">http://wikimapia.org/beta/#lat=-16.3618977&amp;lon=-</a>  46.8928242&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=w&amp;v=1&amp;show=/2567932/pt/3%C2%BA-Pelot%C3%A3o-de-  Bombeiros-Militar  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested      1. Right click on the link above and open it with (open link in new tab)     2. See how the page looks  3. Now do the same action but with direct click on the link  4. Can you see the difference of the window over the map?      When opening the page with (open link with new tab) should show the window   over the map (correct). Like when we open with direct click.       I see a window (wrong). See the screenshots uploaded to see the difference.       </pre>
