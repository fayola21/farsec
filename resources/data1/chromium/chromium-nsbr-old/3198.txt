<title>Issue 3198 -   chromium -    Hanging page cause tab (and browser) to close unexpectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> -navigate to a slow page (ex: <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/contribute.html?">http://download.openoffice.org/contribute.html?</a>  download=bouncer&amp;product%3DOpenOffice.org%26os%3Dwinwjre%26lang%3Den-  US%26version%3D2.4.1)  - while the page is loading navigate to another page  Expected:  - new page shows  Actual:  - the tab is closed (and if that is the only one  the browser is closed).      Some more info:  - The navigation to the new page triggers a call to   RenderViewHost::FirePageBeforeUnload() which starts the hang monitor time-  out  - RenderViewHost::NotifyRendererUnresponsive() is called because the RV did   not respond in time. That method closes the tab.       </pre>
