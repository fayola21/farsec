<title>Issue 11704 -   chromium -    Add options to open url in new tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     I am using chrome on my laptop and I really enjoy it. However since I mostly do not use a   mouse but my trackpad  I have to use the control key to open bookmarks from the bookmark bar   in new tabs.    It would be great to have a option which makes clicking on a bookmark to always open in a   new tab. And why not  when control key pressed  open it in the current tab.    Also  in the same way  it could be great to have another option which makes search form the   url bar to open in a new tab if the current tab is not a blank tab.    Regards  Sylvain. </pre>
