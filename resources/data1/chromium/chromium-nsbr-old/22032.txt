<title>Issue 22032 -   chromium -    Autocomplete dropdown no longer goes away on return - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to a page where you have autocomplete webform entries  such as   <a href="http://crbug.com">http://crbug.com</a>  - type in a text field and see autocomplete entries  - arrow down  hit return    expected:  - autocomplete dropdown should go away after completing.    actual:  - dropdown does not go away. The only way to make it go away is to de-  focus the window.    This makes the browser very difficult to dogfood. Appears to be mac-only    not sure when this regressed. </pre>
