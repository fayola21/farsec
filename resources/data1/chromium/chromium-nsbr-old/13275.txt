<title>Issue 13275 -   chromium -    views::View registers the same accelerator target multiple times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a result of the following change  it turned out that views::View registers   the same accelerator target multiple times.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/114065">http://codereview.chromium.org/114065</a>    When View registers a new accelerator target  it also registers the old   targets again. This behavior may potentially cause a problem.    Comments in FocusManager::RegisterAccelerator() should be uncommented after   this issue is resolved. </pre>
