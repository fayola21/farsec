<title>Issue 6991 -   chromium -    Dragging off omnibox vertically while selecting should select to end? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Brett wants me to do this.  I'm worried that it forces people to be much   more dexterous in their selecting if they want a particular range.  I   suppose I could define a &quot;slop&quot; area above and below the edit where this   didn't trigger but maybe that would be confusing.    Not clear what it means if your cursor is off the edit vertically at   exactly the same horizontal pixel as your selection start.  Probably   &quot;select nothing&quot;. </pre>
