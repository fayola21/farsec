<title>Issue 13631 -   chromium -    No way to restore thumbnails  if all the thumbnails are deleted. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   -Have few thumbnails and remove all the thumbnails using 'Remove  thumbnails' link in NTP (Don't worry if you hit the <a title="Removing 3rd thumbnail in NTP  clears the thumnails list." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10818"> issue 10818 </a>  while  executing this step :) )    Once you are done deleting all thumbnails  try to restore the removed  thumbnails - there is no such option.    Basically  'Restore Removed thumbnails' option is available in 'Click X to  remove the thumbnail page'  so to restore the thumbnails in this usecase  I  need to visit ten's of webpage (even though I don't need) for thumbnails to  available in NTP and then click on 'Remove thumbnails' link.    It will be grt  in this usecase  if we show 'Restore removed thumbnails'  next to/before Show full history page.   </pre>
