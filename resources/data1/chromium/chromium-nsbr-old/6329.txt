<title>Issue 6329 -   chromium -    get rid of unnecessary region code from spellcheck language/locale codes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  *all* the spellcheck languages have regions associated with   them  but they're not necessary for the majority of cases. For instance    what's the point of having sv-SE or hi-IN instead of just sv and hi? I   think we'd better get rid of them unless we need a distinction (cases like   en-US vs en-GB  or zh-CN vs zh-TW).    Later  if we add fr-CH  fr-CA  we can change fr to fr-FR.     This is not just internal naming schemes but also it helps 'unclutter'   spellchecker selection menu. Also  it helps 'fixing' RTL bugs with the   spellcheck language names.      </pre>
