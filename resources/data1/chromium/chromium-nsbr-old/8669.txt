<title>Issue 8669 -   chromium -    Can't drag and drop a URL/bookmarks on title bar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces on 2.0.169.0 (Official Build 11238) and also on Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11449">r11449</a>)  Works fine on stable.    -Drag a URL/Bookmark from B'bar/Local file to empty tile bar (blue bar)   [your mouse pointer should be after &quot;+&quot; [new tab] button and should be  horizontally at center/just above ] and drop it.  The drop event is ignored.    If you drop it  just above the Omnibox  then it works fine in un-maximized  window only and this also no use in maximized window. </pre>
