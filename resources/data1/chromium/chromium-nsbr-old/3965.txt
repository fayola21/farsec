<title>Issue 3965 -   chromium -    The sandbox doesn't allow checking attributes on non-existant files in allowed directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0      1. Run Chromium with --gears-in-renderer  2. Start the Gears unit test server  3. Go to http://localhost:8001/tester/gui.html?LocalServer  4. Note that all attempts to remove a store fail when the permissions  database is updated.  This is due to the inability of sqlite to verify that  its journal file has been deleted  which is done by checking the attributes  on the file.      Attempts to check the attributes on the file do not give an access denied  error.      Attempts to check the attributes on the file give an access denied error.    The only way I could get around this was by explicitly allowing access to  the journal file  which will not work for all databases  since we don't  know all possible names ahead of time. </pre>
