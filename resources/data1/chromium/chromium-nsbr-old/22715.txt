<title>Issue 22715 -   chromium -    timebar - clicking just above or below causes a pause - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When clicking the time bar to seek  if you click in the black area instead of   the blue area  behavior is inconsistent and unexpected.  I was expecting it to seek  the same a Firefox does.  If using the default document  the video pauses  as if I clicked in the video   itself.  If using default UI but with html  the click is ignored.    The other browsers width video and default controls (safari/firefox) treat   the entire bar area as clickable to do a seek.  Not just the skinny bit.  websites like hulu.com  youtube.com also make the full bar clickable.   </pre>
