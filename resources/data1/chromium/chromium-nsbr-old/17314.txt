<title>Issue 17314 -   chromium -    can't run chrome under valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> sh tools/valgrind/valgrind.sh out/Debug/chrome  fails with a DCHECK on line 65 of base/id_map.h.  Commenting that out didn't help much  as it fails on another one  somewhere else:    [12293:12293:24037674424:FATAL:chrome/browser/child_process_security_policy.cc(120)]  Check failed: false. Add renderers at most once.    Evan Stade said this worked for him on Friday  so  either I'm doing something wrong  or this is a new problem. </pre>
