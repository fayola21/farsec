<title>Issue 19177 -   chromium -    chrome+gmail is severely slow - 30 to 60 seconds to open an email. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Worst I've seen is 3 minutes.   Most of the time its 30 seconds.      Only affects gmail  not other websites.  Only affects chrome  not other browsers.  Affects chat within chrome.  Says &quot;cannot connect to google.com&quot;.  Only affects corp gmail  not personal gmail.  Affects all my PC's.  Haven't seen it impact Mac.  Happens mainly when I've been using chrome for a long time and have many   windows open.. about 15 windows.  Usually says 'Still loading'.      Moderately fast response times.  Less than 5 seconds would be good.      I've had 3 PC's and it affects them all.  The latest is Vista64 based.  2 TB of disk space  8 GB memory  4 core.   </pre>
