<title>Issue 19285 -   chromium -    Crashed for no apparent reason - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.202.0~svn20090812r23182-0ubuntu1~ucd1  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: Compiz    Chromium crashed quite suddenly while I was reporting another problem :)   Don't know why  and there were a lot of tabs open  but I have some debug   data from Ubuntu's Apport system. I unpacked the crash report with apport-  unpack and then packed it back up with file-roller :) I hope you can make   use of this data. </pre>
