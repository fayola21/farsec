<title>Issue 20402 -   chromium -    First run UI should not import search engine by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get/reimage a new Windows XP/Vista/Win7 machine  2. Install Chrome  accept all defaults on first run UI  3. Do a search from the omnibox  --&gt; Search results are from Bing    Bing is set as the search provider  even though I've never used IE on this   machine.    I suggest making import of the search provider opt-in rather than opt-out    as this offers the user the opportunity to import the search provider if   they so choose  but doesn't force an import as part of the default   experience.   </pre>
