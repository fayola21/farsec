<title>Issue 1040 -   chromium -    Override font size of pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                On lots of pages the user font settings are ignored.     Firefox has a setting  [] Allow pages to choose their own fonts  instead of my selections above.    This should be for Chromium  too.    Maybe the setting were better formulated as    [] Override page font settings </pre>
