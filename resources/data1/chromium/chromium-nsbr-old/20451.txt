<title>Issue 20451 -   chromium -    It is easy to get a zombie - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Repros on Beta candidate (3.0.195.10) and ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24608">r24608</a>)    -Have a password stored in Password manager.  -Click on 'Remove all' button on Passwords and Exceptions/Saved Passwords tab.  -While the 'Remove all' alert shows up  Exit chrome.    In this use-case  Chrome never exits cleanly  and there is a chrome process  running always. As a result  password manager is unavailable - Neither you  can save passwords any more nor you can view stored passwords  until you  kill the zombie.    PS: I know this a corner case  but still looks like serious issue. </pre>
