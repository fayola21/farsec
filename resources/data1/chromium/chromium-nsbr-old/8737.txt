<title>Issue 8737 -   chromium -    Downloads can be extra slow when temp directory is on different drive from downloads directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you start a download  chrome prompts you for a file name. But it  actually starts the download before you finish typing the filename (or hit  cancel). In the mean time  it stores the downloaded data in the system  default temp directory. When the user enters the file name  it pauses the  download  moves the data to its final location  and resumes the download.  Consider the following use case (example given on linux):    - Temp directory is /tmp/  which is local to the user's machine.  - User downloads a 3 gb file.  - User goes out to lunch  file finishes downloading.  - User comes back and chooses to save the file to ~/Downloads/  which is on  a remote machine.  - File has to copy across the network (!). This takes a long time and the  file ends up taking a maximum of 6 gb of the user's space.    Solution is unclear. I personally think it would be reasonable to not get a  head start on files over a certain size  since (a) the amount of time  typically saved as a percentage of the total download time would be  negligible and (b) if you end up pressing cancel  you've wasted 3gb of disk  space AND bandwidth.   </pre>
