<title>Issue 12125 -   chromium -    Overflow UI for extension toolstrips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to implement UI for when there are more toolstrips than can fit on   the extension bar.    Current proposal is that there is a disclosure widget that opens up a pane   that contains live versions of the extensions that didn't fit. Ask Glen for   mocks. </pre>
