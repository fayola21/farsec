<title>Issue 22266 -   chromium -    Tabs can be lost entirely by dragging tab upwards too quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - create a window with a bunch of tabs  - grab one and drag it up and let go of the mouse very quickly (timing is   important  this isn't 100% repro)    expected result:  - new window with that tab    actual result:  - sometimes the new window will not appear and the tabs in the originating   window will have a gap    Good times! </pre>
