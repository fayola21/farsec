<title>Issue 22776 -   chromium -    Opening many tabs appears slow because tabs animate independently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a slew of new tabs  by mashing cmd-t    expected:  - as soon as the next new tab starts animating  the previous one should finish   so that there's no extra animation.    actual:  - tabs animate independently which looks really slow and janky </pre>
