<title>Issue 9058 -   chromium -    Remove Mouse Event Flags Kept In UI Buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a design issue.    The present implementation stores mouse-event flags in a UI button when an   event is sent to it  regardless of whether the state of the button is   actually affected.    We should change this so that mouse-event flags are propagated to listeners   as function parameters in order to avoid modifying the button with the   flags which is rather transient data.   </pre>
