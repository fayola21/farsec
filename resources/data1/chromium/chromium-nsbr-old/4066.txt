<title>Issue 4066 -   chromium -    Crash at StringPiece::wordmemcmp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> history::TextDatabaseManager::AddPageContent led to a crash at   StringPiece::wordmemcmp while I was visiting   www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/assembly/319741.html       The first parameter to wordmemcmp() is an invalid pointer (it's not null   but seems to points to a protected space or something).     GURL's spec is invalid and parsed_ member has bogus values (like huge   length for components).     The stack is attached.  </pre>
