<title>Issue 18298 -   chromium -    xdg-open can run apps that require a terminal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Start chrome from a terminal.  Download a text file.  (Try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=15786 )  Click on the download.    Expected: new window with file contents.  Actual: I see &quot;less&quot; running in my terminal.    I think this means we're broken for any download that uses a terminal.  I   suspect xdg-open may query isatty() or some such. </pre>
