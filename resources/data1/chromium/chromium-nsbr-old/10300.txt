<title>Issue 10300 -   chromium -    2 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   These two tests have a highlight color that is different from the Mac   which is normal because selection color is different between Mac and  Windows  but even so it still doesn't look identical because there is still  some problem with the fill color for the text.   DEFER WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/svg/text/text-deco-01-b.svg = FAIL MAC LINUX : LayoutTests/svg/text/text-text-08-b.svg = FAIL PASS   (Automatically generated from line 839 to line 846 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
