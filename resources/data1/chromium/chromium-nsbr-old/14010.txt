<title>Issue 14010 -   chromium -    Popup menu on combobox elements is not affected by whole-page zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works as expected      1. Go to any page with a combobox element  e.g.   <a href="http://www.functionx.com/html/lesson14.htm">http://www.functionx.com/html/lesson14.htm</a>  2. hit cmd-= a couple times to zoom in  3. click the combobox      The popup-menu should be larger too; see Safari 4.      The pop-up menu has the same size as it has when page zoom is not   used. </pre>
