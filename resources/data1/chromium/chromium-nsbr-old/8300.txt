<title>Issue 8300 -   chromium -    Python 2.6.x DeprecationWarnings in net testserver during tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install Python 2.6.x and some of the build scripts produce DeprecationWarnings that can confuse IDEs that parse the   build output into thinking they are errors/failures.    src/net/tools/testserver/testserver.py:18: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead  src/third_party/tlslite/tlslite/utils/cryptomath.py:9: DeprecationWarning: the sha module is deprecated; use the hashlib   module instead    (also shows up during layouttests since it's the same testserver script)   </pre>
