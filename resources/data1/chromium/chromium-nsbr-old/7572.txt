<title>Issue 7572 -   chromium -    About:network window pops up after tab is closed  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk: Chromium 2.0.162.0 (Developer Build 9503)  AND  Dev: Google Chrome 2.0.160.0 (Official Build 9072)          1. Open about:network in a tab. Separate about:network window appears.   2. Close the about:network window (not the tab).  3. Now close the about:network tab.    What is the expected output?    About:network window should not pop up at this time.    What do you see instead?    About:network window pops up after corresponding tab is closed.   </pre>
