<title>Issue 20594 -   chromium -    Additional Cache Control Headers in 304 request are ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load any URL that supports Cache-Control directives and conditional GET   via ETags/Last Modified headers  2. Reload the page after the cache expires (but without server side changes   to the URL)  3. The server responds with a 304 Not Modified and a new Cache Control   directive      As per HTTP RFC 2616 <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-</a>  sec10.html#sec10.3.5  If the 304 requests contains new headers they should be used to update the   cached entry.  The end result should be a cycle of cache hits followed by one 304 request   as follows  Test URL: <a href="http://www.webfabric.org/test/abc.txt">http://www.webfabric.org/test/abc.txt</a>  First Request  =&gt; 200 OK  Re-request at 0m 30s =&gt; cache hit  Re-request at 1m 01s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with new Cache-Control directives  Re-request at 1m 30s =&gt; cache hit  Re-request at 2m 01s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with new Cache-Control directives  Re-request at 2m 30s =&gt; cache hit  etc etc        After the cache expires the browser never uses the addional headers in 304   request:  First Request  =&gt; 200 OK  Re-request at 0m 30s =&gt; cache hit  Re-request at 1m 01s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with ignored headers  Re-request at 1m 30s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with ignored headers  Re-request at 2m 01s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with ignored headers  Re-request at 2m 30s =&gt; 304 Not Modified with ignored headers  etc etc    <b>Please provide
