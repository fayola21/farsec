<title>Issue 5270 -   chromium -    Add layout tests for our 'customized' EUC-JP converter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To be compatible with IE and Firefox  we added a custom EUC-JP converter to   our copy of ICU ( third_party/icu38/source/data/mapping/google-  euc_jp_mod.ucm ). It may be a good idea to add tests similar to   fast/encoding/char-decoding.html and fast/encoding/char-encoding.html.    The latter is currently disabled (see b/871718 : char-encoding.html relies   on the ability to have a reference fragment in data url).    Perhaps  for this single encoding  we can write something similar to   http/tests/misc/url-in-utf7.html and http/tests/misc/resources/echo-query-  parms.php (they're not in our tree  yet. See   <a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22492">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22492</a> for the patch that added   tests). echo-query-param.php can be modified to print a %-escaped octet   sequence.          </pre>
