<title>Issue 19867 -   chromium -    &quot;--load-extension=foo.crx&quot; gives cryptic error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> --load-extension only expects to be given a directory  not a .crx file.  If   you give it a .crx file  it says &quot;Can't load foo.crx: manifest is missing or   invalid&quot;.  This is pretty misleading  since foo.crx likely has a manifest.    There are two possible fixes.  The one I prefer is just to make --load-  extension able to also load a .crx file  with the exact same effects as   loading a directory.  aa tells me that --load-extension &quot;is only for   development&quot;  but during development I wanted to check that packaging   succeeded  and besides  I don't really see what denying the ability to   specify a .crx here gains us.    The other fix is to simply give this a better error message  like &quot;--load-  extension can only be used with an unpacked extension directory&quot;. </pre>
