<title>Issue 18870 -   chromium -    Feature request: backup/restore saved passwords. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'd like that Chrome would offer a function to backup and restore the list  of saved passwords. Firefox offers this through an extension (password  exporter).    Moreover I would remember that firefox passwords are no more imported from  3.5 version (aka 3.1) <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9103">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9103</a> </pre>
