<title>Issue 4547 -   chromium -    Can't drag and drop a tab to below the browser window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: Vista EN  VMWare Image   Build: 0.3.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5635">r5635</a>)  User: Limited (Not sure it is really matters here)      1. Have two tabs opened.  2. Try to drag and drop one tab to the down(below) to the browser window.      What is the expected output?   New tab should be positioned at the mouse pointer location  where it was  dropped.    What do you see instead?  The new tab always goes to the top of the desktop.    Please note  It does not reproduces in 0.4.154.22(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5545">r5545</a>).   </pre>
