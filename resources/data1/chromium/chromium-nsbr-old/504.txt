<title>Issue 504 -   chromium -    Problem while resizing on dual monitors. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Two monitors one with 1024x768 resolution and one with 1280x1024   resolution.       Just like firefox or IE or any other software for that matter   chrome   should maximize according to the screen size of the current monitor.        when I maximize chrome it maximizes to 1024x768 resolution only on either   screen.      Please provide
