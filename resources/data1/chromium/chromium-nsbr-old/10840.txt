<title>Issue 10840 -   chromium -    Don't depend on fuser in chrome_process_util.cc (test utilities) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently chrome_process_util.cc depends on fuser to see what processes use  the browser SingletonSocket.    It may be cleaner not to depend on external binaries  especially that it  can't handle spaces in filenames (not sure about spaces in directories). It  is also quite possible that the problem with spaces is not caused by fuser   but by /proc/net/unix  which fuser reads. </pre>
