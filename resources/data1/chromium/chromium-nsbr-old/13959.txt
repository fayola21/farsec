<title>Issue 13959 -   chromium -    ffmpeg plays video at ~1.5x speed for non theora video - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1 (Offizieller Build 18142)  OS                   : Windows Vista Business 64bit SP2    <a href="http://people.xiph.org/~maikmerten/demos/bigbuckbunny-videoonly.html">http://people.xiph.org/~maikmerten/demos/bigbuckbunny-videoonly.html</a>      1. compile ffmpeg with instructions given but keep codecs/muxers enabled  2. copy dll's to chrome dev build dir to overwrite versions there  3. watch ffmpeg supported video encoded in non theora formats (tested with   xvid/mp3)        video plays like the theora videos.        theora videos still work like before. other video formats now get picture   and sound too  but the video is playing at about 1.5 times the speed of   what it should play at and thus gets desynced noticably with the sound   which is playing normally.     </pre>
