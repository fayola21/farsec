<title>Issue 6388 -   chromium -    Update Server Error 3...nothing is working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43      1. Clicking on &quot;About Google Chrome&quot;        Allows me to check for Chrome updates      displays &quot;Update server not available (error: 3)&quot;    I've tried to follow all the instructions available  including uninstalling   and reinstalling multiple times. I removed the folder for google chrome   under the local settings and user data folders after they were left behind   after uninstallation. After reinstalling  I still have a update server   error...     </pre>
