<title>Issue 21729 -   chromium -    We need a chrome.tabs.onStatusChange - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current chrome.tabs.onUpdate is difficult to use because the url property   is only sent in the case where it changed.    This means that in the case of reload  or the 'done' state  you don't get the   URL and need to re-request it.    We should create a new method  onStatusChange  and have it have the following   signature:    void chrome.tabs.onUpdate(Tab tab);    It would always send the entire tab details  not just the parts that changed. </pre>
