<title>Issue 4306 -   chromium -    Must click on text to start drag in bookmark manager table - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you click to the right of the text in a column and start dragging you   get the drag-to-select behavior  not an actual drag and drop drag. We get   this behavior from ListView and there doesn't appear to be a style to turn   on the behavior we want. </pre>
