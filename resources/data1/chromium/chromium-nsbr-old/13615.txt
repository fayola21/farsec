<title>Issue 13615 -   chromium -    &quot;Sticky&quot; tab while switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3 (build 17055) and lower           Opera 9/10: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Launch few tabs.  2. Give PC some heavy work to do (e.g. compressing)  3. Back to Chrome and try to switch tabs. Sometimes tab sticks to cursor   and if you move cursor  it will create new window. Very annoying  probably   related to not so strong laptop  but this thing doesn't happen in other   browsers.      Just switch the tabs. </pre>
