<title>Issue 11956 -   chromium -    Linux: glipper / klipper fight with inline autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;include svn revno; e.g. dpkg -s chromium-browser&gt;  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04  window manager : KDE 3  URLs (if applicable) : Any that have been remembered / visited before.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): As expected.      1. Go to a never-before visited site (say: dnews.de).  2. Close tab.  3. Open new tab  start typing &quot;dnews.de&quot; in the URL bar.        As the browser remembers my URL  and I keep typing  it should _overwrite_   the URL.        As you type  &quot;dnews.de&quot; is pasted into the URL bar  and the remainder of   &quot;dnews.de&quot; that you typed is _inserted_ into the URL  rather than written   over the url. So  you might end up with &quot;<a href="http://dnews.deews.de/">http://dnews.deews.de/</a>&quot; in the URL   bar (depending on at what time the browser decided to paste the remembered   URL in there).    This happens in ~50% of the cases.    Niek Bergboer   </pre>
