<title>Issue 19185 -   chromium -    Windows after first have no title bar when maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start up Chrome linux  2. Maximize the resulting window.  3. Open a second window by either typing ctrl-N  or by running google-  chrome a second time.    The second window (and all subsequent windows) will have no URL bar or tabs   in it  but is otherwise functional. (e.g.  it will open with two tabs; the   front one is the standard &quot;watch out  this is the dev build&quot; tab  and all   its links work fine. If you hit ctrl-W  that tab goes away to reveal the   other one. If you hit ctrl-W again  that tab  and the whole window  goes   away. But there's no way to go to a particular URL)    If the second window isn't maximized when opened (which would happen if you   omitted step 2 above) then the second window opens up correctly.    <b>Please provide
