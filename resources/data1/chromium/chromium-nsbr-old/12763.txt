<title>Issue 12763 -   chromium -    Extensions auto-update should not keep trying to write temp files if the disk is full - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   When downloading newly updated extension .crx binaries  we need to write them   to a temp file to pass off for installation. If the user's disk is full or   nearly full  it would be nice to back off and not even bother to download. </pre>
