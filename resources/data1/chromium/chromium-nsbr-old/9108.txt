<title>Issue 9108 -   chromium -    Windows theme ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	1.0.154.48 (Official Build 9043)    Various parts of chrome don't seem to fully obey the windows theme. Notably  for me  using &quot;high contrast black&quot; :    The installer renders its text using an explicit black but taking the  background colour from the theme - which makes the text black on black.    The URL bar uses a white background but takes its foreground colour from  the theme - so the hostname is white on white and the path light green on  white.    The URL bar problem ended my testing; I'll happily do more if that one's  fixed and try and provide a more thorough review. </pre>
