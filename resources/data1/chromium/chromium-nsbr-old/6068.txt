Go to the page <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/apa/">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/apa/</a>  2. Enter min  max values for rent: input fields.  3. Click on min and then max input fields.     What is the expected output?   Should retain the values.    What do you see instead?  The values are reset to empty.    It also reproduces in Safari 3.x  Looks like webkit issue (?).     </pre>
