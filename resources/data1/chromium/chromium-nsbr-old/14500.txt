<title>Issue 14500 -   chromium -    [www.jiachengqi.com]: Chrome doesn't work for some magic pictures. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.jiachengqi.com/article.asp?id=154">http://www.jiachengqi.com/article.asp?id=154</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?  This is one article forwarded from one of my friend  and the texts in this   page says: &quot;Press Ctrl+A  you will say the magic!&quot; I tried several times   (in Chrome)  but did not find anything interesting. But some minutes later    I tried this in IE  wow  yes  I saw something different!          What is the expected result?  It should be as same as that shown in IE.  (I stuck the result in Chrome and in IE in my attached screenshot for your   information.)      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. visit <a href="http://www.jiachengqi.com/article.asp?id=154">http://www.jiachengqi.com/article.asp?id=154</a>  2. press Ctrl+A  3. try again in IE  you will see the difference    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  IE6  IE7  Maxthon2: OK  FF3: as same as Chrome    Please provide any additional information below.  I guess this might cause by the algorithm of Ctrl+A is different from IE?     </pre>
