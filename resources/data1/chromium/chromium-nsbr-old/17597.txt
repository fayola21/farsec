<title>Issue 17597 -   chromium -    extensions auto-update should not allow multiple &lt;app&gt; tags pointing at the same extension id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A recent discussion on chromium-extensions reminded me that we should enforce   this constraint in the code. We should also probably make it an error for   multiple &lt;updatecheck&gt; tags to be in an &lt;app&gt; tag  instead of just looking at   the first one.     Make sure to add unit tests for this also.  </pre>
