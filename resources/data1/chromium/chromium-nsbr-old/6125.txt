<title>Issue 6125 -   chromium -    [edit search engines] after hitting right ctrl+shift  can't change insersion point with the mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1329600&gt;      1) Open Chrome  Hebrew UI  2) right click on the omni bar  and select &quot;edit search engines&quot;  3) select any search engine and click &quot;edit&quot;  4) hit right + ctrl shift  in the name or keyword area  to set the box to  RTL mode  5) try to change the location of the insertion point by clicking with the  mouse at the middle or the end of the text        actual result:  after hitting right ctrl shift  insertion point from the mouse is always  the rightmost one    expected result:  user should be able to click anywhere to change insertion point      * moving the insertion point with the keyboard works as expected  * hitting left ctrl +shift (for LTR) does not cause a similar problem  * Wordpad works ok for the above keyboard/mouse movement.       </pre>
