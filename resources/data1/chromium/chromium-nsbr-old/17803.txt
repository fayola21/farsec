<title>Issue 17803 -   chromium -    On gmail  focus unexpectedly jumps to the location bar every now and then and location bar is focussed on every tab switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Read your mail in gmail  use keyboard shortcuts (j  k  [  ]) to navigate        The keyboard shortcuts always be sent to gmail        Sometimes  the focus jumps to the location bar  so that e.g. ']' is appended   to the current url  instead of archiving the current mail and opening the   next one in gmail. (Also  when then clicking the gmail UI to give it focus   again  the omnibox stays open  so i have to click the location bar again  hit   esc  an then click gmail and hit ']' again)    Sorry  not consistently reproducible. But it happens multiple times per hour   on the usual few-hundred-mails-per-day diet :-P </pre>
