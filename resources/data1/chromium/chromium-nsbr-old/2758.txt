<title>Issue 2758 -   chromium -    Right-click should focus clicked control - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When right-clicking  the focus should move to the clicked widget.    Happens every time on Chrome.    Steps to recreate:  1. Go to google.com and type 'hello' in the search box (don't submit the   search).  2. Click on the white page background to unfocus the search box.  3. Now right-click on the search box and choose 'select all'.    Expected result (and what happens in all other browsers and windowing   interfaces):  Focus is moved to the search box  and 'hello' is selected.    Actual result (in Chrome):  Focus remains on the page  and the entire page is highlighted.
