<title>Issue 2500 -   chromium -    Have our own contig implementation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Regarding bug <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265</a>    Issue:  The way the file 'User DataSafe Browsing' is extended on Windows leads it  to being quite fragmented. On systems with slow disk seek times  low free  disk space or already highly fragmented drive  the whole system performance  hit can be quite important.    Fix:  - Implement the algorithm discussed in  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363911(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363911(VS.85).aspx</a>  - This could be used for disk cache too.    Caveats:  - The algorithm to fix this is relatively sensitive. Badly implemented  it  can cause more harm than good.  - This shouldn't not be done on flash-based drives. Maybe measuring the  seek time could help detect and skip these drives.  - This requires administrative privilege. On restricted user account  this  would not be executed. Note that this is the default on Vista with UAC  enabled but Vista has by default a defragmentation scheduled every 3 weeks. </pre>
