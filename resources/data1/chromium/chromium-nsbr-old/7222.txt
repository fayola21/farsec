<title>Issue 7222 -   chromium -    Alt-wheel should scroll line by line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1081025&gt;    If we could support this  Chrome will be more passionate for regular news  readers who like to scroll line by line :).    I mean holding 'Alt' key and then scrolling mouse wheel. Wheel up and down  should navigation up  and down line by line respectively.    only FF: supports this.   </pre>
