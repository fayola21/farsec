<title>Issue 3663 -   chromium -    gcl commit should check if the build is closed before committing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It should not commit if the tree is closed unless the -f option is passed.    Two steps are needed.     1. <a href="http://chromium-status.appspot.com/status">http://chromium-status.appspot.com/status</a> should return &quot;open&quot; or   &quot;closed&quot; depending on whether the tree is open or not.  2. gcl commit should use that value to avoid submitting code to a closed   tree. </pre>
