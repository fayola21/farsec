<title>Issue 3826 -   chromium -    Sina news comment page blocks the UI of the process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to <a href="http://news.sina.com.cn">http://news.sina.com.cn</a>  2. Open some tabs of news items.  3. In one of the news item tab  click the &quot;Comment&quot; (__��_��__��_��_��_����__) (below the   news content).  4. In most times  the tab goes blank  the title becomes &quot;��_��_鏕�__��_��____��__��_��__��_&quot;  the   icon becomes the loading icon (rotating circle). This state will last   several minutes. In the state  all tabs belonging to this process can't be   operated.  5. In the state  even if I close the &quot;��_��_鏕�__��_��____��__��_��__��_&quot; tab  other tabs   belonging to the same process still can't be processed.  6. After several minutes  the tabs come back to lives. All mouse messages   queued are processed at once (for example  if I have pressed the mouse   right button multiple times during the blocking state  there will be   multiple context menus shown).  7. Clicking on the same comment link again won't cause blocking again.      The UI should not be blocked for so long time.      The UI (in the same process) is blocked for several minutes.
