<title>Issue 18038 -   chromium -    Tab fonts don't obey system font hinting settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.System-&gt;preferences-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Fonts tab and choose &quot;Details&quot;  2.Turn the hinting settings to None. Observe the fonts in omni-bar and tabs  3.Now turn the hinting on. The omni-bar fonts changes. However the tab   fonts don't change.      The tab font must also be hinted/non-hinted based on system settings.       Currently the hinting is turned off. This used to be fine when the tab   fonts used to be bigger. With a recent upgrade tab fonts were made 8pt from   10pt. The absence of hinting is showing up quite bad.    <b>Please provide
