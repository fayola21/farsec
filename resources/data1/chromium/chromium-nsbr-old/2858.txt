<title>Issue 2858 -   chromium -    NPAPI postURL with a file does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From plugin_host.cc:      // Unfortunately  our WebKit requests can support files which      // contain *only* data.  But the files from NPAPI contain      // headers + data!  So  we need to read the file  extract       // the headers  write the data back to a new file  and then      // finally we can post the file.  TODO: Implement me!      This is causing the layout test  LayoutTests/http/tests/plugins/post-url-file.html to fail. </pre>
