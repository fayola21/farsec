<title>Issue 9773 -   chromium -    Figure out proper way to get left_ptr_watch for loading pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we manually create left_ptr_watch by copying the bits from the  mozilla source and passing them to gdk_cursor_new_from_pixmap(). It might  be faster/cleaner to use gdk_cursor_new_from_name()  but that might not be  supported by all systems.    See render_widget_host_view_gtk.cc. </pre>
