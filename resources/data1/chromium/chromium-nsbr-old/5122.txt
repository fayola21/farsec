<title>Issue 5122 -   chromium -    no web inspector in linux test shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The windows test shell has a menu bar that allows you to open the web  inspector.  I'm not sure the web inspector is enabled on linux and even if  it was  there's no way to open it.  We should add a menu bar on linux and  enable the web inspector. </pre>
