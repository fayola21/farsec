<title>Issue 19761 -   chromium -    &quot;Confirm form resubmission&quot; dialog missing on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a page with a form you can POST  2. Submit the form causing a POST request  3. Try to reload the form results page        There should be a confirmation dialog asking whether the page should be   reloaded  causing the form's action to be repeated. Instead  no action is   taken at all and the user may be led to believe the reload has occurred (but   apparently very quickly). </pre>
