<title>Issue 1507 -   chromium -    On import don't set default search provider to invalid  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make IEs default search be Live Search.  2. Start Chrome and import settings.  3. Type in the Omnibox.    What is the expected output?    There should be at least one entry for searching Live Search for what you   have typed.    What do you see instead?    The only entry shown in the popup is for going to the typed entry as a url.        </pre>
