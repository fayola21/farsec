<title>Issue 19370 -   chromium -    Add support for MSI installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  Chrome only has .exe installers (mini_installer  etc.)  and often   gets installed with Omaha via a metainstaller.  This format doesn't work for   all users.    We should add support for an MSI installer that installs offline  sans Omaha.    When run  the installer should install over previous versions. </pre>
