<title>Issue 22546 -   chromium -    Process limit and other memory-related limits should be dynamic based on free memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently base our process limit on system total memory  assuming that if   memory isn't available  other apps can be swapped out to _make_ it available.    The problem is that other apps can also take it from us  and being swapped   out leads to jank.    Instead  we should probably dynamically calculate the process limit based on   system free memory.  If there isn't much  we should run few processes to   avoid having background renderers get swapped out so often.    I don't know what other limits we calculate based on memory  but if there are   some we should look at them too. </pre>
