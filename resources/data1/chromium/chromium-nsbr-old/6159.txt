<title>Issue 6159 -   chromium -    Add a unit test for certificate path length checking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> pathLenConstraint (path length constraint) is a field in  a certificate's BasicConstraints extension.  It is an  integer whose value is &gt;= 0.  It is only meaningful in a  CA certificate.  It gives the maximum number of intermediate  certificates that may follow this certificate in a chain.  So if pathLenConstraint is set to 0  no intermediate CA  certificates may follow.  If pathLenConstraint is omitted   there is no limit.    The paper describing the recent MD5 certificate collision  attack (<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/</a>) suggests  that browser vendors implement path length checking.  All  major crypto libraries should handle pathLenConstraint  correctly.  But as due diligence  let's add a unit test.    In the graphs below  iCA stands for intermediate CA  and  EE stands for end entity (i.e.  leaf).    Patrick  please create this certificate chain:      root -&gt; iCA pathLenConstraint=0 -&gt; iCA -&gt; EE    I found many certificate chains of three certificates in  which the intermediate CA has a pathLenConstraint of 0  so  this certificate chain will cover the majority of the  chains out there.    For extra credit  we can create another certificate  chain with a nonzero pathLenConstraint:      root -&gt; iCA pathLenConstraint=1 -&gt; iCA -&gt; iCA -&gt; EE </pre>
