<title>Issue 9313 -   chromium -    aviationweek.com looks terrible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This site has a number of validation issues  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?">http://validator.w3.org/check?</a>  uri=<a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw&amp;charset=(detect+automatically)&amp;doctype=Inl">http://www.aviationweek.com/aw&amp;charset=(detect+automatically)&amp;doctype=Inl</a>  ine&amp;group=0 however  Safari and other browsers are still able to display it   with the proper CSS.    I have contacted the webmaster and suggested they try to address some of   these issues but we must be able to be more forgiving.    WebKit nightly has a couple small issues but we don't seem to be picking up   the CSS at all.   </pre>
