<title>Issue 9474 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't remember URLS that are IP addresses (ex.127.0.0.1) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53 (Official Build 11798)  URLs (if applicable) : any address that is an IP address (127.0.0.1    192.168.2.1  most routers' home pages)        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Enter any ip address of a server (like the ip address of your router to   get to it's home page)  2. Type the first few digits of the address again.      Chrome should remember the rest of the address  as it does with text URLs.      Chrome does not remember the digits  and instead offers 0.0.0.x where x is   the digits you have entered so far.     </pre>
