<title>Issue 15669 -   chromium -    Do not display color difference/differences when Chrome is using Incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox 3.5 does not show you are in Incognito mode (gives a visual warning - the Incognito   icon) in Incognito mode which will really helps you use this feature more without telling   someone you are using it (makes sense huh?)..hope this is fixed. It also allows users to   customize use of Incognito mode and run it automatically when the browser starts without use of   a command line switch (the entire browser  not just a shortcut) which will also fix <a title="Send Email + IM Links to an Incognito Window"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1969">Issue 1969</a>   and <a title="Feature Request: Open links in incognito mode automatically" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5993"> Issue 5993 </a> which will also make me extremely happy.    I am going to use Firefox for a while until this is fixed sadly. </pre>
