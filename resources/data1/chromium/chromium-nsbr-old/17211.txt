On the right side by &quot;Sort by&quot; change it to &quot;Price + Shipping: Lowest   First&quot; You will be prompted for a zip code to calculate the shipping.  3. Log out  Log back in  repeat the search  repeat the Sort by and you will   be prompted again      You should not be re-prompted for the zip code because eBay is supposed to   read this information from you profile / a cookie. Apparently  Chrome isn't   storing cookies as it &quot;should&quot; according to eBay.      Zip code prompt reappears even though it shouldn't.    <b>Please provide
