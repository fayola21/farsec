<title>Issue 17304 -   chromium -    qtfaststart does not work on some files. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> startup latency is an important performance metric for media playback.  A seek on start of mp4 is slow and caused by headers and other atoms at the   end of file.  qtfaststart tool addresses this  by moving the header 'atom' to the beginning   of file  but doesnt work on files created by other tools.   </pre>
