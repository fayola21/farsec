<title>Issue 11477 -   chromium -    Fix DomAgentTests disabled for WebKit merge 43114:43242 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Fix DomAgentTests disabled for WebKit merge 43114:43242    I ended up disabling the following tests so that I could land the merge:    GetChildNodesOfFrameOwner    ChildNodeInsertUnderFrameOwner    I had to update the expected results for some of the other DomAgentTests to   account for the fact that WebCore now always adds a HEAD element even if the   input source did not contain one.  That same thing is probably causing these   other tests to fail as well  but it was not immediately obvious to me how to   correct them. </pre>
