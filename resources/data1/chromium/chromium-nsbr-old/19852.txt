<title>Issue 19852 -   chromium -    changing bookmark URL to empty string in JSON file with sync enabled causes crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1906729    So bad  it causes a ring of death.    Repro Steps:  1) Client A &amp; B both are enabled sync and connected with same use account  2) Have few bookmarks in both clients and they were in sync  3) Now Client A closed chrome and modifies the bookmark JSON file (as empty   URL is not allowed by UI) to ensure one of the synced bookmark has Empty   Url and empty name. Start the chrome on Client A  4) Client B is online at this point and syncing.    Actual:  Chrome should never crash and should ignore this Empty URL bookmark    Expected:  Chrome crashes (repeats every time restarted) on Client B. Chrome is not at   all usable for this Client B anymore as it crashes everytime on start.    [/copy]    This should be an easy fix to the client  but once someone gets one of   these bookmarks in their system they may possibly have to wait for the   upgrade before passing --enable-sync again as they'll just crash otherwise.   </pre>
