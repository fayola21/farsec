<title>Issue 19256 -   chromium -    File Open Dialog with huge thumbnails crashes Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit a site with  for instance  Choose File option.  2. When the file browser box opens  browse to a large folder with big   images  pdf's  or any file whose thumbnail will take some effort to   generate  3. Now set the view to Thumbnails  and scroll down quickly.        A smooth scroll with a thumbnail'ed list of files and folders        Chrome freezes  apparently at the point where windows needs to generate the   complex thumbnails.    What is worrying is that  this bug crashes Chrome as a whole  i.e.  all   active chrome processes.    Even the Chrome Crash Recovery process doesn't detect it properly  since   starting chrome again does not prompt with the Restore last session option    and all history is lost.    <b>Please provide
