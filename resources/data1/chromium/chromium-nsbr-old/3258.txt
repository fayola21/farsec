<title>Issue 3258 -   chromium -    Tabs created when tabstrip is compressed pending resize relayout should not force resize relayout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a bunch of tabs so that the tab width shrinks  2. Close a bunch of tabs  tabs will not resize and you'll have a blank area   at the right of the tabstrip  3. Open a new tab (e.g. by clicking the new tab button)        The new tab should open with the current width of tabs in the strip.  Instead  the tab forces the pending resize relayout to occur  which is   jarring. </pre>
