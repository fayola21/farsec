<title>Issue 3846 -   chromium -    can't type in hotmail composer  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.6  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://by102w.bay102.mail.live.com/mail/EditMessageLight.aspx">http://by102w.bay102.mail.live.com/mail/EditMessageLight.aspx</a>             IE 7: OK    The new version of Windows Live Hotmail (yes Gmail is better  however  you   cannot change all old email addresses especially those designated for spam)   does not function in the current version of Chrome.  The &quot;To&quot; and &quot;Subject&quot;   fields are functional.  However  the composer section in which you are   editing and actually typing a message does not function.  You cannot type   anything in there (possibly not a recognized text area?).   </pre>
