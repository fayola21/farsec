<title>Issue 14753 -   chromium -    Chrome browser process crashes when worker subprocess crashes in te middle of sync xhr. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. doewnload 2 attached files  test.html and worker.js  to some local dir.  2. load test.html    The worker creates an XHR to &quot;<a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>&quot;. This is cross-domain so  it has to fail. Because of another bug  this crashes worker process (this  is not a subj of this bug). the problem is  it also crashes browser main  process  but it should not. </pre>
