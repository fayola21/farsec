I got this bug  while reproducing the <a title="REGRESSION: unable to save text documents" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10561"> issue 10561 </a>    -Load the page <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=29487">https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=29487</a>  - Bring up save as dialog from right click context menu.  (as you will notice the suggested filename is auto selected in the save as  dialog)  -Type one single letter to replace the suggested file name.
