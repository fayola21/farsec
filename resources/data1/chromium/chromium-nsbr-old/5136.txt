<title>Issue 5136 -   chromium -    Sad Plugin image should be in theme DLL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Sad Plugin image is currently in chrome.dll instead of the theme DLL.    This is because the renderer draws it directly when a plugin crashes  and   the renderer doesn't have the theme DLL.    This is bad for theming (especially if/when we open it up to third parties   more) and makes the code and directory structure a bit harder to figure   out.    There are several possible fixes:  * Have the renderer load the theme DLL.  This is probably not a good idea   unless the renderer is also going to need a number of other bitmaps; I   imagine it would hurt tab startup time.  * Have the browser draw the image directly on the right parts of the   rendered bitmap.  This might cause Z-order problems and would probably be   pretty complex.  * Have the browser push the bitmap to the renderer during renderer startup.    Might delay renderer startup slightly or cost memory  I dunno.  * Have the renderer grab the bitmap from the browser on demand.  This would   probably be more complex to code than the &quot;startup push&quot; option.    I'm leaning toward the last of these.  Plugin crashes are rare enough that   we should probably pay any speed/memory penalties when they happen rather   than before. </pre>
