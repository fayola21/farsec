<title>Issue 22244 -   chromium -    Download shelf should be visible in all open windows ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21      1. Initiate a (sizable) download.  2. Join the tab that is downloading with another (set of) Chrome tab(s).  3. Watch the download bar disappear. No  the download doesn't stop  but the   bar is gone.        I suppose the bar should remain visible? No biggie  do whatever you want   about it. </pre>
