<title>Issue 19879 -   chromium -    Collect data on replace-versus-edit in address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  single-clicking the address bar selects all  because (according   to me) we claim users nearly always want to replace  not edit.    On Mac  single-clicking the address bar places the cursor  because   (according to pinkerton) we claim users want to edit often enough that   selecting all is frustrating.    There are many other surrounding issues  like what other browsers on each   platform do and what other methods users have to select all or place the   cursor.  But I'd like to at least resolve this central dichotomy    regardless of whether we ultimately change our behavior.    I think the right UMA stat to collect would be &quot;how many navigations   [triggered by the address bar] happen after replacing all the text in the   address bar  how many happen after creating a new tab (== blank address   bar)  and how many happen total&quot; (with &quot;number of edits&quot; being the   remaining amount in the sum).    I suspect the proportions will differ on Mac versus Windows.  One difficult   thing to determine is which direction causation flows on this w.r.t. our   different behaviors on each platform.  I suppose if we see large   differences we could try running small experiments on each platform to   reverse the single-click behavior  and see how the proportions change. </pre>
