<title>Issue 1295 -   chromium -    Scroll Wheel Button Cannot Scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Clicking the scroll-wheel button in a &quot;white&quot; empty space.      When pressing the scroll-wheel button  there should be an arrow up/down   (and sometimes left/right) that would scroll the position the mouse is   pointing from the place clicked.      Nothing happens. Some people on forums say it works for them  others say it   doesn't. I believe all browsers have this feature so I do not know why   Chrome is missing it. IE6 &amp; FireFox 1.5 even had it and it's not something   new and is a standard in web browsers.    Please provide
