<title>Issue 4476 -   chromium -    Need Greasemonkey-compatibility shims - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to do many minor things to increase compatibility with Greasemonkey   for Firefox:    * Wrap scripts in &quot;(function() {&quot; and &quot;})()&quot;  * Implement/stub out some APIs:    - unsafeWindow (just an alias for window)    - GM_xmlhttpRequest (make it warn  then delegate to XHR?)    - GM_log (implement by delegating to console)    - GM_addStyle (implement)    - GM_getValue/GM_setValue (Perhaps we can implement this on top of HTML5   storage)  * Implement @exclude (?)  * Implement @require    There are probably a few others. </pre>
