<title>Issue 17694 -   chromium -    Should allow user to select the FF profile to import from - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When importing settings from an existing Firefox profile  we should allow  the user to pick between multiple existing profiles. Quite frequently   Firefox's notion of the default profile does not agree with what the user  thinks of their default profile  and we end up importing a seemingly random  profile.    This was noticed on Chrome/Linux. </pre>
