<title>Issue 4260 -   chromium -    Blocked Pop-Up Windows Title not displayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.9&gt;                  1. Go to a website that opens two or more popup windows  one of them with   site content  the others advertising.      Only the titles of the popup windows are displayed  allowing to decide   whether a popup maybe ignored or not. While this allows to place   advertising on the title bar this is not more intrusive but more convenient   for the user than the new behaviour.       1. The title bar of the window displays: Blocked Pop-Up  2. The Pop-Up window has to be dragged in to even know whats it about.  3. The user has to view all the ad popups on a site just to find the one   desired.    It seems like &quot;its not a bug  its a feature!&quot;  because this was   intentionally implemented to avoid title bar ads. But its a very   invonvenient feature and should at least be configurable. The Pros of   Chromes Popup manager are destroyed with this  making it less usefull than   other browsers approaches.  other     </pre>
