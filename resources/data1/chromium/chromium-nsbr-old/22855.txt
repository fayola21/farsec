<title>Issue 22855 -   chromium -    Hotmail may not recognize that an e-mail message is checked. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 3.0.195.22 (Official Build 26896)  Site = <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>    IE 7: OK  FF3: OK  Safari 4: OK    Precondition  ------------  Have a hotmail account with at least a page full of messages in the  mailbox.  I used the Junk folder.    Repro  -----  1. Go to Hotmail Inbox or Junk folder.  2. Check/uncheck checkboxes  preferably at or near the bottom of the list   until you have a message that is checked but not highlighted blue.  3. Hit the &quot;Delete&quot; link.    Expected  --------  Hotmail should recognize that the message is selected  and delete it.    Actual  ------  I get a warning dialog: &quot;You need to select at least one message before you  can do this ...&quot;  even though the message is checked.  See attached picture.    It might take a few tries to get this to happen.   </pre>
