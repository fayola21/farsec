<title>Issue 22511 -   chromium -    Audit AutoCompleteEditViewMac focus/selection logic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The focus and selection logic in chrome/browser/autocomplete/autocomplete_edit_view_mac.mm is   full of TODOs and could use another look.  Specific functions include:  Update()  SetUserText()  SetSelectedRange()  SelectAll()  RevertAll()  UpdatePopup()  control:textShouldEndEditing:    Look through these functions and clean up the logic/TODOs.  Everything appears to be working well   enough as written  so unless specific problems arise  this should not be a beta blocker. </pre>
