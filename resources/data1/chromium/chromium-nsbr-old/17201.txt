<title>Issue 17201 -   chromium -    &quot;type to search&quot; serbian translation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Serbian      Stable 2.0.172.37      Windows XP SP3 (I guess it's irrelevant)      The text &quot;type to search&quot; in the address bar is mistranslated. It reads   &quot;_��__��__��_ _��__��_ _���_��_��_���_��___��_��_&quot; (&quot;tip za pretragu&quot;).  &quot;Tip&quot; in Serbian means &quot;type&quot;  but as in &quot;there are 10 types of people&quot;    not as in &quot;typing on a keyboard&quot;.  I think the translation should read &quot;kucajte za pretragu&quot; (&quot;__��_�ܕ�__��ɕ�_��__��_ _��__��_   _���_��_��_���_��___��_��_&quot;). &quot;Kucajte&quot; is the imperative form of the verb &quot;kucati&quot; which   means &quot;to type&quot;.    No need for a screenshot. </pre>
