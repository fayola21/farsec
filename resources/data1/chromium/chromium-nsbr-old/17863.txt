<title>Issue 17863 -   chromium -    dlopen plugins in a subprocess - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The browser process needs to dlopen() plugins to get at their mime types.    We should do it in a subprocess to protect ourselves from misbehaving   plugins.  Will found a crash in VLC that is almost certainly my fault  but   you never know what other sorts of strange code we'll encounter. </pre>
