<title>Issue 7999 -   chromium -    Chrome Inspector no longer works at all. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.164.0 (Official Build 9941)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome-ui://inspector/inspector.html           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A      1. Browse to a webpage.  2. Hit Ctrl+Shift+J.      Chrome Inspector should work properly.      Chrome Inspector starts up fine  but everything is blank. None of the   buttons do anything except &quot;Show console&quot;.    I tried uninstalling then reinstalling Chrome  clearing cache  etc. etc.   Same thing. Also  this didn't happen in earlier versions of Chrome: this is   only in more recent builds. </pre>
