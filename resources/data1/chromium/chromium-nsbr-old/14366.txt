<title>Issue 14366 -   chromium -    [www.zumi.pl]: zumi.pl: left column does not collapses - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.zumi.pl/namapie.html?qt=Gliwice&amp;loc=&amp;Submit=Szukaj&amp;cId=&amp;sId=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">http://www.zumi.pl/namapie.html?qt=Gliwice&amp;loc=&amp;Submit=Szukaj&amp;cId=&amp;sId=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?    Clicking on the marked button (see attached screen-shoot) doesn't   collapse the left column on that page. Well  at least not right away. See   the steps to reproduce bellow for more details.        What is the expected result?    Clicking on that button should collapse the column on the left straight   away.      What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Let the page fully load: <a href="http://www.zumi.pl/namapie.html?">http://www.zumi.pl/namapie.html?</a>  qt=Gliwice&amp;loc=&amp;Submit=Szukaj&amp;cId=&amp;sId=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0  2. Click on the marked button (see attached screen-shoot) and don't move   the mouse pointer just yet. Nothing happens.  3. Move the mouse pointer off the button but to the right hand side.   Nothing happens.  4. Move it to the left. As soon as you mouse-over the left column it   collapses.    Same thing happens if you want to show that column back. To do so in   Chrome  you have to click that button and move the mouse pointer far to the   left hand side.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Works OK on:  Safari 4.0  FF 3.0.11  FF 3.5b99  Opera 9.64    Please provide any additional information below.    Zumi.pl is a well known Polish competitor of Google Maps. </pre>
