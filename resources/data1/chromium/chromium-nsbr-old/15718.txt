<title>Issue 15718 -   chromium -    Single click will not bring text input element into focus in Google Contacts Form - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Google Mail  2. Open Contacts section  3. Select a contact and edit  4. Click on any text input field  the window will not focus on the input   element  5. Click on it again  then it will be highlighted and I can edit it  6. This problem seems to be intermittent. Sometimes it doesn't happen. But   it occurs more than it doesn't.          Single clicking should highlight element immediately.        Need to double click on it. Not exactly intuitive. Not sure why it tends to   happen in Google Contacts but I've seen it happen on other forms as well.   Just not all of 'em.    <b>Please provide
