<title>Issue 6900 -   chromium -    'Esc' should close the ComboBox drop-down list not the dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> see &lt;b/1205762&gt;    Hitting 'Esc' key while ComboBox list is dropped-down  closes the Dialog(on  which is Combox is laid out)  instead of closing the drop-down list.    Eg: Menu Wrench -&gt; Options -&gt; Under the Hood and click on Chrome Language  ComBox box.    While the lang list is dropped-down  hit 'Esc'  the Chrome Options dialog  is close.    Expected: In such a use case  we should just close the drop-down list.    PS: Still reproduces on Stable build:  1.0.154.43 (Official Build 7746) </pre>
