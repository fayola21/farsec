<title>Issue 22379 -   chromium -    Fast JSON responses ends up as part of the HTTP response header - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. A XMLHttpRequest json response that returns something really fast will   not return the response body as responseText.  2. A sleep(1000) on the server will basically prevent the problem. However    that's not correct behavior.        The JSON response will be read and the XMLHttpRequest.responseText will be   readable.        There's some sort of synchronization issue in Google Chrome  occasionally   and consequently the XMLHttpRequest.responseText property is undefined when   it should return some actual content.     </pre>
