<title>Issue 20404 -   chromium -    Make setData working with clipboard interaction on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/editing/execCommand/copy-without-selection.html    The following is a summary of the issue from http://b/issue?id=1124548:    The test fails because clipboard DataObject can't be updated on Windows. ClipboardWin::setData only works for drag and drop  but not standard   clipboard operations.    The issue:  windows is retarded  you have api's for setting the data on the clipboard    or you can set the clipboard  you can't update the clipboard contents   though.    A Workaround:  For drag and drop we create our own IDataObject  put all the requires   entries in to it  then pass it to the system once we start the drag.  We   have no equivalent mechanism to do this with standard clipboard operations.    The windows clipboard api's wrap an IDataObject  but setting data clears   any that's present  and you can't (as on mac) get a reference to a mutable   version of the clipboard DataObject.    make clipboard interaction use an IDataObject (a la drag and drop) and re-  set the IDO as the system clipboard every time you do a setData for the   system clipboard.
