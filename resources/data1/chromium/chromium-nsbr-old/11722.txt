<title>Issue 11722 -   chromium -    Need better ideas for how to accommodate IE's bookmarks sidebar user experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So my mom uses both Chrome and IE. One feature that she prefers in IE is   the   bookmarks sidebar (see screenshot). The sidebar is a permanent fixture for   her and a way to navigate quickly among the set of pages that she picked    named  and ordered.    She initially thought that the 9 thumbnails of on NTP would cut it  but was   frustrated to find out that she needs MOAR THUM NAILZ to get reproduce   the   same experience as with IE.    This bug is just a back-of-the-head placeholder for me (and whoever likes   to   think on this).       </pre>
