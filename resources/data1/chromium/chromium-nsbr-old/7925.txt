<title>Issue 7925 -   chromium -    passing the -r option to gcl upload should assume --send_mail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Seems like the common case if you're including the reviewer in gcl upload  command is to want it to send mail to the reviewer. People keep forgetting  the --send_mail and not getting the review mail sent.    Not a huge priority  but I figured I would get it on the radar. </pre>
