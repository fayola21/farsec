<title>Issue 18678 -   chromium -    Double clicking the last word in a line selects empty consecutive line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.

Double click on the word &quot;doubleclickme&quot; in the JS textarea or on the generated html.        The word &quot;doubleclickme&quot; should get selected. Instead the word and the empty line after it gets   selected    This works in Safari on Windows and Mac but is broken in Chrome on Windows and Mac so it seems like   there is something wrong in our binding layer.   </pre>
