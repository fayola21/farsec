<title>Issue 430 -   chromium -    doesn't install in wine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> First of all the website is identifying your os from the headers and does  not allow you to download another os version of browser. You should add  another button there. Secondly i am pretty sure it would run smoothly in  wine but it does not install. I know this is probably some gui thing not  being implemented in the default wine stuff but still.    Here's what wine spits out:    fixme:ntoskrnl:KeInitializeSpinLock 0x457764  fixme:advapi:CheckTokenMembership ((nil) 0x1289e0 0x33fb50) stub!  fixme:process:SetProcessShutdownParameters (00000280  00000001): partial stub.  fixme:ole:CoInitializeSecurity ((nil) -1 (nil) (nil) 6 2 (nil) 64 (nil)) -  stub!  fixme:winhttp:WinHttpOpen ((null)  1  (null)  (null)  0x0): stub    And ps: webkit is actually konqueror's engine so give less credit to apple  pls and more credit to &quot;zi germanz&quot; :) </pre>
