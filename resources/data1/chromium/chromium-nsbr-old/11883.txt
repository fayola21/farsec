<title>Issue 11883 -   chromium -    Wrong applicaton icon on taskbar in Windows 7 RC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.23  URLs (if applicable) : NA      1. Going to taskbar options. Setting &quot;Taskbar buttons&quot; to &quot;always combine&quot;  2. Creating web application shortcut (GMail for example). Closing all   Chrome windows.  3. Launching our new GMail app. Now we have 1 Chrome window with a HiRes   icon.  4. Launching usual instance of Chrome  and it hides under the GMail icon   (this is problem N1).  5. Going to taskbar options again  and setting &quot;Taskbar buttons&quot; to any   other option.        1. GMail window should show it's original High Res icon.  2. Different app windows should not stack together - they are almost   useless in this state.        Two Chrome windows fall apart with usual Chrome having it's own icon  and   GMail window showing a stretched favicon of GMail. </pre>
