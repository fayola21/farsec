Middle click on a subforum link such as &quot;General Discussion&quot; to open in   a new tab      New subforum is opened up in a new tab  but the subforum also opens up in   the  current tab through the onclick event embedded in the TD table   element.      Subforum should only open up in a new tab  not the current tab as well.  Onclick even should only be triggered during a left click event  not a   middle click.     </pre>
