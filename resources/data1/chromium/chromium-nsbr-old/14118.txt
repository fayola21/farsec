<title>Issue 14118 -   chromium -    Duplicate &quot;Did you mean?&quot; infobars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported by bradfitz [at] google    There is a screenshot showing two identical did you mean infobars  but   nothing else particularly interesting in the screenshot. This was observed   on linux 3.0.187.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18043">r18043</a>) but I'm marking it OS-All for now as I have a   feeling it's not linux-specific.    On steps to repro:  &quot;I think it was being slow so I hit Ctrl-L Enter again. �_So I might've had   two requests in flight. �_Or at least two dup DNS lookups in flight.&quot; </pre>
