<title>Issue 5940 -   chromium -    orange.co.il: Incorrect content served to Safari &amp; Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> orange.co.il works fine in IE &amp; Firefox but doesn't behave correction in  Safari &amp; Chrome.    From looking at the source their sending it looks like there are places in  which they are serving different versions of the site for Firefox &amp; Safari.    Also see: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3533">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3533</a>    One example:  URL: <a href="http://www.orange.co.il/obox/devicelist.aspx?nodeid=931682">http://www.orange.co.il/obox/devicelist.aspx?nodeid=931682</a>  Bug Description: Page layout is messed up.  Discussion:  It appears that the HTML served for Safari &amp; Firefox is different and  that's the source of the problem  looking at the source for the page in  Safari vs FF we can see that:        * There appears to be at least one .js file included in the version  pulled down by Safari that isn't included in the FF version.        * If you search for #ctl00_TopMenu2_Menu1_SkipLin you'll see that the  element is styled completely differently in both versions of the page.    I tried saving the HTML from Firefox as a bunch of static files and loaded  them into Safari where they displayed properly.    Another problem is that there are 2 Javascript errors in Safari in  in the  function which appears in a file who's header comment calls it  AtlasCompat.js  the errors occur in the function _loadSafariCompatLayer and  are on lines 377 &amp; 2225  I only looked at the one on line 377 which is:  HTMLElement.prototype.attachEvent = attachEventProxy;  The problem is that HTMLElement.prototype is null  it's assigned on line  327 as:  HTMLElement.prototype = HTMLHtmlElement.__proto__.__proto__;    This is probably some hack for an older version of Safari  since things  where messed up badly enough for this to not manifest in any noticeable  way  I don't really know if this is even a problem. </pre>
