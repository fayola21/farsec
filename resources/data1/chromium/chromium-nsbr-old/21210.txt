<title>Issue 21210 -   chromium -    integrated bitmap fonts are not used for Chinese fonts in GNU/Linux version of Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.204.0      Firefox 3.x:OK      1.Launch the GNU/Linux version of Chromium  2.open any Chinese web page  3.the Chinese words aren't displayed with the integrated bitmap fonts   which is uncomfortable to read and is ugly.      The Chinese characters should be displayed with bitmap fonts instead of  antialiased fonts.      The Chinese characters are not displayed with bitmap fonts.    Note that usually Chinese characters should be displayed with Bitmap fonts  on the screen as the characters is different from  or more complex than   western alphabets. And usually a Chinese .ttf file contains both bitmap  fonts for displaying of normal font sizes  and vector fonts for printing  and displaying of large font sizes.    attachments are the same web page displayed in Firefox and Chromium. </pre>
