<title>Issue 2350 -   chromium -    add &quot;up&quot; navigation button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request for an &quot;up&quot; button to navigate on websites.    Currently  there is a forward and backward button with drop down  capabilities. For me  one missing but very often used button is the &quot;up&quot;  button from the Google bar. It strips directories and websites from the URL  until it is at the main website. This is very useful to jump to the main  website after landing on a sub page or higher sub-pages.    My proposal or idea is to place an upward arrow between the back and  forward button with the same drop down menu capabilities and copy the  current functionality from the Google bar. </pre>
