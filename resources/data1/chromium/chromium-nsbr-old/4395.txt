Go to the ftp  it will bring up an authentication box  in which you should   type a username and a password.  2. Press Alt+Tab to go to another window.  3. Press Alt+Tab to go back to the Chrome (login) window.  4. Start typing the username.      The username will be typed.      There is no focus on the authentication window.  Pressing Tab will go through the elements of the page.  No way to reach the authentication window with the keyboard anymore.    Also  when putting the username@ before the domain  the username should   already be in the username field of the authentication window  should it not?   </pre>
