<title>Issue 7594 -   chromium -    Right Click Context Menus Don't Always Work In Google Docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=">http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=</a> ...          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open a Google Docs word processor document that contains embedded   images.  2. Click on the image.  3. Right-click on the image.      The image should be selected in step 2 and a context menu with options   related to the image should pop up in step 3.      The selection cursor doesn't change in step 2  and the standard context   menu comes up. No image-related options are available.    At first I thought this was only a problem with images  but it appears to   happen sometimes with tables or other text selections as well. I can't seem   to find any consistency to how it happens but it might be related to the   current selection. But it is always reproducible on images. </pre>
