<title>Issue 16455 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Create application shortcuts doesn't create shortcut with the app logo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is happening on Win7 7260 build      1. Go to reader.google.com and login  2. Click on the page icon and select Create application shortcuts    What is the expected output?   Shortcut should be created with the app logo    What do you see instead?  A default icon will be seen    This works fine with 172.33 official build but not with Chromium build   20376 </pre>
