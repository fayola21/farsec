<title>Issue 11236 -   chromium -    We need a way to do A/B testing of SDCH compression latency - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SDCH has been implemented in Chromium as a transport compression protocol.    We need to be able to test its overall performance in a controlled manner.    We should first remove selection bias by making sure that an SDCH   compression transaction can take place  nad then we should randomly decide   to use (or at least advertise) SDCH capability to the server. </pre>
