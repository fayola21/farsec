<title>Issue 4792 -   chromium -    Use same SiteInstance for pages from different ports - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a page.  2. In same browsing instance (e.g.  tab)  visit a page from the same domain   and protocol  but served from a different port.          The new page should belong to the same SiteInstance (and be rendered in the   same process) as the old page.  Currently  Chromium creates a new   SiteInstance for the new page because the port is different.    Adam Barth points out that two pages from the same domain and protocol can   still access each other's contents  even if they are served from different   ports.  In other words  if two pages change their document.domain variables   to match  any difference in the page's ports is then ignored by the Same   Origin Policy.    There's no major problems caused by this currently because we're pretty   conservative about when we switch renderer processes  but we should fix it. </pre>
