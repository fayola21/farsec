<title>Issue 7259 -   chromium -    Right click on Tab strip  hold and releasing button in content area  should not display context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1101244&gt;  Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8964)    --Right click on Tabstrip (don't release the button)  hold  drag the mouse  to content area and release the (right)button.      Notice Tabstrip's context menu is displayed at cursor position as soon as  mouse (right)button is released.    Note: Incase of IE  FF  the above behavior is ignored  i mean no context  menu is displayed once the button is released in content area.   </pre>
