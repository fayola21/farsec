<title>Issue 3464 -   chromium -    Can't remove the bookmark on the bubble with return key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to any webpage and press Ctrl+d to get bookmark bubble.   2. Do tabbing to get focus on 'Remove' link.    We can notice two issues here:    1) 'Remove' is not highlighted with Keyboard focus.  2) While keyboard focus is on 'remove' link  hit return key to remove the   bookmark.      What is the expected output?  Bookmark should be deleted.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.    PS: we accept &quot;Space bar&quot; input on &quot;remove&quot; link of the bookmark bubble.       </pre>
