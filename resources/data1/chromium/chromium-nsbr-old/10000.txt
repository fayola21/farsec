<title>Issue 10000 -   chromium -    Settings fubared after sudden shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)    I had Chrome (beta channel) running on my Windows machine during the recent   Mountain View power outage (April 8).  When I restarted the machine  and   chrome  an odd collection of settings had been changed/forgotten:  1) The thumbnails of favorite websites on a new tab are all missing  and   remain missing even after revisiting those sites.  2) My search engine settings  both keyword-based ones and even having any   default search engine  were all wiped out.  3) Suggest in the omnibox stopped working  despite its checkbox remaining   checked.    However  it did not lose any of my bookmarks  history  or cookies.    I've been repairing #2 (search engine settings) by hand  but I can't figure   out a fix for #1 or #3 (on the plus side  these still being broken means I   should be able to provide artifacts of this bad state  if told what you   need).    I haven't tried reproducing it  since I'm not keen on cutting power to my   computer repeatedly while it's running. </pre>
