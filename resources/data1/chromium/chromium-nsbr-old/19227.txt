<title>Issue 19227 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar taking up only half the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;3.0.198.1&gt;                Hi     As soon as I opened this new version of chrome I noticed the bookmark   bar now takes up only half the screen.  It seems to be cutting out right in   the middle of the favicon as shown in my screenshot.   </pre>
