<title>Issue 11929 -   chromium -    OS X: Breakpad not dumping crash reports - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps to reproduce:  * In international preferences set &quot;_��__��__��__��__��_&quot; to be the default system   language.  * Launch Chrome.  * Watch Chrome silently crash (this bug is about breakpad  not the fact   Chrome is crashing here).    Expected results:  If Chrome Crashes we should get a Minidump.    Actual results:  No Crash log is generated.  Breakpad prints the following to the console:  5/13/09 4:38:11 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.69693[401] Breakpad   Reporter: unable to determine minidump file length    </pre>
