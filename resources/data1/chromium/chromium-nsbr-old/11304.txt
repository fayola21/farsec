<title>Issue 11304 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Shift directionality shortcut may not work for certain richtext lines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.178.0 (14981)��_��_��_                       : 2.0.177.1��_��_��_  URLs (if applicable) : Gmail      Firefox 3.x: OK (on Gmail's Old version only)           IE 8: FAIL    It is possible to &quot;confuse&quot; Chrome somehow:    1. In Gmail's Compose Mail richtext box write &quot;Hello&quot; while the richtext   bar is set to Left to Right and Align Left.  2. Click on the Right to Left button in the richtext bar  3. Click on the Align Left button in the richtext bar  4. Try using the Ctrl+Right/LeftShift keyboard combination on that line  even try to synchronize the alignment/directionality using the richtext bar   first      hmmm...      Ctrl+R/LShift will not work on that line ever again ;)      Additional information:  This is low priority    FF passes only in the old version of Gmail as it doesn't support keyboard   directionality changing for the newer version.    IE8 has the same problem as chrome (but in the old version of Gmail too    because just like FF and unlike Chrome  it doesn't support keyboard   directionality changing for the newer version) </pre>
