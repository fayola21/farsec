<title>Issue 6472 -   chromium -    BUG: Suddenly No Images And Forgetting The Session On Restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.0    I was browsing several websites  including GMail  Google Reader and some   other  not resourceful websites.  As I was reading a post in Google Reader that had a lot of pictures in it (over   30  though not that big  like 400x400 each  I think). I switched to the GMail   tab and returned to the Google Reader tab to find that all of the pictures were   suddenly missing. Going back to GMail and other websites revealed that   most of the pictures were missing from them as well (without reloading them).  Now  it could be a memory problem -  I have Outlook (with an opened message)  Windows Live Messenger 2009    Google Talk and Chrome with about 8 tabs or more working unminimized and Norton AntiVirus 2007 and WinAMP 5.541 (playing) on the background (plus   the rest of the ongoing services applications  HP printer and Microsoft   parasites).  Windows XP SP 3 Professional Edition  Gigabyte ATI X300    When I pressed PrintScreen  pasted the image in Paint and edited it  saving   the picture would fail. Only after I shut down Chrome (the regular way)  it   succeeded.  When I started Chrome again  all of my tabs were not restored - even though I   had the optioned selected and it worked on all the other times. </pre>
