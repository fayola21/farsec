<title>Issue 2496 -   chromium -    Auto. Re-Open of more than 1 chrome windows fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.1    If i have 1 Chrome window with some tabs open and i close the window    chrome will re-open all tabs automatically if i restart chrome.  Unfortunately this function doesn't work if i have 2 or more chrome windows   opened (every window with some tabs). Chrome will only open the last Chrome   window i closed before.    In Mozilla Firefox 3 is this function working properly.    Regards     Andi </pre>
