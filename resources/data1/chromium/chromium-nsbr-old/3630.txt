<title>Issue 3630 -   chromium -    Improper cleanup of IPC Channel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The IPC Channel exposes a Close() method that attempts cleanup of the   channel before closing it. The problem is that if there is a pending IO   operation when the method is called  it just cancels the registration and   if this action is performed from the object's destructor  it will   immediately delete the overlapped structure that was handled to the OS.   What follows is the OS using memory that was already released. </pre>
