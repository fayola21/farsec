<title>Issue 12720 -   chromium -    Text file is rendered as a media player - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-</a>  protocol.txt  2. Notice that the file is rendered as a media player.        I expect to see this rendered as a text file. Instead  I see a media player   (image attached). Looks like mime-type sniffing gone awry.        I am using Chromium 3.0.182.1 (16855) (ToT as of yesterday) on Vista 64.
