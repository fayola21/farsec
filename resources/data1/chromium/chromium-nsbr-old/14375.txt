<title>Issue 14375 -   chromium -    [ecampus.lasalleonline.net]: pop-up blocker does not allow me to see the classes of the ecampus of the university - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://ecampus.lasalleonline.net">http://ecampus.lasalleonline.net</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?        You need to be logged in the web and then when you click to visualize the   classes it opens first a window to select the classes and after that another   one with the class embedded in a real-media player. It is the e-campus of the   university La Salle      What is the expected result?      I should be able to disable the pop-up blocker as I do in safari 4    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    fine for Safari 4  FF3.0  IE8         </pre>
