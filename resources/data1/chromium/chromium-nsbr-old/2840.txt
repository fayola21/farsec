<title>Issue 2840 -   chromium -    Long URL causes flickering tool-tip on new-tab-page and 100% cpu usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.154.0 (Developer Build 2596)                  First  add a page with a long URL to the &quot;Recently closed tabs&quot; list:  1. Open the new-tab-page.  2. Right-click the chromium ball logo in the upper right hand corner of the   page (which has a very long data: url) and choose &quot;Open image in new tab&quot;.  3. Close the tab.    Then  do this:  4. Open / refresh the new-tab-pag.  5. Hover the mouse cursor on the data:image/png... entry in the &quot;Recently   closed tabs&quot; list.    Note: This has nothing to do with the URL being a data: URL. It happens   with other URLs  too.      The URL that appears in the tool-tip should be truncated and followed by an   ellipsis when it gets too long.      The URL is truncated  the tool-tip flickers and CPU usage goes up to 100%   while the tool-tip is displayed.    </pre>
