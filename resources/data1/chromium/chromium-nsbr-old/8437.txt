<title>Issue 8437 -   chromium -    Cannot switch to background Chrome window with modal dialog open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chrome (non-maximized) - I tried TOT from this morning.  2. Open any modal dialog in Chrome or type ...     javascript:alert('modal');     ... into the address box and hit enter.  3. Switch to another application window but make sure it's window doesn't   fully obscure the Chrome window.   4. Try to switch back to Chrome by clicking on the Chrome window in the   background (note: click outside the modal dialog).    In 1.0 you could click anywhere inside the Chrome window to activate it.  In 2.0 the Chrome window does not come to the foreground unless you click   inside the modal dialog.     This is extremely frustrating if  for example  the modal dialog is obscured by   a foreground window.     </pre>
