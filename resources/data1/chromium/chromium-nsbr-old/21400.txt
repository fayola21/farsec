<title>Issue 21400 -   chromium -    Stop using crash_service.exe on the build slave - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issue:  crash_service.exe acts as a breakpad recipient and saves the crash dumps. The dump   accumulates on the slaves without never being looked at since the pdb are usually   stale anyway.      Solution:  Instead  each unit test should setup its own instance of breakpad to dump the stack   trace in stdout when not under a debugger. Stack traces is much more useful than   memory dumps to that regard since 'at least they're on the buildbot stdio logs' for   the try slaves  won't work for continuous build because symbols aren't always copied   over.  crash_service is windows-only but the proposed implementation is platform agnostic.      Implementation:  Grab the guts that initializes breakpad out of crash_service.cc and into   base/test_suite.h.  Most tests will get it free since  chrome/test/ui/ui_test_suite.h #include chrome/test/unit/chrome_test_suite.h which   #include base/test_suite.h.  UITestSuite::LoadCrashService() needs to be removed.  Fix StackTrace to print out of process exceptions.      Summary:  Don't save memory dump  instead just print the stack trace with StackTrace. If   crash_service.exe is already running  don't initialize the breakpad bucket.    Keep crash_service.exe around just in case but stop using it on the slaves. </pre>
