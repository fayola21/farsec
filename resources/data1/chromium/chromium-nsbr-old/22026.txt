<title>Issue 22026 -   chromium -    OCSP Verification should not retry immediately. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Visit a site that uses a certificate that points to an unreachable OCSP Server  2. Wait the 4+ seconds it takes for the site to load  3. Click on another link and see that each link takes 4 seconds to load.      After the initial timeout/failure of the OCSP verification chromium should wait a while before trying   again.      It tries again immediately.      I seem to have run into the same issue detailed here:  <a href="http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/forum/topics/wrap-has-turned-extremely-slow">http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/forum/topics/wrap-has-turned-extremely-slow</a>    An internal website I run uses an SSL cert from IPSCA  but ocsp.ipsca.com is not working properly..   it seems to timeout and or return a 403 error.    as a workaround I added     127.0.0.1   ocsp.ips.es  127.0.0.1   ocsp.ipsca.com    to my hosts file.  This fixes the 4+ second delay  but I can see that for every page I load  chrome   sends two POSTS to my local webserver.    I have also tried turning off the &quot;Check for server certificate revocation&quot; option  but that doesn't   make a difference. </pre>
