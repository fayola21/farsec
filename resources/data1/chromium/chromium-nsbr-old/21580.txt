Open two windows with one tab each.  2. Drag one tab over the other window until it snaps and then drag it away. Don't release the   mouse while doing this.        Consistent looks of dragged tab.      When starting  title bar is invisible. After snapping  it's partly visible.    This can't be reproduced before build 25899 because it was not possible before   pinkerton@chromium.org fixed <a title="Separated tabs can't be merged into separated windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15108"> Issue 15108 </a> yesterday. </pre>
