<title>Issue 18039 -   chromium -    Selected default font sizes do not predict how big fonts will be across a wide range of websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Open up a web page.  For example  'The Chromium Blog'.  2.Look at the font size selected in the 'Fonts and Languages' menu.  3.Notice that the example font size does not match the website's font size.  4.Notice the example font size does not match the 'Preview' font size.      I expect there to be greater coordination between the preview font sizes   and the web page's main font.      After this update  there is tremendous variation between the main fonts of   different websites  especially compared to Windows.  Sometimes the fonts   are tiny  some times they are the correct size  sometimes they are far too   big.    <b>Please provide
