<title>Issue 21166 -   chromium -    Selecting items in completion popup menus doesn't autofill their textboxes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    OS version               : 10.5.8.  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works      1. Go to a text box that you've used before  e.g. the search box on   crbug.com  2. Enter a letter  3. Press down to select something from the completion popup        The text from the popup should be copied to the text box  but the part of   it that was newly inserted should be selected  so that i can &quot;type over&quot; it if   I want (e.g. if I enter &quot;th&quot; and then select &quot;thakis&quot;  &quot;akis&quot; should be inserted    but selected).        The text is not inserted. It _is_ sent when hitting enter  but I often select   something from that popup and edit it a bit afterwards  which is not   possible.    The &quot;should happen&quot; behavior is how it works in Safari and TextEdit  and   everywhere else where stuff is completed. </pre>
