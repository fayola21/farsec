<title>Issue 22593 -   chromium -    Mac ffmpeg binaries built incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The mac ffmpeg binaries that have been checked in are straight-up incorrectly built.  I had   rebuilt the mac_dbg binaries using the latest set of patches  but the standard mac binaries are   still on the old version.     We should redo the builds of both to be certain.    To build the debug versions of the binaries  do 2 things.      1) remove the --disable-debug flag    2) edit the generated config.mk after running configure and change      STRIP=strip           to      STRIP=true    The first generates symbols.  The second steps avoids stripping the binaries during make install.    The problem is after the rebuild  videos no longer seem to load. </pre>
