<title>Issue 12559 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes on incomplete web page load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28 (official build) on Windows  URLs (if applicable) : n/a         Safari 4: not tested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: not tested      1. Open web page in Chrome that is incomplete.    * Notes about &quot;incomplete&quot;: i.e. with opening tags but without closing   tags.  This may be due to a firewall that cuts off the loading of pages in   the middle  or perhaps a (very) lazy developer.    A simple page that exhibits this defect (paste into Notepad and save as a   .html  then view in browser without passing through other software):    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;      Web page renders up to cutoff point  with tags silently closed by the   renderer.      &quot;Whoa  Google Chrome crashed!&quot; </pre>
