<title>Issue 19049 -   chromium -    Call SSLSetPeerID to enable SSL session resumption on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are not calling SSLSetPeerID on the Mac.  I haven't examined  our SSL packet traces  but I believe this means we're always  doing full handshakes and not resuming SSL sessions.    SSLSetPeerID is documented at  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/Reference/secureTransportRe">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/Reference/secureTransportRe</a>  f/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000155-CH1g-BCIFDEFB </pre>
