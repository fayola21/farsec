<title>Issue 3508 -   chromium -    Chrome beeps where others don't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Put the focus in a text area.  Press ctl-C to copy.  Chrome beeps.    IE  Firefox  Safari/Win  and Windows notepad do not beep.    Examining <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/WebKit/WebCore">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/WebKit/WebCore</a>  /editing/Editor.cpp?view=markup   it looks like WebKit wants to beep in   this circumstance.  I wonder why Safari doesn't do it.  Maybe this is a mac   thing?    (If anyone has a mac and can comment whether Safari beeps and whether other   mac apps beep  that'd help.) </pre>
