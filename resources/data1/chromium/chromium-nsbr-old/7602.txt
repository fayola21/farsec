Install per-user chrome build (e.g. chrome.google.com)  2. (On Vista keep checked the &quot;Make chrome the default browser.&quot;  3. Log off.  4. Login as any other user.          Notice that in XP (Start-&gt;Set Program Access and Defaults  Internet   Options) and in Vista (Start-&gt;Default Programs) the second user has a   system setting option to make Chrome the default browser  however this will   only screw up their system since Chrome can not be executed by this user.    HKLMSoftwareClientStartMenuInternetchrome.exe should not be created on   a per-user install.  HKLMSoftwareRegisteredApplications should not be set on per-user install.    On per-user install only HKCU keys should be changed.        Vista and XP </pre>
