<title>Issue 23133 -   chromium -    it would be nice to have a &quot;no animate&quot; option for chrome.tabs.move - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I wrote an extension for customizing tab focus behavior. One of the things it   lets you do is ensure that all newly opened tabs show up on the far right of   a window. When it calls chrome.tabs.move  we show animation as the tab moves   over and this makes it feel janky. It would be nice to have an option to skip   the animation.    I guess an alternative solution would be to have a new api that lets you   register an interceptor for new tab creation that lets you customize things   like what window it opens in  and at what index. </pre>
