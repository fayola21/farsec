<title>Issue 14766 -   chromium -    [web.de]: Problems registering new account under web.de - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://web.de/">http://web.de/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Site unusable: Google Chrome blocked  or site doesn't load What is wrong?  It is not possible to register as a new user on web.de because the   selection of username is not recognised.        What is the expected result?   You should just be able to register  choose the user name from the   suggestions and complete the registration.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Visit <a href="http://web.de/">http://web.de/</a>  click on freemail and select &quot;Jetzt f��__r web.de   freemail registrieren und...&quot;  2. Enter a username  e.g. Annemarie Klener  Musterstrasse 5  23452   Musterdorf (any name just to test  this one is fake)  3. In the field &quot;Wunschname&quot; enter &quot;Annemarie&quot;  4. Choose one of the usernames suggested  a password and any answer for the   security question.    The form keeps jumping back and doesn't recognise the username you choose   from the list. It is therefore not possible to complete the registration.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Firefox    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
