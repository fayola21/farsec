<title>Issue 16236 -   chromium -    mouse back/forward buttons cause sad-tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20108">r20108</a>  a mouse back/forward button (the extra buttons on the side of   the mouse) sad tabs the renderer.    Happens every time (except when the web page is already sad tabbed  in   which case chromium handles the button press and it causes a navigation).    Appears to be due to the fact that webkit is expecting every mouse button   click to be a left  right  or middle. Instead it is getting ButtonNone   since the conversion code is:        result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonNone;      if (event-&gt;state &amp; GDK_BUTTON1_MASK)          result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonLeft;      else if (event-&gt;state &amp; GDK_BUTTON2_MASK)          result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonMiddle;      else if (event-&gt;state &amp; GDK_BUTTON3_MASK)          result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonRight;    This causes an assert:    (third_party/WebKit/WebCore/dom/Node.cpp:2631 bool   WebCore::Node::dispatchMouseEvent(const WebCore::PlatformMouseEvent&amp;  const   WebCore::AtomicString&amp;  int  WebCore::Node*))    I assume that this is a new assert and we aren't actually doing anything   different than before. I only observed this on linux but I suspect it   happens on windows as well where the relevant code is:            result.type = WebInputEvent::MouseMove;          if (wparam &amp; MK_LBUTTON)              result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonLeft;          else if (wparam &amp; MK_MBUTTON)              result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonMiddle;          else if (wparam &amp; MK_RBUTTON)              result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonRight;          else              result.button = WebMouseEvent::ButtonNone;    Darin: should we only be sending mouse events to the renderer for the first   3 buttons (i.e. fix is in chromium)  or is webkit freaking out for no   reason? </pre>
