<title>Issue 13401 -   chromium -    Restart dialog should have Restart button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you go to the about box and click Update Now  when the Update is done   installing you get a dialog box telling you to close all the windows and   restart Chrome.    The dialog box should instead read something like:    You need to restart Google Chrome to start using this update. If you restart   now  your tabs and windows will be restored.    Restart Now / Later    This requires some system by which the app can restart itself. </pre>
