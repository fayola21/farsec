<title>Issue 11287 -   chromium -    Add presubmit checks for BUG and TEST - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should have a presubmit check that ensures a CL has a BUG= line and a   TEST= line to enforce the practice of filing bugs for tasks and writing tests   for new code.    The test should allow for the values to be junk ('none' or 'n/a'  etc) so   that people can still submit trivial stuff and build fixes without needing   real values here.     We should also modify gcl's template to add these lines. </pre>
