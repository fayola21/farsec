<title>Issue 15891 -   chromium -    Implement showModalDialog on mac &amp; linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing this to track the feature.  I don't think it ever worked for it.    I have added a regression test for this  once the feature is implemented: ShowModalDialogTest.BasicTest </pre>
