<title>Issue 16629 -   chromium -    Plugins broken as of 3.0.192.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.1 binary           Chrome: 3.0.191.3 binary: OK      1. Create dir C:tmp if it doesn't exist  2. Load attached extension (compile  move compiled dll to extension folder   run chrome.exe --enable-extensions --load-extension=&quot;path/to/extension&quot;  3. Close the browser  4. Repeat a few times (generally happens in under 5)      Not fatal errors      Fatal errors    (All the extension does is log to C:tmplog.txt when the external  functions are called  which I can't see any way of justifying how it can be  causing fatal errors of its own) </pre>
