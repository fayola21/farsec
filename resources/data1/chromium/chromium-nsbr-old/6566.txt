Go to some page  e.g. <a href="http://www.googlesyndication.com">http://www.googlesyndication.com</a> in 1st tab.  2. Open 2nd tab.  3. Switch to 1st tab.  4. Right-click on link (e.g. &quot;Advanced Search&quot;) to bring up context menu.  4. Select &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; from menu.    Note that tabs are all compressed to the left-hand side.
