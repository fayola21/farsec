<title>Issue 10992 -   chromium -    DCHECK(!paint_rect_.IsEmpty()); in RenderWidget::OnResize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While doing some work with extension toolbars  I started hitting DCHECK(!paint_rect_.IsEmpty()); in RenderWidget::OnResize().      The issue appears to be that Size::IsEmpty() uses a different test than   Rect::IsEmpty() (width == 0 &amp;&amp; height == 0) vs. (width == 0 || height == 0).    So the previous if test against the size didn't match the DCHECK.   </pre>
