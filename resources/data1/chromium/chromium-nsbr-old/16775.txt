<title>Issue 16775 -   chromium -    First run bubble doesn't work great for xmonad/dark themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So here's what the first run bubble looks like for me (see attachment)    The dark themes bit is easy  we just need to force the text to black since   we force the background to white. The wrong placement thing is hopefully   also a quick fix.    Side note: the bookmark bubble also is illegible for me  for the same   reason. </pre>
