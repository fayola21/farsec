<title>Issue 17897 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] - DevTools - Add hover/tooltip elements to javascript variables - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	3.0.193.2 (Official Build 21134)  WebKit	531.3  V8	1.2.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.193.2 Safari/531.3      Currently in the Javascript debugger  if you have a long variable:  fooVar: &quot;alsdkfjaslkdjfsaldkfjsaldkfjsdlkfjsaldfkjsaldfkjsaldkfjslkf&quot;    It will show up as:  fooVar: &quot;alsdkfjaslkdjfsaldkfjsaldkfjsdlkfjsa...    I would expect that hovering over the variable content would show me a   tooltip/hover widget showing me the full content of the variable.  As it   stands today  I can double click it and copy it to another window  but that   seems like a bad user experience.  I can also try to expand the right   panel  but that will not always show me the full content. </pre>
