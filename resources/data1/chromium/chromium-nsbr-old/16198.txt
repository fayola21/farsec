<title>Issue 16198 -   chromium -    add Omaha version to about:version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Occasionally  end-users run into problems with autoupdate.  It would be   helpful for diagnosing these problems if we could verify the version of Omaha   that they're running  and perhaps to get access to other diagnostic info   (logs? current update status?) since this data is otherwise hard to get (you   have to look in the registry). </pre>
