<title>Issue 13703 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Omnibox2 does not allow mouse dragging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Type a character to open the omnibox.  Mouse down on it.  Drag the mouse up   and down.    Expected: Selected line moves.  Actual: Nothing happens  and on release the line that is shown as selected   activates  even if the mouse is nowhere nearby.    This works fine in the old dropdown. </pre>
