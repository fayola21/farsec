<title>Issue 19991 -   chromium -    Linux Certificate Management UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Manage certificates&quot; should launch a   configuration dialog rather than a wiki page.  We intend to launch a system   utility like we do for proxy configuration  but one does not exist yet.    This bug is just to track that we still need one. </pre>
