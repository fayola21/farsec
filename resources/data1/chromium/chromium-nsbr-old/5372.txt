<title>Issue 5372 -   chromium -    Omnibox shouldn't capture alt-home - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.36 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6676">r6676</a>)  Sorry  I could not able to get right title for the bug :(    I just noticed  some thing is screwed up with inputting first char in  omnibox  If user hits (alt+home) twice/thrice and types something in Omnibox.    Use Case1:  New Tab - set as home page.  -Create a [New Tab]  -Hit Alt+Home twice/thrice very fast and type any letter in Omnibox.  Result:  I will get the first character as blank space/empty square/___/some special  character  then every thing is fine with second char onwards.    Use Case2:  -Any webpage (eg: google.com) set as home page.  -Create a [New Tab]  -Hit Alt+home twice.  Result: User is navigated to google.com page and then immediately to [New  Tab] --This result happens most of the time for me.    I believe above two use cases may be referring to same issue (?).    Demonstrated the same behavior even with 149.30 build also.       </pre>
