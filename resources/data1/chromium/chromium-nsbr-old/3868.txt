<title>Issue 3868 -   chromium -    installer should check for conditions where chrome is known to fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be good if the installer could detect the most common reasons why   chrome would not work on someone's computer:    - incorrect version of OS  - known conflicts with security software  - etc.    We could then give the user a message letting them know how to fix the   problem. Right now most users just get a crash and don't know how to fix   it. </pre>
