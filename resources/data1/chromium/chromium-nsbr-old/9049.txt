<title>Issue 9049 -   chromium -    Prompt for default browser on second run (and subsequent launches) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If chrome is not set as the default browser  it should prompt to take the   default browser setting (like all other browsers do) on launch.    However  we should not prompt on the first run because users will not be   ready to make a decision yet.  The prompt should also have a &quot;don't ask me again&quot; checkbox.   </pre>
