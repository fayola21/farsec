<title>Issue 5123 -   chromium -    Should be able to create application shortcuts using Chrome and Chromium (?). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Build: 0.4.154.31 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)  Chromium Build: 0.5.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6362">r6362</a>)    This is really annoying and confusing for me.    1. I will create a application shortcut for a webpage (Eg: google.com)  using CHROME in all 3 places(Desktop  Start Menu  Quick Launch Bar).  [Notice the target for these shortcuts is Chrome as usual ]    2. Again create a application shortcut for the same webpage (Eg:  google.com) using CHROMIUM in all 3 places (Desktop  Start Menu  Quick  Launch Bar)  [Notice the target for these shortcuts also Chrome only]    Expected:  --In case  If we support shortcuts with both Chrome and Chromium (at the  same time and for the same webpage)  THEN the shortcuts should be created  for CHROMIUM ALSO for the specified locations.    --In case  If we don't support shortcuts with both Chrome and Chromium (at  the same time and for the same webpage)  then the existing shortcuts should  be replaced by the new shortcuts (in this case target should point to Chromium)    Observation:  ############  In step1  I will create a (CHROME)shortcut only in quick launch bar and  In step2  I will create a (CHROMIUM) shortcut only in quick launch bar and  Desktop  Then in this scenario  the target for quick launch bar shortcut is  CHROME and CHROMIUM for that of Desktop one's    In a nutshell  I believe the bug over here is  we are not replacing the  existing shortcuts with the new targets. </pre>
