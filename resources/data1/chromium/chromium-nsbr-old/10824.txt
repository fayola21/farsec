<title>Issue 10824 -   chromium -    Calling uninstaller recursively should give focus to already open dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps  -----  1. Go to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Google Chrome and launch uninstall.exe   (This will bring up confirmation dialog)  2. Repeat step 1    Expected: Focus should be given to already open confirmation dialog    Actual: We get a new dialog saying &quot;Please close all chrome windows and try   again&quot;    Similarly  when Chrome process is running and if try to launch uninstaller    we get a dialog &quot;Please close all chrome windows and try again&quot;. Calling   uninstaller again opens a new dialog instead of giving focus to already   opened one.    </pre>
