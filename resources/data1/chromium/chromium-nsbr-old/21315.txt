Shift click &quot;compose mail&quot; in corp gmail    A new window opens and the compose pane starts to load. After a few seconds    the new window and the original gmail window crash. Sometimes I get a cascade   of &quot;unresponsive&quot; plugin dialogs along with a blank error dialog (see   attached).    FWIW  I'm running 4.0.202.0 and there is an update pending (waiting for me to   restart).   </pre>
