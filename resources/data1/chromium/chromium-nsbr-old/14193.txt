<title>Issue 14193 -   chromium -    Histograms are using base::Time rather than base::TimeTicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Doing a search for UMA_HISTOGRAM*  it appears most callers that specify a   time delta for UMA histograms are doing so by using base::Time::Now() to   measure the endpoints.    It is better to use base::TimeTicks::Now()  since we care about only the   difference  and not the absolute time value.    base::Time::Now() is tied to the system clock.    So if the user change's their clock after one time snapshot is take  the   delta reported for the histogram will be totally wonky.    Whereas base::TimeTicks::Now() is an always increasing value (according to   time.h). </pre>
