<title>Issue 6363 -   chromium -    Popup blocker overzealous  needs heuristic improvements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On at least some sites  our popup blocker makes it painful to use the site    because we don't or can't catch &quot;user-initiated&quot; popups as such.  It's not   yet clear whether we'd need better heuristics  some sort of   whitelisting/granular control  or what  so before designing a solution  I'm   simply collecting example sites where Chrome is painful right now.    * Visit <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/index?bhcp=1">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/index?bhcp=1</a> and click in the   page's upper navigation bar where it says &quot;map&quot;.  This causes a navigation   to a new HTML page which auto-opens a popup and then does history.go(-1);.    The best heuristic I could think of for this is &quot;allow onload popups for   pages loaded by a user-gesture  whose origin page was within the same   site&quot;.  erg thinks this is still pretty exploitable.    * Visit <a href="http://www.in2art.com/art-supplies/sharpie-markers">http://www.in2art.com/art-supplies/sharpie-markers</a> and click on one   of the products.  Not sure exactly why the resulting popup gets blocked. </pre>
