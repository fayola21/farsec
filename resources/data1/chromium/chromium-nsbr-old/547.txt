<title>Issue 547 -   chromium -    Windows 2000 Support Requested - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For me the one and decisive issue for Google Chrome is that it doesn't run  on Windows 2000. Would it be too hard to change that?  <a href="http://compn.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/google-chrome-does-not-work-on-windows-2000/">http://compn.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/google-chrome-does-not-work-on-windows-2000/</a>  suggests not  but I assume that's just an outsider's speculation. So  what  are the chances?    Sebastian Lisken   </pre>
