<title>Issue 21993 -   chromium -    I can not access my personal email http://gmx.es - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Build oficial 26042)  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://gmx.es">http://gmx.es</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1.Activity in google chrome  2.put the web <a href="http://gmx.es">http://gmx.es</a>  3.and I can not access my personal email because your browser is not   compatible.      The result we hope is that the web is compatible with Google Chrome 3 since   it is the page for my personal email and I can not access my personal mail.      What happens in this web mail is that when I put my account and my password   I put that to use the GMX Mail is required to use the Safari  Firefox and   IE.   I have communicated with GMX support and they said that with Google Chrome   2 if it worked  but have tried to make it work for version 3 and say they   know that other changes can make  which should modify the Google his code   of the web browser to accept <a href="http://gmx.es">http://gmx.es</a>        I attached a screenshot of the error that goes anywhere.       </pre>
