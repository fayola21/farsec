<title>Issue 22492 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Gears Crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.4    running gmail or calendar with offline enabled is flaky. Seems to have a hard   time syncing (offline logo keeps spinning) and gears crashes repeatably.    Reloading sometimes manages to sync  sometimes not but eventually  gears will   crash.     </pre>
