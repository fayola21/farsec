<title>Issue 22811 -   chromium -    Status bubble should display if a link opens in a new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Safari  when hovering over a link  in the status bar is hinted if the link is   opened in a new window or not (or in a tab  or downloaded).    I'm not sure if Safari's way is the best way  but I think it would be nice if   Chrome could visually indicate what is done with the link.     A similar case is dragging a file on windows. When using modifier keys  or   crossing volume boundaries  the copy/move/create-shortcut action is   visualized by adding visual hint to the icon being dragged. </pre>
