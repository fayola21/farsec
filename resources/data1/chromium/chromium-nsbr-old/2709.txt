<title>Issue 2709 -   chromium -    Add support for moveTo and resizeTo on top-level windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add a command-line switch or preference to enable moveTo and resizeTo on   top-level windows.    This may help with some testing.  For instance  Selenium uses these   functions to simulate maximizing the window. </pre>
