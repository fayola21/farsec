<title>Issue 5242 -   chromium -    Gmail uses Symbol font after colored text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A gmail message containing colored text displays in Symbol font following   the colored portion.  The same message is also in Symbol font in IE6  but   displays properly in Firefox.    Seen in Chrome 0.2.149.30 and 0.4.154.31.    See attached screenshot. I can also forward a copy of the actual email to   someone investigating this. </pre>
