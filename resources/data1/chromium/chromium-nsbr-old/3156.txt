If you use IME and the Japanese keyword is during the IME conversion  even   if you select NavSuggest suggested item  you are not redirected to the   site  but to get the search result on the search provider.    Repro steps:  1. Launch Chrome  2. Active IME  3. Type &quot;sebun&quot; in Japanese (= ��_�_���__��_��__)  4. NOT finalize the conversion (Do NOT hit any key) and then click   NavSuggest suggested item which is &quot;www.sej.co.jp   ��_�_���__��_��__��__��_��_��__��_�Ε�_��__��_��__��_�_��_��_���  ��_��_��__&quot;��_��_��_(as attached)  5. www.sej.co.jp is displayed on the OminiBox and nothing happens  6. Hit return to get the search result page of &quot;www.sej.co.jp&quot;    Expected behavior:  Be navigated to www.sej.co.jp in step 5 above    OS: Windows XP SP2  Build: 0.2.149.23 </pre>
