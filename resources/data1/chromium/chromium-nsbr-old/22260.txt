<title>Issue 22260 -   chromium -    Status bubble can draw over pop-up blocker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download something so that the download bar shows up.  This is   necessary because we need a way to force the status bubble over to the   right side of the page.  2. With the download shelf showing  get some blocked pop-ups  so that   the pop-up blocker bubble shows up.  <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/">http://www.popuptest.com/</a> has   some tests that will bring up the pop-up blocker bubble.  3. While on the site with the blocked pop-ups  position a link so that it's at   the bottom left of the viewport and put the mouse over it.  This will cause a   status bubble to open up on the right side of the window.      Expect: pop-up blocker and status bubble to not conflict.  Observe: status bubble obscures pop-up blocker.      Windows 4.0.206.1  I don't see this on the Mac or Linux because the status bubble does not   move to the right in this situation.  <a title="Status bubbles can overlap download bar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22198"> Bug 22198 </a> for the Mac. </pre>
