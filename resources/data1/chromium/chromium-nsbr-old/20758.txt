<title>Issue 20758 -   chromium -    Defend against Flash in a 'netscape' directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Flash doesn't work if any of the directory components leading to it contain   &quot;netscape&quot;.  However  we need to call realpath()  resolving symlinks  to (a)   make Java work and (b) de-duplicate multiple symlinks to the same file.    We should probably do something clever if Flash is found in a 'netscape'   directory  like using a symlink to it.  Might make deduplicating tricky. </pre>
