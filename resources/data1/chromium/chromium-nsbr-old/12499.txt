<title>Issue 12499 -   chromium -    Bash/Emacs/Cocoa text editing modifier don't work in text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 3.0.182 (182.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7          1. Type some text in a textarea or text field;  2. Hit control+a.      In Cocoa text fields you would go to the beginning of that line of text.   Other modifiers include k (to kill the rest of the line of text)  y (to yank the   text back) and e (to go to the end of the line).      Beep. </pre>
