<title>Issue 13524 -   chromium -    Implement language-picker dialog for spell checker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.184.0~svn20090605r17731-0ubuntu1    There doesn't seem to be a way to add new spellchecker dictionaries (*.bdic)   in Linux builds. Just copying them to ~/.config/chromium (I think just   recently it was decided to keep them there) doesn't do anything. </pre>
