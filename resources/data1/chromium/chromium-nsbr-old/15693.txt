<title>Issue 15693 -   chromium -    Test_shell's layout test controller can't switch to text mode if dumpAsText() is called in a timeout. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In LayoutTests/media/video-document-types.html  the change   <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/45378">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/45378</a> made the dumpAsText() be called in a   timeout callback.    Our test_shell now just ignores the call  making this a rendertree test. We   should fix this. </pre>
