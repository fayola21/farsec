<title>Issue 21570 -   chromium -    Use JSONSchema to validate extension manifests instead of doing it by hand. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're currently parsing/validating our manifests by hand and it is super   error-prone and tedious.    We should port our JavaScript implementation of JSONSchema to C++ and use   that instead. See here for the JS version:    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/renderer/resources/jso">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/renderer/resources/jso</a>  n_schema.js </pre>
