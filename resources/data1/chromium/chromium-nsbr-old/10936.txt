<title>Issue 10936 -   chromium -    Escape handling is wrong in Mac Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to a page.  2. Type &quot;word&quot;  the popup should come up.  3. Hit Escape.        It should put back the URL of the page you were on.  Instead  it clears the field.    [Secondary bug: Navigate down before hitting Esc.  Should take you to the default autocomplete   option.  Another Esc should take you to the original URL.  The first part seems to work  but should   be verified when the main bug is fixed.] </pre>
