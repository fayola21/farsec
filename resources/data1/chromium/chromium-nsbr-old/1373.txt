<title>Issue 1373 -   chromium -    Navigating dark background websites results in blinding white flashes between pages. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.alliedtribalforces.com/forum.php">http://www.alliedtribalforces.com/forum.php</a>        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Navigate through any of the links that lead to the same domain where the   dark background persists.      It is expected that you see the current page until the new page is ready to   replace it resulting in a constantly dark background.      While leaving the current dark page and before entering the new dark page   you are blinded by a white blank browser window. </pre>
