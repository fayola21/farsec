<title>Issue 12464 -   chromium -    Mac tabs sometimes resize by silly amounts. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a window right now with four tabs  three have short titles (&quot;New Tab&quot;  &quot;New Tab&quot;  and   &quot;Google&quot;)  the fourth has a long title which gets truncated with ellipses.    When I click between tabs  the difference between when the longer one is selected is just enough   that the truncation adds and drops an 'i'.  This doesn't seem directly related to the actual titles    because clicking between the short-title tabs has the selected tab resizing by the same couple   pixels.    Seems like the point at which we switch from &quot;all tabs even&quot; to &quot;main tab is bigger&quot; mode should be   when it adds more than some reasonable number of pixels.  Like 8  or 12  or 20  enough to   materially affect the main tab's title. </pre>
