Navigate to a website that requires a prompt box for password imput   (instead of a login form)      The prompt box that opens should be themed with Windows Aero if it is   activated  this problem DOES NOT occur with other pop up boxes in chrome   such as &quot;options&quot; or &quot;about&quot;      The window borders are themed with the default colors as though it were   vista basic  or XP   </pre>
