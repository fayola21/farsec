<title>Issue 2278 -   chromium -    Don't initialize MetricsService unless users have opted in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MetricsService.InitializeMetricsState is called unless users pass in a   special command-line flag disabling the metrics system.  This method   ensures that a unique client_id variable is set up and stored in prefs   (Local State)  even though it isn't used unless the user has enabled   recording.  This has led to a number of conspiracy theories that this is   some kind of tracking tag  and there's even software out there that tries   to continuously zero out the id.  We should defer creation of this id until   SetRecording(true) is called.   </pre>
