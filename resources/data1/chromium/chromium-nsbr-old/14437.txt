In setting I can only set default folder to download and showing a   dialog with a question where I went it save  bud if I went automatically   download only *.pdf files and for else type of files I want to have a   question &quot;Do you want to  download it&quot; It isn't possible set it now. It can   be a security bug maybe...       Google Chrome automatically start downloading (only if the file isn't   executable).    <b>Please provide
