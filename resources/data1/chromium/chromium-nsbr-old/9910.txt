<title>Issue 9910 -   chromium -    webkit tests are flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Pam:  On that note  though  it would be amazing if someone wanted to figure out  the interdependencies. We have three run_webkit_tests otpions available to  help:  --randomize-order  which runs the tests in a random  order;--run-singly  which launches a fresh test_shell for each test; and  --num-test-shells  which sets how many test_shell threads to run at once.  It'll be time-consuming (--run-singly is especially slow)  and there will  be some work involved in comparing the results to figure out which test(s)  are causing problems  but it would be a valuable thing. And no programing  knowledge required. </pre>
