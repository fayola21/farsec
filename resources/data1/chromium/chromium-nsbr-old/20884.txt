<title>Issue 20884 -   chromium -    gzip with multiple members aren't handled properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2 (Official Build 24690)             Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL             IE 8: FAIL        1. Produce gzip compressed file with multiple members as per RFC 1952 (e.g.   by concatinating multiple gzip files).  2. Make sure it's returned by server with &quot;Content-Encoding: gzip&quot; header   and &quot;Content-Type: text/plain&quot;.  3. Open resulting url in Chrome.        Original uncompressed content should be shown.        Chrome suggests to save file  and resulting saved file contains first   member decompressed and other members intact.    Here is a relevant quote from RFC 1952:       2.2. File format          A gzip file consists of a series of &quot;members&quot; (compressed data        sets).  The format of each member is specified in the following        section.  The members simply appear one after another in the file         with no additional information before  between  or after them.    I've just test IE8  FF2  FF3  Konqueror  Safari 3 &amp; 4 and Opera 9.  It   seems that only Opera is able to handle multiple members properly. </pre>
