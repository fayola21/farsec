<title>Issue 18391 -   chromium -    Can't remove focus from page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. I go to Google Docs or some other site that overrides Ctrl+B  2. I press Ctrl+B to get the bookmarks bar (it does bold instead)  3. I'm not giving up yet! I click on the tab to take focus from the page   and try again.        Expected: Clicking on the tab bar removes focus from the page so I can use   my keyboard shortcuts unhindered by the page's overrides    Actual: Can't remove focus from the page w/o opening/switching to a new tab   :-(   </pre>
