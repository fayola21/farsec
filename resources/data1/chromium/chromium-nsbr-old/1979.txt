<title>Issue 1979 -   chromium -    Back button when used in succession does not record my previous actions and causes Gmail to hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm running the standard issue IBM ThinkPad T34p. The laptop has a back  button near the arrow keys. When I navigate to an email on Gmail and click  on the back button  Chrome correctly navigates back to my Inbox. However   if I do this in rapid succession (i.e. read email  hit back button  read  next email  hit back button)  Gmail will eventually hang. This does not  happen in FF3. The only way I can exit the hang is to manually refresh  Gmail at which point  some of my previously read emails are no longer  marked as read. In other words  my previous actions are not recorded by Gmail. </pre>
