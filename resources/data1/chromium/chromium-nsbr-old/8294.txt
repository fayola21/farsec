Navigate to incognito mode - Hit Ctrl + Shift + N     What is the expected output?   incognito window should open without any issues.    What do you see instead?  Incognito window opens but instead of showing text - You have gone   incognito.....  it shows new tab page content (most visited broken images    show full history link etc)     Screenshot: </pre>
