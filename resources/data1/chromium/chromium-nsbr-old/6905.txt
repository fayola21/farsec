<title>Issue 6905 -   chromium -    HistoryAutocomplete should score typed versus untyped exact matches differently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I have visited a link to a URL like &quot;b&quot; which  when typed  would look   like an UNKNOWN input type  but I've never _typed_ that URL  then what   happens when the user types this and presses enter depends on whether the   popup is open and how fast they press enter.  That's because the untyped   result comes back asynchronously but is scored higher than the   synchronously available Google search result for this text.    After some thought  I think making the scoring like:  exact (typed) &gt; Google &gt; exact (untyped)  ...fixes this case and works best.  The only other option is to force   autocomplete to always run to the point where all asynchronous results   which could return a higher score than the best synchronous result have   completed.  I don't even know how to accomplish that  and it would   certainly be slow. </pre>
