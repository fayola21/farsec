<title>Issue 22731 -   chromium -    Crash when dragging loading tabs outside of main window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 26808)  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Gnome  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://gmail.com">http://gmail.com</a>      1. Start up maximized Chromium window and open up a new tab  2. Start loading <a href="http://gmail.com">http://gmail.com</a> in the new tab  3. Keep dragging the tab in and out of the main chromium window and the process will crash      N/A      Eventually the process will crash with a segmentation violation in cairo_xlib_surface_create. I frequently run into this problem when I'm moving a tab which has started to   load and accidentally move it outside of the Chromium window. Reproducible in 95% of the tests on my system. Let me know if there are binaries with debug info which would   produce a better backtrace.   </pre>
