<title>Issue 19307 -   chromium -    &quot;Plugin crashed&quot; info bar has confusing icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Go to a web page with Quicktime (for now  because the Quicktime plugin   crashes a lot)  2. The Quicktime plugin will crash and display the infobar that states that a   plugin has crashed      A yellow triangle &quot;warning&quot; icon on the infobar  or at least something that has   to do with a plugin  or an error.      You get a &quot;group of people&quot; icon like the one used in Address Book for   mailing lists. This doesn't really have anything to do with a plugin crashing.   </pre>
