<title>Issue 14017 -   chromium -    Page load never stops after opening multiple tabs from same page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0 (Developer Build 18316)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: OK      1. There is no sure fire way to reproduce exactly. It just happens   randomly  but I do find that it happens almost every time on   Deviantart.com  and Myspace.com  2. Open multiple tabs from the same site. (Example: Deviantart.com)  3. After a while  the tabs will go into a never ending load.      All the pages load and in a timely fashion.      The tabs go into a never ending load. The pages stay blank  the status bar   indicates its Waiting for X  and the Favicon load indicator just keep   spinning. The only way to fix it is to kill the entire browser  because   after it happens  no site loads anymore  but its only triggered by some   sites  and they all seem to be using Javascript/AJAX in some form.    Deviantart.com is almost always a sure fire one. I go there  load it up and   when I try to open multiple tabs of art  they just lock up into this   neverending load  and just kill the browser.    I don't know if this could be related to using Dual Monitors that I started   using recently  but Chromium has been doing this for the past 2 weeks now   and it strangely coincides with me getting my second monitor. Below are   some screenshots (the second one loaded fine  but then when I clicked on a   link in the page  it went into a the never ending load)  don't know how   much they can help  but from the time I took them  cutout my second   monitor  and posted them here  the pages were still like that. </pre>
