<title>Issue 17864 -   chromium -    Mac homepage preference does not pick up changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open preferences  2. For the home page option  type in a new URL but do not hit enter  3. Close the preferences and relaunch the browser  4. Notice you still have the old home page    Since there is no &quot;Apply&quot; button in the preferences  the change to the home   page URL should be picked up when the preference window is closed even if   the user does not hit enter after the change. </pre>
