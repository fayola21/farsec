<title>Issue 2831 -   chromium -    Chrome somehow switches into Cyrillic until restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1198075 1270330&gt;    I have no idea how this occurs  but it's happened to me once at home  (either b136 or b138) and once at work (b139.1)  so it's worth filing.    Somehow Chrome's input gets switched into Cyrillic.    By &quot;input&quot; I mean that if I press the &quot;a&quot; key on the keyboard either in web  content OR in the omnibox  I don't get an &quot;a&quot; glyph but rather some  Cyrillic character that looks like a Greek phi.  Similar things happen for  all other keys.  I can simultaneously bring up Wordpad and type normally so  I'm not switching some system-wide setting.  If I restart Chrome the  problem disappears so I'm not toggling some Chrome pref.    When this happened today  I had just typed &quot;www&quot; in the omnibox  hit  alt-enter  then realized I didn't want that tab  and while it was loading   middle-clicked it to close.  Then when I sent to type in the omnibox things  were goofy.      </pre>
