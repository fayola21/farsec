<title>Issue 13001 -   chromium -    Improve icon theme detection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: .0.183.0 (Developer Build 17289)      1. Download a file      I expect to see the same mime icon in the download bar and  chrome://downloads/ as I see on the rest of my system.      The icons shown inside chromium look like Mac icons. Pressing &quot;show in  folder&quot; opens a nautilus folder where the files look totally different   making it harder to find them.        The solution would be to use FreeDesktop icon names and the corresponding  icons from the active system theme.
