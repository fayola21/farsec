<title>Issue 2237 -   chromium -    Bad dependencies from chrome/views into chrome/browser in view accessibility code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Code in chrome/views is not allowed to depend on code in chrome/browser.   chrome/views/accessibility is making pretty heavy use of constants and   objects defined in chrome/browser. If there is specific wiring needed for   the browser  it should live in chrome/browser not chrome/views. </pre>
