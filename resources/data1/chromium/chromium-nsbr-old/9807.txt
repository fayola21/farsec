<title>Issue 9807 -   chromium -    Track binary size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to track the final binary size. We've talked about it for years but   it needs to be done.    1. Create an &quot;official&quot; builder for each platform with full optimization   since there's not so much point in tracking the non-WPO build. This machine   needs to be a fast single (dual)-core machine for this since WPO build is   single-core bound and takes &gt; 2 hours. Only build mini_installer.exe    there's no point in building the tests there.    2. Track the file size as any other perf test in <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html</a> </pre>
