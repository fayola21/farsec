<title>Issue 16909 -   chromium -    Can't drag thumbnails on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dragging of thumbnails on the NTP doesn't work. You can drag thumbs to the   desktop to create a link  but you can't rearrange them w/in the page.    Using this html5 drag demo  I've noticed that we do get all the same   messages as windows  we just don't get them until after the drag completes.   That confuses me a little as the drag cursor updating works when doing   normal dragging  so we are getting and processing updates from webCore   during a drag. I know they're unrelated  but it doesn't seem like we're   completely blocking.    <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=31818">https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=31818</a>    Darin  who's the right person to talk to about html5 dragging code? </pre>
