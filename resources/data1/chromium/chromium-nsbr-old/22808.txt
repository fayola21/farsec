<title>Issue 22808 -   chromium -    When an exception is trapped on buildbot  send an email to buildbot@chromium.org - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently looking at exceptions on the buildbot master is manual. It could be   more useful to send an email when exceptions are trapped.    The main gotcha is to not enter a recursive exception trapping state.    Also  maybe it would just send too much crap. Any opinion on this? </pre>
