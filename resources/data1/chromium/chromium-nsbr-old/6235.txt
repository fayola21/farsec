<title>Issue 6235 -   chromium -    Tab Interface - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Maximize Chrome on a secondary monitor  2. Open enough tabs to fill the tab bar and beyond        Normally each tab gets resized and smaller to make room for the newly   opened tab.      On a secondary monitor it continues to add tabs at the same size  putting   them out of view.  It'll overlap the min/max/close buttons and continue   going off the screen.  This only occurs when maximized on the secondary   monitor.  Not an issue when not full screen.    Please provide
