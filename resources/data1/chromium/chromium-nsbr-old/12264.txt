<title>Issue 12264 -   chromium -    Implement &quot;open URL in Chromium&quot; service - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both Safari and Camino have a really great feature where they implement a   system Service to open the current selection in the browser. Camino gives its   service an accelerator key (cmd-shift-U) so it's even easier than the one   provided by Safari.    - open Terminal  select some text that's a URL (such as the output of 'gcl   upload cl_name')  - go to services menu and chose &quot;open URL in Chromium&quot;  - watch url get loaded w/out having to copy/paste or drag    I use this all the time  we should implement this. It's pretty simple too  IIRC.   Look at how Camino does it for an example. </pre>
