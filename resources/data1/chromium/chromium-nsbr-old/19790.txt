<title>Issue 19790 -   chromium -    Sync Goes OFFLINE_UNSYNCED if HTTPS traffic is being monitored by Fiddler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome   3.0.191.4 (Developer Build 20167)  WebKit  531.2  V8      1.2.10  User Agent      Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.2 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.191.4 Safari/531.2    Repro Steps:  1) Start chrome with sync enabled and Login to sync with valid account.  2) About://sync --&gt; Status is ready  3) Start Fiddler and ensure you enable minitoring HTTPS traffic under   Fiddler Options    Expected:  Sync should not go offline and should work fine    Actual:  Sync goes into OFFLINE_UNSYNCED state and doesn't work until fiddler is   closed.    Note: Not sure if this is something we will be able to support. It is quite   possible that this is 'by design' bug as fiddler changes proxy settings and   so it may be possible that Sync is not working with this new proxy   settings. But strangely internet is usable so Chrome is working fine in   terms of use (tried HTTP site and it works fine  was able to see my bank   accounts. It is just sync which can't reach the server.    Also  Upon closing fiddler  sync runs fine and tries to resolve any   conflicts if any.    One important thing to note here is  Chrome gives out warning when trying   to access HTTPS site with Fiddler HTTPS minitoring enabled and it requires   user to select 'Proceed Anyway'. So may be Sync is sending traffic to   chrome network stat  but chrome decides not to send it further as it thinks   it's a security issue. In such case  we should report this to user with   proper error message.    There is also another way to look at this  what if some other App is doing   the same thing like Fiddler then we won't support Chrome Sync??? Something   we need to be careful.     </pre>
