<title>Issue 17843 -   chromium -    omnibox search term suggest only works with preconfigured search engines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 21636    I added a new search engine with the same parameters as the default Google   search engine  but changed {google:baseURL} to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> as an   workaround for issue 1512  only to find out that keyword suggestion no   longer works then. Deleting the default Google search engine  and adding a   new engine with the exact same parameters  gives the same results: keyword   suggestion doesn't work.   </pre>
