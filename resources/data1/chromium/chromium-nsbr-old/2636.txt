<title>Issue 2636 -   chromium -    Cache form data so edits are not lost if you naivgate and then come back - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open <a href="http://visir.is/section/smaar01">http://visir.is/section/smaar01</a>  2. Type in: skoda &lt;and press enter&gt; into the input box in the top left of   the content area. This will display the search results.  3. Click on the first link of the search results below the search box.  4. Press Back        I expect to be taken to the search results. This is what happens in   Firefox. But instead I get the &quot;Confirm Form Resubmission&quot; and I have to   issue the reload the page every time I press Back. Frustrating. :)     </pre>
