<title>Issue 5559 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: cannot select text in gmail compose using shift+click if scroll between clicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open gmail compose  2. type in enough text such that the vertical scrollbar appears on the   composition window  3. click near the top of the composition window  4. scroll to the bottom using the mouse  5. shift+click near the bottom of the composition window        I expect to see text selected from first click to second click.    Instead  my cursor is just moved to the location of the second click.  It   appears that interacting with the scrollbar causes the browser to forget   about the first click.    I wonder if this is a webkit bug or a gmail bug. </pre>
