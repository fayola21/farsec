<title>Issue 23107 -   chromium -    Last character of completed path in Omnibar is the wrong color after inline autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I happen to have &quot;go/go&quot; in my history. As I type the first &quot;g&quot;  &quot;o/go&quot; is   highlighted and completed (inline autocomplete). As I continue typing  the   highlighted region shrinks until I have typed the whole thing. However  at   that point  the last character is black  not gray.    So:    * The URL must inline autocomplete.    * The URL must have a path component. </pre>
