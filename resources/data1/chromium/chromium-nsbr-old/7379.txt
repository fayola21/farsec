<title>Issue 7379 -   chromium -    Need a utility UI-type thread on the browser process. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should create a thread to perform random stuff that require an UI   message loop.    Currently we have two threads with a UI message loop: the main thread and   the file thread. The file thread should really have an IO message loop  but   currently it also handles things that we don't want to send to the main UI   thread and require Window's messages processing.    Candidates to run on the new thread: COM communication with the updater and    clipboard operations from the renderers.   </pre>
