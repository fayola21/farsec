<title>Issue 6669 -   chromium -    can't read online newspaper  problem with popup pictures  rainradar on buienradar.nl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="http://www.telegraaf.nl/telegraafi/">http://www.telegraaf.nl/telegraafi/</a>           Safari 3:ok      Firefox 3:ok           IE 7:ok    Opens the paper correct but only the upperpart of the paper is clickable to   open the newsfeed.Here the popup is under the mousepointer. Halfway and   lower the page the popup is moving behind the pointer. The popup is not   clickable to open the feed. So you can only read upperside of the paper.    Pictures on the paper opens in a popup but in chrome there is a one second   flash of a popup with the picture and then it closes itself direct.    On <a href="http://www.buienradar.nl/h.aspx?jaar=-3&amp;soort=loop1uur1x1">http://www.buienradar.nl/h.aspx?jaar=-3&amp;soort=loop1uur1x1</a> there is a   shutdown when the radar starts to roll.    Good luck and I love the chrome                  </pre>
