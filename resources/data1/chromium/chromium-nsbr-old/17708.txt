<title>Issue 17708 -   chromium -    Open file dialog box opens  but is not visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In several online applications (notably Bugzilla  and Basecamp) I   frequently need to upload a file from my computer to the site.   2. When I click the button to initiate a file open dialog box  it's as if   the modal box is open (I can't click anything else in Chrome) but the box   is nowhere to be seen on my screen.   3. All I can do is press ESC at this point to dismiss the dialog box. I   cannot successfully find and upload a file from my computer to a web site   by using Chrome.                <b>Please provide
