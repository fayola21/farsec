<title>Issue 6966 -   chromium -    History page shows Untitled after viewing a page with title displayed in the tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc</a>         Safari 3: OK (displays No Title  but also displays full URL address)        Opera 9: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Goto: <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc</a>  2. Bring up the History page (Ctrl+H)  3. Look at the top entry in the history list  which is the above URL just visited      See either the base filename (chrome_switches.cc) or the full URL displayed as the name/title   of the most recent history entry.      See &quot;(Untitled)&quot; displayed.    The history display just simply has to be fixed to either show the base filename or the full   URL.  Showing Untitled is completely meaningless and unhelpful.  Also  all other major   browsers already handle this correctly. </pre>
