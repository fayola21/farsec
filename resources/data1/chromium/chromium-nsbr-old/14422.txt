<title>Issue 14422 -   chromium -    [minihp.cyworld.com]: Changing View Option at Minihp.Cyworld.com Shows Two Views Simultaneously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://minihp.cyworld.com/pims/main/pims_main.asp">http://minihp.cyworld.com/pims/main/pims_main.asp</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?    Changing the photo view from All Images to Slideshow ends up showing the  Slideshow  but the album from All Images is also being rendered.  It's as  if a thread that was supposed to be stopped is still running.    What is the expected result?    Only the Slideshow view should be rendered.    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to www.cyworld.co.kr  and log in.  2. Open Mini Home Page.  3. Find a post that has a album of photos.  4. Click the ��__��_��__��_��� (Slide) link.  5. Observe that while the Slideshow view does happen  the album of photos  is still flipping underneath.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Yes.  IE 7.0.5730.13  FF 3.0.11   </pre>
