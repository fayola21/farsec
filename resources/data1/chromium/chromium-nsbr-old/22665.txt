<title>Issue 22665 -   chromium -    Caching of page failures? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 4.0.212.0 (26807)     <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-">http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-</a>  theory/ch24.htm  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works    Apologies  I haven't been able to perfectly reproduce this  but it does   happen quite frequently. If I visit in a window:    <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-">http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-</a>  theory/ch24.htm    and then visit a few other pages and reload it after a while  I get this error:    Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown error.    Reloading doesn't make it go away  but any tweak to the URL (e.g. adding a   question mark) fixes it. Quitting also seems to fix it  temporarily. It seems   to be some odd sort of cache. </pre>
