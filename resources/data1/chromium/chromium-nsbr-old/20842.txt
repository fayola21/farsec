<title>Issue 20842 -   chromium -    Sync Integration Test with favicon verification runs flaky most of the time due to not guaranteed Favicon Loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Sync Integration Test   (LiveSyncTest_PrePopulatedHistory1K.SC_CleanAccount_AddFirstBMWithFavicon_370  489)  2. It fails most of the time due to favicon not loaded. So it fails while   trying to compare favicons.    Please check private buildbot output.   </pre>
