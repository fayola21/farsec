<title>Issue 8102 -   chromium -    Make pak files resilient against overwriting / updating. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently load pak files as a shared memory mapping that isn't private.    I believe this means that if the files were to be changed on disk  they   would be changed in our running chrome also.  We should make it so these   files can be replaced (updated  for example) without affecting currently   running instances (much like how replacing the binary would work). </pre>
