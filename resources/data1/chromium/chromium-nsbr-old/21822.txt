<title>Issue 21822 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Chrome uses only 4 connections per host instead of 6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When running <a href="http://www.browserscope.org/">http://www.browserscope.org/</a>  Chrome 4 shows up as having as having a 4 connections per hostname bound.    In contrast  Chrome 3 and Chrome 2 are listed as having 6 connections per host.    From the perspective of the network stack  the constraint is 6 connections per host -- see the constant in   src/net/http/http_network_session.cc.    The issue is that WebKit maintains its own constraint for loader  which is pegging us at 4 -- see platform/network/ResourceRequestBase.cpp:      #if !PLATFORM(MAC) &amp;&amp; !USE(CFNETWORK) &amp;&amp; !USE(SOUP)  unsigned initializeMaximumHTTPConnectionCountPerHost()  {      // This is used by the loader to control the number of issued parallel load requests.      // Four seems to be a common default in HTTP frameworks.      return 4;  }  #endif   </pre>
