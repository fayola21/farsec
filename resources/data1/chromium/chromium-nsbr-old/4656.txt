<title>Issue 4656 -   chromium -    Slow dropdown boxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.23  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.milandigitalaudio.com/order.htm">http://www.milandigitalaudio.com/order.htm</a>  Other browsers tested: FF  IE      1. Go to any page with a dropdown list.  2. Click on the arrow to the right to see the list  3. It takes a couple of seconds for the lsit to appear. A blank list of the   right size appears instantly  but the entries appear only after a   significant delay. It was the same with every dropdown list I've tested    even the list of sender identities in gmail.
