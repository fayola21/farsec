<title>Issue 11988 -   chromium -    cmd+a and cmd+e keyboard shortcuts don't behave as expected in text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 2.0.181 (181.0)        1. Put the cursor into any text-entry field on a webpage or in the address   bar  for example.  2. make sure there is some text or type some.  3. hit cmd+a or cmd+e        cmd+a should jump to the beginning of the line.  cmd+e should jump to the end of the line.        cmd+a selects the text in the field. This is particularly bad  because it will   cause the text to be overwritten if the user just wanted to start typing at   position 1.    cmd+e seems to trigger no actiion at all. </pre>
