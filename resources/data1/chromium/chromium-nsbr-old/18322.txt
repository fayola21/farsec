<title>Issue 18322 -   chromium -    Feature: make the rootless blue window border optional (X11) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.0 (Developer Build 0)      Since the last nightly build we have the nice and shiny blue window border   with the vista-like window buttons in the X11 builds. The blue 'title bar'   is more consistent to Chromium's branding and color style but has some   negative side-effects as well.    Using a rootless window makes it quite hard to use features provided by the   window manager on X11  such as Kwin and Metacity. For instance right-  clicking on the top of the window doesn't show up the normal window menu   with entries like 'move to desktop z'.     Adding up to that it seems like that making the window rootless made   dragging the window very slow  the build I had before didn't had a rootless   window and dragging it was at normal rate. Not sure if it's related though.    Exact description of the feature request:  &quot;Making it optional to have a rootless window trough a checkbox in the   settings pane  of course turned off by default.&quot;    Hopefully you guys take it into consideration.    Thanks in advance.   </pre>
