<title>Issue 4475 -   chromium -    Greasemonkey scripts get injected into frames after onload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Consider this Greasemonkey script:    alert(&quot;parse&quot;);  window.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;  function() { alert(&quot;load&quot;) }  false);    When injected into a top-level frame  both alerts are displayed. However   when injected into an iframe  only the parse alert is. This appears to be   (from quick testing) because injection is happening post-load in iframes. </pre>
