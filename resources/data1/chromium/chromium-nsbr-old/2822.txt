<title>Issue 2822 -   chromium -    Use MenuItemView instead of Menu for the Page menu button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1232732&gt;    There is currently a hack in chromeviewsaccelerator.cc which modifies the  shortcut string in certain cases for RTL locaes. For example  instead of  returning &quot;Ctrl++&quot; the hack returns &quot;++Ctrl&quot;. This hack is required because  Windows does not support Unicode directionality marks for text inside  menus. Modifying the string in this manner is not very safe since it relies  on the fact that we always the strings that need adjustment always have the  suffix &quot;+&quot; and KEY (where KEY is the actual accelerator key).    One way to avoid using this hack is to not use Windows menus and instead  use the chrome specific menus (the same menus used by on the bookmark bar).      </pre>
