<title>Issue 11961 -   chromium -    Don't authenticate when retrieving favicons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See this url for reference: <a href="https://mail.uwsuper.edu/exchange">https://mail.uwsuper.edu/exchange</a>  Also see <a title="Login dialog triggered on mail.uwsuper.edu" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1763"> issue 1763 </a>.    When retrieving favicons from a site that requires authentication  we show a   login prompt to the user.  However  other browsers silently fail.  We   shouldn't require the user to authenticate to get favicons.   </pre>
