<title>Issue 21773 -   chromium -    audit pref registration and move prefs into files that use them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The intended use was to have prefs registered in a file that uses them.    This is to make it easier to add/remove prefs without touching unrelated   files and reducing the chance of unused prefs.    No where is this intention explicitly stated and we've slipped a bit from   this goal.  It would be nice to clean it up a bit. </pre>
