<title>Issue 19077 -   chromium -    Linux: Esc in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pressing esc in the omnibox after editing the contents currently does   nothing.    Options:    1) Chrome on Windows: Restore URL of the currently loaded page (undo edits)   and select all    2) Firefox on Linux: Press once to dismiss the autocomplete  twice to do   the same thing as Chrome on Windows.    3) Epiphany: Restore URL of currently loaded page and remove focus from the   omnibox. (Sometimes (inconsistently?) pressing it once resets the contents   but moves the caret to the beginning instead of unfocusing; if it does    pressing esc a second time unfocuses.)    So  restoring the URL of the current page seems to be a given. Beyond that    it looks like the decision is whether to select the entire URL  move the   caret to the (beginning|end)  or unfocus the omnibox. </pre>
