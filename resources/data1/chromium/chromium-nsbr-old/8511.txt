<title>Issue 8511 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Distributor logo misplaced on glass - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In build 168  the Distributor logo overlaps the caption buttons in the   glass frame.    Presumably due to Ben's frame refactoring.  It looks like the logo's left   edge is where its right edge should be (i.e. the logo's width is not   getting subtracted when determining how to place it). </pre>
