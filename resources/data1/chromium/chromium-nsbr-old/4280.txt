<title>Issue 4280 -   chromium -    Middle click on tab strip should 't close the single tab browser window  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   According to new design  middle click on tab strip (single instance of  chrome with single tab) should not close the browser window.      But this fails for Vista 32 and 64 bit machines.    What is the expected output?   Should not close the browser window.    What do you see instead?  Window is closed.    Works fine in WIN XP.         </pre>
