<title>Issue 12500 -   chromium -    [META] Downloading issues tracker for Download Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 3.0.182 (182.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7          1. Go to download.com;  2. Try to download the first application;  3. Click the window menu and then click downloads.      Feedback on download starting.      Download is started but there is no feedback. I would expect the   downloads tab to open in the background and the icon to animate into it or   something of the sort.    When download tab is selected I would expect the spinner to show   progress. </pre>
