<title>Issue 8515 -   chromium -    Issue with maximize on secondary monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    1. Have a dual monitor setup with a 16:10 primary and 4:3 secondary.  2. Maximize Chrome on the primary widescreen monitor  then maximize on the   4:3 secondary.        The browser will properly snap to the dimensions and resolution of each   monitor.          After being maximized on a 16:10 monitor the browser will no longer   maximize to 4:3. When maximized on the 4:3 monitor it maintains the   resolution of 16:10 overlapping the boundaries of the monitor.   </pre>
