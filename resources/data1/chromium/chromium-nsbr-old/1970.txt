<title>Issue 1970 -   chromium -    ctrl+shift+t conflicts with Google Pinyin IME - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From chromium-discuss:  Control + Shift + T opens your most recently closed tab. Press the key  combination again to open the tab closed before that one. Google  Chrome remembers the last 10 tabs you��_��_��_ve closed.    This shortcut key conflicts with Google Pinyin IME for switching  between Traditional Chinese and Simple Chinese��_��_��_   </pre>
