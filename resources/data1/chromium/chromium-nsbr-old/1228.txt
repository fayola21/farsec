<title>Issue 1228 -   chromium -    Options Dialog Box Enhancement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open the Options Dialog Box  2. Change any settings  3. Close the Dialog Box by clicking X on the top right hand corner of the box.      It is expected that the settings do not apply to the browser as I have  closed the Options Dialog Box. I do not want to apply the settings.      The settings are applied. There is no option to revert back the settings  once set in the Options Dialog Box. It would be nice to have an Apply  button to give user the option of applying or discarding the settings.    Please provide
