<title>Issue 10822 -   chromium -    Uninstalling system level Chrome doesn't remove HKCU..ClientState key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps  ---------  1. Do a system level install from pack.google.com  2. Launch Chrome so that dr is written @  HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463c-  AFF1-A69D9E530F96}  3. Now uninstall Chrome    Expected: To remove all the registry keys    Actual: HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-  D564-463c-AFF1-A69D9E530F96} will not be removed    Also  say you have system level chrome and you try to install user level   chrome. It fails. This writes registry keys Last* @   HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleUpdate. Shouldn't they be removed too on   uninstalling system level chrome?   </pre>
