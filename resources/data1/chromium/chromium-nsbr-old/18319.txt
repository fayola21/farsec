<title>Issue 18319 -   chromium -    A possible(!) Logical bug in logging.cc (on a rare case) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you look at 'InitializeLogFileHandle' in logging.cc  you will see that you have a special case that handles a default log file   name if none was specified     if (!log_file_name)  ....    now  while i don't know who might call this function before the logging   file name is established  if someone would  then it will not work on vista  as if(!) you installed the chrome via the google pack  it will sit in the   Program files folder  which under vista is a non writetable folder unless   the user is elevated.....    since this is a design decision i will leave it to you folks  but i think the best way to go is the 'GetTempFolder' which is assured to   be R/W by MS    also  you seem to chose a differnet file name and not 'chrome_debug.log'   which is a bit strange  but.....    normally i verify bugs before reporting them  but i never had chrome via   the google pack  so maybe it does some tricks i am not aware of   </pre>
