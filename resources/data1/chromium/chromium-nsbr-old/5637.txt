<title>Issue 5637 -   chromium -    Add 'lang' / 'xml:lang' to html templates for hisotry  new_tab  etc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   By adding 'lang'/'xml:lang' (as a template parameter) corresponding to the   UI language of Chrome  we can pick appropriate fonts for the language.    This cannot be done yet because Webkit does not  select a font based on   lang/xml:lang. I'm working on that.      An alternative to this is to make fonts 'localizable'.        </pre>
