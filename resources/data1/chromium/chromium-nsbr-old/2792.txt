<title>Issue 2792 -   chromium -    Save Password infobar not cleared correctly after using HTTP Auth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  OS: any        1. Open page http://chrometws:8080/http/authentication/auth_basic.php in a tab.  2. Get username/password by inspecting file  chrometwshtdocshttpauthenticationauth_basic.php  3. Enter username and password in authentication dialog.  4. Before page auth_basic.php finishes loading authenticated page  click on  a bookmark to navigate away to another page (e.g. http:/cnn.com).    Notice that password manager bar for auth_basic.php may appear on cnn.com  page. (It's a timing thing.)    What is the expected output?     Password manager bar for authenticating a given page should not appear on a  page other than the one being authenticated.    What do you see instead?    Password manager bar may appear on different page.    See attached screenshots.    </pre>
