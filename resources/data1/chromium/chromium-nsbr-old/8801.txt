<title>Issue 8801 -   chromium -    CTRL + M doesn't work anymore - and combining more then one start parameter seems not to be possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 2.0.170.0 (11716) - (WinXp SP3)    What steps will reproduce the problem:  Press CTRL + M    What is the expected result:  Profiles-dialog openes.    What happens instead:  Nothing    Problem:  How to manage profiles now?    Using &quot;--enable-udd-profiles&quot; as start parameter is suggested as temporary solution.  But I have some troubles by mixing up more then one start parameter:    For example when I also intend to open a special profile at startup. (with the start   argument: --user-data-dir=&quot;..User Data&lt;profile name&gt;&quot;)    I tried to mix these two parameters this way:  D:PROGSNETchrome-win32chrome.exe --enable-udd-profiles &quot;--user-data-  dir=.profilesnorm&quot;  But either the profiles-option doesn't get enabled or the wished profile isn't starting   up :-( </pre>
