<title>Issue 17879 -   chromium -    NNTP: Expanded recent activities defaults to only 6 browsing history items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open chromium with a well used profile (many downloads/browsing history   items).  2. open a new tab  3. hide the &quot;even more&quot; panel  so that just &quot;recent activities&quot; appears.      2 columns of browsing history and 2 columns of download history (don't know   about other ppl  but i get 4 columns in the expanded &quot;recent activities&quot;).      6 items of browsing history (1 column and 1 extra item at the top of the   2nd column)  with the rest of the space (3.8 columns worth) filled with   download history.    if i remember correctly  the ratio of browsing to download was increased   recently (== more browsing) for the non-expanded view  so i figured this   must be a bug...    <b>Please provide
