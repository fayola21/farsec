<title>Issue 2382 -   chromium -    Add New Install Options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Several new options for the installer are needed...perhaps they could be   passed as flags to the installer?     Feel free to break this up into smaller bugs if necessary.    1.  Install silently flag (no UI shown while installing)  2.  Auto-launch after install flag (launch the browser after installing)  3.  No first run UI flag (don't show any first run UI: search bubble  etc.)  4.  Preset homepage flag (set the first-run homepage to a given URL) -   [still resolving homepage vs. &quot;welcome&quot; page]  5.  Enable homepage button flag (preset the homepage button to show/not   show by default)  6.  Preset search provider flag (set the default search to a given   provider)     </pre>
