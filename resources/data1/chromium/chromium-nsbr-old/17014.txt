<title>Issue 17014 -   chromium -    Bookmark Bubble: &quot;Done&quot; instead of &quot;Close&quot; button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : All      1. Bookmark a site using the star left to the omnibox    The bookmark bubble opens. I think many new users are confused by &quot;Close&quot;   because they don't know if the website got actually added to the bookmarks.    Also if changing the title or the folder of a bookmark a &quot;Done&quot; button would   fit better  i think.     </pre>
