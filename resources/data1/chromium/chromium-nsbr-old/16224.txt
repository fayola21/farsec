<title>Issue 16224 -   chromium -    SQLite crash with shared builds due to double-linking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 20179  OS + version         : Pardus 2009 RC  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32 bit  window manager : KDE 4.2.4      1. Build chromium with shared library enabled and in release mode  2. After opening chromium  it crashes.  3. Delete the profile files from ~/.config/chromium and after that  it  opens as intended (gdb output &quot;without_profile_folder&quot; is attached)  4. Then close chromium  and re-start it... It crashes again (gdb output  &quot;with_profile_folder&quot; is attached).  5. Delete the profile folder again and it opens as intended but after  closing it and trying to re-open it  it crashes again.    Also  when chromium opens  there are no buttons on the right upper corner  (close  minimize buttons). </pre>
