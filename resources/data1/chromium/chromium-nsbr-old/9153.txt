Please remove that crashing problem - especially now - couse lots of people   are testing the new windows 7 (aboute 10 mln) - The new internet explorer 8   - at the moment of writng doesn't work good (it is slow - very slow). The   people are learning now the new os - why they just couldn't learn the new   browser - google chrome with new os ?? I thing the hardest is changing the   habbits - new os is giving you a chance to change it easliy for many users   - just do something with crushing please.    regards  from chrome enthusiast  Peter ;)         </pre>
