<title>Issue 14610 -   chromium -    Updating Mac Chrome causes the current running instance to lock up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Mac Chrome until an update is available  2. Open a new tab  3. Try to navigate anywhere  and nothing happens    I've had this happen several times now  where my running instance of Mac Chrome &quot;stops   working&quot; when there is an update available. By &quot;stops working&quot;  I mean you can't navigate   anywhere  the new tab page content does not show up  etc. Native UI (like opening a new   tab  &quot;About Chrome&quot;) seems to work.    It's hard to reproduce the problem  since you need to wait for a new update to be available.    I noticed this problem today when Mac Chrome got into this state its version was 3.0.187.0.   Once I quit the process and re-launched  the version number was 3.0.189.0 and it was   functioning normally. </pre>
