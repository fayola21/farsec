<title>Issue 9114 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: bad things happen when I enter a javascript: URL into the location bar of the new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: bad things happen when I enter a javascript: URL into the   location bar of the new tab page    2.0.171.0 (Developer Build 12076)      1. open a new tab  2. type javascript:alert(&quot;foo&quot;)    Bugs:    1. The bookmarks UI becomes very thick.  See attached screenshot.  2. The location bar changes to say &quot;chrome-ui://newtab/&quot;    I suspect this is fallout from the recent changes to how we support   DOMUIHost. </pre>
