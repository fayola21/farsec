<title>Issue 8426 -   chromium -    We are lowercasing the host in URLs irrespective of the scheme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : probably stable 1.x series (not specified)  URLs (if applicable) : flashget://...           Safari 3: na      Firefox 3: NO           IE 7: na    See    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=5214285ffedd47af">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=5214285ffedd47af</a>    Reporter says:    flashget://W0ZMQVNIR0VUXWh0dHA6Ly93d3cubHpidC5uZXQvZG93bi5waHA/ZGF0ZT0xMjMwNzQwMDYxJmhhc2g9M2QxZWI2YzRlMDBkM2ZkY2YwNTY2NDQ5MzkxYzRiY2UzM2ZkM2YxOFtGTEFTSEdFVF0=&amp;5743    this is a download link to a file  and it's case sensitive  this is how it appears when using &quot;copy link location&quot; in firefox  which is  fine    but when using &quot;copy link address&quot; in chrome  this link becomes this:    flashget://w0zmqvnir0vuxwh0dha6ly93d3cubhpidc5uzxqvzg93bi5waha/ZGF0ZT0xMjMwNzQwMDYxJmhhc2g9M2QxZWI2YzRlMDBkM2ZkY2YwNTY2NDQ5MzkxYzRiY2UzM2ZkM2YxOFtGTEFTSEdFVF0=&amp;5743    can you see the difference? some letters have changed to lower case  which  makes it invalid    so now every time i want to download something from a link like this  i  need to switch back to firefox  but i really like chrome since it's simpler  and has a better looking    so is this a bug or something and will be fixed or  is it suppose to be like this and will not be changed?  </pre>
