<title>Issue 19933 -   chromium -    Bring back the 'Recently closed windows' item on the new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0    There used to be a 'Recently closed windows' item on the new tab page. In the   new dev version  it's gone.    I basically lost a whole lot of tabs which I still wanted to read  because I   had multiple windows open and restarted Chrome.    Please bring it back. </pre>
