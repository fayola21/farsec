<title>Issue 15783 -   chromium -    Feature request: Add more options to Search Engine options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33    Please provide more options to search engine options  at least %c or   something for current site hostname. This way user could search from the   current site host with <a href="http://www.google.tld/search?q=%s+site:%c">http://www.google.tld/search?q=%s+site:%c</a>    Other options that could be useful:  - referer  - current site full uri    There are some options like {startPage?} eg. in YouTube search  but real   documentation for those is missing I guess?     </pre>
