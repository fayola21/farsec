<title>Issue 13619 -   chromium -    no favicons on OSX tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.5 (Developer Build )  URLs (if applicable) : any with a favicon (e.g.  www.gmail.com)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. open new tab  2. type in www.gmail.com in address bar        The tab's favicon changes to that specified by site.  In this case  to the   Gmail red envelope-like &quot;M&quot;.        On OSX  all tabs always have the default favicon of a greyscale Earth globe.    I presume this feature is simply not implemented yet  but wanted to add a   tracking bug. (I open a lot of tabs  so typically rely on favicons to   distinguish tabs...) </pre>
