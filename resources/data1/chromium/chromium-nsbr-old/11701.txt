<title>Issue 11701 -   chromium -    Windowed plugins are janktastic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you have a page with a lot of plugins (or if you have enough tabs    even one plugin)  the browsing experience can degrade terribly over time.    For instance  I frequently leave the Omaha dashboard open:   http://chromedashboard/#view=omaha ... (10 flash instances) constantly.. it   stays open for days  I occasionally switch to it and reload it.    When I switch to it after the browser has been in use for some time and I   haven't visited that tab  things basically go horribly wrong. The UI of the   browser locks up  the regular windows titlebar paints over the top of the   tabstrip  etc. I have to wait for flash to wake up. Even once control is   returned it'll still be very slow for a while  so I sometimes give up and   go into task manager and kill the flash process  then come back and reload.
