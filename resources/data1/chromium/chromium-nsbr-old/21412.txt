<title>Issue 21412 -   chromium -    Do something on successful installation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should do something simple to indicate successful installation. It is   disconcerting when you install something like an extension that uses page   actions and it does nothing at all.    Some options:    a) Show some kind of &quot;hooray!&quot; bubble  b) Open a tab with information provided by the extension developer (and   default it if not supplied)  c) Go to chrome://extensions/ and use a yellow fade effect to show the new   extension    I like b) because it gives extension developers a place to explain how to   use their extension. I like c) because it is more consistent  particularly   in the case where an extension developer doesn't need to show anything at   this point. I don't like a) at all  but present it because we talked about   it before. </pre>
