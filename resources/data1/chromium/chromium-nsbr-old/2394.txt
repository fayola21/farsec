<title>Issue 2394 -   chromium -    Chrome crash when deleting history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab and click &quot;Show full History&quot;  2. Full history details in shown. Lets say the history for the current day   is long (so it takes a little while to delete the history)  3. Click on &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; and click Yes to the confirmation  4. Chrome starts deleting the history and you see the rotating small circle   in the tab header  5. (Assuming I am a fool  I didn't see the rotating circle) As the delete   is happening  I keep clicking on the &quot;Delete history for this day&quot; and   &quot;Yes&quot; to confirmation message.  6. When chrome finishes cleaning the history and as you click &quot;Yes&quot; for the   confirmation message  chrome crashes.      Should not crash. Simple solution would be remove the &quot;Delete&quot; link and   replace it with the rotating circle (instead of having it in tab header)      Should not crash.    Please provide
