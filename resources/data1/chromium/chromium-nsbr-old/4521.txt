<title>Issue 4521 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: phantom tooltips left on the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: phantom tooltips left on the screen    hover the mouse over the reload button  and then quickly move the mouse   down (as fast as you can).  notice that the tooltip does not go ahead.    could this be due to some of the WebContents refactoring?  i've been seeing   this bug for several weeks now on tip-of-tree. </pre>
