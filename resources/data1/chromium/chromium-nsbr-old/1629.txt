<title>Issue 1629 -   chromium -    HTTP BASIC and DIGEST Authentication not passed once login takes place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to URL <a href="http://beta.winserver.com">http://beta.winserver.com</a>  2. Click the button: [ Login Using Browser ]  3. Login with credentials:        user name: CHROMETESTER       password: CHROMETESTER        What is expected is the login process to complete with a redirection to the  private home page.            However  Chrome will not send the HTTP Authorization: header with the  redirected request and thus the backend server will repeat the process of  displaying in public login page.    To see the actual private home page after attempting to login  manually  type the url: <a href="http://beta.winserver.com/default.wct">http://beta.winserver.com/default.wct</a>    This problem also exist with Safari  which I presume the problem lies  within the same WebKit engine.  No other browser exhibits this RFC standard  HTTP BASIC/DIGEST AUTH problem.    Please provide
