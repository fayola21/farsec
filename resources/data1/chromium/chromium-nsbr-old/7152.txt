<title>Issue 7152 -   chromium -    Find in page: searching for a gmail label shows odd behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Originally reported internally &lt;b/1194064&gt; by Paul McClave.    To reproduce  open gmail and search for the name of one of the labels near   the top of the label list.     - Although the first matching label will highlight correctly  chrome   scrolls down too far so that the label is off-screen.   - Other matching labels are not highlighted at all    I've seen this bug in v138 and v139. It used to work fine with older   builds.. not sure at what point it stopped working.     Latest repro in: 1.0.154.43 </pre>
