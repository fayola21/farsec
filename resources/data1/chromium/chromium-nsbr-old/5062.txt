<title>Issue 5062 -   chromium -    Don't trigger the alternate nav URL for keywords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a keyword called &quot;hungry&quot; that maps to a site that lists menus for   today. I use this like a bookmark (there are no query parameters).    But everytime I type this  I get the suggestion &quot;Did you mean   http://hungry/ ?&quot; because there happens to be somebody's computer named   hungry on the network.    I think the fetcher should notice if I typed a keyword and not try to do   the lookup. </pre>
