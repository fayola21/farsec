<title>Issue 21361 -   chromium -    Can't Print - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;4.0.206.1&gt;    OS version               : &lt;10.5.7&gt;            1. Two Finger (right click equivalent in mac) does not offer print option.  2. Under File  Print option is accessible  but does not trigger print action.        Should be able to print content from Chrome.      Oddly  nothing.   </pre>
