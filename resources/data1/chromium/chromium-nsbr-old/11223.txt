<title>Issue 11223 -   chromium -    Vista/Aero + RTL locale + Maximize: Tabs obscure window control buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.178.0 (14936)  URLs (if applicable) : no need    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE  : OK             - open chrome on a HEBREW vista (this is crucial  not just hebrew enabled    but rather a native HEBREW vista)  - maximize  - you will see that instead of placing the Close/Restore/Min on the left as   you should  you place them on the right  so they &quot;fight&quot; with the tabs     do note that if the user selects to have chrome in english  then this works   perfectly  and you place the Close button and the rest on the right as you   should    but if the user chose hebrew as the native UI of chrome  then it should be   on the left    also  chrome/uim workes looks really good when not fully maximized  this is   a maximized bug only        this actually always was like this in chrome  so it is not a bug you   introduced lately    Also:  this is nearly <a title="Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons don't function" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5857"> issue 5857 </a>  which ends with &quot;working again&quot;  and seems to be something else a bit    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5857">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5857</a>    note in the image how the rightmost tab hides the close button     </pre>
