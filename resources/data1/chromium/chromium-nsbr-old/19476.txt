<title>Issue 19476 -   chromium -    Mac port does not handle non-default UI resolution - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run /Developer/Applications/Graphics Tools/Quartz Debug  2. Set the UI resolution to 1.5  3. Launch the browser      Expected: Everything in the application should be drawn at 1.5X and at   screen resolution.  Actual: Theme backgrounds are not scaled up (though the rest of the   browser chrome is).  Page rendering is still happening at 72dpi and scaled   up from that  so it's the correct size but fuzzy.    See attached screen shot.     </pre>
