<title>Issue 11945 -   chromium -    Hide autocomplete when the only suggestion available was written fully - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.180.0      1. Write something in some form to see Chrome's suggestion box appear  2. Write one of the suggestions fully (one that doesn't have a &quot;longer   variation&quot; or one which is the same only with capital letters for example))      The suggestion box should disappear      Since the suggestion box doesn't disappear  it makes me think i forgot to   write some character at the end....   </pre>
