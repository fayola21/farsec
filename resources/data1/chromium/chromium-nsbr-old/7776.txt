<title>Issue 7776 -   chromium -    Please ask a manager to fill in the Freenode group contact form so that you can take over #chrome on irc.freenode.net - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The IRC users &quot;beinghuman&quot; and I are Google Chrome users who want there to   be an Chrome end-user support channel (chat room) on the Freenode IRC chat   network.  We can help to answer questions there too if you like.  We have   started the channel ##chrome but hardly anyone visits.  There is also a   channel #chrome but it seems to belong to an anime fan club.  There is only   one user there today.  The fan club channel is private; nobody may join   without knowing the password.    Google can take over the channel.  Freenode requires that someone from   Google  preferably a manager  fill in the   <a href="http://freenode.net/group_contact_form.shtml">http://freenode.net/group_contact_form.shtml</a> form.  You should request to   assert ownership of all channels whose name begins with #chrome and   #chromium.    Could you please pass this request on to a manager for them to consider   doing?  Thanks in advance. </pre>
