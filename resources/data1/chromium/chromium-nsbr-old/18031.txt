<title>Issue 18031 -   chromium -    New New Tab Page shows a vertical scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this is most likely taken care of but posting just in case      1. make the chrome window not maximized (&quot;Restored&quot;)  2. open the NTP  3. maximize the window      there should be no vertical scrollbar  you can also try it the other way around (first maximized and then   &quot;restored&quot;)    another issue is the download shelf that will add a scrollbar to already opened NTPs even on tab switch    the bookmarks bar is also a problem  if it is not on &quot;always show&quot; there   will always be a vertical scrollbar when opening the NTP   </pre>
