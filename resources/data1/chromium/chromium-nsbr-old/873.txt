<title>Issue 873 -   chromium -    Security: passwords saved by computer shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I find it strange and dangerous that with options -&gt; minor tweaks -&gt; show  passwords I can see all my logins with passwords and the websites they're  for. I can understand that other browsers save them as well locally  and  that someone using your computer could get them out  but showing them like  this with the website they're for makes it all too easy for someone who  uses your computer to use your login. Please fix (even if it has been made  on purpose  I think it is a bad idea from a security point of view).  </pre>
