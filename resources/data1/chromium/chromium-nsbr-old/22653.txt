<title>Issue 22653 -   chromium -    input/keyboard extension support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is kinda meta bug about adding input/keyboard extensions. We have to figure out what kind of extension   apis are necessary (if no yet available) and file bugs on them. In addition  we have to file identify good   extensions to implement and file bugs on them as well.     Some of input/keyboard extensions are listed below:      Any Key - type phonetic Russian  Ukrainian  Amharic  ...  :  <a href="http://anykey.mozdev.org/">http://anykey.mozdev.org/</a>  AVIM and Mudim - fully accented Vietnamese : <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/fennec/addon/2947">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/fennec/addon/2947</a>   and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7224">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7224</a>    abcTajpu  Type accented/intl/special chars :  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/459">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/459</a>    3arabi - Arabic transliteration based on Google translate :     Fireinput - Chinese IME : <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5420">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5420</a>    Indic IME  : <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2573">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2573</a>    BTW  it has to be noted that the above extensions work everywhere in Firefox because all the UIs in Firefox are   under its control (written in XUL) but in case of Chrome  they're not likely to work in native UI elements (e.g.   omnibox) unless we go a great length to 'hook them up with native UI elements (or replace 'native UI elements'   with dom UI elements)    FYI  other language-support related extensions of Firefox:   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1/cat:37">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1/cat:37</a> </pre>
