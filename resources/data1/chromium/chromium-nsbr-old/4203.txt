<title>Issue 4203 -   chromium -    When omnibox has focus and no drop down  ESC should select the whole line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Press F6  2. Use left/right arrow keys  3. Press ESC      Currently ignore the input; should select the whole line (like Ctrl-A   does).    Deleting the current line isn't a good idea since users may press ESC a few   time when dismissing the suggestion drop down. </pre>
