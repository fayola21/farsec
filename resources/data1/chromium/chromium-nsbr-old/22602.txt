<title>Issue 22602 -   chromium -    Chrome does not remember Twitter login - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>  2. Login and select the checkbox that says &quot;Remember me&quot;.  3. Exit Chrome and re-launch  4. Navigate back to <a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>      Expected: I should be taken to my home page without seeing the login page.  Actual: I'm left at the login page  where my user name and password are pre-populated  but the   &quot;Remember me&quot; checkbox is not checked. I have to click the sign in button manually to go to my   page.    Are we not handling cookies or password autofill here properly?    This works as expected in Firefox and Safari. </pre>
