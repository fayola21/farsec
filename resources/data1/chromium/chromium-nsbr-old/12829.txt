<title>Issue 12829 -   chromium -    Gtk link buttons need focus indication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 17027  OS + version : ghardy desktop  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : ratpoison  URLs (if applicable) : any single word that is resolvable as a hostname on   its own in the local subnet      1. Enter a single word into the URL bar (with no leading http:// or   anything) that happens to also be a resolvable hostname on its own.  Note   that this must be a word that you haven't previously used with a trailing   slash or visited with chrome  so that #2 below happens.  2. Get sent to the google search page for that word  3. Wait a bit  see the &quot;Did you mean to go to http://&lt;yourword&gt;/ bar  4. Realize that you can't visually tab into the link on that bar.    Experimentation shows that tabbing starting with focus in the URL bar goes   to &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; if the bookmark bar is open and then the next tab puts   focus on the &quot;did you mean to go to&quot; link  but the link isn't surrounded   with the normal visible box.      Link should be surrounded by a visible box to indicate focus.      No visual indication is given that the link has the focus.   </pre>
