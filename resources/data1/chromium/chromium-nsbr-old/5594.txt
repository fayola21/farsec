<title>Issue 5594 -   chromium -    &quot;Close Firefox Before Importing&quot; window should support tabbing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happens in Release and Dev builds.    I got this while demonstrating the fix for the <a title="Return key on &quot;Customize these settings&quot; [of FRUI] should show up settings dialog." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4687"> issue 4687 </a>.  The window &quot;Close Firefox Before Importing&quot; should support tabbing.    Looks like not a regression  as it is also reproduced in 149.30 build.    Not mentioning the repro steps  hoping those are universally known :).         </pre>
