<title>Issue 21027 -   chromium -    Star button info bubble should not hardcode text colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm changing info bubbles to use the system theme background color instead of   hardcoding it to white.  As a result  if the user has a dark background   color  the contents of the Star info bubble are hard to read.  This is   because the colors are all hardcoded.    Instead  these should use system colors  or at least have light and dark   variants of the colors  and use color_utils::PickMoreReadableColor(). </pre>
