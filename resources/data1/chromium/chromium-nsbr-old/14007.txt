<title>Issue 14007 -   chromium -    Add channel to uninstall survey URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We'd like to be able to know when users of a specific channel are   uninstalling because of issues in that channel at that time.  Because the   relationship between a version number and its channel is becoming blurred  we   need a precise way to track this.    Robert  can you add the channel name to the uninstall survey URL? </pre>
