<title>Issue 11242 -   chromium -    www.qubi.com has garbled characters (encoding issue) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   There's a frame with the following url that has garbled characters.     <a href="http://file.qubi.com/sg_framework/sg_framework_top/season2/adserver_www_010.h">http://file.qubi.com/sg_framework/sg_framework_top/season2/adserver_www_010.h</a>  tml    Opening the frame in a separate tab has the same problem. Even the encoding   override in that frame is of no use.       Safari 4beta has the same problem. IE8 and Fx3 do not.    </pre>
