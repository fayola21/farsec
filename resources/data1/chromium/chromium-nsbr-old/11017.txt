<title>Issue 11017 -   chromium -    Linux dialog button labels should be task-specific - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may sound like a non-issue but it would be nice for polish.    Currently  the dialog buttons in the Linux version are  - About dialog: [gtk-ok] OK  - Add folder dialog: [gtk-cancel] Cancel  [gtk-ok] OK    The GNOME HIG asks for different labels. I know you are not bound to the  GNOME HIG but I think Chromium would benefit from this slight change:  Basicly  the HIG asks to use specific action names instead of the very  generic &quot;OK&quot;. Using action names helps determining the purpose of the  dialog on the first sight. This is why you don't really see &quot;OK&quot;-buttons in  GNOME or other GTK+ apps.     For Chromium  the proposed change would be:  - About dialog: [gtk-close] Close  - Add folder dialog: [gtk-cancel] Cancel  [gtk-add] Add    So to sum it up  preferences-like dialogs should have a &quot;Close&quot; button  instead of &quot;OK&quot;. Dialogs which perform actions should have &quot;Cancel&quot; and  &quot;$action&quot;. Confirmation dialogs should have &quot;Cancel&quot; and &quot;$action&quot; as well  instead of &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;No&quot; (think: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete this item?  [Cancel] [Delete])    I'm trying to report this early because the same is a problem for Mozilla.  They want to change to conform the HIG  but it's not easily possible  because of how their multi-platform markup works. </pre>
