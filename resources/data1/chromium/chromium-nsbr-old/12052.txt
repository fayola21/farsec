<title>Issue 12052 -   chromium -    Eliminate all NOTIMPLEMENTEDs that aren't helpful for finding bugs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NOTIMPLEMENTED() is useful when you're tracking down why a given behavior is   crashing -- they help you find code paths that haven't yet been thought   through.  But we print so many  about unuseful stuff (like &quot;is first run&quot;)   they're not helpful.  It especially confuses users.    I'd prefer for a fresh run to not print any NOTIMPLEMENTED  and instead have   bugs filed. </pre>
