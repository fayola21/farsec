<title>Issue 13135 -   chromium -    Bing (New Search Engine from MS) Inline Site Preview Feature Broken in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit www.bing.com and search for something e.g. 'Google'  2. Now next to each web result there should be a dot and a line upon   hovering on it  one should be able to view preview of the site without   visiting it first.      Chrome should have preview of site feature working in www.bing.com. Instead    it works sometime and majority of the time it doesn't.    It works fine in FF3 and IE8.         </pre>
