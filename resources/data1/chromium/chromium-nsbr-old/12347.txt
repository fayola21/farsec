<title>Issue 12347 -   chromium -    File chooser dialogs should use mime types on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  linux uses shell-style globbing. I assume mac does the same. The  reason is that SelectFileDialog::FileTypeInfo uses extensions  but this  should be changed to mime type (for at least mac/linux  if not windows).    I think this should be mstone-beta. </pre>
