<title>Issue 2614 -   chromium -    Wishlist: Secure Profiles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think a valuable feature would be to have the ability to protect entire   chrome user profiles  but with the default unprotected.     So when you start a secure chromium session you get prompted to unlock it.     This would be most useful on a shared system with a single logon. Browsing   history  download history  bookmarks etc would be personal and protected.     </pre>
