<title>Issue 19898 -   chromium -    Change the logic of find matching bookmark node in model associator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new model association algorithm tries to find the best matching bookmark   node for a given sync node (under the corresponding parent) by trying to   exact match both title and url for URL nodes and title for folder nodes.    We should probably do a case insensitive match for both title and URL and   probably even just match URLs for URL nodes.    There might be some issues with duplicate titles and URLs. </pre>
