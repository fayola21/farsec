<title>Issue 15717 -   chromium -    Opening tabs in the background in Mac Chrome doesn't set their size correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a tab in the background (middle click a link)  2. Switch to the newly opened tab  3. Often  the tab is not sized correctly    This happens very often opening Google docs / spreadsheets from a link in   Gmail. Sometimes  the tab will not resize  sometimes it resizes properly when   you switch to a different tab then switch back. </pre>
