<title>Issue 8754 -   chromium -    History only shows &quot;Loading...&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think this is a different bug from the one fixed earlier  so I'm not  going to zombie it. History used to work ok for me (save the high CPU) but  now that Glen has re-worked it  I get stuck on &quot;Loading...&quot; no matter what.  This is on the Mac  I dunno about linux.    Steps to repro:  1) Delete profile  start fresh (~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome)  2) Launch Chromium  click &quot;show history&quot; on NTP  3) Surf to a few pages to get some history  4) Open a new tab  click &quot;show history&quot;    Expected:    at step (2) there should be no history. At step (4) there should now be  some since you surfed.    Actual:    At both steps (2) and (4)  it only shows &quot;Loading...&quot; and never budges. CPU  load is low.    As I said above  before last week's fix for the CPU issue  I could load  history and interact with the page just about every time. Now I never get  any history no matter what I do. </pre>
