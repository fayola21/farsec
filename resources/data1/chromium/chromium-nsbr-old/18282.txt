<title>Issue 18282 -   chromium -    Remove all downloads in the download shelf in one click. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you download many items  they all appear in the download shelf. When you   close the download shelf and download another item  all the previous items   are still visible.    I recommend us to create a context menu on the download shelf that says   &quot;Remove all from list&quot;. That way  users can remove all items from the   download shelf at once instead of clicking &quot;Remove from list&quot; 10-15 times.    Unless there is a better way (when we press x  it will it will not persist   the items when it appears again next time) </pre>
