<title>Issue 20166 -   chromium -    Linux omnibox control key behavior is incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start typing a URL that gets inline-autocompleted  e.g. &quot;www.goo&quot;.  2. Press the Control key.      On Windows  the inline-autocompleted text remains highlighted.      On Linux ToT  the inline-autocompleted text disappears when the Control key is   pressed and reappears when it is released.  This makes it impossible to hit Ctrl-  L and then Delete or Backspace while you're typing text into the omnibox to   select and clear it all -- when 'L' is pressed all of the text is highlighted    but the selection gets reset to just span the inline-autocompleted text when you   release Control.    Possibly related: brettw points out that hitting a Ctrl-combination is supposed   to stop the &quot;append .com&quot; behavior  so that you can hold Control  press V to   paste a URL from the clipboard  press Enter  and then release Control  without   .com getting added to your URL (please let me know if I'm mis-characterizing   this  Brett). </pre>
