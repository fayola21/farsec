<title>Issue 7390 -   chromium -    Information status bar becomes all black and always visible... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL      Not applicable (it is a GUI problem)      1. Open [Options] dialog  2. Select [Basics] tab  3. Select [On startup: ] =&gt; &quot;Open the following pages:&quot; and  4. Add www.google.com page as an entry in the list  5. Close the dialog  6. Restart the browser      The expected result is to see a normally functioning status bar that will  show relevant information when you opening a new page or moving the mouse  pointer over a link and to remain hidden in case there is no sensible  information it could show to the user.      The information status bar turns into a black rectangle that is always  visible at the bottom left corner of the browser window no matter which  page is open.    The problem persists in case you open new tabs using Ctrl+T and partially  disappears if the user resize the Chrome window horizontally. However even  in this case the status bar stops disappearing in case there is no activity  as it does usually.    Screenshot is attached. </pre>
