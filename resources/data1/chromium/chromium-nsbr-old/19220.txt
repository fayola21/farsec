<title>Issue 19220 -   chromium -    Buttons not disabled after making search engine the default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 3.0.195.6 (Official Build 22526)        1. Right-click on Omnibox; select &quot;Edit search engines...&quot; from menu.  2. Select a non-default search engine.  3. Press &quot;Make Default&quot;.  4. Press &quot;Remove&quot;.  5. The default search engine is (apparently) removed from the list.  6. Press &quot;Close&quot;.  7. Reopen the &quot;Search Engines&quot; dialog.  8. The removed search engine is back on the list.    What is the expected output?    The &quot;Make Default&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot; buttons should be disabled immediately upon  pressing &quot;Make Default&quot; to avoid the appearance that the default search  engine has been removed.    What do you see instead?    The search engine looks like it has been removed  when it really hasn't.     </pre>
