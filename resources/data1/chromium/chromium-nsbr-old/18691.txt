<title>Issue 18691 -   chromium -    Uninstaller error while trying to uninstall thr 'Add or Remove programs' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 3.0.197.11  OS: XP/SP3    This is one more edge corner case  where we are missing with (un)installers.    I experienced this issue few times in the past  but was unable to spot the  repro steps. So  I don't think  we regressed here.    -Install X version  -Launch add/remove programs - This is IMP  -Install X+1 thr Full/Diff installer  -Try to remove Google Chrome from add/remove programs.    Result:  Uninstaller error is shown as shown in the screenshot. If you click 'Yes'  on error alert  then Google Chrome entry is permanently deleted from the  list ( as expected) and impossible for the user to uninstall it thr  add/remove programs.    Solution:  Execute this step:  3.1 Refresh add/remove programs.    I know this edge corner case  but still it is annoying !!         </pre>
