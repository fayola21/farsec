<title>Issue 18516 -   chromium -    Error Code: 0x80042194 for Google Chrome Setup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;    Other browsers tested:Firefox 2.0.0.20              I am getting the same error too when I am trying to install chrome setup.  I realized that &quot;googleupdate.exe&quot; needs to be run  so I did a file search  and found that the file does not exist.    I checked for windows services and see that &quot;GoogleUpdaterService.exe&quot; is  running and startup type set to &quot;Automatic&quot;.    I have tried all the above and tried to setup after disabling my firewall  but didn't help    I am still getting the error &quot;code: 0x80042194&quot; and there seems to be no  resource on the web either. Please anybody help.     I want to try Google Chrome as I am getting frustrated of firefox. </pre>
