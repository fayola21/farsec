<title>Issue 18236 -   chromium -    Reference builds lack symbols on the mac  which defeats our suppressions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the Mac  the tests   SunSpiderReferenceTest.Perf  V8BenchmarkReferenceTest.Perf  have tons of valgrind warnings without symbols.    Perhaps those binaries lack debugging symbols at all   which makes our suppressions not work.    Also  the reference builds even on linux tend to have  old valgrind errors in them that have since been  fixed  so it might not be worth valgrinding them anywhere. </pre>
