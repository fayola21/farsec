<title>Issue 18080 -   chromium -    Mac: Use defacto standard key equivs for tab switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Command-Shift-Arrow  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Command-Option-Arrow      Mac chrome is following Firefox's lead on its choice of keyboard equivalent  for tab switching (Command-Option-Arrow). It'd be better to be consistent  with Apple's own Safari and Terminal  which use Command-Shift-Arrow                       </pre>
