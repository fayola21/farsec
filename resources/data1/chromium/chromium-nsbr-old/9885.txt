<title>Issue 9885 -   chromium -    [Windows] Window allowed to be too small - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the user resizes the main window we let it get way too small  and it   looks ugly.  We can set a minimum size in a WM_GETMINMAXINFO handler.    Note that this also trips a DCHECK() in debug builds. </pre>
