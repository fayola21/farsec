<title>Issue 19084 -   chromium -    Linux: gmail scrollbar find ticks do not disappear when find bar is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On my chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23027">r23027</a> build      1. Open the gmail inbox  2. Ctrl-f to open the find bar  3. Enter in a single letter  4. Wait for the scrollbar ticks to show up  5. Close the find bar      The scrollback ticks should go away.  They are still there though.  Moving   around the scrollbar doesn't change it  they get repainted  so it's not the   lack of a paint update.  This only happens on gmail.  When I close the find   bar in other pages  the tickmarks on the scrollback disappear too. </pre>
