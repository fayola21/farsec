<title>Issue 9869 -   chromium -    _XGetXCBBuffer: Assertion `((int) ((xcb_req) - (dpy-&amp;gt;request)) &amp;gt;= 0)' failed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've been seeing this in a few contexts (see bugs blocking on this one).    Current guessing is that maybe we're hitting X from multiple threads.  See   the dependent bugs for some repro scenarios. </pre>
