<title>Issue 20732 -   chromium -    Download bar stays on all tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 3.0.195.10    I am not sure why this was chosen but I much prefer the old &quot;download bar in   one tab only&quot; system.    I like Chrome because of its simplicity and speed (both the Browser and how   quick you can do things in it). So I find it pretty annoying having to press   that x in the bottom right after every download. I liked the old system   better when I didn't have to close it because it was only attached to one tab   (not all).    If it was chosen because people complained  then why not make it a option? </pre>
