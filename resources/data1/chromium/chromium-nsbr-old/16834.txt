<title>Issue 16834 -   chromium -    Improve the ways that rebaselining tool downloads the archived results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the rebaselining tool hard code the servers and directory names to   download the archived results. This bug is for further improvements and   tracking the directory name changes:  1) Remembering to change values here when infrastructure changes  2) Providing ability to pull data form the canary (-webkit-org) results  3) Implementing a way to pull WebKit result directories from one common  location and eliminating hard-coding. </pre>
