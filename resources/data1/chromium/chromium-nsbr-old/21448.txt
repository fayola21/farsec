<title>Issue 21448 -   chromium -    Hover state doesn't stay with pointer as tabs open and close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start with a window that's about 1000 px wide.  2. Have 3 tabs open.  Position the mouse pointer over the rightmost.  3. Leave the mouse pointer alone.  4. Press command-T 4 or 5 times.      Expect: As the tabs begin shrinking and moving  the hover state (the   awesome glowy shiny thing) should stay under the cursor.  Observe: The hover state stays with the third tab  the tab that was under   the cursor when the tabs started shrinking.    With the cursor positoned appropriately  it is also possible to give the   hover state to a tab's close button so that it becomes red  and not have the   hover state revoked as the tab's close button moves out from under the   cursor.      4.0.206.1 official release (206 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25349">r25349</a>)  4.0.208.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25632">r25632</a> </pre>
