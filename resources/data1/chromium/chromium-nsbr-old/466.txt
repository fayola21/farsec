<title>Issue 466 -   chromium -    client side X.509 authentication not supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Obtain a valid client side X.509 certificate which allows for client   authentication  and import it into all the appropriate certificate stores   (For Chrome it appears the standard OS certificate store)  2. Set an IIS or Apache server to demand a valid client side certificate   before allowing access  3. Set an SSL certificate foir the appropriate IIS or Apache server  so   HTTPS is possible  4. Go to the appropriate link (ie <a href="https://name.domain.tld">https://name.domain.tld</a>)        Either the Chrome browser is expected to request an appropriate valid   client side certificate OR it selects one automatically from the   certificate store  after which it displayes the expected (secure) website   content.        The valid link displays a Chrome error instead:  Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown Error      Please provide
