<title>Issue 16395 -   chromium -    Flash termination lag when closing tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open any website which uses flash (preferably Youtube since there is   sound from the flash object)  2. when the flash object is emitting sound (because you can hear it) close   the tab (make sure there is another tab open so the chrome itself doesn't   close)  3. for the next couple of seconds you should hear the flash object play. (I   do have quite a few tabs open but I checked to see if it was a processing   power problem by doing the same thing in Firefox and IE 8 and neither of   them lagged when I closed the tab (not the browser))        Flash object should immediatly stop producing sound as soon as the tab is   closed        The Flash object continues to produce sound for a couple of seconds  <b>Please provide
