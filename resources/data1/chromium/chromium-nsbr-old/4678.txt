<title>Issue 4678 -   chromium -    Need to turn on ENABLE_WORKERS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebKit enabled workers in the 38550:38575 merge. We should turn them on as   well. Likely the only work needed is to hook together the v8 bindings   correctly.    Aaron  who else should be CCed on this bug. We can use this as a tracking   bug for getting workers working in chrome. </pre>
