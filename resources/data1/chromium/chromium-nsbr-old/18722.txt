<title>Issue 18722 -   chromium -    Make the link colors and link underline themable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new new tab page has 2 different kind of links. One is the title used   under the thumbnail. This is be default black and is correctly skinnable   today.    However  there is another set of links  the links used inside the recently   closed panel. By default these have the text color of the hover  border color   of the thumbnails and an underline color the same as the non hover border   color of the thumbnails.    The list view is also using the same colors as the links in the recently   closed panel. For some themes these might need to be different from the   recently closed links. </pre>
