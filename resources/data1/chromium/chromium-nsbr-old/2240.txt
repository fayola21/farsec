<title>Issue 2240 -   chromium -    Feature: &quot;paste and go&quot; should be an option when pasting text into a form field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be cool if &quot;paste and go&quot; were an option in the context menu of a   form field in a web page.  This would mimic doing a paste followed by   submitting the form.    The idea is to apply the &quot;paste and go&quot; feature from the omnibox to   ordinary form fields. </pre>
