<title>Issue 2460 -   chromium -    Context menu for tab doesn't appear if only one tab open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chromium (compiled from tip of tree)  2. Make sure only one tab is open  3. Right click the tab.        I expect the tab context menu (reload  duplicate  etc) to appear but   instead I see the application context menu (restore  move  task manager    close).    </pre>
