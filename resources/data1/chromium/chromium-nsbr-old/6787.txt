<title>Issue 6787 -   chromium -    add a way to change safebrowsing urls at runtime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great to have a way to change the urls used by safebrowsing at   runtime  so that we can test changes against Chrome locally before pushing   them to the production servers.  Ian mentioned that a command-line flag   would be one way to do this without exposing the option in the UI.    (this was 1214410) </pre>
