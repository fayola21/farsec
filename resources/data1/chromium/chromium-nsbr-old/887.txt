<title>Issue 887 -   chromium -    Sometimes incorrect table display on wowwebstats.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Google Chrome 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://wowwebstats.com/r2gytu6awt25k">http://wowwebstats.com/r2gytu6awt25k</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.0  Safari  Internet Explorer 7         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit <a href="http://wowwebstats.com/r2gytu6awt25k">http://wowwebstats.com/r2gytu6awt25k</a>  2. Browse links under &quot;Split&quot; menu        Display table data within the constraints of its borders      Sometimes  for an unknown reason  additional data is displayed from the   source code.    I've attached screenshots showing how the page should look and an example   of how it looks when it loads incorrectly. I was unable to reproduce this   problem in other browsers  however it occurs frequently in Chrome. Current   solution is to refresh the page until it loads correctly  which may be   several refreshes.        </pre>
