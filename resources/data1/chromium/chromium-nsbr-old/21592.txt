<title>Issue 21592 -   chromium -    Investigate keepalive ping to background renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [anti-jank] periodically send a ping to renderers in hidden tabs of the   foreground window    the goal here is to keep the hidden tabs alive and ready to renderer if the   user switches to them.  we can probably make the ping execute a dummy paint   or some kind of significant traversal of the webcore render tree. </pre>
