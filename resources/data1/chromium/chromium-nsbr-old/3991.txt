<title>Issue 3991 -   chromium -    IDN in 'wait for foo.com' in the status bar is shown as punycode regardless of accept-language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Whether or not we show punycode or Unicode in the UI depends on the value   of Accept-Language header. In the status bar (at the bottom)  the domain   name in 'wait for foo.bar.com' is always shown as punycode.     This may or may not be a regression. I'm not sure. I thought I had taken   care of every case where we show the domain name in the UI.          </pre>
