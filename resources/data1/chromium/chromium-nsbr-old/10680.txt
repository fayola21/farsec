<title>Issue 10680 -   chromium -    Tab with download is killed  if attempt to close it with Ctrl w/middle click. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13939">r13939</a>)  Looks like this is introduced as part of the fix for <a title="Do not stop downloads when closing the corresponding tab/window" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1028"> issue 1028 </a> ??    -start downloading a file.  -Ctrl+f4 to close the window (hoping you have only one tab opened)  -You will get &quot;Download is in progress confirmation&quot; dialog - AS EXPECTED.  -Click on 'Wait for download...&quot; button.    You can find two issues here which are related to same issue.    Issue1:  See the first attached screenshot  the tab is entirely painted with black   color  it is bcoz of <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> issue2 </a> :)    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue2 </a>:  As soon as ctrl+F4 is pressed  we close the tab first and will show the   'download is in progress...' confirmation dialog. If user clicks on 'Wait   for downloads....'  then we will show downloads page  but the tab where the   download is initiated is closed technically but shown in tabstrip.   Screenshot2 is attached.    Observation:  Ctrl+F4 behavior with other browsers:  IE7.x: Behaves as Chrome  i e it first closes all the opened tabs and for   the last tab  it closes the window.    FF3.x  Safari 4.x: it first closes all the opened tabs and for the last   tab  the event is ignored.     </pre>
