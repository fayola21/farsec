<title>Issue 14575 -   chromium -    Cannot kill windows and/or tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I was reading corporate gmail this morning.  I clicked on the link  mentioned above.  I got a tab labeled &quot;untitled&quot; with a blank page.  I  clicked on the 'x' for the tab -- nothing happened.  I dragged the tab off  to a new window and clicked on the 'x' for the window -- nothing happened.        The comic book distinctly stated that each tab and window was its own  process precisely to provide isolation so that the browser wouldn't hang.   The tabs and windows should have closed 100% reliably.          The application hangs.  The tabs and windows cannot be closed.  &quot;Report bug  or broken website...&quot; doesn't do anything.  &quot;about:version&quot; doesn't do  anything.  I can still navigate between tabs; gmail and bug remain  responsive  I can open and close new tabs...      <b>Please provide
