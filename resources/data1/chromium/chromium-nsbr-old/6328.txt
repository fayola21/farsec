<title>Issue 6328 -   chromium -    Shortcut with name &quot;Google Chrome&quot; remains in NonAdmin even after uninstalling system-level Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In Admin  install system-level chrome 2.0.156.1 (Official Build 7653)   with param --create-all-shortcuts. This will create a desktop shortcut on   NonAdmin  2. Switch to NonAdmin  click on the Desktop shortcut. First Run dialog will   be seen  3. Click on Start Google Chrome button. Additional Desktop icon with same   name &quot;Google Chrome&quot; will be created  4. Switch back to Admin and uninstall Chrome      All desktop icons with name &quot;Google Chrome&quot; should be removed when we   uninstall(This is what I was told). But one of the two shortcuts remain.    This is related to the already fixed issue (<a title="Desktop icon remains after uninstall when chrome is installed with --create-all-shortcuts option" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5104"> Issue 5104 </a>) </pre>
