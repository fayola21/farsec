<title>Issue 8129 -   chromium -    At-exit assert when duplicating certain tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build and launch a debug build of Chromium  2. Visit www.msnbc.com  wait for the page to load  3. Right-click the tab  select &quot;Duplicate&quot;  4. Wait for the duplicate tab to finish loading  5. Close Chromium    Expected result: browser closes. Actual result: assert in destructor for   ObjectWatcher. Does not happen if instead of duping the msnbc.com tab  a   new tab is opened and navigated to msnbc.com. Does not happen at other URLs   I tested. </pre>
