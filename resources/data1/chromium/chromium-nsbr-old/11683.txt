<title>Issue 11683 -   chromium -    RTL: IME changes when writing a Hebrew character inside an English string in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.1                         2.0.180.0 (15648)      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Write an English string inside the omnibox (for example... abcd)  2. Now try to write a Hebrew string between the b and the c (for exmaple...   _��__��__��__��_)      ummm....      After each character i write  the language changes back to English so in   order to write the whole word i need to press Alt+Shift after each Hebrew   character    btw  to make this more practical  try this when writing a Hebrew word between the dots in the string   <a href="http://www..com">http://www..com</a> </pre>
