<title>Issue 2168 -   chromium -    Corrupted &quot;Local State&quot; file causes Chrome to hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29      That's the problem  I can't reproduce the steps to get to it. All I can say  is that I was fiddling with the Home Page settings  then restarted Chrome  and the problem appeared.  However I kept a copy of the corrupted Local State file that causes Chrome  to hang. So the steps are:  1. Copy the attached &quot;Local State&quot; file to &quot;Local SettingsApplication  DataGoogleChromeUser Data&quot;  2. Start Chrome.      Chrome should load properly.      Chrome falls into an infinite loop of &quot;Report Bug&quot; dialogs (see screenshot).    Note: I couldn't reproduce the bug with build 2105  so maybe it's already  been fixed.    </pre>
