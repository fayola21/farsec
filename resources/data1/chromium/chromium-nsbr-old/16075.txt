<title>Issue 16075 -   chromium -    Browser windows open off screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.3 (Official Build 19935)    When I start Chrome both at home and at work  the initial window opens off   screen; there is just a sliver of the window available to touch  and it is   very annoying - it seems like Chrome didn't open.    I would think that I had somehow screwed up my configuration  but this is   happening on two different computers - and it started within the past few   days.    I can repro. </pre>
