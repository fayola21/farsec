<title>Issue 20960 -   chromium -    Images not loading all the time on Google Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43 (Official Build )  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.basketballforum.com/phoenix-suns/388115-">http://www.basketballforum.com/phoenix-suns/388115-</a>  best-damn-babe-thread-bbf-84.html          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to a website with lots of images  2. A lot of times you will get a tiny broken image instead of the actual   image          All images should load correctly.        A lot of times the images will not all show up. You have to refresh the   page several times for all the images to load. Sometimes even then that   won't work and will have to right click the broken image and click &quot;Open in   new tab&quot;. When you do that  then refresh the browser on the page where the   image wouldn't show  it will then load. Very frustratining have to refresh   pages a lot of times up to 7 times to see all the images  especially on   message boards / forums. </pre>
