<title>Issue 7833 -   chromium -    JS wrappers and WebCoreNode leaks in unit_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9961">r9961</a> we have following leaks at the end of Hammer/unit_tests (debug  build):    Leak 5 JS wrappers.  Leak 2 JS wrappers.  LEAK: 10 WebCoreNode    This bug is just a reminder to fix them.    The cause of these leaks is most probably in one of the following tests:      renderer/render_view_unittest.cc    renderer/render_widget_unittest.cc </pre>
