<title>Issue 2501 -   chromium -    Disable safe browsing update while on battery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Regarding bug <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265</a>    Issue:  The last thing a user wants to see while on battery is the HD seeking a  lot. The HD is often slower while on battery and seeking uses a large  amount of energy.    Fix:  Detect when the laptop is on battery. Disable Safe Browsing updates/DB  optimization when in this state. Resumes once on line. </pre>
