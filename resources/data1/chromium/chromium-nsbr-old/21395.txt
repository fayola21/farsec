<title>Issue 21395 -   chromium -    Warm a renderer up early during the startup process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We could probably improve our startup time by starting a renderer process   early during startup.  We're a web browser  we know we're going to need a   renderer process  so what's the wait?    Some timings I took on the Mac recently show:     ms  event    0  browser launched   30  browser reaches main (30 ms from launch)   82  browser enters main thread run loop (52 ms from main)  202  renderer launched by browser (120 ms from run loop)  233  renderer reaches main (31 ms from launch)  273  renderer enters main thread run loop (40 ms from main)  291  renderer makes initial resource request (18 ms from run loop)    By starting a renderer sooner  we can probably shave off about 70 ms  the   time that it takes to launch the renderer and have it reach its run loop.    This can be done in parallel with the other stuff that the browser is doing   after it reaches its own run loop.    The 70 ms delay is inherent in starting any renderer (the timings above are   from a warm system).  We don't need to just warm a renderer up during   startup  we can cut down subsequent page load times for new sites/tabs by   changing our policy to always keep a warmed-up renderer available (if   we're not out of slots). </pre>
