<title>Issue 2572 -   chromium -    Window menu shown when right click on tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a browser with a single tab. This only repros if you have a   single tab.  2. Right click on the tab.        The windows menu shows when instead the tab menu should show.    We must not be calculating the non-client area correctly when there is a   single tab. This could also explain my recent fix for 2523. </pre>
