<title>Issue 1349 -   chromium -    Unable to enable JRE 1.6u10 in Java control panel unless Mozilla is also installed on the desktop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27      1. Start with Windows XP with IE as the only installed browser  2. Install Sun JRE 1.6u10  3. Control panel -&gt; Java -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Settings -&gt; Default Java for   Browsers  4. Check &quot;Mozilla Family&quot; option; if successful  click &quot;Ok&quot; and then verify   that setting indeed took; it does not      - Java Applets should work once Sun JRE 1.6u10 has been installed  - Should be able to check &quot;Mozilla Family&quot; and setting should take effect      - Applets do not work  - It is not possible to (permanently) cause &quot;Mozilla Family&quot; checkbox to be    checked    Workaround:   1. Install Mozilla FireFox 3  2. Check &quot;Mozilla Family&quot; checkbox in Java control panel  3. Applets now work in Chrome    Suggestion:  Perhaps Chrome could update necessary registry keys to allow JRE to   recognize Chrome as belonging to the Mozilla family </pre>
