<title>Issue 10914 -   chromium -    Inspector zooming does not change the font size of non-console areas - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off <a title="Inspector should Zoom Text" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5758"> issue 5758 </a> comment #2.      Zooming in the inspector only changes the font size in the console (the   bottom part). It does not change the font size in non-console areas (source   code section and styles section).     BTW  the inspector font size is too small to begin with  but that's a   separate issue.  </pre>
