<title>Issue 22783 -   chromium -    Cannot drag slashdot comment slider sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. load a slashdot page like   <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/09/22/2138201/Google-Brings-Chrome-">http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/09/22/2138201/Google-Brings-Chrome-</a>  Renderer-Speedy-Javascript-To-IE  2. try to drag the grippy bars between the comment counts (&quot;full&quot; /   &quot;abbreviated&quot;) in the left column    This works *sometimes*  but I can't find a pattern as to when it works or   not.  I even managed in filing this bug to load the page once  repro the   problem  reload two more times  then have it work once.    I assume this works on Firefox; I don't have a Win/Mac computer handy to   test those Chromes/Safari on.    It would be good to reduce this to a test case  probably. </pre>
