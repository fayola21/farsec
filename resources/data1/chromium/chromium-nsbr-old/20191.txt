<title>Issue 20191 -   chromium -    chrome mp4 is 12% slower than ffmpeg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. run media_bench on trek2.mp4 with chrome dll's  2. replace dll's with ffmpeg dll's and rerun    expected  similar performance    instead  chrome performance is about 12% slower.    on trek2.mp4 6144ms for chrome vs 5430 for ffmpeg  Its not because we use -O2.  -O3 goes a little slow - 6165ms.  3 differences I'm aware of:  1. compiler is 420.  ffmpeg is 440.  2. assembly is disabled  3. code changes in ffmpeg mp4.   </pre>
