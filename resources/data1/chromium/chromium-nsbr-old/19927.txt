<title>Issue 19927 -   chromium -    omnibox completion popup to far left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the current page has a scrollbar  the omnibox completion box overlaps   it. Also  the popup is very close to the right edge of the window in general    which makes the window look out of balance.    On windows/linux  this doesn't happen  because the page/wrench menus are   always visible  while they're invisible by default on os x.    The popup could instead be aligned with the left edge of the &quot;go&quot; button.    Assigning to a UI person for evaluation. </pre>
