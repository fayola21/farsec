<title>Issue 5012 -   chromium -    Google &quot;Suggest a feature for Google Chrome&quot; page issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some issues up for suggestion in Google Chrome on this page - <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/static.py?page=suggestions.cs">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/static.py?page=suggestions.cs</a>  are already implemented in the latest public release of Google Chrome.   Those suggestions should be removed. Also  that page to suggest features is   found in the &quot;contacting support&quot; section and most users who would like to   submit suggestions (that I know and myself  till today) do not know about   that page. It is too hard to find. </pre>
