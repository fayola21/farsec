<title>Issue 10588 -   chromium -    WaitForSingleObject with INFINITE timouts causing browser hangs for users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sundar and Karen are both experiencing serious hangs intermittantly.  They   can create and destroy tabs  but can't load any content or interact with   the page.  In Karen's case (hang2.dmp)  the browser would never respond.    In Sundar's (hang1.dmp)  it would sometimes come back in 10 seconds or a   minute  other times never.    I have dumps of both situations here: //www/~jabdelmalek/chrome/hangs/    This is _really_ serious  as the IO thread is blocked on a   WaitForSingleObject with INFINITE timeouts.  Wan-Teh  I know we've talked   about this before a little  but I really think this code needs to be   modified  or the waiting can happen on a different thread.  As is it's a   very frustrating experience for users  and they end up stopping to use   Chrome. </pre>
