<title>Issue 7254 -   chromium -    Wrong buttons in Installer Update available buttons. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Looks like  we are showing wrong buttons in Installer update available  dialog (from About Google Chrome dialog).    If update available  then the buttons should be &quot;update&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;.    Right now  we have &quot;update&quot; and &quot;ok&quot; buttons.    I don't see any reason to have &quot;OK&quot; button in such a usecase.     </pre>
