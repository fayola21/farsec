<title>Issue 11501 -   chromium -    Special Chrome URLs not always grouped in the right process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open Chrome.  2. Open 2 new tabs.  3. Open task manager.  Notice the 2 New Tab pages are in the same process.  4. In the second tab  navigate to about:blank  then to chrome-ui://newtab.  5. Notice that second tab now is in a different process.    It seems to me that New Tab pages should share the same process regardless of   how you navigated to them. </pre>
