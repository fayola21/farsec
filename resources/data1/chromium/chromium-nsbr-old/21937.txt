<title>Issue 21937 -   chromium -    --use-user-dir is ignored if an instance exists  on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25617">r25617</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  window manager : Gnome  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Chrome launches with the profile   passed to --use-user-dir (so with completely separate extensions  plugins    ...)      1. Launch Chrome (`google-chrome --enable-plugins`)  2. Launch another instance of Chrome from the terminal  with a user dir   (`google-chrome --use-user-dir=~/foo`)  3. Navigate to to about:plugins in the second instance  and plugins will be   enabled  where they wouldn't have been if the first instance wasn't   present.    &quot;Created new window in existing browser session.&quot; is dumped to the terminal   when launching the second instance.  This behaviour is incorrect  where an   explicit separate profile has been specified. </pre>
