<title>Issue 17382 -   chromium -    Recent Bookmarks section non-existant in New New Tab Page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.1  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://newtab (New Tab Page)  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Make a bookmark  2. Open New Tab      No 'Recent Bookmarks' section.      In 'Recent Activity' section  Recent Bookmarks does not exist  but was   useful functionality in the 'old' New Tab page... New Tab page is looking   good so far  just pointing out/making note of the lost functionality in the   hope that it's not intentional and just been missed so far  or simply not   ready yet. </pre>
