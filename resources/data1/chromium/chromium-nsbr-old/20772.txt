<title>Issue 20772 -   chromium -    Make Webkit obey GTK preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dean wrote:  &gt; A long time ago I spent some time making sure that the Chromium GTK  &gt; webkit stuff honored the cursor blink speed of GTK  and fixed in  &gt; webkit  etc.  It seems that since it regressed  by my old comment is  &gt; still there:  &gt;   &gt; double RenderThemeChromiumLinux::caretBlinkInterval() const  &gt; {  &gt;    // Disable the blinking caret in layout test mode  as it introduces  &gt;    // a race condition for the pixel tests. http://b/1198440  &gt;    if (ChromiumBridge::layoutTestMode())  &gt;        return 0;  &gt;   &gt;    // We cache the interval so we don't have to repeatedly request it   from &gt; gtk.  &gt;    return 0.5;  &gt; }  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Where we return 0.5  we used to do what the comment says and ask GTK  &gt; for the blink speed.  &gt;   &gt; I am guessing this got ripped out when Adam removed GTK from the  &gt; renderer.  I would like to still honor GTK here  it is really nice on  &gt; remote X if you set your cursor not to blink  and you avoid needless  &gt; painting a few times a second.  &gt;  &gt; What's the best way to go about it  pipe it through webkit glue and  &gt; into the browser over IPC?    The suggestion was:    &gt; We can perhaps stick the GTK theme related stuff into WebPreferences  &gt; (maybe a struct inside it?).  All the existing IPCs with  &gt; WebPreferences are probably good times to set new GTK settings (cursor  &gt; blink  selection color  etc).    &gt; While you're at it  we could plumb through the selection color.  Looks  &gt; weird for the omnibox highlight to not match the on-page highlight.    &gt; note that on both Windows and Linux you get a message when these  &gt; settings change  so for full credit make it so the info is sent as a  &gt; separate IPC and not just part of the startup info.  :)    I will work on this. </pre>
