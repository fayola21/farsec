<title>Issue 19952 -   chromium -    Bookmark Sync does not maintain order or position of bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Official Build 23673)      1. Enable bookmark sync on two browsers and sync them ahead of time.  2. Create a new bookmark and add it to the bookmarks bar at a specific   position.  3. Check the other browser and wait for it to sync.        The bookmark should be added to the second browser and appear in the same   position as the first browser.        The bookmark is added  but at a seemingly random position.     </pre>
