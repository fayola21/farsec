<title>Issue 21218 -   chromium -    user name and password details are not saved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1 (Official Build 25376)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Fire up Chrome.   2. Set Chrome to remember passwords.  3. Set proxy settings to &quot;use automatic configuration script&quot;.       First time you open a page  it will ask for user name and password since   you are behind a proxy. Chrome should remember the password during the   session and in-between the sessions.      The password is not remembered during the session and when you open a new   session.   </pre>
