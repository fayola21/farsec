<title>Issue 5444 -   chromium -    Logging in to Google make me logged in in all Chrome-s - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi!    If I start a Chrome and log in to Gmail for example  then don't close this   window  and I start a completetely new Chrome window (from start menu) in   this new window I begin logged in already  and so if in this new window I   go to Gmail for example I can read my mails etc.. And I can not login into   my other Google Mail account in this new window just if I first log out   from the first  but this makes the change for both Chrome windows.    It's more annoying if some use the same computer at home and one leaves   Chrome with Gmail logged in  the other starts a new Chrome and get's into   one's Gmail.    That's why I put this in &quot;Security Bug&quot; category.    Bye     Gime.hu      </pre>
