<title>Issue 6805 -   chromium -    Refactor the l10n library into the Base module - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b/1246452&gt;    The l10n_util library resides in the Chrome module currently. There is code   in other modules (for example  the code in the default plugin installer)   that should use the facilities provided by l10n_util instead of using ICU   directly. In order to enable code outside of the Chrome module to use   l10n_util  the library needs to be moved up to the Base module.    This is not a high priority issue since the default plugin installer is the   only code that needs to switch from using ICU to using l10n_util.     </pre>
