Create an event handler for &quot;onload&quot; or &quot;onerror&quot;  2. try to delete the event handler by setting it to &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;null&quot;   or deleting it using &quot;delete&quot;.      The event handler is set to &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;null&quot; or an exception is   thrown.      The event handler still exists after it has been set to &quot;undefined&quot; or   deleted using &quot;delete&quot; but no exception is thrown. (Setting to &quot;null&quot;   works)    Please provide
