<title>Issue 8005 -   chromium -    Proposed Solution to Help Users Keep Their Download Folders Under Control - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. If I would keep downloading Gmail attachments without cleaning out my   Downloads folder  I would eventually fill my hard drive and cause my   applications to stop operating properly due to disk space problems.     Proposed Solution (partial):    1. Add &quot;Move File&quot; and &quot;Delete File&quot; options below the &quot;Show in Folder&quot; to   the drop down menu for the downloaded file.  The intent is make it easier   for the user to move the downloaded file to a permanent storage location or   to get rid of the file if it is no longer needed after the users views it.    2. After a &quot;Move File&quot;  the &quot;Show in Folder&quot; should open the folder it was   moved to and the &quot;Open&quot; should open it from that location.    3. After a downloaded file has been deleted using the &quot;Delete File&quot; option    the tab at the bottom of the page for that downloaded file should be   removed from the screen.    What is the expected result? N/A      What happens instead? N/A      Please provide
