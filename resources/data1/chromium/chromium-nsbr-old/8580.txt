<title>Issue 8580 -   chromium -    net_perftests should delete temp files it create - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. run net_perftests          net_perftests leaves behind /tmp/cache_test/ when it finishes. It should  delete that directory.        Tested with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=11300">r11300</a> on Ubuntu Hardy. Haven't tried on Windows and mac.    I tried deleting it from TearDown() in  src/net/disk_cache/disk_cache_test_base.cc  but that didn't seem to work? </pre>
