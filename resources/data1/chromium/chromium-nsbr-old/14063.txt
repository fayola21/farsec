<title>Issue 14063 -   chromium -    Regression: The back button is grayed out when a popup window is re-used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1 (Official Build 18142)                         3.0.189.0 (Developer Build 18360)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il">http://www.ynet.co.il</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Enter <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il">http://www.ynet.co.il</a>  2. Get the popup blocked message to show up after clicking on the scrolling   news in the right side of the website... and choose &quot;Always show pop-ups   from www.ynet.co.il&quot; in it    NOTE: this isn't easy to do right now because of <a title="Pop-ups blocked message does not appear for the first popup" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14062"> Issue 14062 </a> !    3. now that www.ynet.co.il is whitelisted reopen it in another tab  4. click on a scrolling news item to open a popup  5. click on another title in the scrolling news  6. the popup will be redirected to the new article BUT there is no way to   go back to the old one.. backspace does not work and the menu item in the   popup is grayed out    i always surf like that and it works well in IE and FF...  it also worked well in Chrome 2.0.169.0 (Developer Build 11219) (i just   checked) so this is a regression </pre>
