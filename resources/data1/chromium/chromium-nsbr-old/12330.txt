<title>Issue 12330 -   chromium -    System-level Chrome shortcut remains on Quick launch bar on uninstall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For system-level install  on uninstalling Chrome  quick launch shortcut gets   removed from the actual location but the icon still remains on the quick   launch bar. This doesn't happen for user-level Chrome. I'm not sure if this   is caching issue or something else. My concern is why this happens only for   system-level Chrome.    This happens on Win7 Admin account. </pre>
