<title>Issue 6670 -   chromium -    Download/History tab freeze - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch chromium (I'using chromium for testing  not chrome)  2. Try to access history or downloads tab via relevant menu entry (usually   also works with keyboard shortcuts  yet with exceptions)        History/Downloads tab is displayed  with recently accessed sites/downloaded   files  etc.        New unnamed blank window is created in the taskbar  but is not displayed.   Chromium freezes. Can only be killed via task manager  ending process   chrome.exe. Additionally  even with chrome not running anymore  or   restarted screen is corrupted (picture attached) with the downloads/history   menu entry permanently highlighted on the screen  on top of all windows.    Please provide
