<title>Issue 3869 -   chromium -    Window jumps from monitor 2 to monitor 1 (with and without magic_browzr) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I found a repro case for the bug I mentioned the other day...    Setup: I have two monitors in portrait mode.  The left is the primary   monitor.  I use the nView desktop manager to extend my taskbar across both   screens.  I tried to reproduce this on Finnur's machine with two landscape-  mode monitors and a taskbar that was only on the left monitor  and failed;   I don't know which of those factors is at issue but I suspect the extended   taskbar.    Repro: Start Chrome.  Open a window on the left monitor and one on the   right.  Maximize both.  Navigate the left window to google.com.  Now   repeatedly click the right window's titlebar area  then the google.com   search box in the left window (speed is not important).  After a couple   repetitions  the right window will jump to the left monitor.    With both 0.3.154.6 (old frames) and 0.3.155.0 (build 3632; magic_browzr)    I reproduce this bug  but in the older build  the window also becomes   restored when it jumps monitors  while in magic_browzr it remains   maximized.    Feel free to stop by my desk to observe/debug if you aren't in position to   recreate my monitor/taskbar setup.     </pre>
