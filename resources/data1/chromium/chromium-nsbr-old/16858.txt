<title>Issue 16858 -   chromium -    Chrome completely unusable on latest release. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Upgrade Chrome to 3.0.194.0  2. Start up Chrome      Everything works fine  like in the previous release (3.0.192)      - Chrome starts up with about:linux-splash (it doesn't restore my previous  tabs that I had open  like it usually does).  - Opening a new tab  the page is completely blank.  - Trying to visit a site (like google.com) doesn't work. The page remains  blank.  - The about:linux-splash page hangs  opening up a dialog to either &quot;Wait&quot;  or &quot;Kill pages&quot;.  - If you change any preferences  those changes are lost when you restart  Chrome.    <b>Please provide
