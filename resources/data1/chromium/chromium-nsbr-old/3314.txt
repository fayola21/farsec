<title>Issue 3314 -   chromium -    Assign Keyboard Shortcut or Menu Item to Bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great to assign keyboard shortcuts and create real menu items  for bookmarks.  This could even function as a lightweight extensions api  before a real one arrives.  The feature could include a bunch of default  bookmarklets. Examples:    Assign ctrl-d to the Add Google Bookmark Bookmarklet (and overload the star?)  Assign ctrl-shift-f to a Google Site Search Bookmarklet for the current site  Assign ctrl-shift-s (and add menu item for) to a bookmarklet which uses  javascript to get the page name and link  then uses  <a href="mailto:a@a.com?subject=&amp;body=">mailto:a@a.com?subject=&amp;body=</a> to open the default mail client to send the  link to someone      </pre>
