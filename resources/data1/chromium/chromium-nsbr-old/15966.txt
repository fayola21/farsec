<title>Issue 15966 -   chromium -    [www.amazon.com]: Printing pagination is not as expected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: www.amazon.com Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.33 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.33 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?  When the website prints something it expects certain pagination.  Under   Chrome it gets different pagination.  For example in the process of   returning an item to Amazon  the site prints a doc that has a packing slip   and a mailing label.  They should be on separate pages.  Under chrome  the   page break is in the middle of the mailing label.    What is the expected result?      The packaging slip and mailing label should print on separate pages.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Buy something from Amazon  2. Start the return process with Amazon  3. Use Amazon's service to print the packing slip and mailing label.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Yes.  Firefox and IE 8    Please provide any additional information below.    My printer is an Epson Artisan 800      </pre>
