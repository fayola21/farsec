<title>Issue 18262 -   chromium -    Scrollbars not activated for new tabs (or on tab selection) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22243">r22243</a>      1. Make your browser window really small (so that your default page has scrollbars).  2. Open a bunch of new tabs (e.g.  using Cmd-T).  3. Switch to them.      The scrollbars should be active (blue).      They aren't.    Patch in a jiffy. </pre>
