<title>Issue 18622 -   chromium -    NNTP thumbs slow to load on Eee - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The NNTP thumbnails sometimes take around 10 seconds to load (I've timed it   (by counting in my head) at around 30s once).    They instantly appear probably 2 out of 3 times  but quite often I'm left   staring at [screenshot] for an agonizingly long period.    Ideas? Sorry for the sparse details. Anything diagnostic I can do to narrow   this down? </pre>
