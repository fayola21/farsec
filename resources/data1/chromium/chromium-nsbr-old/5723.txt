<title>Issue 5723 -   chromium -    WatchdogTest.AlarmTest has timing issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WatchdogTest.AlarmTest assumes that the process executes in a timely   manner. This is not true on a VM on a crowded server. So it is possible   that a process to be delayed by &gt;1 second. The test should not check for   timely events unless it sets itself as realtime class  which I don't think   is a good idea.    BTW  I've seen it happens at least on the Mac and Windows which doesn't   rule out that it couldn't happen on Linux. </pre>
