<title>Issue 3561 -   chromium -    Last tab in last window should be client  not caption  area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we're down to the last tab in the last window  we report the tab as   caption area  so that when the user drags it  they drag the window around.    This results in bugs (like the wrong context menu when right-clicking this   tab  or middle-clicking not working [see <a title="Middle button (mouse wheel) is not working to close the browser (last tab) in build - 3394" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3466"> issue 3466 </a>]) which have to be   worked around.  It also makes the code more complex  both for the   workarounds and the special-casing code that does this to begin with.    This bug is about making the tab be reported as client area like it   normally is.    Finally  both Ben and I think this behavioral inconsistency is a little   weird.  Why train users they can do this with one tab  but then break it as   soon as they have either more tabs or more windows?  We have a nice big   window drag target already; let's just make the behavior with one tab in   window consistent in all other cases (allow the user to drag the tab   around/out).    If we decide not to make this behavioral change  then part of this bug will   also be implementing a hack where  for the last tab in the last window    dragging drags the whole window  not the tab. </pre>
