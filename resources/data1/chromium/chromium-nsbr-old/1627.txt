<title>Issue 1627 -   chromium -    close tab small issue (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29              Firefox 3: OK        1. Open any URL in more than 1 tab.  2. Close last tab      Tab is closed  selection goes to previous tab.      Selection goes to previous tab  that tab is closed.      I think it will be better to close tab first and than put the selection to  the previous tab.  </pre>
