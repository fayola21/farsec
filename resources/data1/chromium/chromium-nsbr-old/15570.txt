<title>Issue 15570 -   chromium -    Hard to toggle a checkbox with the spacebar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.2 (Official Build 19048)    <a href="http://corsair.cs.iupui.edu:18011/n342/ph2ed03/checkDemo.html">http://corsair.cs.iupui.edu:18011/n342/ph2ed03/checkDemo.html</a> (or wherever)         Opera 10: OK    Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Press &lt;Tab&gt; until a checkbox is focused  2. Hold down &lt;Space&gt;  3. Press &lt;Tab&gt;  4. Release &lt;Space&gt;          The checkbox that was originally selected should be toggled.          The checkbox does not change.      In Firefox  the *next* checkbox changes state  which is a little odd.      In GTK  Opera  Windows  and most other places I've seen a checkbox  they   toggle when spacebar is pressed  not released. I think this is more   sensible. </pre>
