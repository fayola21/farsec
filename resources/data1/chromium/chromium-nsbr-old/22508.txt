<title>Issue 22508 -   chromium -    Tab doesn't update until context menu displayed after waking from sleep - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - put laptop to sleep (I've never seen this with my desktop) with no   windows open  - wake laptop up  - click chromium icon in dock to show window with NTP (tab says &quot;New   Tab&quot; as title)  - load a page like gmail.com    expected:  - tab title updates to Gmail page title    actual:  - tab still says &quot;New Tab&quot;. As soon as I control-click to show a context   menu  it updates immediately.    This is 100% repro for me on my laptop. The context menu solution makes   me think it's a stuck message pump  but odd that I don't see this on my   desktop. </pre>
