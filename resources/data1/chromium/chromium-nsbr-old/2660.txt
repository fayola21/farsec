<title>Issue 2660 -   chromium -    Flash movies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to dailykos.com or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/zeitgeist08">http://www.youtube.com/user/zeitgeist08</a>  2. Play one of the embedded Youtube videos      Expecting smooth flash performance  fast scrolling  no choppiness or   stuttering in the video.    Sometimes the CPU will be pegged at 100%  sometimes it will only play for   two seconds  sometimes the movie will stutter.  It is probably easier to   reproduce some of this behavior on single-core computers.    (This may be a duplicate of <a title="Suboptimal perfomance on pages with Adobe Flash" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=93"> Issue 93 </a>  but we won't really know until 93 is   fixed.  Until then  it should probably be treated as a separate issue...?)       </pre>
