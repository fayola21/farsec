<title>Issue 21401 -   chromium -    ResourceDispatcherHostTest.TooManyOutstandingRequests timing out on Purify buildbot everytime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ResourceDispatcherHostTest.TooManyOutstandingRequests has been timing out   consistently on Purify XP buildbot today and since the buildbot was down   for couple of days due to various errors  it is hard to say which specific   commit caused this.     Manually running the tests on buildbot after excluding this test allowed   buildbot to finish its run (and generate some leak errors). I am going to   add this test to ignore list for now.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/</a>  builds/5472/steps/purify%20test:%20unit/logs/stdio  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/</a>  builds/5473/steps/purify%20test:%20unit/logs/stdio  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/XP%20Unit%20(purify)/</a>  builds/5474/steps/purify%20test:%20unit/logs/stdio    [       OK ] ResourceDispatcherHostTest.TestBlockedRequestsDontLeak (156   ms)  [ RUN      ] ResourceDispatcherHostTest.CalculateApproximateMemoryCost  [       OK ] ResourceDispatcherHostTest.CalculateApproximateMemoryCost (63   ms)  [ RUN      ]   ResourceDispatcherHostTest.IncrementOutstandingRequestsMemoryCost  [       OK ]   ResourceDispatcherHostTest.IncrementOutstandingRequestsMemoryCost (46 ms)  [ RUN      ] ResourceDispatcherHostTest.TooManyOutstandingRequests    command timed out: 1200 seconds without output  killing pid 2612  program finished with exit code 1   </pre>
