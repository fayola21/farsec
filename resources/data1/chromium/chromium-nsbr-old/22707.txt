<title>Issue 22707 -   chromium -    Implement main window resizing in test_shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ...sort of.    What we actually want to do is fake out main window resizing in the test   shell. This allows us to mimic Chrome's behavior of ignoring resize/move   requests for the main window but reporting to js as though it  had been successful.    Currently  resize/move tests pass in chrome.exe without actually resizing   the window (see RenderWidget::rootWindowRect()'s use of   pending_window_rect_). The idea is to just fake out resize/move calls for   the main window to TestWebViewDelegate so that js thinks it successfully   changed the window  but no platform api calls are made.    Popup window resize/move behavior will continue to be legitimate.    There is an open bug (<a href="http://crbug.com/2709">http://crbug.com/2709</a>) for actually implementing main   window move/resize.  If that ever happens  test shell should consider   changing to doing real moves/resizes. </pre>
