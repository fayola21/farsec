<title>Issue 3765 -   chromium -    Encoding menu is disabled when about:blank is replaced by an html document (in javascript) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.6    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://statcomp.ats.ucla.edu/WebTools/JavaTools/popup.htm">http://statcomp.ats.ucla.edu/WebTools/JavaTools/popup.htm</a>               IE 7: OK      1. Go to  <a href="http://statcomp.ats.ucla.edu/WebTools/JavaTools/popup.htm">http://statcomp.ats.ucla.edu/WebTools/JavaTools/popup.htm</a>  2. Click on the &quot;here&quot; link at the top of the page to open a popup window  3. Try to change the Encoding in the newly opened pop-up...      The right click menu should have Encoding in it like it IE (and it would be   a good idea to add other page-control-menu items in it too IMO  maybe as a   sub menu)      There is no way to fix the encoding manually (in this example it is not   needed but in some Hebrew sites i know it does)     </pre>
