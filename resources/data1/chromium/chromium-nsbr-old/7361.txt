<title>Issue 7361 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data should not be modal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.46              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Clear browsing data popup should not be modal i.e. I should be able to   continue work in the browser while the data is being cleared. It can take   very long for clearing data which has accumulated from a few months of   browsing.  You can use a background process/thread like the other browsers do. </pre>
