<title>Issue 2525 -   chromium -    Implement ScrollView::inWindow for health  happiness  and animation pausing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hyatt says we'll &quot;be happier&quot; if we implement IsWindow. Currently this   function just returns true.    This function should return whether the scroll view is in a visible window   or not (basically in a toplevel tab in any window). This will make   background animations (animated gifs) pause when the tab is not selected    which will save on some CPU and might also be nicer to the user since they   won't miss anything if it's some kind of movie. </pre>
