<title>Issue 11173 -   chromium -    testshell colorsync profile for layout tests needs a revisit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout tests are now run in parallel.  This causes problems for the  current code that forces the colorsync profile during the run in that the  copies of testshell fight each other.  What needs to happen is:    1. make a new mac util that will change the profile on launch and then wait  until it gets told to exist (via stdin  signal  whatever).  2. update the layout test runner script to launch the util before it starts  any tests and quit it on all exist paths.  3. remove the colorsync profile code from testshell    odds are the entire signal handlers can come out of testshell and it can  just force and revert prefs on startup based on the layout flags no doesn't  need the signal handlers  that was mainly there to get the profile back for  users since it changes the look of the desktop.   </pre>
