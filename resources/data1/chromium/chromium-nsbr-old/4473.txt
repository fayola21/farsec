<title>Issue 4473 -   chromium -    Add support for 8 Indic locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have (almost complete) translations for 8 new locales:    bn gu kn ml mr or ta te    Tony has already checked in partial support for building the DLLs  and I   have code for review that will complete it to the point where we build and   ship the DLLs.    However  building these and running with --lang=bn does not work.     I don't know what else is required to get these locales enabled in the UI   (changes to ICU?).    Assigning to tony to let me know what else needs to be done or to reassign   to someone else (jshin?).    I'd like to get this in for 1.0 if possible  and certainly enabled on the   trunk soon so that the translation team can do LQA.   </pre>
