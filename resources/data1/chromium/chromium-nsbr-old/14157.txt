<title>Issue 14157 -   chromium -    If find-in-page scrolls the page  mouse clicks are interpreted as if the page had not been scrolled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go e.g. to <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?q=string">http://google.com/codesearch?q=string</a>  2. Hit ctrl-f and search for &quot;html.js&quot;. Your chrome window should be small   enough that this scrolls the window down  3. Click one one of the links that became visible due to the scrolling        Expected: The clicked link should be opened  Actual: Some other link is clicked  or the click is ignored          This happens with the currently released version of Chrome 2 on windows   as well as with the nightly build of Chome/Mac. It doesn't happen in Safari   4/Mac.    Since this happens in the live version and is pretty annoying  I'll call this a   P1. I'm not too familiar how you use priorities though  so re-prioritize at   will :-) </pre>
