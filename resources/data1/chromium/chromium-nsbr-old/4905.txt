Start Chrome and minimize it.  2. Start ZoomText Xtra 7.1 (may be later too).  3. Restore Chrome.      Working with Chrome.      Chrome makes the whole computer slow. The tab seems like it has gone out   of the browser the same manner when you try to move a tab into a window of   its own (transparency).  Everything works slowly and eventually a &quot;Google Chrome has crashed&quot;   message comes up and asks for a restart.  After agreeing to the restart  the session cannot even be restored.   </pre>
