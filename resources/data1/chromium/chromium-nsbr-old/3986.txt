<title>Issue 3986 -   chromium -    QuakeLive Beta doesn't work with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://quakelive.idsoftware.com/">http://quakelive.idsoftware.com/</a>  Other browsers tested: IE7  FF2  FF3      1. Go to QuakeLive page and login (you have to be a beta tester)  2. After login the &quot;Incompatible browser&quot; page is displayed        Able to login and play QuakeLive inside the browser.        Nothing. Incompatible browser.    I know that this might not be Chrome's problem  but it's funny that Google   prouds itself with Chrome being a multimedia browser and we probably won't   be able to play one of the biggest browser games of the next year with it. </pre>
