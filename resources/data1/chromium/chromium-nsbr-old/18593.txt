<title>Issue 18593 -   chromium -    Improve windowless plugins memory usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are some low hanging fruit for reducing windowless plugin memory   usage which were introduced when we switched to asynchronous painting (see   the last section in <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-</a>  documents/plugin-architecture)    The transport DIB is kept allocated all the time.  We can switch to a model   just like the browser &lt;&gt; renderer where it's allocated only when it's   needed  and use a cache that times out often and releases the memory.  This   would release the plugin memory for background tabs.    For transparent plugins  we also keep a DIB of the background  so that the   plugin composites over the data.  We keep this around all the time  but we   can throw it out when the page is not in the foreground and painting isn't   happening.  We'll then need to do synchronous painting the first time the   plugin is visible  which is ok (the killer is scrolling  but we can   optimize this case by keeping the DIBs around for foreground pages).    Lastly  we keep the backing store of the plugin around always  but again we   can remove it and paint synchronously the next time  if the page is not   visible. </pre>
