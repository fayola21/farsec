<title>Issue 5547 -   chromium -    Opening a new window does not select the new window in the taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Note that this only happens on trunk builds currently.  I'm seeing this   issue on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6978">r6978</a>  though  admittedly  I've been seeing it for a little while    so I don't think it was introduced very recently.    Open a new window (Ctrl+N  Wrench menu --&gt; New window) and note that while   the new window appears in the foreground  it is not selected in the Windows   taskbar.    I see this on Windows XP.  I have not tested on Windows Vista. </pre>
