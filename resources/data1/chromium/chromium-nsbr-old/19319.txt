<title>Issue 19319 -   chromium -    Should support Alt+Shift+t to toolbar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT(r 23365)    While focus is on the browser window  hit Alt+Shift+T.    Result:  Does nothing.    Expected:  Keyboard focus should be transferred to toolbar and so that user can use  left/right arrow keys to navigate to different buttons (back/forward  navigation arrows/refresh/bookmark/page/menu) on the toolbar.    FF on Linux support this.    PS: I believe this bug is not applicable to Mac !!??  as other browsers  don't support this behavior there !  </pre>
