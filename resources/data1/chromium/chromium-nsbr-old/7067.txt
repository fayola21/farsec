<title>Issue 7067 -   chromium -    IconLoader needs to be able to load icon in different sizes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When obtaining a web application's icon using IconLoader in the form of an   SkBitmap  it is not possible to specify the bitmap size. Instead    IconLoader uses the default system icon sizes (such as 32 by 32 pixels).   This is problematic in case the returned bitmap needs to be drawn using   larger dimensions.    See the TODO comment in chrome/browser/icon_loader.cc for a more detailed   information about the problem. </pre>
