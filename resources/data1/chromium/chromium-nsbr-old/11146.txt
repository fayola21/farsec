<title>Issue 11146 -   chromium -    middle-click should close a tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Middle-clicking on the tab in the tabstrip closes the tab on Windows Chrome  as well as apparently every other major browser except Safari. I tested Mac  Firefox and Mac Opera.    This is really both a Linux bug and a Mac bug  but I'm not sure how to mark  a test as both. The issue tracker yells at me in red if I put two OS-  labels on the same bug! CC evan so he can figure out what to do for Linux. </pre>
