<title>Issue 11022 -   chromium -    Table text overlaps in RTL textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0                       : 2.0.177.0 (14518)  URLs (if applicable) : Attached      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Copy and paste the line from the Attached html file to an RTLed text   area (such as the one here just RTL it first using Ctrl+Shift)      Text should be normally viewed in the text area....      The first letters are over the border and you only see half of it  if the text box had some text before pasting  the letter may appear behind   it    *I could only reproduce it in RTLed textarea but as i don't know what is   the cause of the problem it may be possible to port this bug to LTR?    *I could only reproduce it when using Chrome to copy the text too. Using   FF/IE to copy the text and pasting it into chrome didn't reproduce the   issue    *In some conditions I need to delete the first character of the text to   reproduce the issue (i had to do this using &quot;forward delete&quot; so i can   reproduce it in the small textbox and overlapping other text in the   screenshot)    Screenshot:  <a href="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/7143/chrometextoverlaps.jpg">http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/7143/chrometextoverlaps.jpg</a> </pre>
