Key points:    - CSS: span { font-weight: 100 }    - HTML: &lt;span&gt;&lt;bold&gt;AAA&lt;/bold&gt;AAA&lt;/span&gt;    Expected: &quot;AAA&quot; in bold  followed by &quot;AAA&quot; in normal style.    Observed: &quot;AAAAAA&quot; in normal style.    Notes:  - The same bug appears for SPAN  DIV  P  H1  H2  ... tags  too.  - Removing the CSS would solve the problem.  - Work around: Add style    strong { font-weight: 700; }   </pre>
