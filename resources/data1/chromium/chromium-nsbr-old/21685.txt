<title>Issue 21685 -   chromium -    devtools.html should be auto-generated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> devtools.html is a modified copy of inspector.html file from WebKit. Thus    changes made on WebKit side to inspector.html are not automatically reflected   in devtools.html causing breakages during WebKit deps rolls.    We should generate devtools.html automatically from inspector.html (and    perhaps  other sources)  to make sure that it stays up-to-date. </pre>
