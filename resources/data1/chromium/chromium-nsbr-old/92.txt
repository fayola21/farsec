<title>Issue 92 -   chromium -    Windows Accessibility compatibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you set Windows color scheme to &quot;High-Contrast Black&quot; (Display  Properties &gt; Appearance &gt; Color Scheme)  Google Chrome is almost unusable.    1. The address bar becomes white-on-white.  2. The Options interface becomes black-on-black.    Google Chrome should strive to adhere to accessibility settings (including  color schemes) of the operating system. People like me who are color blind  are unable to use Google Chrome. </pre>
