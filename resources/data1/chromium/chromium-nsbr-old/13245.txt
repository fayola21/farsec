<title>Issue 13245 -   chromium -    FEATURE REQUEST: &quot;Explode&quot; and &quot;Implode&quot; tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	2.0.172.30 (Official Build )  WebKit	530.5  V8	1.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.30 Safari/530.5         I don't believe other browsers have this feature        There should be a hotkey to &quot;explode&quot; all the tabs so they all split into   their own windows. And  more importantly in my opinion  a hotkey to   &quot;implode&quot; and merge all tabs from all open windows into one window.  </pre>
