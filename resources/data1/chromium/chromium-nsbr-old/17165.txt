<title>Issue 17165 -   chromium -    Desktop shortcut not added upon install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37    Just some feedback here  but maybe it is actually a bug.  I installed Chrome for the first time and when installation finished  there  was no shortcut on my desktop. This is BAD. I went into my programs  and  there it was. So I added the shortcut myself. Then  when I started it  a  small window appeared telling me it was finishing setup and would add a  desktop shortcut for me. But guess what  I had to go find you  so I added  one myself... so too little  too late...    BTW  FF3.5 instantly added a shortcut on my desktop when installed.   </pre>
