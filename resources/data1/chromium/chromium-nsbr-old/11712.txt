<title>Issue 11712 -   chromium -    Browser Crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.65      1. Open at least two tabs in Google Chrome.  2. Click the left mouse button over any tab  and keep holding it.   3. Drag the tab outside the browser to open it in an independent window    but 'keep holding the mouse button' and don't let it go.  4. Now while holding the left button  click the scroll button(mid-button   aka mouse3).      Chrome will crash.      If mouse's scroll button(mid-button aka mouse3) is not clicked at the same   way mentioned above  browser won't crash and a new window will open.   </pre>
