<title>Issue 11634 -   chromium -    [linux] Status bubble size issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.15057-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15057">r15057</a>    1) Possibly a &quot;feature&quot;: The status bar is willing to render wider than the   width of the browser window.    2) When moving the mouse from one link to a second  without mousing over any   non-link between (ie  the links are pixel-adjacent)  and the second link is   shorter than the first  then the status bar does not shrink to the width of   the second link href  and appears centered in the space sized for the first   link href. </pre>
