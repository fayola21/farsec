<title>Issue 21905 -   chromium -    cross-context callbacks can get lost - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have some test code where I'm calling chrome.toolstrip.expand on a   toolstrip from a different toolstrip like this:    other.chrome.toolstrip.expand({url:&quot;hello.html&quot;}  function() {...});    If url is a valid extension URL  then the callback never gets fired.  If   it's a 404 or a non-extension URL (e.g. www.google.com)  then the callback   gets fired.    Matt and I looked at this a little bit.  It appears that UnregisterContext   is getting called on &quot;other&quot;  and that this is somehow getting rid of the   pending request.  Matt speculated that this was because StartRequest is   using currentContext rather than callingContext  but changing this didn't   appear to help. </pre>
