<title>Issue 7922 -   chromium -    Thick Block bar is displayed in [New Tab]s - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces in Trunk 2.0.165.0 (Developer Build 10094) and DEV: 2.0.164.0  (Official Build 9941)  Need to hunt down  when it is broken !!    EASY REPRO STEPS:  #################  -Have two [New Tab]s opened.  -In omnibox  type news in one of them hit enter key.  -You will show up with info bar &quot;do you mean to go to <a href="http://www.news/?">http://www.news/?</a>&quot; -  Don't respond to it  -Drag this tab out to a new window.    You will show up black color bar in [New Tab] at the place of Bookmarks  bar. This is really annoying.  Screenshot attached.   </pre>
