<title>Issue 5912 -   chromium -    gcl try should have a --platform option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you're iterating on a problem with a particular platform  it would be   nice to be able to just specify a single platform (mac  linux  windows).    You can do this with --bot  but in that case you need to know the specific   bot names (e.g. 'mac dbg 1').  You can look those up  but I also don't   remember the URL.    In the meantime  it would be useful if gcl try --help gave slightly more   useful info about the options to --bot (I wasn't sure what it was looking   for - a platform  a hostname  a virtual name?) and maybe included the URL   of the try server.     </pre>
