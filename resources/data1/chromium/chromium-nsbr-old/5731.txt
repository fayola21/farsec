<title>Issue 5731 -   chromium -    Renderer context menu is displayed out side of the browser window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happens in both Chrome (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7133">r7133</a>) and Chromium (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7307">r7307</a>)    I know  we have a bug for renderer context menu with context menu key that  always displays on top-left of a webpage. But still I'm filing this bug  to  keep track  we don't miss this use case also.    -Make your browser window small.  -Navigate to any webpage  where we can observe horizontal scroll bar  (cnn.com webpage is fine.)  -After the page is rendered  do tabbing until the page is scrolled to  right-hand side.  -Now  hit context menu key.    Observe context menu is displayed far away from the browser window.  (Screenshot attached) </pre>
