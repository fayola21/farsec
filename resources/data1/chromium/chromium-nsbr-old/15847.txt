<title>Issue 15847 -   chromium -    Dynamically rebase chrome.dll on a system-specific way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Current state:  1. Some machine will have chrome.dll rebased  whatever base address we select  2. Having chrome.dll rebased in multiple processes cost *a lot*. On a 2 gigs   of RAM system  it can easily grow to ~40 processes  hence (40-1) * 10 megs ==   390 megs of RAM wasted! This is specifically important on laptops with a load   of crapware.  3. The differential installer assumes the PEs aren't modified.    Plan:  1. Add a command line flag --rebase where chrome.exe starts and rebase   chrome.dll according to the base address found.  2. Upon mini_installer.exe execution  run `chrome.exe --rebase`.  3. Fix the differential installer to not back off when a PE (dll) is just   rebased.    Any strong opinion? </pre>
