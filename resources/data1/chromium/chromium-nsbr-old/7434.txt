<title>Issue 7434 -   chromium -    &lt;canvas&gt; problem: Google Maps directions don't print correctly on some printers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to maps.google.com  2. Perform a directions query  e.g. &quot;seattle to kirkland&quot;  3. Click 'Print' in upper-right  4. Switch over to new window  click 'Include large map'  5. Type Ctrl-P and print the directions      Printed page includes the large map with semi-transparent route   superimposed on top.      Results vary by printer.  On a HP Laser Jet 9050 PS  the route is displayed   but the map tiles underneath are completely absent  making the map   unusable.  On a HP LaserJet 5000 Series PS  the route line is solid  not   transparent  so that the street names underneath the route are unreadable.    On a Canon iR2200-3300  the print-out is fine.
