<title>Issue 6853 -   chromium -    Resources loaded by Gears over HTTPS should not use a dummy certificate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Access GMail in disconnected mode.  The warning box shows. Page info reports that the connection is not   encrypted safely.    This happens because we create a dummy cert when we intercept a URL loading   for Gears (see url_request_intercept_job.cc l163).  In such cases  we should not provide a cert (the connection will be treated   as HTTP).    Note: bug imported from Buganizer #1308113 </pre>
