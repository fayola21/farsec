<title>Issue 14191 -   chromium -    Make fetch_server portable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It turns out that currently fetch_server is compiled only on Windows.    I tried to compile it on Linux and got errors with undefined INVALID_SOCKET  in http_listen_socket.cc. I'm going to add static const SOCKET  kInvalidSocket class constant in net/base/listen_socket.h (= INVALID_SOCKET  on Windows and -1 on POSIX). </pre>
