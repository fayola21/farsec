<title>Issue 2292 -   chromium -    Chrome has problems with Launching application from File Associations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1.  Create/Register a File extension so that it launches a user   application.   I believe you can use the WIN32 console/dos box commands    ASSOC and FTYPE.  2. Create a WEB URL with the special extension  3. Click the URL        What is expected is for the user registered application to lunch.        A few things    1) Chrome has an ignoring silly BIG arrow that shows the download.    2) It doesn't launch it.    3) The check box &quot;Always Open Files Of this Type&quot; doesn't work    Please provide
