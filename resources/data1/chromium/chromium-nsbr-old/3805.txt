<title>Issue 3805 -   chromium -    Concurrent linking of test_shell and test_shell_tests consumes a lot of memory and leads to trashing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I run scons on Linux  sometimes both test_shell and test_shell_tests   get relinked.    When only one ld runs  it consumes approx. 70% of my 1 GB memory. Linking   takes 5 mins  but it's generally ok.    But when two run concurrently  the system just trashes and I have to kill   one of lds  and then restart the build to get the other file linking.   </pre>
