<title>Issue 8740 -   chromium -    Input type file multiple text shows only a single file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An html input field of the form    &lt;input type=file multiple&gt;    allows the user to upload multiple files from a single dialog. After the  user has selected file(s) from the dialog  chrome shows some feedback next  to the input field. Currently  that feedback is one of the file names (even  if multiple are selected  it only shows one name). Ideally  it would show  something like &quot;N files&quot;. (This is actually what safari 4 does. They also  show a little &quot;stack of papers&quot; icon.)    I have attached an example html file. I don't actually know whether the fix  for this lies in webkit or chrome. In either case it's pretty low priority   but would be nice to have.       </pre>
