<title>Issue 14122 -   chromium -    Omnibox edit field stops updating. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Browse to www.google.com.  2. Select &quot;Back&quot; from the right-click context menu.    Now when you type in the omnibox  it does not update with your autocomplete stuff.  This issue is   to specifically track the update within the editing field.  There is a deeper problem that the popup   does not popup  which is due to message-loop issues (*).  When the message loop is working  it   masks this problem.    (*) <a href="http://crbug.com/13468">http://crbug.com/13468</a>     </pre>
