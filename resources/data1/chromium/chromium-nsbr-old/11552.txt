<title>Issue 11552 -   chromium -    Local folders dragged to Bookmarks bar may not be recognized as bookmarks  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 2.0.172.18        Precondition: start with clean History.    1. Drag a local folder  say  c:temp  from Windows Explorer to Bookmarks  bar.  Bookmark is created on bar.  2. Type &quot;c:temp&quot; into Omnibox; hit Enter.    What is the expected output?     The directory should be recognized as a bookmark and displayed with a star.    What do you see instead?    The directory may not be recognized as a bookmark.  It's because Chrome  tries to put the path in the form &quot;file:///C:/temp/&quot; when entered into the  Omnibox.  When you drag a local directory to the Bookmarks bar  it's  created as &quot;file:///C:/temp&quot; (without the trailing slash).    The easy solution would be to append the trailing slash when dragging a  folder to the Bookmarks bar.   </pre>
