<title>Issue 146 -   chromium -    Improper handling of the method 'browserURLChange'  is causing Flex pane to be clicked twice in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click the various accordion headings in the Flex 3 application  2. Accordion panes then seem to be selected at random  randomly.          The correct accordion pane should be selected when clicking headings in the   accordion.        Accordion panes open and close seemingly at random. This is strange   behavior considering the application should be running in the Flash player.   I tested other applications on the Web that use Flex 3 accordions and they   seem okay.      Please provide
