<title>Issue 4746 -   chromium -    Remove ISO-8859-9 from the encoding menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the trunk  we treat ISO-8859-9 (Turkish) the same as windows-1254 per   HTML5 8.2.2.2. That's done by merging with the webkit trunk as well as by   our ICU data change (for Chrome-proper code). So  there's no reason to have   two encodings in our encoding menu.
