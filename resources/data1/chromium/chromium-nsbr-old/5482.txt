<title>Issue 5482 -   chromium -    mixing javascript  diplay:table-cell and display:none causes a bug in page rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open the attached page  2. Click the show/hide button at least twice  3. There is no step three      When the last two divs are visible  they should always appear in the same   line  and the second div (visible sometimes) should appear before the third   div (always visible). The first div (the button div) should appear before   both divs on its own line.      A freaking mess!   1: The first div always appears last.  2: When the page is first loaded  each div appears in its own line  3: After clicking the show/hide button a few times  the second div (visible   sometimes) appears last  after the third div (always visible).    Please provide
