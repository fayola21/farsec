<title>Issue 22858 -   chromium -    Request to create JS to set a users default HP to Google on webkit browsers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm creating this bug on the advice of brokowski to request JS to set a users default HP to Google on   webkit browsers (Chrome  Safari)    We would like to create JS to render a users browser to Google in as few clicks as possible. Currently    a user has to take a number of steps manually (Go to the wrench menu  select preferences  type   www.google.com  select open homepage) to do this in Chrome and Safari.     Currently  for IE its a simple JS call and for Mozilla a user must drag a link to the home icon.     See this in JS rendering on IE  Mozilla at: www.google.com/services/hp    Please contact me if you need more information. Thanks! - anantica </pre>
