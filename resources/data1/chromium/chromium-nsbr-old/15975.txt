<title>Issue 15975 -   chromium -    Suggestion: Template for feature requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Don't know where this should go  but shouldn't there be a template for   feature requests? Also  shouldn't 'Defect report from user' now be renamed to   'Defect on Windows'  for consistency? </pre>
