<title>Issue 17830 -   chromium -    Hiding download items could be prettier - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  download items just become invisible if they don't fit on the shelf.    Ideally  the partially visible item should be overlaid with a horizontal alpha   gradient (in this case the download item's tracking area should only be as   large as the visible part of the item).    If that's too different from win/linux behavior (those behave as mac does   now)  the items should at least fade in/out when they become   visible/invisible. </pre>
