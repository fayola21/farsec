<title>Issue 18823 -   chromium -    Clicking &quot;N closed tabs&quot; on NTP directly after startup should open these tabs in the current window instead of in a new one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.12      1. When a new dev snapshot is out  click chrome-&gt;about  wait for update   to dowload  2. About box says &quot;please restart&quot;  so hit cmd-q  3. Open chrome again  4. Click &quot;3 Closed tabs&quot; on the NTP to restore the state before the update          The 3 tabs should open in the window I just opened.        Another window with the tabs opens  so I have to close the useless empty   window with just the NTP and move the window with my tabs up. </pre>
