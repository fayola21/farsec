<title>Issue 16228 -   chromium -    Regression: extension messaging doesn't work in content scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My refactoring that uses V8Proxy notifications about context-  created/destroyed broke extension messaging.  We rely on those to set up and   tear down state for the context  but they aren't called for content script   contexts. </pre>
