<title>Issue 9000 -   chromium -    Don't import bookmarks into &quot;Imported from X&quot; folder when there are no bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install with fresh profile  2. Do not import bookmarks during first run  3. Import bookmarks from browser menu    the bookmarks are imported into an &quot;Imported from Firefox/IE&quot; folder. If   there are no bookmarks set yet  it would be way better if they just   imported into the bookmarks toolbar  etc like they do from the first run   UI.    I watched a user in a UI test decline import on install only to manually   import 1 min later. She was extremely frustrated that she had to move all   her bookmarks to the right places (and out of the &quot;Imported from Firefox&quot;   folder.     </pre>
