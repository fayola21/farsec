<title>Issue 17107 -   chromium -    Clean up PipelineImpl  PipelineThread and FilterHostImpl mess - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's no reason why these classes should be separated.    PipelineThread and FilterHostImpl should be merged into PipelineImpl  and we   can add ref-counting to the Pipeline interface so we can post messages   without relying on yet another proxy class.    FilterHostImpl itself is quite useless in it's present form  and the only   benefit it provides is that it remembers the FilterType constant.  However an   std::map&lt;FilterType  MediaFilter*&gt; would accomplish the same thing.   </pre>
