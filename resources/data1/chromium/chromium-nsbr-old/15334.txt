<title>Issue 15334 -   chromium -    Completion popups don't redraw correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Go to a website with a text field that remembers its input (e.g.   crbug.com)  2. Enter a few characters        As more characters are entered  the completion menu should get shorter.        The completion menu _does_ get shorter  but it doesn't get redrawn   correctly: The long completion menu is still visible in the background.    Screenshots attached (you might need to rename them to .png) </pre>
