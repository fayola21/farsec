<title>Issue 13203 -   chromium -    Session history dropdowns on back/forward buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to implement the click-hold session history dropdown menus on the back  and forward buttons.    I started  but ran into problems with the mouse tracking while trying to  intercept the timer. The code I'm attaching has problems in that the  control stops tracking when you drag the mouse.    Marking helpWanted in case someone wants to give it a try. You should make  ToolbarButtonCell derive from ClickHoldButtonCell. </pre>
