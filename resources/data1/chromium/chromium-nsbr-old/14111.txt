<title>Issue 14111 -   chromium -    Display an infobar alert when extension process crashes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that we have extension processes in the task manager  it's time to  nicely handle their crashes (and termination by the user).    Currently terminating extension process from the task manager kills it  but  it does not disappear from the task manager. And there is generally no  user-visible indication of something bad happening other than extension  content disappearing from the shelf for example.    Ben: after a short discussion with aa on irc I'm going to do that using the  infobars system. Initially I was thinking about a &quot;sad extension&quot; in the  shelf  but it turns out that extensions can have views in many places  not  only the shelf. This is a user-visible thing  so CC-ing you. </pre>
