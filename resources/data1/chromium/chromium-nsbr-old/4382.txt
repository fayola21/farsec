<title>Issue 4382 -   chromium -    Trunk builds &gt; r5120 broken on Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : chromium 0.3.155.0 build 5120    i'm not sure what the problem is  but somewhere between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5112">revision 5112</a> and   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5120">revision 5120</a>  something went very bad with chromium.    <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5112">r5112</a> works fine (even though it failed some test). the next downloadable   build i could find is <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5120">r5120</a>  and from that point on (including <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5120">r5120</a>)  all   builds have a serious problem.  things seem to work ok  but the moment i try to open a link to open in a   new tab (middle click or context menu)  nothing works properly anymore:    * the tab icons do not become that spinning circle thing when   navigating/refreshing.  * opening links in a new tab does not work (neither by context menu nor by   middle-click).  * downloading a second file crashes the browser (the first downloads ok    usually).  * closing the download ribbon doesn't work (the x is not responsive).  * lots of browser crashes - on tab-closes  on download opens (click the   completed download)  on browser close  and occasionally for no apparent   reason.    these are just things i tested. i'm sure there are a lot more.  i thought that perhaps there was a problem with my user data  but when i   reverted back to a pre-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5120">r5120</a> build  everything went back to being perfect.    i'm running chromium on vista home premium 32-bit on an LG E-500 notebook. </pre>
