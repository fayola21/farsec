<title>Issue 7503 -   chromium -    Hulu Pop-Out Video Does not Resize Properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit <a href="http://www.hulu.com">http://www.hulu.com</a>  2. Go to a video.  3. Click the pop-out button.  4. After the pop-out loads  increase the size of the window.      The video should scale to fit the resized window.      The video scales but is covered by white in the bottom and right sides to   account for the new area given by the resize.  (This might not be the best   description so please take a look at the attached screenshot.)    I know that this did not happen within the last few versions.  Although I   am not sure what the difference in time was between my last visit to hulu   and updates of chrome. </pre>
