<title>Issue 9612 -   chromium -    Download items displayed in random order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12766)      1. Start several (for example 4) downloads at same time.  2. Open &quot;chrome-ui://downloads/&quot; (or press Ctrl+J).  3. Refresh downloads page several times (either by 'Refresh' button or by   F5).       Download items should be ordered by download start time  most recent first   (or at least in some constant order).      Upon some of refreshes  download items go in some random order (not by   recency).    Note that sometimes this behavior shows up right after few refreshes (2 to   5)  but sometimes the order stays constant for more then 20 refreshes. In   such cases  in order to reproduce it  you should close and reopen downloads   tab  and repeat the step 3.   </pre>
