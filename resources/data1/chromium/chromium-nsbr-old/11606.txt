<title>Issue 11606 -   chromium -    Find-in-page dialog loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome	2.0.172.22        1. Ctrl+F to bring up find-in-page dialog.  2. Esc to close find-in-page.  3. Ctrl+F to bring up find-in-page dialog.    What is the expected output?    Find-in-page dialog should appear.    What do you see instead?    Nothing happens.  If you click on the content area first and hit Ctrl+F   then find-in-page regains focus and again reacts to Ctrl+F  Ctrl+G  F3  etc.    Works OK on trunk (2.0.178.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15411">r15411</a>)). </pre>
