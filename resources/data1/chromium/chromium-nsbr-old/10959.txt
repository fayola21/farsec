<title>Issue 10959 -   chromium -    When a textarea gets out of focus  spelling mistakes are ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.177.0                         2.0.174.0    URLs:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>      1. Enter some text with a spelling error in it somewhere in the middle  2. Give the focus to anything else (for example  click on the background of   the page)  3. Continue typing in the text area...      The spelling error should be underlined      Chrome forgot all about the spelling error      This is a long standing problem and very annoying   </pre>
