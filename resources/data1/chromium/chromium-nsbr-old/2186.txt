<title>Issue 2186 -   chromium -    Replace CRect/CPoint/CSize usage with gfx::Rect/Point/Size in ChromeViews - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should stop using the Windows/WTL types CRect/CPoint/CSize within   ChromeViews. They are only used because of historical artifact -   ChromeViews::View was written before the gfx types existed.    This work should be done as a series of steps: upgrading each method on   View to use the new types. This will touch a lot of code so best to do it   in chunks: e.g. upgrade GetBounds  GetLocalBounds  etc.      </pre>
