<title>Issue 21103 -   chromium -    Can't hit escape to exit Flash full-screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292460068">http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292460068</a>  - the flash video will auto-play  hit the lower right corner of the movie to   make it go full screen  - info bubble appears saying &quot;hit esc to exit full screen&quot;  - press escape    Expected:  - back to normal view  exits full screen    Actual:  - beep.    The only way to get out of fullscreen is to click the bottom right corner of   the movie again.    I'm not sure if this is just another instance of our &quot;don't process keys in   flash&quot; bug  or if this is a different issue with full-screen  so I filed it. </pre>
