<title>Issue 17384 -   chromium -    Chrome randomly moves tabs after alt-tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Start with Chrome open  and get several tabs.  Take up a little memory-   YouTube  gMail  Hulu  etc.    2.  Leave it open  un-minimized for about 20 minutes.    3.  When you switch back to Chrome from another program  it will stall for   a second.  During that time if you click on a tab to change focus (that's   mouse-down  then mouse-up) then move the mouse  Chrome will interpret it as   mouse-down  move  mouse-up.  It will drag the tab to wherever your cursor   is.  VERY ANNOYING.      I expect chrome to keep my inputs in order.      Chrome mis-interprets my movements and responds correctly to the incorrect   signal.    <b>Please provide
