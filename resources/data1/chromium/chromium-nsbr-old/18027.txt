<title>Issue 18027 -   chromium -    Plugin layout tests crashing on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As of <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21987">r21987</a> the QuickTime plugin is crashing in these layout tests:    MAC : LayoutTests/fast/dom/object-plugin-hides-properties.html = CRASH  MAC : LayoutTests/fast/images/embed-image.html = CRASH  MAC : LayoutTests/fast/images/object-image.html = CRASH    Since the focus for beta is Flash  I'm adding CRASH expectations for now   rather than backing out the change. </pre>
