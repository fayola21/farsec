<title>Issue 16018 -   chromium -    Layout test LayoutTests/fast/dom/HTMLDocument/hasFocus.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of a recent merge the FocusController has been changed (it has a new   setFocused() method).  A fix to deal with that change has broken the hasFocus test:  LayoutTests/fast/dom/HTMLDocument/hasFocus.html  which now fails. </pre>
