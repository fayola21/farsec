<title>Issue 22884 -   chromium -    Firefox30Importer is failing on vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Firefox30Importer test started failing on vista. I disabled it.    This change seemed to be the only one who could have caused it:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=27003">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=27003</a>    Please take a look  and reassign to whoever wrote the test if you can't   figure it out.    thanks   </pre>
