<title>Issue 15803 -   chromium -    Clicking a checkbox does not give it focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0  URLs (if applicable) : N/A         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open the attached HTML document.  2. Click one of the checkboxes.  3. Press tab.      Upon clicking one of the checkboxes  it should receive focus.  Subsequently   pressing tab should give the following checkbox focus.      The clicked checkbox does not receive focus  and subsequently pressing tab   starts with the beginning of the document.    This happens in Safari too  so it is likely a WebKit issue.  Firefox takes   this a step further  and it works beautifully.  You can click an empty area   in the document and that sets an imaginary focus cursor there.    Subsequently pressing tab will focus the next focusable control after this   imaginary cursor.  I use this a lot: pick a region on the page that I want   to work with  click it  and then use tab to quickly navigate the controls   without tabbing through all the controls about that region. </pre>
