<title>Issue 21697 -   chromium -    No keyboard shortcut for duplicate tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (Official Build 25617) (Linux)        Firefox 3.x: With Extension           IE 8: OK          I've noticed there is no keyboard shortcut for &quot;duplicate tab&quot;.  IE8 has   one (Ctrl + k  I think) and the Firefox extension &quot;Duplicate tab&quot;  has one   as well.       The Firefox extensions is Ctrl+Shift+U.  This could work.     </pre>
