<title>Issue 6009 -   chromium -    Pull Skia from Google code repo using DEPS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Skia now has its own Google code project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skia/">http://code.google.com/p/skia/</a>    We should move to just pulling from there directly via DEPS like we do for   other modules. This will make it much easier to stay in sync. </pre>
