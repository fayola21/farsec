<title>Issue 18240 -   chromium -    Regression: r21621 (add mole info...) breaks page action event setup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The changelist to &quot;add mole info to toolstrip definition and enable moles&quot;   (checked in as <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21621">r21621</a>)...     <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/159202">http://codereview.chromium.org/159202</a>  ... seems to consistently break the extension specific event changelist   (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20782">r20782</a>)  specifically the setup of page action events.    After change <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21621">r21621</a>  RenderThread::OnPageActionsUpdated is called _after_ the   js code calls the native function GetCurrentPageActions() and it therefore   thinks no page actions exist (because the data hasn't been setup yet).    I glanced at the changelist and nothing obvious stuck out  but I'm out of   time (and on vacation) :)     Erik  can I ask you to take a look? This may be due to a design flaw in how   this was implemented to begin with  CC-ing Aaron for comments (in case it   is).    You should be able to test this with the sample RSS page action:  srcchrometestdataextensionssamplessubscribe_page_action   </pre>
