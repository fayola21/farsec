<title>Issue 4750 -   chromium -    RTL: Bookmarks manager context menu should be displayed next to the mouse pointer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.25 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5918">r5918</a>)      1. Run Chrome for any RTL LANG (Arabic is fine)  2. Bring up Bookmarks Manager (Ctrl+Shift+b)  3. Right click on any row in the ListView (Right Hand side)      What is the expected output?  Context menu should be displayed  just next to the mouse pointer.    What do you see instead?  Context menu is displayed far away from from mouse pointer BUT at the same  row level. (Screenshot attached)     </pre>
