<title>Issue 22507 -   chromium -    various problems on facebook on versions 4.0.211.2 / 4.0.211.4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I noticed  for example  that you can't write any message in a friend   homepage  and when you got an e-mail and you read it  the number of unreaden   message won't change even if you refresh the page. you have to delete the   message for never seeing the notification over and over again.  </pre>
