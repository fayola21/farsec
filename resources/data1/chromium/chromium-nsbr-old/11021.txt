<title>Issue 11021 -   chromium -    2 chrome instances  2 tabs and a crazy drag of tab leads to serious strangeness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0    Open 2 chrome windows and open at least one page per window. Then  drag the   tab out of the window en move it to the other window  but don't drop it. Now    while holding the left mouse button  also hold the middle mouse button. Then    drop the tab while still holding the middle mouse button. Result: instant   crash in previous versions of chrome (as reported by a user on the help   forum)  and on my chrome the 2.0.174.0 there is such a strange behavior i cannot even   state it in words  you need to see it for yourself  i mean  one instance stops responding  and the other has like a ghost tab in   it.....   </pre>
