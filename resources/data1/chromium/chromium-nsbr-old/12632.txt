<title>Issue 12632 -   chromium -    Disable virtualization on the vista testers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should disable registry/file virtualization to catch bugs when they are   disabled on a system.    Reference:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756883.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756883.aspx</a>    How to:  secpol.msc  Local Policies  Security Options   Scroll down to the end   Set the last option &quot;UAC: Virtualize file and registry write failures ...&quot;   to &quot;Disabled&quot; for every Vista slave. I haven't found a quick way to change   this via the command line...    Warning:  Disabling this will probably break the slaves! </pre>
