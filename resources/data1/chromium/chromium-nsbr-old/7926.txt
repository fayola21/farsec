<title>Issue 7926 -   chromium -    disabled Paste entry in context menu on not focused edit control - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 2.0.164.0&gt;             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Right mouse button click on not active edit control or on not active   textarea control.    Appeared context menu contain disabled &quot;Paste&quot; entry.  But if edit control was activated by left mouse button click before right   click  context menu will contain enabled &quot;Paste&quot; entry.    In all other browsers and windows applications right mouse button click on   not active edit control always move focus to this edit control before   appear context menu  and &quot;Paste&quot; entry always enabled and I can Paste text   from buffer. I think Chrome must do it too. </pre>
