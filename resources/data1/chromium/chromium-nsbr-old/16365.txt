<title>Issue 16365 -   chromium -    Possible memory leak in unknown location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   0. This may not actually reproduce the problem  but these are the sequence   of events that led to it.  1. Had 3.0.190.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19048">r19048</a> running with one tab open (gmail) for several days.   2. Gmail was blinking (unread chat message) for the period.  3. During that period  did apt-get upgrade twice (once to 3.0.191.3-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19935">r19935</a>    the next time to 3.0.192.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19969">r19969</a>) without restarting chrome.  4. Came back to find chrome using all available memory (100% memory used    99% swap used on the system)      To have a useable machine after taking a break for a few days.      My machine isn't useable because it has no memory left.    <b>Please provide
