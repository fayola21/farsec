<title>Issue 3014 -   chromium -    Java intermittently does not get cookie information from browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a Java applet that uses URLConnection to periodically connect to   the same server as the web page that contains the applet.  Normally the   cookie information is picked up automatically and sent to the server as a   header.  And even in Chrome this works most of the time.  2. Put the web page up on a server that uses sessions (or something else   that sets a cookie).  For example  PHP with session_start().  3. Load the web page - it should work fine at first.   4. Refresh the browser window while the applet is running.  The browser   itself maintains the session; but on its next load the Java applet stops   getting the cookie information and therefore loses session information.  5. If one waits long enough and tries again  the session information comes   back and the applet starts to work again.      At any point the Java applet should keep sending the Cookie header with   each request.      As described above  at certain times the cookie information gets lost and   the applet tries to start its own session    Please provide
