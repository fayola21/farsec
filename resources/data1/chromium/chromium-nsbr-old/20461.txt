<title>Issue 20461 -   chromium -    Manually upgrading an extension that requires more privileges should not disable it and ask for confirmation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install an extension that requires low privileges   (file:///D:/src/chrome2/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/permissions-low-  v1.crx)  2. Install a new version of the extension that requires high privileges   (file:///D:/src/chrome2/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/permissions-high-  v2.crx)        Expected: You should get a dialog for both and they should both install   successfully.    Actual: For the second one you get an infobar telling you the extension has   been disabled because it requires more privileges. Clicking 're-enable'   brings up the same dialog again.    This should not happen because there is no need to disable the extension   for manual upgrades the user initiated. This is only supported to happen   for silent updates. </pre>
