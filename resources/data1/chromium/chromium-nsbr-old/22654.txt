<title>Issue 22654 -   chromium -    focus traversal doesn't work in extension views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make a toolstrip or a mole with some form elements.  Put focus into one and   then try to tab to the next one.  All that happens is that the first one   loses focus.  I'm sure there's some basic machinery that we haven't hooked up   here.      cc'ing Jay since he knows the focus logic well. </pre>
