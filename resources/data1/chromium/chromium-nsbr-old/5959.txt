<title>Issue 5959 -   chromium -    BUG: Directionality inherited by non-paragraphic elements is lost after the first element and inconsistent spacing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42 (may be before too)          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Review the attached reduced test case and notice the following issues -  - In non-paragraphic elements (I guess)  the directionality is not maintained   beyond the first element  it goes back to the paragraphic inheritance or   something.  - The spacing between the lines of the non-paragraphic elements is not equal   between one another (line or element). It is inconsistently changing.   Sometimes the first line has an almost non existence bottom spacing    sometimes it is a 2px bottom spacing or so.   </pre>
