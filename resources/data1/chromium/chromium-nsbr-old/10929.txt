<title>Issue 10929 -   chromium -    Cannot tab through a web page if the focus is on the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a site with an input or textarea (i.e. gmail.com)  2. Click on compose message      What is the expected output?   Be able to start typing right away in the input box since the cursor is  already set in the input box.    What do you see instead?  While the cursor directly shows in the input field  you still have to click  on the input field to start typing.       FF3: ok   Safari 4 (webkit nightly 42662): ok  </pre>
