<title>Issue 20708 -   chromium -    Mouseover &quot;glow&quot; on background tabs shouldn't happen if the window is in the background. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a new window with 2 tabs  - open a second window so you can see the tabs of the first window  - mouse over the non-foreground tab in the background window    Expected:  - no visible changes    Actual:  - the beautiful glowing hover happens even though the window isn't   frontmost. I don't think we should do this subtle highlighting on background   windows.    Ben  do you agree? </pre>
