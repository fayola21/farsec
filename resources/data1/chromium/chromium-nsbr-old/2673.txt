<title>Issue 2673 -   chromium -    Flash: IME not available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> see &lt;b1344351&gt;    Steps to Repro:  1.      Close all Chrome instances.  2.      Open Chrome.  3.      Open <a href="http://weathernews.jp">http://weathernews.jp</a> (If requested  install Adobe Flash  Player and start over.)  4.      Set the caret within [��_��__��_��__��_��_��_��_��__��_��__��_��_��_��_��_��_��___] box.  5.      Try to open IME by keyboard or mouse.    ### PROBLEM ###  Keyboard: IME is not opened by hitting Alt+Hankaku/Zenkaku key.  Mouse: Langbar does not have ��_��_��_input mode��_��_��_ button.  (Other non-IME Chrome keyboard shortcuts do not work  either; Ctrl+N   Alt+D  Shift+Esc)    ### EXPECTED ###  IME can be opened both by keyboard and mouse.    6.      In the same Chrome window  go to <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp">http://www.nicovideo.jp</a>  7.      Log in  open any video  and type a comment using IME. This time it  works.  8.      Still in the same Chrome window  go back to the repro step #3 and  try again. This time  IME works as expected.   </pre>
