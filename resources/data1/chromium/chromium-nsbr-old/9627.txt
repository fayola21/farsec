<title>Issue 9627 -   chromium -    movies.yahoo.com: Mouse clicks on context menu of flash plugin doesn't work always - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/fast-and-furious.html?showVideo=1">http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/fast-and-furious.html?showVideo=1</a>  2. Move the mouse pointer on to the video and get the context menu using   right click  3. Now click on settings in context menu      What is the expected output?   To show the settings menu    What do you see instead?  Sometimes the mouse click is bypassed and only the second click works. Even   if the first click works  trying to close the menu also doesn't work.  Sometimes when you bring up the context menu and try to close it by   clicking somewhere else on the page doesn't close it.    FF3 works fine but not Chrome2.0.169.1_11427   </pre>
