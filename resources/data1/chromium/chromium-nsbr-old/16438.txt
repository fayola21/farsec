<title>Issue 16438 -   chromium -    webcursors on mac require a specific main bundle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since unittests aren't Mac bundles  we have to manually fetch resources from   the right place  but webkit/glue/webcursor_mac.mm uses +[NSImage   imageNamed:].  This means any unittest that were to need a cursor will fail   (none exist at the time this is being opened).    If we also go the path we expect for app mode support  the cursors won't   work there either because the main bundle will be the shell app and not   where all the browser resources are.    We have mac_utils::MainAppBundle() and nsimage_cache::ImageNamed() but I   don't think those can be called from WebKit  so we need to do something to   get the resources from the &quot;right&quot; place. </pre>
