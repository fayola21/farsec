Quit and Re launch chrome.  2. Open three tabs with different sites.  3. With Mouse pointer hold the 3rd tab drag it to the right and separate it  into a window.  4. With Mouse pointer hold the 2nd tab drag it to the right and separate it  into a window.  5. Try merging 3 separated window into the second one .    What is the expected output?  Should be able to merge 3 separated window into the 2 one .    What do you see instead?  Cannot merge 3 separated child window into the 2 one.    Note :  To consistently reproduce the issue :    1. When separating with mouse pointer hold the 3 tab first and first pull  the tab to the right then seperate.    2. Separated window 2 can be merged into 3.    4. All the windows can be merged into 1(main window) </pre>
