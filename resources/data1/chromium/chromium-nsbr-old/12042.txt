<title>Issue 12042 -   chromium -    Maximized tabstrips should be 1 px higher due to theming change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When doing my pixel-perfection changes I made the tabstrip on glass be the   exact same height as non-glass.  But the opaque frame has a dark pixel at the   very top of the maximized background where the glass frame doesn't.  As a   result the glass tabs don't seem to extend all the way to the window top.  I   should just shrink this top area by 1 px. </pre>
