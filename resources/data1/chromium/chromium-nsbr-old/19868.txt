<title>Issue 19868 -   chromium -    All audio files on webpage start simultaneously when they are not supposed to - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       :4.0.203.0       video streaming websites    Firefox 3.x: OK              1. Watch video on websites like Imeem  2. Listen for a few minutes.           Expected result is to have audio only from the video that I am watching.       Instead audio will appear from the video that I am watching and from   other audio sources in the background.    Details:    Basically what happens here is that while I'm watching a streaming a video   online  the advertisements in the back ground will take start playing their   audio over the video that I'm watchting. Its like every file that has audio   on the the page suddenly start to play even if it shouldn't be playing at   that time. It usually happens within the first minute or two of the video   that I am watching. I don't click the advertisements  or mouseover or   anything like that.  It just starts to play audio from the add with the   audio from my video. This issue never occurred in FireFox  so I think it is   a bug related to Chrome.It doesn't occur all of the time  and if you   restart the browser it will usually work correctly the second time you try   to watch the video. It only happens with certain streaming video types.   I've never had this particular problem with youtube videos for example.  </pre>
