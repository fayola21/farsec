<title>Issue 11129 -   chromium -    Right CTRL-SHIFT changes multi-row text fields to right-justified - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Press CTRL-SHIFT on the right hand of the keyboard while the cursor is   in a multi-row text field  2. The cursor moves to the left side of the text and the text is left-  justified.  3. Press CTRL-SHIFT on the left hand side of the keyboard and everything   goes back to normal.    I hope this isn't a &quot;feature&quot; because it sucks. I constantly use the right   CTRL-SHIFT buttons to highlight full words of text and this really gets   frustrating (it just happened again).    Thanks   Tim Kelsch                <b>Please provide
