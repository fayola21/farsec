<title>Issue 11199 -   chromium -    webkit include paths get pulled into chrome build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the gyp build  the compiler flags for webkit get pulled into the chrome  build.  That is  we get the -DFOO settings and -I paths used to build  WebCore and WebKit when building libbrowser  etc.    It looks like this happens when targets in chrome.gyp depend on  webkit.gyp:glue which has          'export_dependent_settings': [          'webcore'         ]     Maybe we don't need to export this?    This would be nice to fix as it will probably build faster (less include  paths) and there might be some correctness issues from the random -D flags  (seems unlikely). </pre>
