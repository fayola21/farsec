<title>Issue 2398 -   chromium -    layout tests with canvas are crashing on the merge branch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These all crash:    run_webkit_tests.sh --debug LayoutTests/fast/canvas      It looks like CanvasRenderingContext2D is no longer Peerable so when we try   to convert to a v8 object (V8Proxy::ToV8Object)  we crash right after the   static cast to Peerable.  My guess is we need to add a new case to the   switch statement in V8Proxy::ToV8Object.    My V8 fu is weak and I will need some guidance.     </pre>
