<title>Issue 9797 -   chromium -    chunking layout tests by directory caused some test flakiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13176">r13176</a> chunks tests by directory (e.g. LayoutTests/fast  LayoutTests/http   etc) and then runs the chunks with the most tests in them first. This  somewhat changes the order of the tests and exposes new flakiness. Note  that this doesn't create new flakiness  it just exposes latent flakiness. </pre>
