<title>Issue 12679 -   chromium -    double clicking words in gmail selects too much - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Double clicking the word at end of a line in gmail can sometimes select more   than just that word.    This is chromium-specific  and is a regression in 2.0.    The badness very likely stems from chromium's   &quot;VisibleSelection::appendTrailingWhitespace()&quot; (to do windows-style selection   of trailing whitespace)  which is still imperfect.    Reduced test-case attached. Looks like it isn't expecting inline elements to   have newlines in them. </pre>
