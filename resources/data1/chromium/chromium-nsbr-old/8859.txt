<title>Issue 8859 -   chromium -    RTL Regression: Some page title doesn't show up at all in new tab &quot;Recent bookmarks&quot; area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a regression  happens on Dev channel build and trunk build  OK on   Stable channel build.    Not sure if this is the same as <a title="[New Tab] page  the underline of linked text should be under all text" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7252"> issue 7252 </a>  since it is easier to duplicate   bug than split bug  so I am filing a new bug now.
