<title>Issue 6303 -   chromium -    font fallback does not work for non-BMP characters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported by Cibu.    How to reproduce:   Go to <a href="http://i18nl10n.com/chrome/nonbmp2.html">http://i18nl10n.com/chrome/nonbmp2.html</a>    Expected: All three lines should be identical (Mathematical Bold Capital A   - E : U+1D400 - U+1D404)    Actual: The first two lines have Arabic characters  instead.    What's happening is that a font used to get glyph indices for ('code2001')   is different from a font used for drawing (times new roman).  When using   UniscribeHelper to look up glyphs for non-BMP characters (simple script)    UniscribeHelper should not do its own font fallback. Instead  it should   just return immediately leaving the font fallback up to the caller.        </pre>
