<title>Issue 1260 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcut in website private window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you launch a Chrome instance from a website shortcut (so you dont enter   the normal Chrome window)  shortcut CTRL-W does not work to close it.  I realize CTRL-W should only close Tabs and there is technically no tab   there  but CTRL-Q does not work either (nor does CTRL-Q work in Chrome   normally). </pre>
