<title>Issue 9765 -   chromium -    Unlimited memory consumption with XMLHttpRequest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start a tool to monitor memory usage of a process (for example  Process  Explorer)  2. Load attached &quot;TableRefresh.html&quot; in a Chrome tab  3. Observe the memory consumption (Working Set) rising every second      Memory usage should stay at the same level  since the document loaded with  XMLHttpRequest replaces itself every time.      Memory usage keeps rising. It will keep rising at least up to 1GB  at which  point I decided to abort the process. I don't know whether it is a leak or  fragmentation or an unexpected reference somewhere that prevents the memory  being reused.      <b>Please provide
