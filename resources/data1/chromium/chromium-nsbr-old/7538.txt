<title>Issue 7538 -   chromium -    Cache not invalidated correctly on cookie changes? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Twice in the last few weeks (once with 1.0.154.48 today  once with some   recent dev channel build at home) I've had cookies disappear mere minutes   after I set them.  Once was on shacknews.com  where I logged in  closed the   tab  opened a new tab later and was asked to log in again; once was on the   internal Google network  where my office location cookie was unset  so I   set it  closed the tab  and later opened a new tab that didn't know my   location.    Clearly something is still amiss with cookie deletion.  Maybe in some cases   we're managing to delete the most recently modified cookies  rather than   least?  Or somehow something isn't getting saved into the global store (but   I didn't think renderers had a mirrored view of cookies)?  Not sure  feel   stumped :( </pre>
