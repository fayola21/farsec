<title>Issue 5552 -   chromium -    Regenerate the test server certificate net/data/ssl/certificates/ok_cert.pem in year 2013. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test server certificate net/data/ssl/certificates/ok_cert.pem  will expire on July 27  2013.  We will need to regenerate it in  year 2013.    It may be a good idea to generate a new certificate that essentially  doesn't expire (has an expiration data very far in the future).    The Test CA also expires on July 27  2013  so this bug appies to  the Test CA  too. </pre>
