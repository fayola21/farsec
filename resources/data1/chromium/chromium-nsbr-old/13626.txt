<title>Issue 13626 -   chromium -    find bar re-searches on switch tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open two tabs (with content in them)  2. Bring 2nd tab into focus  3. ctrl+F (to bring down find bar) and type in an irritating search (such   as the character 'e')  4. close the find bar by hitting the x  5. all the highlighted e's should be gone now.  6. switch to the first tab  7. switch back to the second tab      There should be not highlighted search items  because you closed the find   bar.      Even though the find bar is closed  all the previously searched for items   (letter e for example) are highlighted again. Very annoying if you search   for something common.    <b>Please provide
