<title>Issue 22103 -   chromium -    Automatically convert user scripts to extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For background  see <a title="Enable user scripts by default" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16344"> bug 16344 </a>.    We should be able to transparently support Greasemonkey user scripts by   converting them into extensions at install time.    That way  we don't have to maintain two separate systems forever -- we just   have a small compatibility shim at install time.
