<title>Issue 12249 -   chromium -    Lower the max size for media cache. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current max size for the media cache (audio/video) is set to 1.8GB at the   browser level. The browser should just pass 0 and let the network code decide   what the max size should be.    On a related note  I don't think the cache for media files should be bigger   than the regular cache  which grows with the available disk space  currently    up to 320 MB. </pre>
