<title>Issue 2091 -   chromium -    window.resizeTo() doesn't have any effect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      :   Google Chrome  0.2.149.29 (1798)  Official Build  Google Inc.

Copy the following snippet to a file  sample.html. The script is  supposed to open a html of size : (100  200)   &lt;html&gt;    &lt;script TYPE=&quot;text/javascript&quot; LANGUAGE=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;    window.resizeTo(100 200);    &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2. Open the file      When the above html  sample.html is opened  the window should get resized  to the specified value.      A Chrome window opens but does not get resized.    Additional Information  If a IE7 window is already open  sample.html might be opened as a new tab  in the 'already open window'. In that case  even in IE7 it doesn't get resized. </pre>
