<title>Issue 21118 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/forms/box-shadow-override.html fails on linux/win - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In April 2008  Pam said:  Safari on Mac ignores the box-shadow property for controls that use Aqua   theming (input::-webkit-search-cancel-button and so on).  Since we don't   provide Aqua-themed controls  we should continue to apply the box-shadow   even for controls that ask for Aqua.    This affects the layout test  fast/forms/box-shadow-override.html    It's not very important  though  since Aqua controls are not common on the   Web.    Ojan followed up with:  To clarify  Safari uses aqua style controls for most of their non-text form   elements (e.g. buttons  selects  etc)  even on Windows. We don't. So    things like buttons in safari don't get a box-shadow. This doesn't apply to   Chrome since we never render aqua style controls.    I will add that Safari Win no longer uses Aqua style controls  but these   comments are from before that was the case. </pre>
