<title>Issue 20254 -   chromium -    &quot;Make this my home page&quot; link on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the NTP _isn't_ set as the home page (via the radio buttons in the first   tab of preferences)  we should show a small link in the footer of the NTP that   says &quot;Make this my home page&quot;. When set  the NTP becomes the home page.   Ideally the NTP would show a confirmation message using the confirmation   bubble area at the top noting that this action has been performed.    Rahul  if you can get the basic logic in and an ugly implementation  Miranda   can clean it up. </pre>
