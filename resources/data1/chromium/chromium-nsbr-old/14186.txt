<title>Issue 14186 -   chromium -    Chat notification shows up on the wrong tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Had few tabs open  including http://m http://c and www.gmail.com.  2. Started chatting using Gmail chat on <a href="http://www.gmail.com">http://www.gmail.com</a> account.  3. Sometime during the conversation the chat notifications somehow moved   from the <a href="http://gmail.com">http://gmail.com</a> tab to http://c tab. I saw the chat notification   flashing on the tab corresponding to http://c page instead of the page with   <a href="http://www.gmail.com">http://www.gmail.com</a>.  When I opened the tabs  the pages looked normal on   both http://c and www.gmail.com  so it was only the tab label that was   messed up.      The chat notification should be flashing on the appropriate tab.      Somehow the notifications &quot;jumped&quot; from one tab to the other halfway   through the chat conversation.    <b>Please provide
