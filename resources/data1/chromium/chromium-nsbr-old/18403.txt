<title>Issue 18403 -   chromium -    Ctrl-C in omnibox should update both CLIPBOARD and PRIMARY selections - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> tot  Ubuntu Karmic.    When slecting the omnibox text with the keyboard (ctrl+l) the X selection   buffer is not updated with the text.    Other browsers will update the selection buffer when using this shortcut.    It has caused me to paste the wrong text many times  thinking that I was   selecting a URL to paste but actually not. </pre>
