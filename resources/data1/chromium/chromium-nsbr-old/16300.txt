Open the Developer Tools window (Control + Shift + J)  2. Open the console (&gt;= button at the bottom)  3. Paste in text longer than the width of the window  4. Scroll right past the window with the keyboard arrows      Visible text scrolls across so that you can see where the cursor actually  represents where it is.      Text displayed is static  cursor appears to be at the end of the visible  line  but its position is actually where it should be. </pre>
