<title>Issue 6205 -   chromium -    Endless redirection when login to GMail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. install official Chrome  2. switch to dev channel (2.0.156.1 (Official Build 7653)) and restart   Chrome  3. login to corp GMail  the url bar just keeps flashing      I saw the url bar has 'Offline' in it  so I thought might because Offline   GMail  I disabled Gears and now it works fine. This might be a Gears +   Offline Gmail issue.       </pre>
