<title>Issue 19461 -   chromium -    Auto-hidden taskbar will not appear with Chrome in forefront. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Unsure          With Chrome maximized. When mouse is brought to absolute bottom of screen    auto-hidden task bar (WinXP) should appear.      The Task bar does not appear. Chrome acts as if in a full screen mode.   Restoring the Chrome window (so that its dimensions are adjustable) then   maximizing it (so that the window occupies the entire screen) seems to   resolve the problem. Pressing the windows &quot;super&quot; key brings up the start   menu and shows the taskbar  but does not resolve the problem. Switching to   another window via alt-tab brings up the other window and makes the taskbar   viewable by hovering again. Minimizing and restoring the Chrome window (to   a maximized state) does not resolve the issue.    <b>Please provide
