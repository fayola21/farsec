<title>Issue 7296 -   chromium -    Google offline installation page is extremely misleading! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The page for an offline installation of Google Chrome - <a href="http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?answer=126299">http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?answer=126299</a>  It says - The version of Google Chrome available from the link below may not auto-update to future browser releases  meaning you could   miss important security fixes and feature improvements. If you install Google Chrome using the link below  bookmark this page and check   back periodically to manually download newer releases.    <a title="No way to complete offline install" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1301"> Issue 1301 </a> Comment from kuchall@ - If you read the original request  it was about an offline installer. The update   problem is because installer fails to download new updates due to proxy   configurations. User will have to periodically download and install Google Chrome.    The proxy limitation of regular installer is already on file in other bugs. There is   no ETA for when it will get fixed.    <a title="No way to complete offline install" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1301"> Issue 1301 </a> Comment from dhhwai - So what you're saying is that the possible inability to update is due to the proxy   configurations and not the installer.  So that's great.    But that also makes answer=126299 extremely misleading:  &quot;The version of Google Chrome available from the link below may not auto-update....&quot;    The wording says that _this VERSION of Chrome (downloaded from here)_ may not auto-update    making it seem like some special bug/quirk of this downloaded version  when in fact that's   not true.  BOTH the offline installer and regular installer may not be able to auto-update.      Have you noted that detail anywhere for the regular installer?  If not  that detail is also   not important for the offline installer either.    As you say  inability to download new updates due to proxy configurations is already a   noted bug for BOTH offline and regular installers.  You don't need to specially mention   that in answer=126299.  That answer text needs to be fixed and updated.    I also thought that the offline version could not auto-update like other versions. This needs to be fixed ASAP. </pre>
