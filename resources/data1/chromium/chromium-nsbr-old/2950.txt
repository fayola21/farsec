<title>Issue 2950 -   chromium -    Gameguard causes &quot;aww snap&quot; message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 3.154.0              Firefox 3: Ok for a while           IE 7: Ok      1. start a game that uses gameguard (in my case  lineage 2)  2. try to open chrome  3. results in error messages  and chrome wont work at all.      with IE or FF you can access websites. Usefull for finding game data. Firefox   tends to die after too many tabs are open  and you need to kill the process   before you can continue.    IE has no problems  but is a pain to use (why were trying to get away from it)      I have tried this on a few different computers  same result. The lineage2 game   guard is notoriously problematic  it might just take contacting gameguard and   having both chrome and GG work together to resolve this issue.     </pre>
