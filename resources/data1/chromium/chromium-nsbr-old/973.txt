<title>Issue 973 -   chromium -    Closing tab reverts to previous tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open 3 tabs  2. Go to tab 1.  3. Go to tab 3.  4. Close tab 3.      Goes back to tab 1      Goes to tab 2    Firefox handles this  and IE7 does as well I believe. If you close a tab    it will take you to the previous tab you had opened  rather than simply the   last tab in the line.      </pre>
