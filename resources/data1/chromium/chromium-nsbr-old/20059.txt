<title>Issue 20059 -   chromium -    When chromium first opens brown  or blue  fills the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.0 (23955) from PPA  OS + version         : Ubuntu 9.04 (GNOME)  CPU architecture     : 32 bit  window manager       : metacity + compiz      1. Close all Chromium windows.  2. Open chromium.      I expect to see the homepage.        While opening  and for long enough to notice afterwards  Chromium is   covered in brown  or blue if you use the default theme. This is quite ugly.    See attached screen shot.   </pre>
