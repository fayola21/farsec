<title>Issue 795 -   chromium -    Image display issues (when in their own tab) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    When displayed in an individual tab  the tab should have as title the name   of the image  and I think it would also be a good idea to have  as a   favicon  a little &quot;image&quot; icon (would be the same for all images  or maybe   have a different one for different filetypes  whatever).    Also  it would be nice to have an option to add some padding on the image   on the sides  because at the moment it sticks right to the edge of the   browser  it would be better if there was some space between the side of the   image and the edge of the browser.    Also  it would be nice to be able to change the background colour when   viewing such images  it would be particularly useful for viewing   transparent images (for example  that are intended to be viewed with a   black background).    Thanks. </pre>
