<title>Issue 5338 -   chromium -    No option to deal with background images in the context menu of a webpage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. On a webpage where an image appears as an HTML &quot;background-image&quot;  the   &quot;Save image as...&quot; context menu option expected in Chrome when the image is   right-clicked is not available and there is no &quot;easy&quot; way to save the image   from Chrome to the local computer  unlike Internet Explorer which includes   &quot;Save Background As...&quot; in the context menu when you right-click a   background-image which allows the image to be easily saved to the local   computer.    For example  connect to  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>  and try to save the &quot;W&quot; puzzle piece image on the top of the page by right   clicking the &quot;W&quot; puzzle piece. (see attached screenshot of a side-by-side   comparison of Chrome and IE7)    Because the &quot;W&quot; puzzle piece image is a background-image  Internet Explorer   allows you to &quot;Save Background As...&quot; but Chrome does not (if you select   &quot;Save as...&quot; in Chrome  this saves the entire complete web page  but not   just the image).        Save the (background) image to the local computer        Chrome cannot &quot;easily&quot; save a background image from a webpage to the local   computer -- there is no option for this provided in the right-clicked   context menu  unlike Internet Explorer which allows &quot;Save Background As...&quot;      Please provide
