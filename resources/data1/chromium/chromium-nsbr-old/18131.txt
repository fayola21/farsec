<title>Issue 18131 -   chromium -    Find bar doesn't clear contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type something in the find bar.  2. Delete it by backspacing away the text.  3. Switch to another tab.  4. Switch back.      The first character of what I typed in the find bar is restored to the find   bar when I switch back. This even happens if I close and reopen the find   bar.    Tested on Linux and Windows. </pre>
