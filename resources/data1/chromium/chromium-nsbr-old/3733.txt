<title>Issue 3733 -   chromium -    Serious display problems using Chromium buildbot 3970 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit SP1    In System properties in control panel  when performance is set to &quot;adjust   for best performance&quot;  Chromium buildbot 3970 display is different from   Google Chrome 0.2.149.30 and Dev build 0.3.154.3 when maximized (When in   Incognito mode and vice-versa).    In system properties in control panel  when performance is set to &quot;adjust   for best appearance&quot;  Chromium buildbot 3970 display is the same as in   Google Chrome 0.2.149.30 and Dev build 0.3.154.3 when maximized but the   Incognito icon (when in Incognito mode) is too partially out of the screen   (the top of it is not showing because it is too high).    Hope I explained correctly. </pre>
