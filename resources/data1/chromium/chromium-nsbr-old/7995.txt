<title>Issue 7995 -   chromium -    Gears File Drag and Drop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add Gears File Drag &amp; Drop support     1) update webkit/glue/webdropdata with a drag identity  implemented      as an up-counter in base/base_drop_target and incremented on os-      level drag enters in tab client areas.     2) add CPAPI functions for gears; one to extract the drag type/data      given an NPObject *event and one to control the drop effect (aka      drag cursor).         -- gears has the *event as an NPObject; that event          is untrusted  gears sends the event back to the          renderer/V8 for checking  type/data extraction.     3) add NPOject event testing &amp; drag data extraction code  somewhere      we conveniently have both V8 and NPAPI in one place:            webkit/port/bindings/v8/np_v8object.{h cc}        to verify the *event is a valid drag target event  is in browser      event dispatch  and extract the drag data if so.     4) add IPC glue calls for the new CPAPIs from the plugin process to      the renderer  webview changes to control the drop effect.   </pre>
