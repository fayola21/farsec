<title>Issue 20501 -   chromium -    Bookmark star color is hard to distinguish. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I find it very hard to distinguish the yellow and white bookmark stars.  Part of this is because I'm   slightly color-blind  but in this case I think it's mostly a contrast issue  the star is very small and   surrounded by darker background and it goes from off-white to light-yellow (for instance  the   yellow star below this box in the bug tracker is obviously yellow to me  because it's surrounded by   plain white and the star itself is full of *yellow*). </pre>
