<title>Issue 5704 -   chromium -    javascript issue with Date.parse and dd/mm/yyyy dates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.39           Opera 10: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        I am using a custom javascript date validator on an ASP.Net form. The   relevant part of code is as follows:         var dt = Date.parse(arguments.Value);         arguments.IsValid = !isNaN(dt)    When inputting a valid date in dd/mm/yyyy format  Date.Parse returns NaN   when it should return a number value (therefore isNan = truewhen it should   return false). mm/dd/yyyy dates work fine  but are incorrect as the form is   designed to accept dd/mm/yyyy only.     dd/mm/yyyy dates work fine in all other browsers tested. A localisation   issue with Chrome perhaps?   </pre>
