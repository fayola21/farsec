<title>Issue 11989 -   chromium -    Screen flicker on middle-click closing of tabs with mutliple PDFs open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0  URLs (if applicable) : --  Other browsers tested: IE7                 IE 7: OK        1. Open several tabs with pages that contain a link to a PDF  2. Click the PDF links so that all tabs have Acrobat instance open  3. Use the middle mouse button to close one of the tabs      - The tab should close  and the PDF of one of the remaining tabs should   appear.      - The tab closes  but for a brief moment (0.1s?) the originating page with   the PDF link appears  after which the PDF replaces it. For the first weeks   this minor 'glitch' caused me to think that I was accidentally closing   multiple tabs.     Ideally the tabs should skip the initial page render when a tab holds   an 'active PDF document'.     </pre>
