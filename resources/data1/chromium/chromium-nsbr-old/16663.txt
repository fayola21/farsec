<title>Issue 16663 -   chromium -    Extensions toolbar drawing glitches on second monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When reproducing this  I had two monitors in portrait mode in Windows Vista   (taskbar on left monitor)  and a maximized Chrome window on each.    In either window  visit <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-</a>  documents/extensions/samples .  Click &quot;install&quot; on the &quot;buildbot waterfall&quot;   extension.  Say yes.    Now observe that the newly-added toolbar at the bottom of the second   monitor has part of the download shelf UI drawn over it.  This UI only   covers the area the extension isn't drawing into  and is mostly live   (clicking the close box doesn't do anything  but clicking the &quot;show all&quot;   link does  and hovering UI changes the cursor or the element's hot state).    Restore this window  and the problem disappears.  Re-maximize  and it   reappears.    Move the window to the first monitor and maximize  and the problem doesn't   appear.  Move the first monitor's window to the second monitor and   maximize  and the problem doesn't appear.    Furthermore: on visiting chrome://extensions/ and hitting &quot;uninstall&quot; for   this extension  the (now empty) toolbar is still present in the maximized   windows.  Restoring and re-maximizing makes it go away. </pre>
