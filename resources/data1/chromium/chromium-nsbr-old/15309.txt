<title>Issue 15309 -   chromium -    [stores.shop.ebay.de]: bad layout of embedded (?) page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.de/rustikum-de-shop__W0QQ_armrsZ1">http://stores.shop.ebay.de/rustikum-de-shop__W0QQ_armrsZ1</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.33 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.33 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?  One the page  three columns of products should be displayed  but it appears   the width is not being properly passed in to this layout  meaning the user   sees fewer (1  1.5  2) columns. Changing from full-page to windowed  or   other will temporarily correct  but getting the next page of products   causes the same problem.          What is the expected result?        Three columns of products should be visible (in middle of page)      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to URL. Look.  2. (if it's okay  try selecting next page of products)  3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  FF 3.5  Please provide any additional information below.  Problem is transient -- a resize fixes it  but it reoccurs too (with   refresh  new page of products  etc.)     </pre>
