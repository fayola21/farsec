<title>Issue 16943 -   chromium -    &quot;Always open files of this type&quot; not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has been broken for quite a while. I have a check mark next to &quot;Always   open files of this type&quot; in Chromium  yet it does not automatically open the   file. Is this truly a bug or do I need to clear some settings?
