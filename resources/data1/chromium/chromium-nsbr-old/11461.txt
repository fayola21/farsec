<title>Issue 11461 -   chromium -    Extract Windows-specific parts of TaskManager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To help porting TaskManager (<a title="Port task manager to Linux" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11392"> issue 11392 </a>) I'll extract the Windows-specific   parts of it.    This should allow task_manager.cc to be compiled on POSIX with some stubs.   For full porting the view code will need to be implemented.    I'm opening a separate bug for the extraction because I have some plan how to   do it  but I'm not sure if I'd be able to write the necessary view code   afterwards. </pre>
