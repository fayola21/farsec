<title>Issue 11622 -   chromium -    Dismissing info bar should be smooth. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15545">r15545</a>)  It is clearly visible with 'Default browser info bar' and 'Password  Manager' info bar.    Use case 1:  -Having 'Default Browser' info bar on NTP  Paste and Go on Omnibox (having  a URL in clipboard)    Use case 2:   -Login to Google inter email a/c  -Click on &quot;save passwords' on Password Manager bar.      Notice in both of the above usecases  the info bar dismiss is not smooth  and page flashes alot.    I believe  we have similar flash issues  but don't remember exactly the use  case.       </pre>
