<title>Issue 11511 -   chromium -    Support &quot;app&quot; mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> App mode is when the UI hides all the toolbars and such.  It's used when you   &quot;install&quot; a webpage as an application.    This bug might be a metabug if you want to file more -- we're going to   additionally need the hooks to create icons on the desktop  etc. </pre>
