<title>Issue 18357 -   chromium -    time bar not dynamic in size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Time now has permanent space reserved for hours  minutes and seconds.  But if a video is short  space is wasted in the UI; The time bar should   resize to fit the space necessary.  If the video is very long  more space should be made for the time digits and   the time bar shrinks to the space available.    Example  if a video is less than one minute  only 2 digits should be reserved   and the time bar expand to use the space.    Hulu does it this way  so just follow their behavior as a rule of thumb.   </pre>
