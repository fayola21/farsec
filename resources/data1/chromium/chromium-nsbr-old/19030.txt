<title>Issue 19030 -   chromium -    page refresh completes causes loss of focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.12    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Refresh any page.  2. Watch the refresh finish (favicon spinner stops).  3. As soon as it is done  the Chrome window loses focus (Red  Yellow and   Green buttons are grayed out).      The focus should stay on the window. This wasn't an issue until the latest   Chrome update. Makes reading Google Reader with keyboard shortcuts   very difficult.      The window loses focus after the refresh finishes. </pre>
