<title>Issue 17911 -   chromium -    New new tab page feels much slower to load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> New new tab page feels much slower to load    I notice this most on my laptop when the system is busy with other things.  I   find that there is noticeable lag to show the new new tab page  especially   the thumbnails.  The old new tab page did not have nearly as much lag.  This   makes the new new tab page much less useful to me.    Perhaps we can do something focused to speed it up?  I don't know why our new   tab startup tests do not reflect this slowdown. </pre>
