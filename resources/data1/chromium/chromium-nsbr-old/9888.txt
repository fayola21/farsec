<title>Issue 9888 -   chromium -    Most visited links on the new tab page - duplicated links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.1 (Official Build 13271)  URLs (if applicable) : New tab page  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Bookmark a page  2. If you view another page on that site more often it'll make a duplicate   entry for that page.      That only one page from the site be listed  or only the one you have book   marked.      A website can be listed multiple times  that page for me has three sets of   duplicated sites.  www.example.com/?index (bookmarked and in the first slot) versus   www.example.com/?recent (not bookmarked and it made its way into the last   slot)  </pre>
