<title>Issue 20378 -   chromium -    New Tab maybe shouldn't have a favicon (or throbber) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new tab  2. Look at it      Expect: On Windows  there's no throbber or favicon  but on the Mac  there is.    Maybe the Mac shouldn't have these.  Didn't you read the bug summary?  Observe: throbber (which  by the way  is embarrassing)  and a favicon    If we do want to keep the icon  maybe we should use something custom.      4.0.202.0 official release (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23673">r23673</a>) </pre>
