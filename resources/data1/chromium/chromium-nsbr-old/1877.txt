<title>Issue 1877 -   chromium -    UI suggestions for 'New Tab' button. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Try to close the tab furthest to the right using peripheral vision          The tab closes      Oops--I opened a new tab instead--the second time in a row.  Darn!  I keep   doing that!  That little &quot;new tab plus&quot; looks a lot like the &quot;close tab X&quot;   when I don't look straight at it.  It probably looks too much like the   Firefox close tab box.  Never had this problem in IE7.  Firefox and Safari   don't even have a &quot;new tab&quot; tab.    Please provide
