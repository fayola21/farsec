<title>Issue 18952 -   chromium -    setting window bounds to screen size causes WMs to put window in full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  In a 2 monitor setup  maximize chrome on the secondary monitor (the one   w/o the gnome taskbar/toolbars).  2.  Open a new window.  3.  The new window is now in full screen mode.      The new window should actually be the non-maximized size  but we instead   inherit the maximized window size.  Since the window size matches the   desktop  the window manager tries to put the window in full screen mode.   </pre>
