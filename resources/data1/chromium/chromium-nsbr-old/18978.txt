<title>Issue 18978 -   chromium -    Layout tests failing because of Apache / lighttpd differences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> deanm wrote:    -----    The move to lighttpd seemed to get rid of our HTTP server flake problems  but there are some tests that fail because of   configuration/server differences.  So far these are pretty much caused by    1) Lack of caching support in lighttpd (differences in caching headers)  2) Lighttpd doesn't accept unknown HTTP methods  3) Lighttpd passes Content-Type header to CGIs even if the request didn't have the header present  4) Custom charset/etc via .htaccess    -----    [The .htaccess issue was subsequently fixed.]    The affected tests are    // This are failing for different reasons under our new lighttpd configuration  // TODO(deanm): Address all of these via lighttpd if possible  otherwise fork.  // Maybe flaky and need to be forked?  // Difference in caching headers  BUG1234761 : LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/cache-override.html = FAIL    // LightTPD doesn't accept unknown HTTP methods  BUG1234761 SKIP : LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/methods-lower-case.html = TIMEOUT CRASH  BUG1234761 : LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/methods-async.html = FAIL TIMEOUT  BUG1234761 WIN LINUX MAC : LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/access-control-basic-allow-preflight-cache-invalidation-by-  method.html = FAIL TIMEOUT PASS    // LightTPD doesn't accept unknown HTTP methods and passes CGIs a Content-Type  // even when a request didn't send the header.
