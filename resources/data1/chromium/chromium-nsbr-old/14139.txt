<title>Issue 14139 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar on needs a new look at - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome 3.0.187.0 (Official Build 18043)  URLs (if applicable)  : any  OS version                 : Mac OS X 10_6_0    Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Acceptable      1. Press CMD + B        The bookmark bar should slide down just like the windows build of   chrome.        Sorry in advance this report is not really shocking at but i noticed that if   you press cmd +b  the bookmark bar changes color to dark gray and   sliders under the navigation where on chrome on windows the bookmark   bar in fact is glued to the navigation box and it disappears into this box.    Once again this is not very important but this is something i noticed.  </pre>
