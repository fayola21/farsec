<title>Issue 9402 -   chromium -    Feature request: bookmarking applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request:    1. Be able to bookmark a Chrome application.  2. Click on a bookmark for the application.  3. The application opens in an application window  as if you had clicked on  its Desktop icon.    It would be a neat way to organize your applications. Ideas?   </pre>
