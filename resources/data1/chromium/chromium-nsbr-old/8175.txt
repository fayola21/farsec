<title>Issue 8175 -   chromium -    Download transfers hints of features that are not there (temporily stopped) or are bugged - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start a download that will take a few minuttes  2. Open Downloads by using Wrench/Downloads or Ctrl+J  3. It says Stop Temporarily Abort - which are all the same link: chrome-  ui://downloads/# - click on PauseCancel (yes it's written together)    It will now say Temporarily stopped  there is no option to resume so the   logical thing would be that if I click on the idle dl it will start to   resume. It does not  it just says Opening in Paused  and if you go back to   the download site where you originally started the download and start downloading again it starts downloading in a new process  meaning it does   not resume.      Stopped temporarily would indicate that there is a option to resume which   does not exist.      Your temporarily stopped download is idle  there is no way to resume    nether is there any way to make it go away without clearing the download   history. This is very confusing.    Please provide
