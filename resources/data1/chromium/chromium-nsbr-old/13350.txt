<title>Issue 13350 -   chromium -    FindBarWin registers a keyboard accelerator twice without unregistering it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tot (17631). On any page hit the escape key. Notice that every now and then   the find bar appears then disappears  even though I didn't have the find bar   up.    I also occasionally hit a DCHECK in find_bar_win @ line 606. May be related    not sure.    Finnur says this is likely the result of   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/114065">http://codereview.chromium.org/114065</a>  so passing Yuta's way. </pre>
