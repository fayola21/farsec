<title>Issue 20893 -   chromium -    Increasing font size inside UL structure with unclosed header (H1  H2 ...) tags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.43  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/nipe/unives.htm">http://www.unicamp.br/nipe/unives.htm</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Just access the page: <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/nipe/unives.htm">http://www.unicamp.br/nipe/unives.htm</a>        It's a simple (but malformed) HTML page. It should exhibit a marked list of   links (a screenshot shows how Firefox exhibits it). Other browsers work it   out fairly.        In Chrome  each list item has an increased font size in reference to its   prior  to the point of being too huge (a screenshot shows the beginning and   the middle-to-end of the list). </pre>
