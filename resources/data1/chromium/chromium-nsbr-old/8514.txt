<title>Issue 8514 -   chromium -    Can't login at https using &quot;p&quot; letter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello    After given a try to google chrome  really like it.  But a strange thing happen today. When I try to login at my server wich   uses https protocol  and because is not valid certificate chrome anounce   it. Since it's my server  no problem in using it  but when I fill the login   and go to password every time I press p (the letter) a pop-up comes up with   the message &quot;The help topic you requested(login_up) does not exist&quot;  and so   I can't even login.  Try to close window  to fill the rest of the password  but nothing. Can't   login. I also try this in user name and the same problem happens.    Best regards  Nuno    nunomsh@gmail.com     </pre>
