<title>Issue 3357 -   chromium -    Need multi-color TABs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Currently all the TABs are colored same - blue while the one in focus is   different - white (I like this a lot). But there should be a way to color   other TABs if needed. It further could be based on the organization of   bookmarks - e.g. work related bookmarks would have TABs open painted blue    hobby related bookmarks would have TABs opened painted green etc.                    Please provide
