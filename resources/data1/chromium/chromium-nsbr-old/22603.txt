<title>Issue 22603 -   chromium -    toolstrip bar cannot be toggled on individual windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.211.4 (Official Build 26653)      1. Install an extension which creates a toolstrip  2. Press Ctrl+Alt+B      The active window's toolstrip bar is hidden.      The toolstrip bar is hidden on all windows.    It is not uncommon to move a video or reference page to a small window. While I can understand the elegance of this bar   being toggled on all windows simultaneously  I would like the ability to hide the trimmings like the toolstrip bar in the   small window and maintain them in the larger.   </pre>
