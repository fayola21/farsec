<title>Issue 21126 -   chromium -    media testing is slow - use hash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> extracting movies to files is slow.  For cases where bit exact compares can be used  a checksum will do  instead   of psnr  speeding up the process  The djb2 hash has been used in several unittests and media_bench  and instead   of duplicating it further  it seems like it should be in a common place  and   used outside of just media.  The algorithm lends itself to realtime applications  and easily optimizes   into assembly or for specific data sizes (ie pixels). </pre>
