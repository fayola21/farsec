<title>Issue 6842 -   chromium -    The management tabs open new windows accidentally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2 (or all of the above)  URLs (if applicable) : Anyone.  Other browsers tested: Yes.         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. I open more than one tab on browser window.  2. I click on a tab and move the mouse  unintentionally  quickly to any corner of   the screen.  3. The tab is &quot;loose&quot; easily and the browser opens a new window  not that I want   that to happen.        I hope there will be an internal option so I can block the release of the tabs to   open new windows.        Opens new windows accidentally  several times while I'm working on Chrome.  This accident may have occurred with many people.      Anyway  thanks.   </pre>
