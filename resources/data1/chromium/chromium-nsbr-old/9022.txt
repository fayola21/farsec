<title>Issue 9022 -   chromium -    Better restore UI on startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The 'recently closed' section of the New Tab Page should be altered to   potentially show the following types of items:    (Chrome Icon) _Last Session_  [Window Icon] _3 Tabs_ (Favicon) (Favicon) (Favicon)   [Favicon] _Tab Title_    Clicking 'Last Session' will restore the last session and show an infobar   asking if you would always like to restore the pages you had open last.   This infobar should be easily permanently dismissable. </pre>
