<title>Issue 12507 -   chromium -    Mac scroll bars always remain blue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Version 3.0.182 (182.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7          1. Go to a website with more height than the window;  2. Select another application.      The scrollbars should loose their colour - same as the rest of Mac OS X.      Scrollbars remain blue so the window looks like an active window still. </pre>
