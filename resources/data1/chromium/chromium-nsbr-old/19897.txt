<title>Issue 19897 -   chromium -    Make LayoutTests/svg/custom/getscreenctm-in-mixed-content2.xhtml platform-independent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout test is failing:    WIN LINUX : LayoutTests/svg/custom/getscreenctm-in-mixed-content2.xhtml =   FAIL    The test seems to fail because of different SVG metrics on windows.    - PASSED  + Expected matrix [1  0  0  1  350  56]  + Got matrix [1  0  0  1  350  55]    If the height 55 is correct  we need to fix the test upstream to provide   better description and probably stop using the hard coded numbers for the   comparison since they might vary on different platforms. </pre>
