<title>Issue 7755 -   chromium -    Pasting and then clicking into Twitter.com textbox doesn't work correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.162.0  URLs (if applicable) : www.twitter.com            Firefox 3: OK          1. Open <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">http://www.cnn.com/</a> in one tab in Chrome. Copy the url.  2. Get an account on Twitter.com  then open Twitter in another tab. In the   &quot;What are you doing?&quot; box  type &quot;One two three: &quot;. Then paste the url   &quot;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/">http://www.cnn.com/</a>&quot; into the box. Now type (do not paste) the text &quot; four   five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve fourteen.&quot; into the text box.  3. Now click on the text between &quot;twelve&quot; and &quot;fourteen&quot; (as if you were   going to add a new word between them).        I would expect the cursor to appear between the text &quot;twelve&quot; and   &quot;fourteen&quot;.        Instead  the cursor position will move to just before the   ��_��_��_<a href="http://www.cnn.com/��_��_��_">http://www.cnn.com/��_��_��_</a> text. If you double-click between the twelve and   fourteen  the ��_��_��_http��_��_��_ will be selected. Screenshot attached.    Additional information:    One weird thing is that this bug only fires when you have two lines filled   in that Twitter text box. If the text was ��_��_��_One two three:   <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">http://www.cnn.com/</a> four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.��_��_��_ (which fits   on one line) then you don��_��_��_t see this issue. I also didn��_��_��_t see this issue in   Firefox. </pre>
