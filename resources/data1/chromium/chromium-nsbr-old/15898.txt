<title>Issue 15898 -   chromium -    Improve encoding detection for a very short text which may be useful for query-display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is b/1082767.    ICU's autoencoding detector uses byte tri-grams with binary values (good or   bad) and an encoding with the most 'good' votes wins. This works reasonably   well for chunks of data reasonably long (say  200 bytes)  but it works very   poorly for a short chunk.    Firefox uses byte unigrams and bigrams with weights. </pre>
