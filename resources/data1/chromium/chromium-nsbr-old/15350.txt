<title>Issue 15350 -   chromium -    Review RESOURCE_LEAK Coverity defects in Chromium  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Review RESOURCE_LEAK defects reported by Coverity in Chromium code base.    1. Go to Coverity Prevent web UI  following the instructions in   <a href="http://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChromeCoverity">http://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChromeCoverity</a>    2. Select the reports of latest run  then choose RESOURCE_LEAK and review   all the defects in Chromium code base excluding webkit and third party. The   other two are covered by separate bugs.    3. Update the classification and Severity fields as follows after reviewing   the defects:    - Classification = Bug  Action = Fix: real bug needed to be fixed. Fix it   if in chrome or webkit codebase. If the defect is in other third party   code  evaluate its Severity and take fix action accordingly. Fill in Owner   field.    - Classification = Intentional  Action = Ignore: the code is correct and   the behavior is intended.    - Classification = False  Action = Fix: false positive  the code is   correct. However we can make suitable change  like rearranging lines of   code  to remove the defect.    - Classification = Unsuspected  Action = Ignore: the defect is in out dated   source file and no longer exists  or the defect is in system files  for   example /program files/microsoft visual studio   8/vc/atlmfc/include/statreg.h </pre>
