<title>Issue 18121 -   chromium -    inspector should not be mandatory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> inspector is a tool that is not meant to be used by the vast majority of  users  and as such  it should not be mandatory.    if i remove resources/inspector/  it's still listed on the menu(s)  and if  i try to use it  i get an error page.    It should be silently ignored and hidden from the menu if it's missing. </pre>
