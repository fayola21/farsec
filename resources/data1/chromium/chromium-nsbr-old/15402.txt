<title>Issue 15402 -   chromium -    JavaScript window position information is wrong for tabs other than the visible tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download window_pos.html  2. Run it.  Observe that rect information is right (*)  3. Middle-click (or whatever) to open the link in another tab while staying on the current page.  4. Wait a few seconds.  5. Select the other tab.  The width/height information is zero.  It should start updating right.    (*) The position information may not be right.  I find that it's always 0 0  whether visible or not.    Expected output is something reasonably close to describing the position of the window on the   screen.   </pre>
