<title>Issue 21866 -   chromium -    chromium/google_chrome strings cleanup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This would be something we have to do right after a major release  since it   would result in a lot of strings work.    chromium_strings.grd/google_chrome_strings.grd has a bunch of strings   just because of the product names.  Our l10n infrastructure (on all   platforms) actually has the support to assemble strings from chunks so you   can say &quot;Quit $1&quot; and then plug in the product names for $1 at runtime.    This way the &quot;Quit $1&quot; can be localized (include any order changing)   needed.    Some of these strings use &quot;Chrome&quot; instead of &quot;Google Chrome&quot; to make   the sentence easier to follow  so that may be why they didn't use the   substitution.  But from other rumblings there could be   copyright/trademark issues that mean we really should never be doing   this.    We don't appear to have xtb files for chromium_strings  meaning we don't   have translations for a bunch of these messages.  But we appear to be   getting linux distros that are interested in shipping Chromium and so they   will want translations.    I'm wondering it it makes sense to go back through and remove all the   strings from the two grd files that could be assembled out of the product   names  and reduce these files down to strings that are purely the product   names.  At the surface  this sorta seems like just busy work (for us and   translators)  but it solve the localization need (on Linux) for Chromium    and he helps set the precedence to make sure we don't get more strings   with the product names buried in them (or wrongly just using 'Chrome').   </pre>
