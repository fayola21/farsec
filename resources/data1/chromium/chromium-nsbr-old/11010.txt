<title>Issue 11010 -   chromium -    Notification observer leaks on shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run chromium  quit.  You'll get  [17798:17802:2272096624960:WARNING:chrome/common/notification_service.cc(12  5)] 1 notification observer(s) leaked of notification type 18  [17798:17798:2272096625926:WARNING:chrome/common/notification_service.cc(12  5)] 1 notification observer(s) leaked of notification type 20  [17798:17798:2272096625994:WARNING:chrome/common/notification_service.cc(12  5)] 1 notification observer(s) leaked of notification type 21  [17798:17798:2272096626018:WARNING:chrome/common/notification_service.cc(12  5)] 1 notification observer(s) leaked of notification type 63    This is saying that we registered a notification observer  but didn't   unregister it.    Unfortunately  for some of these (at least 18 above)  it appears the object   that registers for the notifications is a Singleton  and if you try to   unregister in its destructor its destructor runs *after* the notification   service has itself destroyed  causing a crash. </pre>
