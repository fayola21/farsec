<title>Issue 8328 -   chromium -    Enable subpixel antialiasing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This will require changes in Skia.    hbono also wrote: &quot;When adding FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD in skia  is it possible   to add FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP to ignore bitmap glyphs of a font? As far as I   read the current skia  SkScalerContext_FreeType::generateImage() just   copies the bitmap glyph to the output buffer when a font has bitmap glyphs.   (Unfortunately  a lot of CJK fonts still have bitmap glyphs.) This causes a   serious problem that we cannot render CJK characters at all when we use   sub-pixel smoothing because the size of the bitmap glyph is not equal to   the one of the output buffer in this case. Even though we can change the   function to resize the bitmap glyphs  I think adding FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP is   easier to fix this edge case.&quot;    See also <a title="Restore anti-aliasing" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8138"> bug 8138 </a>. </pre>
