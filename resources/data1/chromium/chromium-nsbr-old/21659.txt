<title>Issue 21659 -   chromium -    CMYK JPEG rendered wrong either on the Mac or on Windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.

Mac Chrome  Mac Safari  Windows Safari: image is black  Windows Chrome  Mac Firefox  Windows Firefox: image is orange    I'm sure that this has to do with the image decoder being used.  I think that   the WebKit image decoders understand CMYK and correct it to RGB  so it's   possible that the image is being corrected twice  once at load time by the   loader  and once at display time by ColorSync.    Note that the image in question will crash the renderer in Snow Leopard   until <a title="[Snow Leopard] Crash WebCore::BitmapImage::draw(WebCore::GraphicsContext*  WebCore::FloatRect const&amp;  WebCore::FloatRect..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21114"> bug 21114 </a> is fixed.    The image comes from <a href="http://twitter.com/kuechengoettin">http://twitter.com/kuechengoettin</a> and is attached   for convenience.  Actually  this whole thing comes from <a title="[Snow Leopard] Crash WebCore::BitmapImage::draw(WebCore::GraphicsContext*  WebCore::FloatRect const&amp;  WebCore::FloatRect..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21114"> bug 21114 </a>. </pre>
