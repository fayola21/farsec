<title>Issue 12341 -   chromium -    Layout test fails due to scollbar appearing occaisionally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The outer scrollbar shouldn't be there.    LayoutTests/editing/selection/4975120.html    Need to look at what we do before DumpRenderTree.  Maybe we just need to call   Layout().     </pre>
