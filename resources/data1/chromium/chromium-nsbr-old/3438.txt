<title>Issue 3438 -   chromium -    Tabs within a bank webpage are not displayed - hdfc website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Attached screenshots of IE display vs Chrome for my bank webpage  since   it is confidential site - I cannot provide steps to get to the webpage for   you   sorry.          Problem is that the tabs inside the webpage which say &quot;Accounts&quot;  &quot;Third   Party Transfer&quot;  &quot;bill Payments&quot;  &quot;Credit Cards&quot; etc are not visible while   using Chrome  but visible/usable in IE      No tabs are displayed.    Please provide
