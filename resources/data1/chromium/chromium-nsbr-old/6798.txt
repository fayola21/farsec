<title>Issue 6798 -   chromium -    Don't substitute non-inline-AC URL for inline-AC one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The history URL provider has code to substitute a shorter URL for a longer   one for inline autocomplete purposes.  However  in the case where the   shorter one has been typed only once and is longer than a simple hostname    this can mean not inline-autocompleting anything  rather than at least   getting the longer URL  which is probably better. </pre>
