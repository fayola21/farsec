<title>Issue 18791 -   chromium -    Unfullscreen leaves omnibox in state where it doesn't accept URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.196.0-22005  OS + version: Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture: 32-bit  window manager: ion3    I've seen the omnibox get into a state where it refuses to visit new URLs.  I   don't know how to reproduce it  but one of my currently-open windows is doing   it  and bradfitz was complaining to me about seeing the same thing a few days   ago.    Here are some observations that may help in tracking down the problem:    - Ctrl-L doesn't focus the omnibox; I need to click in it to focus  - I *do* get autocomplete and the suggestion drop-down as I type  - When I hit Enter  Webkit doesn't do anything and the URL gets replaced by the   current location  - The same thing happens to all tabs in the window (both new and already-open   tabs)  - Things still work as expected in other windows  so the problem looks like it's   constrained to one AutocompleteEditViewGtk </pre>
