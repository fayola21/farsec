<title>Issue 21388 -   chromium -    Focus is not restored after dismissing find-in bar with pre-populated search word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repro on ToT (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25720">r25720</a>)    Usecase 1:  #########  -On NNTP  make sure keyboard focus on Omnibox  -Ctrl+F to find-in bar and type 'foo'  -Esc to dismiss the find-in bar. [ focus is not restored to Omnibox - I  believe this is expected behavior]  -Now refresh the NNTP/create any number of NNTP's/delete the search word  from Find-in bar search box and create steps 2 and 3.    Expected: Keyboard focus should be restored to Omnibox. But It never.    Usecase 2:  ##########  -Navigate to google home page - notice focus is on the search box.  -Ctrl+f to find-in bar and type 'foo'  -Esc to dismiss the find-in bar.    Result:  Google's search box is highlighted but the caret does not blink on the  search box.    PS: Usecase 2 is a regression.   </pre>
