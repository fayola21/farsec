<title>Issue 23049 -   chromium -    user name and password details are not saved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome does not remember user name and password if you're behind a proxy   that requires NTLM authentication.     The last Chrome build that worked fine: 4.0.203.2 (Official Build 24690)    Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Fire up Chrome.   2. Set Chrome to remember passwords.  3. Set proxy settings to &quot;use automatic configuration script&quot; or configure   it to use a proxy server and enter port info manually.      First time you open a page  it will ask for user name and password since   you are behind a proxy. Chrome should remember the password during the   session and in-between the sessions.      The password is remembered during the session and but when you open a new   session.  </pre>
