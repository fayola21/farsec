<title>Issue 11447 -   chromium -    Images should be resampled on a background thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We use high-quality but slow image resizing. This makes pages that display   animated zoom images very janky. It also means if you are viewing a large   photo that is being resized to fix the window  there will be short hang   while we resample it.    When initially painting  we should display a linearly interpolated version   of the image. This should then kick off a request to a lower-priority   background thread to do the resampling. This is straightforward to do.    When the resampling is complete  we should repaint the image(s) with the   resampled version. This is a bit more tricky  since the graphics layer   doesn't know about where the image might be on the page. </pre>
