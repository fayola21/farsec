<title>Issue 5398 -   chromium -    Crome closes when opening chrome on other user acount on the same pc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29                Here at work I have to switch between user accounts on the same pc often   and I have noticed that if I have google chrome open on one user account   and then I switch users and open google chrome on the other user account.   When I go back to the original user account my google chrome windows will   be closed and when I open chrome it says it crashed.     I am using windows vista  and it may have something to do with being signed   into gmail on one of the accounts as well  but I'm not sure.       Can switch between users accounts without it closing my chrome window on   the other account.       Thanks </pre>
