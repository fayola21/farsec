<title>Issue 20018 -   chromium -    Occasionally get extra dock icons for tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure of the STR but I've seen this twice now.    Sometimes when I open a tab  it takes a while to appear (app janks) then a   new Chrome icon bounces in the dock. It goes away when I close the tab.    Logging this to get it on the record  it's definitely something to be mindful   of. If we get a lot of reports we should investigate for beta but unless we   are  can't do much without STR.   </pre>
