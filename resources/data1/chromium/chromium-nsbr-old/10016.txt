<title>Issue 10016 -   chromium -    Make Gears' location notifier to be less disruptive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53      Firefox 3.x: OK with Geode extension  very simple and less disruptive      1. Go to site that uses Gears location feature  such as Gmail's compose feature with Location in Signature on Labs  2. A notifier will appear that will ask you to use this feature      It should be less disruptive      POPUP window appear  very annoying especially moving from pc to pc with   Chrome. I've attatched a doodle of what it should be.    I hope this works the same such requesting to use Gears for database and   etc. :] </pre>
