<title>Issue 9422 -   chromium -    Mousing over link in background window brings it to the front - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. create two windows and load pages in them  2. offset them slightly so they overlap but you can still see links in the background window  3. mouse over a link in a background window    Expected:    - might see some rollover or CSS changes  but nothing major    Actual:    - background window comes to the front  but isn't key or main.    ACK! Very annoying! </pre>
