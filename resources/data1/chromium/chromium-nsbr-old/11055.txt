<title>Issue 11055 -   chromium -    Going forward/back in a new tab doesn't take the current pending entry into account - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looking at the code  I think this has been around forever  but I didn't   test older versions.    If you have a pending load and then hit Control-Back/Forward  thatrelative   navigation will be relative to the last committed entry of the previous   tab  not the currently pending one.    For example  normally if you hit Back then Back really fast before the load   commits  we'll go back two. If you hit Back then Control-Back really fast    you'll end up with the first tab navigated back two  and the second tab   navigated back one.    People don't hit Control-Back very often  and the page is usually committed   when they do  so this isn't a super high priority.    To test in code  remove the lines in   BrowserCommandsTest.BackForwardInNewTab commented with this bug number that   prevent that test from asserting due to this bug. </pre>
