<title>Issue 13243 -   chromium -    [Linux] Minimal window size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.184.0 (Developer Build 17473)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): minimal window size prevents bug      1. Resize the main window to be very small  e.g. too small to show the url  entry      There should either be a minimal window size.      You can get parts of the widgets from the right of the url entry draw on  top of the back/forward/star buttons which is very ugly  see Screenshot.   </pre>
