<title>Issue 20998 -   chromium -    Linux: UnspecifiedStackSignature crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're getting lots of crashes with UnspecifiedStackSignature.  At first  I thought they were   64 bit crashes  but it appears that many of them are 32 bit.  I think I remember Evan saying   they're related to <a title="Render crashes when loading Totem (non-flash movie files)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20350"> issue 20350 </a>  but in any case  I'm curious why we're getting   UnspecifiedStackSignature in the first place.  It looks like we started getting these 32-bit   UnspecifiedStackSignature crashes in 4.0.202.2.  It's somewhat interesting though that the   crashes only began happening a week after the 4.0.202.2 release went out.  Perhaps there's   something related to the following release (4.0.203.2) coming out around then?  Meh  I   dunno.    As you can see here  http://crash/reportview?  product=Chrome_Linux&amp;version=4.0.202.2&amp;date=&amp;signature=UnspecifiedStackSignature&amp;  email=&amp;clientid=&amp;starttime=&amp;endtime=&amp;start=400&amp;num=500&amp;start_token=ChIJieKowll5X  zIRuMfWA3oDaDUQkAM  the crashes started Oct 27.  But the first reports of any crashes   for this version start on Oct 21  which I assume is when it got released.  It's strange that   the UnspecifiedStackSignature crashes started happening later.    Maybe if <a title="Render crashes when loading Totem (non-flash movie files)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20350"> issue 20350 </a> gets solved  it'll explain this.  I'm also curious why breakpad isn't   reporting where the signal was received.  The stack trace is also broken.  Thread 0 only has   the breakpad exception handler stack frames  not the rest of the thread stack.  Does this   imply that the stack is corrupted  thus preventing the retrieval of the rest of the stack   frames?  Or is there a breakpad bug here?    Cc'ing people I think know about breakpad. </pre>
