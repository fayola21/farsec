<title>Issue 13958 -   chromium -    Task manager shows N/A for browser process network usage  which is not true - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are cases when the browser process makes network requests  for example   safe browsing updates I think. I for sure have seen that sometimes the value   in network column for the browser process is not N/A.    I think it would be slightly more accurate to say in task manager's resource   provider for browser process that it supports network usage statistics.    This is a trivial change in code  but user visible. So I'm filing this bug   and asking before starting the work. In case you don't agree  please just   close this as WontFix. </pre>
