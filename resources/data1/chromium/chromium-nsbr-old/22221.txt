<title>Issue 22221 -   chromium -    Saved Passwords all gone  chrome does not offer to save new passwords even though option is checked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have saved a bunch of passwords from previous builds of chrome.          Chrome used to remember all my passwords and have the fields autofilled    and also offer to remember passwords for new sites.      Chrome has forgotten all my passwords. When I click on View saved passwords   in options  the list is completely empty. I am actually really scared right   now as I am afraid someone has hijacked the developer build and stolen my   passwords. Also Chrome refuses to offer to remember new passwords  and   won't save any passwords anymore. HUGE BUG.    <b>Please provide
