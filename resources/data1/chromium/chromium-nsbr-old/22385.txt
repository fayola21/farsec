<title>Issue 22385 -   chromium -    duplicate resource filename causes bad behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you have two different .grd files in two different directories that   reference different files with the same relative name  one of them will be   used for both resources.    For example:  browser/browser_resources.grd references  browser/resources/foo.txt    and  renderer/renderer_resources.grd references  renderer/resources/foo.txt    Only one of the two foo.txt files will be used for both resources.  There   is no warning and no error  just bad behavior.  This appears to be because   the build rules copy the resource files into a single shared flat directory   (obj/global_intermediate/chrome) where they can conflict with each other.   </pre>
