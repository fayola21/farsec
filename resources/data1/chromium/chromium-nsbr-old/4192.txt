<title>Issue 4192 -   chromium -    browser crashes upon clicking &quot;show password&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Click the customization menu in the top-right  2. click &quot;options&quot;  3. Click the &quot;Minor Tweaks&quot; tab  4. Click &quot;show saved passwords&quot;  5. Click &quot;show password&quot; (I do not have any saved passwords  so the problem  probably only exists due to the fact I do not have any password selected)      The &quot;show password&quot; button should probably be ghosted out when no password  is selected.      when the button is clicked  the whole browser immediately crashes. </pre>
