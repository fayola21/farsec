<title>Issue 11793 -   chromium -    Investigate whether webkit change 43522 should be applied to RenderThemeChromiumWin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In &lt;<a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/43522">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/43522</a>&gt; the margins style for search   inputs on windows was changed. Since this change was in RenderThemeWin.cpp   it doesn't impact chromium.... should the same style be used in   RenderThemeChromiumWin.cpp ?    I am attaching the visual impact it has on the layout test LayoutTests/fast/forms/search-styled.html. </pre>
