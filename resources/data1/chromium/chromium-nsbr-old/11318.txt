<title>Issue 11318 -   chromium -    Auto-replacing comma &quot; &quot; by point &quot;.&quot; in the address bar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think Google Chrome could have an option to automatically replace comma  &quot; &quot; by point &quot;.&quot; on address bar.  I think this can be good because many people including me sometimes write  the address wrong  with the comma instead of point  cause the keyboard keys  are near.   </pre>
