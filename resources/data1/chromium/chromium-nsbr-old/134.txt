<title>Issue 134 -   chromium -    Can't set Chrome as default browser under Vista x64 unless installed as administrator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)      1. Install Chrome via installer under Vista x64.  2. Go to Options dialog and click &quot;Make Chrome my default browser&quot;      Windows should set Chrome as the default browser for the OS.      No change is made (in my case  Firefox remained the default browser). The   button in the Options dialog also remains enabled and the message.    Workaround:  Right-click the ChromeSetup.exe installer and select Run as Administrator.   This makes it possible to set Google Chrome as the default browser by   checking the appropriate checkbox during the installation process. </pre>
