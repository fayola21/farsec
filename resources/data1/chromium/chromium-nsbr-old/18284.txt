<title>Issue 18284 -   chromium -    Crash in Google Sites when indenting a table - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2 (Build oficial 22142)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://sites.google.com/">http://sites.google.com/</a>         Safari 4: OK (the whole table is indented)    Firefox 3.5: OK  more or less (a cell is indented)           IE 7: OK  more or less (a new line under the table gets indented)      1. Create a table in a Google Sites page. For example  2x2. I think any size will do.  2. Click next to the right of the table  outside of it.  3. Click in the 'indent right' button.      The table is indented to the right.      The tab crashes and I get a sad tab.    The Google Sites editor is ofteen a bit unstable and sometimes crashes randomly  but   this is the only crash I could easily reproduce in a consistent way.  </pre>
