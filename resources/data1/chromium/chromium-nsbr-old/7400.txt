<title>Issue 7400 -   chromium -    Chrome takes too much time to refresh the page and picks up info from cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. We have an intranet application which is used to upload testing data.   After uploading the data we have a separate web page to verify the   contents..   2. Most of the time updated information does not reflect in chrome.         Should be able to see the updated info.      Old information shows up. Clearing the cache addresses the issue. Even   Shift+refresh keys do not work..     Please provide
