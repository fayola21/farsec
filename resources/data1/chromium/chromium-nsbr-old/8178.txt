<title>Issue 8178 -   chromium -    Clicking somewhere on a long URL does not position the cursor correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1      1. Open new tab.  2. Right click on Google logo (on top-right corner) and open image in new   tab.  3. Try to play with this new tab:    - first click selecting the whole address (that's fine)  But what about next clicks?  After many clicks it's unselecting at least.    - When cursor is at the beginning (Home)  one clicking on text selecting   all (double click should select the whole text)  On one-click cursor should go to clicked position?    - Go to the end (End) and click somewhere.  Cursor is going somewhere else (it looks like some hardcoded limit).      Cursor should be in the right position when clicked.   </pre>
