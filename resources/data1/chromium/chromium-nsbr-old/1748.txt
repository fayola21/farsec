<title>Issue 1748 -   chromium -    feature request: noscript-like javascript filtering desired - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Executing Javascript from unknown sources is generally dangerous; if not  today  then tomorrow  your favorite browser will have a JS-related security  flaw.  And one of the sites you visit regularly will be hacked and have  malicious JS injected into pages.  Safer to browse with JS disabled  everywhere except where you really need the extra functionality.    The Security Zones concept in IE is both too cumbersome and not granular  enough.  The NoScript Firefox extension is a great balance between  user-friendliness and safe/paranoid defaults.  I would love to see  functionality like that built in to Chrome  or failing that  as an extension. </pre>
