<title>Issue 14654 -   chromium -    HTML5 Drag and drop  effectAllowed and dragEffect broken in Chrome. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The effectAllowed and dropEffect properties of the DataTransfer object allows   the page to decide what kind of effect dragging things has. For example if I   set effectAllowed to &quot;linkMove&quot; and then the dropEffect to &quot;move&quot; the effect   is to do a move dnd action and we should show the move cursor.    In Chrome  if I set effectAllowed to something that does not contain &quot;copy&quot; I   cannot do any drag and drop.    FWIW  this works in Safari 4. </pre>
