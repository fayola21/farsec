<title>Issue 4331 -   chromium -    Window Size Automatically Reduces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> CHROME VERSION: 0.3.154.9        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open a new tab in Google Chrome  2. Close the new tab by pressing the [x] in the corner.      The newly created tab closes and the original tab shows.      It does not happen that much  but about 1 in every 20 times of doing the   above steps  the window size of the entire browser will automatically go   from a &quot;Maximized&quot; size to a smaller &quot;Minimized&quot; size.    I could post some screen shots  but I believe that the problem is easy   enough to understand.  After closing a new tab  the whole browser goes from   being in a &quot;Maximized&quot; size (taking up the whole screen except for the   windows explorer bar at the bottom) to a &quot;Minimized&quot; size (Taking up only a   portion of the screen; you can see the desktop outside of the web browser).    I am being a little nit-picky and this is not that big of an issue  but I   want this web browser to be perfect.  I like firefox  but I love simple   designs.  Putting the both together is a great idea and I would like it to   be perfect when the actual thing comes out! </pre>
