<title>Issue 2605 -   chromium -    javascript associative array's 'numerical' keys are not in order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : GoogleChrome (latest public)    <a href="http://blog.bmn.name/2008/09/google-chrome-array-eval-out-of-order/">http://blog.bmn.name/2008/09/google-chrome-array-eval-out-of-order/</a>  Other browsers tested: FFox  MSIE 5+6+7  Opera  Safari 2+3         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        create asoc. array in JS like:  var arr = {one:true two:true three:true four:true};      try to loop over this object property (only asociative array emulation in JS):    for(var i in arr) alert(i);      4 alerts with strings 'one' 'two' 'three' 'four' in this exact order!      4 alerts with strings in random order  or say in different order then they  was created.    This is very painfull bug for JS programers because JS desnt offer any  different way how to create and loop thru associative array. All commonly  used browsers work properly since IE5+. </pre>
