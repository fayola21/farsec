<title>Issue 14632 -   chromium -    should not print out &quot;evaluating&quot; in the console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I type in the console  I get an &quot;evaluating...&quot; message each time I hit   enter. I don't think we should bother printing this out.    1. It's annoying having all these evaluating messages throughout the things   I've typed. Makes the console hard to read.  2. The responses come immediately  so the evaluating message isn't really   necessary in the first place.    The only time it would realistically take a long time is if the renderer process   were dead  in which case  the evaluating message wouldn't be accurate. :) </pre>
