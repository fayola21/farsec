<title>Issue 7505 -   chromium -    Bad Bookmarklet Bookmarks ExportImport - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.160.0      1. Create a bookmarklet that includes quotes (javascript:alert(&quot;wow&quot;)).  2. Export bookmarks.  3. Import bookmarks.  4. Go to the imported bookmark and activate it.      The bookmarklet will work.      Nothing (JS error)    The bookmark was not exported correctly and also not imported correctly (and not even in the same way it was exported).  Every quote became slash-prepended (as in JavaScript syntax)  but HTML does not support this kind of things (like the bookmark importer does not).  Changing the outer attribute quotes (href=&quot;...&quot;) to a single quote (href='...') makes Chrome not import the bookmarks.    Also note - the spell checker says &quot;prepended&quot; is not a word  it suggests &quot;perpended&quot; (and others). When searching for &quot;perpended&quot; Google suggests it should be &quot;prepended&quot;. Am I right? Are Google and Wikitionary (and   others) wrong? </pre>
