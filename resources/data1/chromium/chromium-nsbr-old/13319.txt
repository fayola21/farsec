<title>Issue 13319 -   chromium -    quick close of multiple tabs using the mouse doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  when you click the close button on a tab  the next tab slides  under your mouse such that the close button of the next tab is under your  mouse. This allows for easily closing a lot of tabs with your mouse.    I'm on 3.0.182.5 (Developer Build ). </pre>
