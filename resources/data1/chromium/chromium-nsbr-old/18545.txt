<title>Issue 18545 -   chromium -    Layout test crash: WebWorkers on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> #0  0x08a5ae24 in WebWorkerClientImpl::terminateWorkerContext   (this=0xb771d48)      at webkit/glue/webworkerclient_impl.cc:149  #1  0x08847e36 in WebCore::Worker::terminate (this=0xb7778f0)      at third_party/WebKit/WebCore/workers/Worker.cpp:101  #2  0x08847e53 in WebCore::Worker::stop (this=0xb7778f0)      at third_party/WebKit/WebCore/workers/Worker.cpp:112  #3  0x085ec150 in WebCore::ScriptExecutionContext::stopActiveDOMObjects   (this=0xb1a0eb0)      at third_party/WebKit/WebCore/dom/ScriptExecutionContext.cpp:156    The crashing line is:    webworker_-&gt;terminateWorkerContext();    and webworker_ is NULL. I would just wrap a NULL check around it  but Evan   told me I should file a bug instead. </pre>
