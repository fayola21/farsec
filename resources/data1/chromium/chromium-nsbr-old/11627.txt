<title>Issue 11627 -   chromium -    Unable to load a cached POST going back/forward if the current URL matches the URL of the POST - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Unable to load a cached POST going back/forward if the current URL matches the URL of the POST    Example site:  <a href="http://www.uni-nets.com/chrometests/brokenforms.php">http://www.uni-nets.com/chrometests/brokenforms.php</a>    Initially  when you just load that URL  the browser does a GET.  Then when you submit the form  the browser does a POST to the same URL.  Hitting back goes back to the page that was fetched using GET.  Hitting forward  should load the POSTed page from   cache  but it does not. </pre>
