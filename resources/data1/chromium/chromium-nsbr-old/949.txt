<title>Issue 949 -   chromium -    Depot tools fail on Mac OS if a non-english language is set - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To reproduce the problem  try to do gclient sync with LANG set to fr_FR for  instance. This is the default on French systems. On other parts of the  world (except english-speaking)  the locale will be different but the same  problem will happen.    The problem comes from the fact that svn will then answer messages in  another language than english  which will confuse gclient.py which tries to  match text with output.    The obvious solution is to do this somewhere in gclient.py's Main function:  os.environ[&quot;LANG&quot;] = &quot;en_US&quot;    Sincerely   Joel-Alexis Bialkiewicz </pre>
