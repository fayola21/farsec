<title>Issue 7818 -   chromium -    file:// links don't work on new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we changed around our chrome:// chrome-ui:// chrome-resource:// etc    it looks like webkit wasn't updated to allow it as a local resource.  This   means if you have a file:// link in the new tab page (for example  in your   top 9)  you will not be able to click it. </pre>
