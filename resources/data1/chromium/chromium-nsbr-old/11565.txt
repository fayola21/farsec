<title>Issue 11565 -   chromium -    Strange behavior with Search engine keywords  if it contains special chars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought we have a bug for this  but could not able to trace one. And this  is not a regression.    -Add a search engine keyword with any one of the special chars '~/%/^' (for  eg: g~ )  -Type &lt;keyword&gt; into the Omnibox.    You will notice two issues here.    1. As soon as you enter &lt;keyword&gt;&lt;nospace&gt;  you are entered into search UI  mode.    2. Once you are in search UI mode  hit 'Backspace' to exit the search UI  mode. You can't  as backspace is ignored in this special case.         </pre>
