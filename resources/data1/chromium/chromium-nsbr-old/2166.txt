<title>Issue 2166 -   chromium -    307 Redirect Behavior when using the POST method - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        1. POST a form to server1 that replies with a 307 redirect to server2.  Chrome coverts the POST to server2 to a GET request  which squashes a  user's form data.  IE7  Safari and FF3 all make a POST request to server2.        Make a POST request to the URL specified by the Location header in a 307  redirect and preserve form data.        POST-&gt;307-&gt;GET-&gt;FROWN     </pre>
