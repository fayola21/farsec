<title>Issue 19055 -   chromium -    Window decoration/tab bar disappear after full screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11  URLs (if applicable) : N/A          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. F11 to full screen browser  2. F11 to return from full screen (does not return to previous window size)  3. Window decoration is missing (either X11 window manager or Chrome window   decoration)      Hitting F11 while in full screen mode will reduce the window to previous   size and return the window decoration to the &quot;normal&quot; state for a non-full   screen window.      Window does not leave full screen  I can ALT+drag to resize the window.   Sometimes the window will resize to full screen  sometimes not. When   resizing to a smaller  non-full screen size window the title bar (window   decoration) is missing. Hitting F11 again does nothing noticeable. (See   Screenshot.png)    Another oddity: when focusing on a window within the same monitor (I have 2   30&quot; monitors) the Chrome window loses its tab bar as well as the window   decoration. If the focus is moved to a window on the second monitor the   Chrome window will still be missing the window decoration but the tab bar   will still be there. (See Screenshot-1.png)   </pre>
