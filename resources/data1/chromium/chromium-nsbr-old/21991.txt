<title>Issue 21991 -   chromium -    Maximize  - Restore implementation broken. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chromium and maximize. The window widgeet (and the maximize button)  don't change  it stays as an unmaximized window  although it is maximized.   2. Click maximize button to return to normal window  it doesn't respond.   3. Double click on titlebar  window is resized to normal window mode  but  the window frame changes to a maximized version.   4. Consequent double-clicks on window titlebar maximize - restore the  window  but the window frame is opposite of what it should be in each moment.       On maximize  window frame should become maximie (title bar dissapear  most  space economised).       It inverts the window frame state  and the button maximize does not work.     <b>Please provide
