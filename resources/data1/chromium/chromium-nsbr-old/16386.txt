<title>Issue 16386 -   chromium -    Tab dragging offsets windows strangely if they are of different sizes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - create a window with 2 tabs  - drag one off to create a new window  - resize the newly created window to be smaller than the original window  - drag the new window back to the old to merge them back together    Expected:  - window you're dragging is aligned with tab strip drop location in the  destination window.    Actual:  - the window you're dragging drops way down to the bottom of the screen  even though the mouse is in the tab strip of the destination window. The  bottom edges of the windows line up  which is wrong because they're not the  same size.    Releasing the mouse while in the tab strip correctly merges the windows   and the drop feedback is correct  but the window you're dragging is just  pushed way off to the wrong part of the screen. </pre>
