<title>Issue 14853 -   chromium -    Regression: a renderer crashes when selecting a drop-down menu item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium trunk (since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13965">r13965</a>)   URLs (if applicable) :  Other browsers tested:  Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:  Chromium (before <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13956">r13956</a>): OK                  Safari 4: OK               Firefox 3.x: OK                      IE 7: OK                      IE 8: OK    1.Open the attached file;  2.Click the drop-down menu and open a drop-down menu;  3.Move a mouse cursor to the bottom of a drop-down menu  and;  3.Observe.    What is the expected output?  A renderer should not crash.     What do you see instead?  A renderer crashes.        It seems <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13964">r13964</a> (*1) changes PopupListBox::getRowFont() and call menuStyle() to retrieve a   font (including its height) that renders a row. On the other hand    PopupListBox::getRowHeight() still calls itemStyle() to retrieve the height of a row. This   causes a style inconsistency between a font height and a row height in the PopupListBox   class.
