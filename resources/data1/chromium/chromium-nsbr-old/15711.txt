<title>Issue 15711 -   chromium -    NNTP: Recent Activites drop-down list should be closed  after window is opened. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   -Close a window with few tabs.  -Close a tab in the current window.  -Do tabbing on NNTP to go to step1 link under 'Recent Activities'    Notice  before the link (step 1) gains keyboard focus  its drop-menu   appears on top-left corner of the window -Screenshot attached. If you do   tab one more time  now step1 link gains keyboard focus and now its drop-  down menu is listed properly underneath the link.           </pre>
