<title>Issue 2197 -   chromium -    Scroll up doesn't work on laptop trackpad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29    I can scroll up and down fine in other browsers using the trackpad. When i   do the same in chrome  i can scroll down but not back up.      1. Scroll down using your laptop trackpad. usually by running your   finger(s) down on the right hand-side.  2. Now try and scroll up  3. It doesn't :(      FAIL!      Nothing!      </pre>
