<title>Issue 19132 -   chromium -    XIM (fcitx) loses response in the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22553">r22553</a>(and former versions)  OS + version : Kubuntu 9.04/Linux dword-pc 2.6.30.2-dh #1 SMP Fri Jul 24   11:15:54 CST 2009 i686 GNU/Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit x86  window manager : Openbox      It happens unpredictably and frequently after a certain amount of   browsering  especially when the input method is enabled while switching   tabs.       XIM should work properly.      XIM (fcitx version 1:3.6~rc-1) loses response to any key input. After   manually turning it off  the default hot-key Ctrl+Space can open the input   method  but no input can be done(neither Chinese nor English)  and then the   input method has to be manually turned off(Ctrl+Space can no longer turn it   off  while being able to turn it on). And the input method would not work   properly again unless you restart Chrome.  Meanwhile  other programs can run quiet well with fcitx  and other   functions in Chrome run quiet well too.
