<title>Issue 22563 -   chromium -    HistoryContentsProviderTest.Body hangs in newer valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> tools/valgrind/chrome_tests.sh -t   unit --gtest_filter=&quot;HistoryContentsProviderTest.Body&quot;    hangs on linux if you're using valgrind-10880 or valgrind-10771   but not if you're using valgrind-20090715.  Doesn't seem to hang on the mac.    Maybe there's something wrong with the patches we  apply to valgrind in tools/valgrind/build-valgrind-for-chromium.sh   but it could be upstream  too.   </pre>
