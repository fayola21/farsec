<title>Issue 7899 -   chromium -    Clicks in scrolled textareas don't go to the correct place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using 2.0.165.0 (Developer Build 10111) and clicks in text fields   sometimes take me to the wrong place.    To repro  go to someplace with a text field  for example:    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>    Type a bunch of blank lines at the top so the text is pushed down and a   scrollbar appears. Scroll to the bottom. Now click after the end of the   next to the last line. You would normally expect the cursor to go to the   end of that line  instead it goes to the end of the document. </pre>
