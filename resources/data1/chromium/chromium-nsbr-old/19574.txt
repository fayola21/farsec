<title>Issue 19574 -   chromium -    Language for GTK dialogs set by LANGUAGE  not LANG - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install all English and Spanish language packs on a Hardy machine.  2. Run Chromium with:   a. LANG=es_ES.UTF-8   b. LANGUAGE=es   c. LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=es  3. Press ctrl + o.  3. We get:   a. Spanish Chromium dialogs only.   b. Spanish GTK dialogs only.   c. Both Chromium and GTK dialogs in Spanish.    Is this the expected behavior? Or should LANG control the GTK dialogs as well? </pre>
