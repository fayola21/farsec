Click on new to compose email    What is the expected output?   The compose field to accept text in it.    What do you see instead?  Doesn't accept any text(same as hotmail  <a title="Cannot compose email in Hotmail (requires spoofing as Safari's UserAgent string)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4111"> Issue 4111 </a>). The classic yahoo   mail works fine though.    The new UA string doesn't seem to work. It doesn't give an option to use   New Yahoo mail.  If FF UA string is used  it works fine.
