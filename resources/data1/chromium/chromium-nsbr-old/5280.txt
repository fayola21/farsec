<title>Issue 5280 -   chromium -    Bad font for accented chars in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.cz/search?">http://www.google.cz/search?</a>  rlz=1C1GGLS_csCZ300&amp;aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=merunka+um��__n��__+n��_��_vrhu                1. enter &quot;merunka um��__n��__ n��_��_vrhu&quot; into omnibox  2. hit Enter        URL should be shown in uniform font.      The chars following &quot;��__&quot; (e with caron) are shown using different font.    Platform: Windows XP professional  English  This is probably caused by the font used. The same happened in MS Office    (e.g. in PowerPoint presentations) and in other situations.  I think solution could be to use different font which doesn't suffer from   this problem. </pre>
