Downloading starts immediately          Can you please add a download prompt when a user clicks a link and try to   download something. at present  once I click a download link  downloading   starts immediately.It would be nice if you add a prompt to ask a user that   do you want to download it  sometimes  I might not want to download it.  I think Firefox provides a better solution  if you use firefox and   reproduce the procedure as I stated above  you can see what you can get.        Downloading starts immediately once you click on download link   </pre>
