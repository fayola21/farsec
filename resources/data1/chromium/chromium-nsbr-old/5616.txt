<title>Issue 5616 -   chromium -    no close all tab confirmation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes by accident I click the close button of the chrome window and I   have many tab open. Then chrome close all the tabs without any   confirmation.   Please put a confirmation box when close button of windows is pressed   instead of tab.  IE and FF both have it.   </pre>
