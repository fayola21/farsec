<title>Issue 9683 -   chromium -    Chrome hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0  URLs (if applicable) :<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?">https://mail.google.com/mail/?</a>  zx=1jy2l9yp15w0e&amp;shva=1#inbox/1206a6354d56523c            Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK                          From few days I have noticed that chrome browser hang very frequently when   same pages opened very smoothly in other browser. Some time when I click   the backward button in Google chrome it is not respond instantly. After 30   second and some time after a minute it would respond. Chrome is not always   responding well with PDF document. Most of the time it is hang and only   after reload it open the PDF document with the acrobat reader. I think   this information will help you make the Google chrome better. I am using   Windows XP sp3 with 1.5 GHz Intel p4 &amp; 256MB of RAM machine.    </pre>
