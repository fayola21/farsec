<title>Issue 19288 -   chromium -    Recent Activities on New Tab page should have an easier means of clearing it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.6 (Official Build 22526)      1. Do Stuff... preferably something that you would regret other people   would see.  2. Create a new tab  3. Display shame for all!      It would be nice to have a clear option in the now wasted right hand side   of the Recent activities box title bar.    They made it easier to delete most frequently visited pages  but your   recent activity requires much more work.  I didn't actually see the View   Full History &gt;&gt; link and thus didn't know how to quickly clear this list if   I wanted to. </pre>
