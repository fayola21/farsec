<title>Issue 9891 -   chromium -    Resource interpreted as other but transferred with MIME type text/plain. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Create a simple file  for example containing string &quot;&lt;P&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/P&gt;&quot; and    set its content-type to &quot;text/plain&quot;   2. Load this page via AJAX      No warnings. After all it's a valid text file: it contains only printable   characters. On the other hand it would be incorrect to set MIME type of   this file to &quot;text/html&quot; since it is not a valid HTML file (since it   doesn't have &lt;!doctype&gt; declaration  nor &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt;   sections).      Chrome Inspector generates a warning &quot;Resource interpreted as other but   transferred with MIME type text/plain.&quot;     </pre>
