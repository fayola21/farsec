<title>Issue 1975 -   chromium -    Lazy-load of E*Trade Main Customer Page Fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://us.etrade.com/e/t/accounts/accountscombo">https://us.etrade.com/e/t/accounts/accountscombo</a>             Safari 3: OK       Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    What steps will reproduce the problem (see Reduced Test Case  below  for an   alternative that does not require a customer log-in)?    Please Note: After September 11th  the problem will have been worked-around   on etrade.com and the Reduced Test Case  listed below  must be used to see   the problem.  The work-around is to serve the page in a conventional (not   lazy-loaded) format to the user.  More detail on that is available below.      1. Go to <a href="https://www.etrade.com">https://www.etrade.com</a>    2. Log in successfully as a user with accounts to transfer funds to and   from.    3. Wait for the page to load.    4. Confirm that the page initially looks like the attached screenshot    &quot;lazy-load_on_chrome.jpg&quot;.      5. If not  the page has been patched to load in non-lazy-load mode so you   must skip to the Reduced Test Case  below  in order to see the problem.    See the attached screenshot  'inline_js_not_installed.jpg' and then skip to   the Reduced Test Case  below.    6. If so  continue with these steps.    7. Notice that the &quot;To:&quot; select box under &quot;Quick Transfer&quot; is disabled.    8. Once the page loads  select a &quot;From:&quot; account under &quot;Quick Transfer&quot;           The &quot;To:&quot; select box under &quot;Quick Transfer&quot; should instantly and   dynamically become enabled.           The &quot;To:&quot; select box under &quot;Quick Transfer&quot; stays disabled.    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.     Please see the attached screenshot of the problem showing in Chrome: 'inline_js_not_installed.jpg'    The reason that the &quot;To:&quot; select box remains disabled is that the desired   functionality depends on inline JavaScript scripts that have not been   recognized as active JavaScript code by the currently-running JavaScript   context.      * * * Reduced Test Case * * *       The Reduced Test Case includes complete source code  for easy debugging.      These steps will reproduce the problem in the reduced test case:        1. Go to   <a href="https://www.etrade.com/javascript/et1/dev_tools/test/harness/lazy_loader_in">https://www.etrade.com/javascript/et1/dev_tools/test/harness/lazy_loader_in</a>  line_script/index-src.html      2. Follow the JavaScript 'alert' prompts.      3. Wait for the &quot;Test Succeeded&quot; 'alert' prompt.              The &quot;Test Succeeded&quot; 'alert' prompt should show.              The &quot;Test Succeeded&quot; 'alert' prompt does not show.     Other browsers tested with the reduced test case:          Safari 3: OK       Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK     Additional Information about the Reduced Test Case:  The test case shows   Chrome failing on a segment of the lazy-loading operation that is done on   the main customer etrade.com page that is not working in Chrome.  That   segment takes inline JavaScript from xml-http 'responseText' that has been   written to the page via an 'innerHTML' write and installs it so that it is   active code in the current JavaScript context.  While extensive inline   scripts represent an anti-pattern in terms of software engineering   practice  they are a legacy-code reality on the Web and with all major   websites.  Major websites desire to deliver a premium experience to their   users.  Therefore they would like to break the loading of their pages down    where possible  into components.  This is called &quot;lazy-loading&quot; and brings   many benefits  including allowing the user to begin interacting with the   page immediately  scalability  and resiliency under heavy load.         </pre>
