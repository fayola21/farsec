<title>Issue 20160 -   chromium -    Options dialog is almost inaccessible without a mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Offizieller Build 23673)        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Currently a user without a mouse can't (easily) access all exposed options:    * The individual checkboxes  textboxes  etc. don't have accesskeys so that   one could directly jump to a specific setting (instead you'll have to keep   hitting the Tab key until you're there).    * There doesn't seem to be a way to scroll through the &quot;Under the hood&quot;   options (tabbing just makes the focus disappear but doesn't scroll).   </pre>
