<title>Issue 8073 -   chromium -    Need process singleton implementation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ProcessSingleton is responsible for keeping one Chromium instance running   at a time.  (This is necessary because the various data files we use do not   support concurrent modifications.)    There's a stub implementation for Linux  but currently it just aborts if   you're already running another instance of Chromium  rather than sending a   message to the already-running process telling it to bring up another   window.    See process_singleton_linux.cc. </pre>
