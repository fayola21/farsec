<title>Issue 15519 -   chromium -    a:hover style is not applied or cleared when scrolling the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.1 (Official Build 19007)    <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/165639/what_to_expect_from_google_chrome_ext">http://www.pcworld.com/article/165639/what_to_expect_from_google_chrome_ext</a>  ensions.html           Safari 4: Couldn't test because it didn't react to scrolling by   touchpad.    Firefox 3.x: Clears the hover style when scrolling out of the link but   doesn't always applies it when scrolling in.           IE 7: Almost good  but there is some delay before applying or   clearing the hover style.        Opera 9: Same as IE7.      1. Open the PC World article or the attached test page.  2. Move the mouse above the link.  3. Scroll down the page without moving the mouse.        The background of the link should turn red when the mouse is over it and   should be cleared when the not.        The background color doesn't change.   </pre>
