<title>Issue 12508 -   chromium -    Need ScopedNSDisableScreenUpdates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> like we have base::ScopedNSAutoreleasePool  we also need  base::ScopedNSDisableScreenUpdates to prevent anyone from disabling w/out  re-enabling.    Should be trivial to write. The tab dragging and BWC could use this once it  is. Just search for uses in the code. </pre>
