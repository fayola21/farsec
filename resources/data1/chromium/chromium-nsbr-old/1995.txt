<title>Issue 1995 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't detect when the Vista changes theme to/from Aero - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29                     IE 7: OK      You need a Windows Vista machine that supports Aero theme.    1. Open a chrome browser.  2. Open Vista Theme personalization  3. Switch from Windows Classic to Windows Vista theme or viceversa.    Another way to repro this is to open an Aero Window  and then connect to   the session using Remote Desktop (RDP).        The window should change the theme with Windows. Because Chrome title bar   is custom this doesn't work.        See attached pictures      You might need to capture the WM_THEMECHANGED or WM_STYLECHANGED windows   message to fix this problem.     </pre>
