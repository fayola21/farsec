<title>Issue 9606 -   chromium -    Find in page dialog accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit CTRL + F to bring up the Find in page dialog  2. Use a tool like Inspect32 to see the MSAA information exposed.        Issues:  1. Edit box reported as MSAA role client  which is the default role  when none is provided by the   programmer. Expected behavior: get_accRole should return ROLE_SYSTEM_TEXT.  2. The form field has no label programmatically connected to it. Expected behavior: get_accName   for the form field will return the label string.  3. The string value contained in the field is reported as the name  not the value. Expected   behavior: get_accValue will return the string currently contained in the field.     </pre>
