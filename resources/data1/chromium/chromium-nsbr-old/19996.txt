<title>Issue 19996 -   chromium -    implement more aggressive use of exponential backoff in sync clients - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently re-zero several error counters (transient_error_commits and   consecutive_errors) in the syncapi if at least one entry in a commit batch   succeeded.  Also  we do not currently consider transient_errors as reason   enough for exponential backoff.  While in true form a transient error is   something that should dissolve with a retry  we have had cases where this was   not true due to bugs in either the client or server.  This caused clients to   successively try to recommit entries that would deterministically fail with   TRANSIENT_ERROR returned from sync servers.    This bug is about improving these heuristics and backing off if a client sees    repetitive failures.
