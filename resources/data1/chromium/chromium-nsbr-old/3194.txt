<title>Issue 3194 -   chromium -    &quot;Proceed Anyway&quot; takes to previous page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to any webpage (Eg: google.com)  2. Navigate to <a href="http://www.china-highway.com">http://www.china-highway.com</a> and click on &quot;Proceed Anyway&quot;   button.    What is the expected output?   Should navigate to <a href="http://www.china-highway.com">http://www.china-highway.com</a> webpage.    What do you see instead?  User is navigated back to previous page ( in this case google page)  but   the URL in the Omnibox still contains &quot;<a href="http://www.china-highway.com">http://www.china-highway.com</a>&quot; only.
