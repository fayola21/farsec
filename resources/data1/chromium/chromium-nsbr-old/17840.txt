Download multiple files  (at least 10) so that one of the downloaded files buttons and the   &quot;Show all downloads' link overlap.  2. Try closing the download shelf or clicking on the Show all donwloads link.      Expected:  We should be able to close the download shelf and access the &quot;Show all downloads&quot; links.    Actual:  The downloaded files button would eclipse the &quot;Show all downloads&quot; link and the close button of   the downloads shelf and these two become inaccessible.      On windows the downloaded files buttons would disappear if they are touching &quot;Show all   downloads&quot; link.     </pre>
