<title>Issue 18261 -   chromium -    Redesign WebDropData class - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From &lt;<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/160083&gt;:">http://codereview.chromium.org/160083&gt;:</a>    TODO #3 (in some other patch): We really should make WebDropData cheaper to copy around and   retain. I'm not convinced it's a good idea to push out the entire thing over IPC  especially since the   data pushed could be very big and may not even be used.    [I'll further point out that the data pushed through on WebDropData can be arbitrarily large. Could   this ever kill the browser? Hmmm. It's also bad to have duplicate copies of large pieces of data    especially if the browser ever runs on a small  e.g.  iPhone-like  platform. This will also get worse   when drag-images are generated  since they should also be pushed from the renderer to the   browser.] </pre>
