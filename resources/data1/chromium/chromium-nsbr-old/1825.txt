<title>Issue 1825 -   chromium -    Incorrect default download path on Windows Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27    It seems that the default download location is incorrectly determined on   Windows Vista. In my case  I have moved my stuff from C:Users&lt;userName&gt;   to X:  so the download path should have been X:Downloads instead of   C:Users&lt;userName&gt;Downloads. Using FOLDERID_Downloads on Vista to   determine the download path  if none is explicitly set  should help. </pre>
