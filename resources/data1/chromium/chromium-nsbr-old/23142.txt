<title>Issue 23142 -   chromium -    add as simple  per-user  per-page way to disable Chrome Frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  if a page requests rendering in GCF and the plugin is installed    there's no way for a user to opt-out of GCF rendering. A right-click menu   item (or similar) should provide the ability to refresh the page without GCF   rendering.   </pre>
