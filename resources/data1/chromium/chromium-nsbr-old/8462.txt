<title>Issue 8462 -   chromium -    Confirm that stats counters work when stats memory is corrupted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's been suggested in <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/40012">http://codereview.chromium.org/40012</a> that there's a   scenario on Mac where the stats data can be corrupted on a crash  leaving   the app unable to start up. The previous fix for this broke renderer stats.   The new fix reenabled them. It's possible that the Mac situation is still   broken  but unlikely. The new name of the shmem file now contains the pid.   There is a chance that another instance of Chrome will run with the same   pid as an old one which had crashed and then we would incorrectly use that   segment. Perhaps we could add some code to the mac shmem system to always   clean out any remaining shmem files from prior runs upon startup.  </pre>
