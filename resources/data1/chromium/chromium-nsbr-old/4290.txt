<title>Issue 4290 -   chromium -    Have to click at a mispelled word when spell checker language is changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   0. Set chrome's spell checker's language in English (United States)  1. Type some text in British English i.e. localise and see its red-  underline  2. Change the language to English (United Kingdom)  3. The red underline on the word does not disappear until you click on the   word.        Ideally  the red underline should disappear without any further clicks or   manual intervention from the user as soon as the spell checker's language   is changed.      You have to manually click on the words with red-underline to make the   underline disappear under the new spell checker's language- not ideal if   you have a lot of words to correct.
