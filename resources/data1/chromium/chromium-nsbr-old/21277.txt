<title>Issue 21277 -   chromium -    interactive_ui_tests failing due to WebKit merge 48098:48155 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A bunch of devtools-related tests started failing with this WebKit deps roll.    Would you mind taking a look and letting me know what you think?  I'm   disabling the tests in the meantime  as my tentative diagnosis is that   something broke upstream. </pre>
