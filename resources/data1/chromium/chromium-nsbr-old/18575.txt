<title>Issue 18575 -   chromium -    WPAD (proxy autodetect discovery) does not test DHCP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium's implementation of WPAD is fairly limited  and only tests DNS for   &quot;wpad&quot;.    Really  DHCP should be tried first (by sending an INFORM message for option   252).    Internet Explorer does this.    Chromium and Firefox however do not support it.    This bug isn't too severe  in that users can workaround it by manually   entering the network's PAC location (whatever would have been returned by   the 252) as a custom URL in the proxy settings.    But it is surely an inconvenience for setups relying on it. </pre>
