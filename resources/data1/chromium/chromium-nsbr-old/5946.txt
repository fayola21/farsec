<title>Issue 5946 -   chromium -    nana10.co.il: column labels displayed on top of text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.nana10.co.il/">http://www.nana10.co.il/</a>    Other browsers:  FF3 OK    Bug Description:  The yellow &quot;_��__��__��__��_ 10&quot; and &quot;_��____��__��__��_ _��_-nana10&quot; labels wrap over two lines and  are displayed on top of the columns.    Discussion:  The problem is that the labels are slightly larger in WebKit than they are  in FF &amp; IE and so the line wraps.    The fix is very simple  simlpy add  white-space: nowrap;    To the IngHdrTxt css rule used for these labels  this causes the text not  to wrap and the labels are displayed correctly. </pre>
