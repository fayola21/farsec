<title>Issue 2215 -   chromium -    event.metaKey returns true when ALT is pressed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When attaching to a DOM event (like keydown)  the &quot;event.metaKey&quot; property  returns &quot;true&quot; if the ALT key is pressed (as well as &quot;event.altKey&quot;). It  should return &quot;false&quot;.    I'm attaching a page that can be used to test it. It is enough to press the  ALT key there to see the results.
