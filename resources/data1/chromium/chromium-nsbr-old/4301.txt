<title>Issue 4301 -   chromium -    Split unit_tests.exe into multiple static libs + one executable project - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reduce the link time by splitting unit_tests into smaller and static   libraries. More logical separation of browser/common/plugin/renderer unit   tests. Would still link into one big executable since browser still depends   on renderer. :/    Need to sync with scons &amp; xcode.    Proposed: postpone after 1.0 so it doesn't make merging into official   harder? </pre>
