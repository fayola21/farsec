Save the following as test.html  &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;test.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;img src=&quot;image.jsp&quot;&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2.

Put this file in   the same directory with test.html    3. Browse test.html        It is expected that the image file is called once thus incrementing the   counter or outputting to system console once.        The image file is called twice thus incrementing the counter or outputting   to system console twice.     <b>Please provide
