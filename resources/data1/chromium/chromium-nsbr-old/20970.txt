<title>Issue 20970 -   chromium -    Basehref bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39    In the source code of my webpage I included a basehref meta tag  so that   the template images load from the correct directory.    For example the basehref is 'www.website.com/templates/default/'    But If I have an &lt;img&gt; tag with the source 'images/picture.png' (for   example) the picture is loaded out of the 'www.website.com/templates/default/images/picture.png' directory (the   basehref and the img src are combined)     But if you use 'view source' the source of an image tag is a hyperlink   which does not include the basehref if you click on it.    (The picture is loaded from 'www.website.com/templates/default/images/picture.png  and the hyperlink   goes to 'www.website.com/images/picture.png' - no basehref included)   </pre>
