<title>Issue 13095 -   chromium -    Copied text contains spurious ��_��_ characters when pasted into URL bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.4    Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1.  Open any web page.  2. Triple click a line of text to select it.  3. Copy.  4. Click the URL bar.  5. Paste.        The selected text is pasted.        The selected text is pasted with ��_��_ at the end of the line and sometimes in other places as well.    For example  when copying the first result from a Google search for aardvark  we get:    However  the��_��_ aardvark��_��_ is not closely related to the pig; rather  it is the sole recent   representative of the obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata ��_��_ ...    Note that the copied text is fine and does NOT contain spurious characters when pasted into   other applications.     </pre>
