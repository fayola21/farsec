<title>Issue 21074 -   chromium -    hung renderer dialog should dismiss with &quot;wait&quot; for enter or esc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From checking with Ben: the Hung Renderer dialog should default to &quot;wait&quot; if   the user hits &quot;enter&quot;  likewise  if they hit Esc  it should also pick &quot;wait&quot; since   'kill' is destructive.  </pre>
