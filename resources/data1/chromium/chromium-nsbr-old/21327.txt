<title>Issue 21327 -   chromium -    History file size explodes (6G or so in couple of days) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. No idea - use Chrome for a while?          Not-giant file (250M total I thought?)      I have no idea how this happens  but over the last couple of weeks Chrome   ate all my free space (12 G worth)  down till vista reported 16K free.    Freed up some space and tracked two files to be the culprit -     History &amp; History Index 2009-09.    Referencing <a title="User Data Grows Too Large (~2GB)"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16705">Issue 16705</a>: I tried to run VACUUM  and it has been running for   the last half hour.    Other notes - I frequently find Chrome processes left over from old   browsing sessions.  Starting chrome takes around 600M of my resources and kills my comp.    This all seemed to start fairly recently and suddenly - I suddenly noticed   that my last 12 or so gigs of disk space were gone.    NOTE - Thumbnails is ~200M too - is that normal?    <b>Please provide
