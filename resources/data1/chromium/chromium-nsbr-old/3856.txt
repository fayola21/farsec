<title>Issue 3856 -   chromium -    Evictions: More dlls causing crashes in the field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Crash #1: http://go/crash/reportdetail?  reportid=85f1b075e5ba98f6&amp;product=Chrome&amp;version=0.3.154.9&amp;signature=-6A4E    Renderer crash in:  acpiz.dll    Please do more research on this DLL. My cursory search turned this up as a   potential trojan  but I was myopically looking for an excuse to blame this   DLL. If it's actually a valid product DLL  I can follow up with the   company.    Assigning to Ricardo so CPU can focus on his other 1.0 project. </pre>
