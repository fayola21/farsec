<title>Issue 7893 -   chromium -    incognito feature makes chrome forget what tabs were open last time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;    chrome has two features..... one is the incognito window  the other feature is to remember the tabs which were open last time when u   restart the browser  these two features work  independently  but if I open an incognito window and close my regular window with all the   tabs.... and after that I close the incognito window... next time when I   restart chrome it forgets what tabs were open in the regular window  so basically whenever the regular window is closed chrome should make a   record of the tabs that are being closed... rather than making a record   only when chrome is being shut down.... </pre>
