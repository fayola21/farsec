<title>Issue 4652 -   chromium -    Opening (Chromium) Task Manager causes system menu to no longer have other programs' extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I use the nVidia nView desktop software  which adds a system menu item   called &quot;nView Options&quot;.  Post-magic-browzR  Chromium's system menu shows   this item like other Windows apps do.  Hooray!    Unfortunately  if I trigger the Chromium task manager via shift-esc  then   until I restart the browser  the system menu no longer has that item.    Instead it looks like the old  pre-magic-browzR system menu: the Windows   standard one + &quot;Task Manager&quot;. </pre>
