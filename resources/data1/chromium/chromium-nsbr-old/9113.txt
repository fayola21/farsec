<title>Issue 9113 -   chromium -    Ebay.com: Clicking on 'Choose more ...' second time hangs the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to ebay.com and search for an item  2. In Preferences section on the left  click on Choose more... under Buying   formats. Check an option and click on Go  3. In the same Preferences section  click on Choose more... under Show   only.     What is the expected output?   A div element should be seen to choose from the options    What do you see instead?  The renderer hangs and doesn't respond until the tab is reloaded. Looks   like the request sent by the user is stuck somewhere    This looks like a javascript issue    IE7/FF3: ok  Chrome1.0.154.48/Chrome2.0.169.0:not ok  Safari4 is being served some other html source </pre>
