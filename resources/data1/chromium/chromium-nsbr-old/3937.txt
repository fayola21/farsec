<title>Issue 3937 -   chromium -    &quot;Did(Start|Stop)Loading called while (not ) loading&quot; errors encountered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we fix run_webkit_tests to append stderr to the test output  ~170   layout tests start failing  of which ~165 are because of &quot;DidStartLoading   called while loading&quot; or &quot;DidStopLoading called while not loading&quot;.    I'm going to change those two messages from LOG to DLOG in   test_webview_delegate.cc so we can continue to notice regressions in those   tests  then add the tests to tests_fixable.txt anyway so we can track them   along with other broken tests.   </pre>
