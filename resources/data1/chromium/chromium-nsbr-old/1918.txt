<title>Issue 1918 -   chromium -    XPathEvaluator wrongly selects all nodes when given the query //*[1] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29           Safari 3: -      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Create an XML document object (e.g. using a DOMParser object's   parseFromString method). Give the XML document a structure something like:     &lt;AAA&gt;     &lt;BBB/&gt;     &lt;CCC/&gt;     &lt;DDD/&gt;     &lt;EEE&gt;        &lt;FFF/&gt;        &lt;GGG/&gt;     &lt;/EEE&gt;   &lt;/AAA&gt;    2. Instantiate an XPathEvaluator object and use it to query the document   element with the query: //*[1]  3. Inspect the set of nodes returned from this query.           //*[1] should return a set of nodes  each of which is the first in the   local set of sibling-nodes. With the example above the expected set of   nodes would be: [AAA  BBB  FFF]           Chrome's evaluator returns every element in the document  i.e. [AAA    BBB  CCC  DDD  EEE  FFF  GGG]     </pre>
