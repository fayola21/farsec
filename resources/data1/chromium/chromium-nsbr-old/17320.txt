<title>Issue 17320 -   chromium -    Mouse hover on the extension does display the name strip outside Chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install any extension. It will be easier with Buildbot extension  2. Make the Chrome window small enough so that the whole name cannot fit in   the window  3. Hover mouse on the extension    What is the expected output?   The strip should be rendered inside Chrome window I guess and it shouldn't   be displayed outside the window.    What do you see instead?  Name strip is displayed outside Chrome window.     Please see the attached image. </pre>
