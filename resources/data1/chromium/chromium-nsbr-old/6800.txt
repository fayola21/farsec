<title>Issue 6800 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't set Content-Type for file upload when the file extension is not recognized. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Write a simple file upload form like this one:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;file_upload&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;thefile&quot;&gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2. Open the test page in chrome  3. choose a file with a weird extension. In my case the extension was   &quot;.aes&quot;. Submit the form.  4. Use some tool to monitor the http request and you will notice that   Content-Type is not set for thefile. (In my case I wrote a webwork-based   web application as the server and dumped the request there.)    For the same test  Firefox 3 uses &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; as the Contet-  Type for the file and IE7 uses &quot;application/x-zip-compressed&quot;    5. Re-do the test with a well-known file extension  such as &quot;.xml&quot;. Chrome   properly detected the content type as &quot;text/xml&quot; and set the field in the   request.        There should be a Content-Type assigned to the uploaded file. Even if the   file extension is not recognized  a default value such as   &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; might be good enough  like what Firefox does.        The Content-Type field for the uploaded file is missing.       </pre>
