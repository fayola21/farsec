<title>Issue 12836 -   chromium -    Go button mouse over display the wrong message sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chromium  2. Hover the mouse over the go button        It should say &quot;go to about:linux&quot; but says &quot;stop loading this page instead&quot;    See attached video      It's also sometimes inconsistent when typing into the location bar  but  it's a bit harder to reproduce. An example would be if one typed &quot;face&quot;  into the location bar  the choices that pop up are:    &quot;Search google for face&quot;  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>    If I use the down arrow key to select the second entry  sometimes if I  hover the mouse over the go button  it would still say &quot;go to face&quot; instead  of &quot;go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>&quot;.   </pre>
