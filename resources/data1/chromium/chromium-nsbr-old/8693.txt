<title>Issue 8693 -   chromium -    Bug and dev-proposal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hey guys!    Please integrate a &quot;bug-button&quot; like Apple Safari does   it makes the things a lot easier to report.    Chrome 2.x crashed too much on my computer that it is   too complicated everytime to &quot;make a report&quot; like now.    And please integrate somewhere a proposal-channel or something  like this to get more involved like Firefox-Labs do.    My proposal: In my optinion really nice killer-app:  Since Apple adopt in Safari their cover-flow effect in their  bookmarking strip  what about a Google adoption? (sorry  I��m german)  from Google Earth View in Chrome-Bookmarks... something like a 3D-View with   little screenshots of my most favorite bookmarks (or every folder of it) on   it. If I am clicking on once of these screenshots  my page is going to load   in a new tab. It is much more intuitive than a 2D cover-flow and much more   flexible...    Feel free to send me an answer or feedback      Greetings from Germany     Patrick        </pre>
