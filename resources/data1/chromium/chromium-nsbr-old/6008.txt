<title>Issue 6008 -   chromium -    Chromium continuous builds do not sort chronologically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Goto:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/</a>  2. The directory names currently use MM-DD-YYYY format.    Directory names in this format do not allow the directory listing to sort   chronologically at the same time.  It requires extra scrolling and   searching to find the directory with the latest build.  (And NO  the   directory named &quot;LATEST&quot; does NOT help because the ZIP file inside does not   contain the build number and you have no idea which build it is.)    This happens for both:     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/</a>     <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=N;O=D">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/?C=N;O=D</a>    The build directory names should use YYYY-MM-DD format  which will sort   both alphabetically (collating order) and &quot;chronologically&quot;. </pre>
