<title>Issue 22587 -   chromium -    Close tab button is on the wrong side on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0 (26747)  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Correct side  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Also the wrong side (but that's no excuse!)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: On the correct side for Windows  but the wrong side for OS X   (which makes sense  as it's not running on OS X)      1. Open Chromium  2. Look at the close tab button      The close tab button should be on the left of the tab. In OS X the close window button is on the   left  as is the close tab button in every application made by Apple (eg Safari  Terminal) or any   third-party app that is widely regarded as a proper &quot;Mac app&quot; (eg NetNewsWire  TextMate).       The close tab button is on the right  imitating the close window button on Windows.   </pre>
