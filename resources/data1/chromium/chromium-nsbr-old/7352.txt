<title>Issue 7352 -   chromium -    Chrome will not update to version 1.0.anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;2.0.159.0&gt;      1. Install public &quot;Out of Beta&quot; version of Chrome = 2.0.159.0  still...   2. Install Chromechannel 2.0  3. Select Developer Channel  4. Try to update Chrome to the current 1.0.x.x version  5. It won't update  presumably because it is a lower version number      Update to any Version 1.0.x.x      Nothing - won't update. Curse Chrome development team for boneheadery in  choosing version numbers.     </pre>
