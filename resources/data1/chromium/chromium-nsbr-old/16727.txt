<title>Issue 16727 -   chromium -    SYDP panel needs marketing text and URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When Chrome installs or is configured on first run  it does not set a URL or   text for itself in the &quot;set your default programs&quot; (SYDP) panel.    We should have some localized marketing text and a contact/more info URL   here  since it may help users make their program choices (and many other   programs have them.)  Ideally  this would be set on first run at the same   time as other settings. </pre>
