<title>Issue 5911 -   chromium -    Options getting lost after restarts  etc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Install Chrome (I have reinstalled several times in the hope that some   fixes have been introduced  but it doesn't seem to improve).    2. Set up array of five pages for start up - select these in 'options'  Expect... to see these pages on start up  What happens... I see these windows as expected - all OK  so SOME browser   setting persist after restart    3. Set up bookmarks bar  editing names  Expect... to see icons in bookmarks bar  What happens... I see no icons - ERROR (this is NOT a problem on desktop   machine)    3. Set up bookmarks bar  Expect... to see bookmarks on pages after restart  What happens... bookmarks all revert to default  all need resetting after   the machine is switched off and on.    4. Set up various password access log-ins  Expect... to passwords to be remembered after restart  What happens... none remembered    5. Set up Google as search for address bar.  Expect... to be able to use address bar for search  What happens... mostly doesn't work. I have managed to get it to use Google   for search 2-3 times  but then it's forgotten after restart.    Please provide
