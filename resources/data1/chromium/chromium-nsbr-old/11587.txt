<title>Issue 11587 -   chromium -    Pressing &quot;HOME &amp; END&quot; in RTL elements doesn't work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: '2.0.177.1'&gt;    Problem when type in any TEXTAREA or INpUT elements when it's the text-  direction is Right-To-Left (Like Hebrew).  When I start typing and press right CTRL+SHIFT for RTL  the HOME&amp;END   buttons doesn't work as expected.      Pressing &quot;HOME&quot; need to go before the first letter in the text line.  Pressing &quot;END&quot; need to go after the last letter in the text line.      I can't explain.         </pre>
