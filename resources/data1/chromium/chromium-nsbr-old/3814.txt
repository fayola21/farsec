<title>Issue 3814 -   chromium -    Regression: &quot;Always open files of this type&quot; is enabled for exe's during downloads progress - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.154.9 (Official Build 4058)  I believe this is broken with new download manager bar for exe's (?)       1. Download any exe file from www.download.com  2. Click on &quot;save&quot; button on Unconfirmed download bar.  3. While download is in progress  click on drow-down button on the download  self.    Notice the option &quot;Always open files of this type&quot; is enabled as long as  the download is in progress. Once the download is completed  the option is  auto disabled.    Works fine with Google Chrome live build: 149.30  I mean  this option is  never enabled in the download self's drop-down list. </pre>
