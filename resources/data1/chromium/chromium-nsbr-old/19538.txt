<title>Issue 19538 -   chromium -    Right clicking on the sync &quot;Start now&quot; link on the NNTP should not show &quot;Open link...&quot; options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run chrome with --enable-sync  2. Login into www.gmail.com  3. Open a New Tab Page    You should see a promotion at the bottom of the NNTP  with a link   containing the test &quot;Start now&quot;.    Expected behavior:    Right clicking on that link should not show the regular options for a link   (such as &quot;Open link in a new tab&quot;)  because this is not an actual link - it   is only used to launch the sync wizard when it is clicked.    Actual behavior:    The &quot;Open link in Xxx&quot; options do show up in the context menu.    The problem here is that we use an href. There are two ways to fix this:    1. Use two different elements  one with the link and one with the fake link   (and use the right one based on the message the backend sends to the NNTP).    2. Use a link but remove the href attribute instead of setting it to '#'.   In this case  we'll need to use the className &quot;link&quot;  the aria role and a   tabindex since an element without a href attribute is not a link and is not   keyboard focusable. </pre>
