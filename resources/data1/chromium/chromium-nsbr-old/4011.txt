<title>Issue 4011 -   chromium -    Be able to autocomplete against IDN hostnames - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b680129&gt;    When a user types an IDN in the autocomplete bar  we need to be able to do  a prefix search in history for that value. We should therefore store the  unicode version of the IDN in history so we can do these queries. Coming  out of history  we can then compute the canonical punycode domain name for  in-memory use.     </pre>
