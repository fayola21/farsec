<title>Issue 21899 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Application shortcuts work poorly on Windows 7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an application shortcut for GMail and Google Calendar.   2. When you run each application shortcut a low resolution icon is  displayed on the Windows 7 taskbar. In the previous stable build it was a  much higher resolution icon.   3. Right-click and pin the application shortcuts to your Windows 7 taskbar.  They change icons to the default Google Chrome icon and rename themselves  to &quot;Google Chrome (2)&quot; and &quot;Google Chrome (3)  etc.. if you already have a  Google Chrome application shortcut on your taskbar.       Expected high resolution icons for GMail  Calendar (and any other Google  web products) to be displayed and pinned properly to the Windows 7 taskbar.   They should act like individual applications and fully support the Windows  7 taskbar functionality.            <b>Please provide
