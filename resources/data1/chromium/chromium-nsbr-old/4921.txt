<title>Issue 4921 -   chromium -    Euro-chrome! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have on several occasions had Chrome responding as if I was accessing   from Europe or SPain.  On one occasion  Google.com defaulted to the german   web site and came up in German.  On another occasion  it defaulted to   google.com.es and came up in Spanish.  Tonight I tried to play a video on   YouTube that I have flagged as a favorite and i was told that I was not   allowed to access it from my country.  I also use Firefox and have had no   problems there </pre>
