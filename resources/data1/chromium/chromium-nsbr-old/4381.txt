<title>Issue 4381 -   chromium -    chrome.exe --incognito does not load properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : dev 0.3.154.18 and the previous dev version        chrome.exe runs fine    chrome.exe --incognito does not  it says running in the background  according to taskman  but it doesnt pop the window up.  I have to force it  to close manually.     Running this maybe 1/10 times results in it opening up properly  something  which surprised me.  Opening up regular chrome after forcing down  chrome.exe --incognito results in regular chrome opening fine  but with a  &quot;it messed up last time  restore tabs?&quot; message.   </pre>
