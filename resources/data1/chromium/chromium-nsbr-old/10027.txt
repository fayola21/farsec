<title>Issue 10027 -   chromium -    Manually add exceptions to password manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Save password for a site (eg. www.smth.com)  2. Open a form on the site that has user/password fields not related to the   site login  3. Chrome replaces the fields (user and pass) with saved credentials.  4. Now if I submit the form not even changing the user/pass fields  my data   (user/pass fields) on the form is changed and faulty :S    Solution:  Add an option to add sites to the password manager exceptions manually </pre>
