Drag a tab off the main window  to create a separate window  and   release.  2. Drag the tab from the separate window (with one tab) onto the main   window.  3. Don't release above drag until it is the farthest right tab in tab list.  4. Watch NOTREACHED assertion fire in:    void TabStrip::DestroyDraggedSourceTab(Tab* tab) {    // We could be running an animation that references this Tab.    if (active_animation_.get())      active_animation_-&gt;Stop();    // Make sure we leave the tab_data_ vector in a consistent state    otherwise    // we'll be pointing to tabs that have been deleted and removed from the    // child view list.    std::vector&lt;TabData&gt;::iterator it = tab_data_.begin();    for (; it != tab_data_.end(); ++it) {      if (it-&gt;tab == tab) {        NOTREACHED() &lt;&lt; &quot;Leaving in an inconsistent state!&quot;;        tab_data_.erase(it);        break;      }    }    tab-&gt;GetParent()-&gt;RemoveChildView(tab);    delete tab;    // Force a layout here  because if we've just quickly drag detached a   Tab     // the stopping of the active animation above may have left the TabStrip   in a    // bad (visual) state.    Layout();  }        No  assertion.        Assertion fires.      Please provide
