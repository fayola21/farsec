<title>Issue 850 -   chromium -    Add &quot;find as you type&quot; feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: No      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: Yes    I would like to have the &quot;find as you type&quot; feature that exists in FireFox.   It is very neat to just start typing to find something in a page without   having to press ctrl+f.      1. Go to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/">http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/</a>  2. Enter &quot;enter&quot; without pressing ctrl+f        The first found text containing &quot;enter&quot; is selected      Nothing. I have to press Ctrl+f    More information on how Firefox handles it can be found at:   <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/">http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/</a>   </pre>
