<title>Issue 21453 -   chromium -    &quot;Type to search&quot; and &quot;Press [tab] to search&quot; in omnibar should not obscure text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get yourself a narrow window  2. Type a potentially incriminating phrase into the omnibar      Expect: the &quot;Type to search&quot; text should disappear when you've got enough   text in the omnibar to reach it.  Observe: the &quot;Type to search&quot; text obscures the juicy bits.    Alternately  start typing some text into the omnibar and then make the   window narrow.  That's what I've done to prepare this image.  What am I   trying to score?  You'll never know.    On Windows  the text will disappear when the omnibar gets too narrow for   the text it contains.  When &quot;Press [tab] to search&quot; is displayed  the text   disappears but the [tab] image remains  all the way over to the right.  (It   even remains when the omnibar is too narrow for the text with the [tab]   image present.  Is this intended?)    Mac Chrome should improve here  and do something like what Windows   Chrome does.      4.0.206.1 official release (206 branch <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25349">r25349</a>)  4.0.208.0 trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25632">r25632</a> </pre>
