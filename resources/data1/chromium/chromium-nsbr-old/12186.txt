<title>Issue 12186 -   chromium -    Shockwave Flash Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I am not sure how to reproduce this problem. It has happened several times and I think   it is Shockwave Flash that's doing it.     So  I think to reproduce it   1. make your Task-bar to Auto-hide.  2. go to a website with flash (I used screenshots from eveonline.com)  3. mess around with it enough  then notice that when you bring your cursor to the   bottom  the taskbar is behind Chrome (even though you have it set to be above all   windows).         The taskbar is set to be above all windows  but it is not above Chrome.         It is behind Chrome (And only Chrome).     <b>Please provide
