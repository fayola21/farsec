<title>Issue 4627 -   chromium -    0.4.154.23 update failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   The following happens when my chrome got updated this morning.  1. A chrome instance with default profile has been up and running for a while  2. Try launch another chrome with different profile  but chrome does not launch  3. Check my running chrome and found its version is 154.18  4. Close the running chrome. Try launch it (with default profile) and find  Chrome does not start.       This turns out to be an in use update problem. More info below.      Relevant registry values:  opv:0.4.154.22  pv: 0.4.154.23    Application directory:    09/18/2008  05:12 PM               411 0.2.152.bak  11/12/2008  11:14 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          0.4.154.18  11/19/2008  06:59 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          0.4.154.23  11/17/2008  10:13 AM           765 936 chrome.exe  11/17/2008  01:16 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Dictionaries  05/21/2008  03:13 PM                 0 First Run  11/18/2008  09:29 PM           765 936 new_chrome.exe    Install log:  [1119/185944:ERROR:delete_tree_work_item.cc(33)] can not delete  C:Documents and   SettingshuanrLocal SettingsApplication  DataGoogleChromeApplication0.4.15  4.18chrome.dll OR copy it to backup path  C:DOCUME~1huanrLOCALS~1Temp25738  chrome.dll    So the system is in inconsistent stage after update. Not sure whether it  has anything to do with multi profile.   </pre>
