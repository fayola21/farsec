<title>Issue 5130 -   chromium -    Form autofill should show the suggested vaules with arrow keys. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 0.5.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6362">r6362</a>)      1. Enable Form Autofill in Wrench menu/Options/Minor Tweaks tab.  2. Fill up any online form and submit the form.  3. Navigate to the same form and keep keyboard focus to any input field and  key down the arrow key.    What is the expected output?   Should list all the suggested values.    What do you see instead?  Nothing.    IE 7.x: Shows up the suggestions for Arrow key(Up/Down) and also for double  click on the text field.  FF3.x: Same as IE.  Safari 3.x: Shows up the suggestions for just Down Arrow Key.    I'm really missing this fantastic feature. Would be nice  if we can support  IE behavior.       </pre>
