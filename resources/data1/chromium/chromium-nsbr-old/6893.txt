<title>Issue 6893 -   chromium -    Support SSL renegotiation on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In ssl_client_socket_win.cc  function  SSLClientSocketWin::DoPayloadReadComplete  we have:      if (status == SEC_I_RENEGOTIATE) {      // TODO(wtc): support renegotiation.      // Should ideally send a no_renegotiation alert to the server.      return ERR_SSL_RENEGOTIATION_REQUESTED;    }    We should add the code to support SSL renegotiation. </pre>
