<title>Issue 7875 -   chromium -    Report a bug or broken website should include recent JS and HTML errors in the report. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often  site compat problems are the result of logged JS or HTML errors.    Seeing the specific JS or HTML error that the user ran into on the page   would help us to identify and classify errors that users are running into.    Sometimes  just visiting a site isn't enough to reproduce the error that   the user is running into  and the report won't include enough information   to reproduce at all.  Having the recent errors in the report would help in   these cases. </pre>
