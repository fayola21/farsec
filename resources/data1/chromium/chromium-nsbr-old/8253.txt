<title>Issue 8253 -   chromium -    Chrome stalls when accessing website with HTTP basic auth  freezes complete WIndows network stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK          Visit a website with HTTP basic authentication and lots (~90) of embedded  images.         The page is displayed after the user enters his credentials (or just  confirms the saved username and password).        The requested page is loaded (from what I can see in the webserver logs)   but then all transfers appear to stall  and all TCP connections on the  computer running Chrome are broken.    Logging the requests with the Fiddler tool indicates that all the images  are first requested without the authentication header  and only after the  server responds with a 401 error  the request is repeated with the proper  authentication header.     It appears to be a timing problem  because when fiddler is running the page  loads completely  also if Chrome is run in a VM. Apparently the large  number of responses during a short period of time causes Windows' TCP stack  to break down. </pre>
