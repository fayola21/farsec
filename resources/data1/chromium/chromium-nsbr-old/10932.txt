<title>Issue 10932 -   chromium -    Clicking in popup on Mac Omnibox doesn't seem to work right. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse to www.linux.org  then www.slashdot.org.  2. In the omnibox select-all.  3. Type 'linux'.  4. Click 'See 8 recent pages in history containing linux' (or whatever).        Instead of taking it to a page showing a search on my history  it takes me to whichever   autocomplete item was selected.     </pre>
