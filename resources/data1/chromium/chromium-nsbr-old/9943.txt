<title>Issue 9943 -   chromium -    webkit test failures from the webkit win gyp transition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like the tests are failing because of a missing string for text  inputs. Maybe GetLocalizedString is failing?    Here's a diff from one of the test failures:  &lt;         RenderButton {INPUT} at (366 22) size 172x22 [bgcolor=#C0C0C0]  [border: (2px outset #C0C0C0)]  &lt;           RenderBlock (anonymous) at (8 2) size 156x18  &lt;             RenderText at (3 1) size 150x16  &lt;               text run at (3 1) width 150: &quot;No string for this identifier!&quot;  ---  &gt;         RenderButton {INPUT} at (366 22) size 56x22 [bgcolor=#C0C0C0]  [border: (2px outset #C0C0C0)]  &gt;           RenderBlock (anonymous) at (8 2) size 40x18  &gt;             RenderText at (3 1) size 34x16  &gt;               text run at (3 1) width 34: &quot;Reset&quot;       </pre>
