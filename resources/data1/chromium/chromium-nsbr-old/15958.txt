<title>Issue 15958 -   chromium -    garbage charage when copy/pasting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 3.0.190.0      1. Load <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html</a>  2. Double click &quot;Google&quot; in &quot;Help with Google Search  Services and   Products...&quot; (Note the space after is selected also)  3. Hit Cmd-C to copy  4. Open a new tab  5. Hit Cmd-V to paste into the url bar        Expect url bar to contain &quot;Google &quot;  instead it contains &quot;Google��_��_&quot;    I'm not sure if the bug is on paste or copy.  I think it's probably copy   because if I paste into TextEdit  it also shows the same thing (but other   apps didn't show it).   </pre>
