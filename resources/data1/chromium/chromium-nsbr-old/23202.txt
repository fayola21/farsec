<title>Issue 23202 -   chromium -    Absolutely positioned element is not complied with W3C standard. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch the testcase file attached      The inner div is absolutely positioned div without left/top specified. So   according to W3C standard  its left should be at the place as same as   static positioned place.    W3C standard:   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width</a>    &quot;2. 'left' and 'right' are 'auto' and 'width' is not 'auto'  then if the   'direction' property of the element establishing the static-position   containing block is 'ltr' set 'left' to the static position  otherwise set   'right' to the static position. Then solve for 'left' (if 'direction is   'rtl') or 'right' (if 'direction' is 'ltr').&quot;      The inner div always align to left of the outer div  which is different   from the static flow. ( The first and third groups in testcase are   absolutely positioned while the second and fourth groups are static   positioned for comparing. )    <b>Please provide
