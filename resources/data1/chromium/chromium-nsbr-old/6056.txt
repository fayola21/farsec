<title>Issue 6056 -   chromium -    Improve enforcement of unit testing in gcl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a way to help contributors and reviewers remember to add unit tests    here's a proposal to have gcl report when they are (or might be) missing.    It's a very rough guess now  and will probably need some refinement as we   see what it misses and where its false positives are too annoying.    What changes might need tests?  * Any new source file (.cc  .cpp  .m  or .mm)  or  * Any new method added to a source or header (.h file    o A new method is identified by a flush-left non-comment line that has (   somewhere before the next flush-left line and either ends with { or has {   at the start of the next flush-left line.    What counts as a test?  * Any change to any code file whose name ends in test.* or tests.*    o This is very rough  but at least it shows that the contributor thought   about testing when making the patch    What do we do if we don't find a test?  * On 'gcl change'  report a warning to the user  * On 'gcl upload'  add a warning to the change description so the reviewer   sees it too    o Add an option to override this    Future possibilities  * Is it worth restricting the check to only public or protected methods?  * Since any &quot;real&quot; change ought to either fix a bug or add a feature that   should be tested  warn whenever there are no changes to any tests   (including layout tests) or a test_lists file  even when no source files or   methods were added.  Alas  this is probably not feasible since we don't   keep layout tests in the same repository  * Rather than adding a warning to the change description  it'd be nice to   have a separate warning in the review app  so it showed up no matter what   and the path author didn't have to override anything.  But since we want   the warning in client-side 'gcl change' anyway  for now we'll keep it   simple and trust people. </pre>
