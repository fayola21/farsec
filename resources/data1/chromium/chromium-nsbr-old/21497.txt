<title>Issue 21497 -   chromium -    Object and Array property handling is a mess; properties are returned in unpredictable order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an array or object with a number of elements  preferably numbers &gt; 1034 or mixed   number/string keys for objects  2. Loop over it with for(var i in object)      All tests are green.    Values are returned in the order  in which they were added. This is not needed for Arrays  but at   least for normal Objects. Having a predictable order also has a benefit for polymorphic inline   caching  because the address offset probably is probably different  if the values are stored in   different orders.    Otherwise  it causes overhead to store values in a certain order in JS. So this behavior makes a   lot of sense and is used in many existing applications.    The behavior of Objects and Arrays is the same in Chrome  and that's why I tested it this way    because there is just one base object class and the rest is implemented via JS afterwards. JSC is   different in this respect. I just wanted to make sure  the code I saw corresponds to the observed   behavior.      Chrome returns values in pseudo-random order and handles small ints differently than string   keys and large number keys &gt; 1034.    <b>Please provide
