<title>Issue 17595 -   chromium -    Test failure formatter script doesn't have any unit tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout test failure formatting script at   src/webkit/tools/layout_tests/test_output_formatter.py doesn't have any unit   tests covering the other scripts (failure_finder.py) it runs.    These scripts contain regular expressions that could potentially break.  We   should add unit tests for this. </pre>
