<title>Issue 6409 -   chromium -    scoped_bstr should be built only on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> scoped_bstr wraps BSTR  which is Windows-only.  We should only build  scoped_bstr.cc on Windows.  It should be put into the Windows-only section  of base/base_lib.scons and its unit test should be in the Windows-only  section of base/base_unittests.scons.    The file-wide #ifdef OS_WIN in each of scoped_bstr.cc  scoped_bstr.h  and  scoped_bstr_unittest.cc should be removed.    This is consistent with how we treat all other platform-specific files. </pre>
