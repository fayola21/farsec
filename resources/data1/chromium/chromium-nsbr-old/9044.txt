<title>Issue 9044 -   chromium -    Modify &quot;dangerous downloads&quot; prompt algorithm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now our &quot;dangerous file&quot; prompt is based on the filetype  which has   both false positive and occasional false negative issues.  Instead  I   propose (as I think Ian and I agreed before?) a solution based on   unprompted downloads.  Here an &quot;unprompted&quot; download is one not triggered   by a direct user action (e.g. button click).    Proposal:  * User-triggered downloads are saved without a prompt.  * Unprompted downloads are saved without a prompt iff:  ** This is the first such download since the user has done an explicit   navigation  AND  ** The filetype is not &quot;executable&quot;.  * Other unprompted downloads get some sort of notification (infobar?) about   &quot;this page wants to save xxx on your computer&quot; or something.    Pros:  * Attaches warnings more closely to cases where users would be surprised or   unaware of pages' actions (less crying wolf).  * Moves warning out of the download shelf area  where it's cramped and   awkward.    Cons:  * Allows social-engineering attacks where clicking an innocuous item   downloads an .exe that users can later run.    My belief is that the bullet in the &quot;cons&quot; section is not solvable with UI   that does not also train users to just click through warnings. </pre>
