<title>Issue 20849 -   chromium -    Sync notifications are not received when the email name contains upper case letters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run two instances of Chrome with --enable-sync and a different --user-  data-dir.  2. Enable sync on both instances (by going to &quot;Wrench menu&quot; -&gt; &quot;Sync my   bookmarks...&quot; using an email address containing upper case letters (e.g.   JohnSmith@gmail.com).  3. Create a few bookmarks on the first client and observe the second   client.        The expected result is that the bookmarks created on the first client   should appear on the second client within seconds. The actual result is   that the bookmarks don't appear until the second client adds/edits/delete a   bookmark.    If you visit about:sync on the second client you'll notice that   &quot;Notifications Received&quot; is 0  which is why the client didn't receive the   bookmarks. </pre>
