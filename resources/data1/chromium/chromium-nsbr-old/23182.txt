<title>Issue 23182 -   chromium -    Wrong translation of &quot;forward&quot; in contextual menu (czech) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Czech      Google Chrome	4.0.213.1 (Ofici��_��_ln��__ sestaven��__ 27053)  WebKit	532.1  V8	1.3.13.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.1   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.213.1 Safari/532.1      Linux Ubuntu 9.04 (I pretty much believe that I've seen the same   translation on Win XP as well).      In contextual menu (on the page) the word &quot;forward&quot; (as go forward in tab   browsing session history - opposite to &quot;back&quot;) is translated as &quot;p��_��_eposlat&quot;   which is wrong  because it is a verb and means &quot;to forward an e-mail&quot;.    The word &quot;vp��_��_ed&quot; shall be used instead. </pre>
