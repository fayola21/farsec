<title>Issue 21957 -   chromium -    Adobe Flash Player 10.0.32.18 + Google Chrome 3.0.195.21 = System lockup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UIj_VCRvR8&amp;hd=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UIj_VCRvR8&amp;hd=1</a> (any YouTube video   will work but this is what I used for 90% of the test)           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: Not Available on Windows 7           IE 8: OK           Opera 10: OK    Steps to reproduce:  1. Make sure to have Radeon HD 4xxx series card (I have the Radeon HD 4850) + Catalyst 9.x   drivers (I used the latest 9.9 but it also affects 9.8)  2. Use Google Chrome version 3.0.195.21  3. Go on YouTube or any video service  4. Stream any videos (but higher chances of reproduction with HD videos)      Actual Results: When the ATi driver tries to reset itself (could be induced by Flash Player in the   first place)  the Flash plugin within Google Chrome 3.x will cause the system to lockup while it   tries to recover. During recovery the system goes into an infinite loop trying to recover itself.   This issue doesn't occur with previous Adobe versions and Google Chrome 2.x. Problem so far   doesn't affect other browsers.         Expected Results: Shouldn't freeze if the ATi driver tries to recover itself and the recovery should   not take more than 20 seconds.         Workaround (if any): None known.            I already filed this bug report with Adobe under FP-2752. </pre>
