<title>Issue 17529 -   chromium -    'tab doesn't respond'-message should have an ignore function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Feature request]  Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.1  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    When a tab doesn't respond a message from chrome appears which asks me if I   would like to stop the not-responding tab.   On some moments  when my computer is very busy (high CPUusage/memory usage)   this message appears almost every minute.  For this reason I think chrome should have an option to ignore these   messages for the current session.  So if the message appears for the first time and you should check a   checkbox with 'Ignore this message during this session' you should not get   this message again  untill you closed and restarted chrome. </pre>
