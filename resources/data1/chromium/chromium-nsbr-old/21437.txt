<title>Issue 21437 -   chromium -    --show-extensions-on-top: toolstrips and bookmark items do not squish the same way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The animation between detached and non-detached looks funny when you compare   a bookmark item to a toolstrip. The toolstrip gets clipped from the bottom   and the bookmark item gets squeezed into the middle. We should do the same in   both cases. </pre>
