<title>Issue 11053 -   chromium -    DCHECK (size_ != new_size) in RenderWidget::OnResize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In ExtensionView  I'm manually calling SetSize() on our RenderWidget when   the bounds changes (<a title="HWNDView not getting its size set properly"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10835">bug 10835</a>).  This was leading to a couple of DCHECKs in   RenderWidget when one of the dimensions was 0.  The first was <a title="DCHECK(!paint_rect_.IsEmpty()); in RenderWidget::OnResize" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10992"> bug 10992 </a>.    The second is (size_ != new_size).  This doesn't look like I'm passing in   the same size to the view (I'm only calling it when my own size actually   changes  and RenderWidgetHost checks this too).  I was having some trouble   debugging this  so I'm filing this as a bug for now.    To repro: after I submit CL 96008  go to ExtensionView::DidChangeBounds and   comment out the IsEmpty() test  then run unit_tests.exe --  gtest_filter=ExtensionView*.     </pre>
