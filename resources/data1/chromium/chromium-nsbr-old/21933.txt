<title>Issue 21933 -   chromium -    Layout issue on NTP with extensions on top - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Chrome with --show-extensions-on-top  2. Open New Tab page  3. Observe the layout issue with the extension shelf.    I thought I had broken this with my theming changelist (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26228">r26228</a>)  but it turns   out this existed in the previous build (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26224">r26224</a>) which predated my theming   change. </pre>
