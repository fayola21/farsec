<title>Issue 11112 -   chromium -    Chaining tabs together - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I't would be nice to have a feature to connect tabs  you could chain tabs   together using a certain button combination  ctrl+shift for example. As   long as ctrl+shift is held tabs clicked that are next to each other are   chained together. Chained tabs act as one  no tabs can be opened in between   them  they move together  and must be closed together. To remove tabs from   a chain you would ctrl+shift click it  remove it if it's at the end of a   chain  or remove it and break the chain into separate pieces if it's in the   middle. This way an open linked tabs next to parent tab feature could be   added without the disoriented anchor tabs issue described in the &quot;Tabbed   Browsing in Chrome&quot; blog (<a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/tabbed-browsing-">http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/tabbed-browsing-</a>  in-google-chrome.html). I assume this must be hard to code as no browser   currently seems to implement it  and while not many people may ask for it   quite a few would probably use it if it was there.   </pre>
