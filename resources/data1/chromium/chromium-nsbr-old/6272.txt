<title>Issue 6272 -   chromium -    Omnibox: ctrl-shift-Enter should append .org - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1  URLs (if applicable) : www.opensuse.org            Firefox 3: OK        1. Enter the omnibox  2. Type opensuse  3. Press ctrl-shift-Enter      URL changes to www.opensuse.org      URL changes to www.opensuse.com    Besides .org  additional domain extensions would be nice  for example my   country's domain ( ctrl-alt-Enter gives .co.za ? )  This would probably   have to be configurable. </pre>
