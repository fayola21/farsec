<title>Issue 3717 -   chromium -    Setting chrome as default browser in preferences windows does not sets chrome as default browser completely in vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;             Safari 3: OK       Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Install Chrome  do not set it as default browser during installation  2. Run chrome  press 'set as default browser' button in preferences window  3. Try opening any .html file on your computer      Html file is opened in Chrome      Html file is opened in browser which was default before chrome    Additional information:  Chrome makes it default browser incompletely: it is default browser in the   start menu (first screenshot). But it is absent in 'default programs list'   (second screenshot). Also it is not set as default program for the .html   and other files and for http:// and other protocols in 'Associate a file   type or protocol with a specific program' (third screenshot). In this   dialog it can be set as program for .html and other files  but it cannot be   set as a program for http and other protocols (fourth screenshot).      Additionally  I've tried to set firefox as default browser  the run chrome   with administrative priviledges and again press 'set chrome as deafult   browser' - it does not changes anything. </pre>
