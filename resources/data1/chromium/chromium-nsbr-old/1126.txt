<title>Issue 1126 -   chromium -    can't watch netflix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi.  I don't think this is the kind of bug that you are looking for  but   you don't work with Netflix instant viewer.    I don't know how to fix it (i can barely turn on my computer without the   help of my kids).  Good luck with the rest of this project.  We can't wait to see what you do   next.  --H </pre>
