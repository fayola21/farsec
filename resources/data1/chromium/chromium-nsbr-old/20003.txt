<title>Issue 20003 -   chromium -    Write unit tests for the NSS HTTP client functions in net/ocsp/nss_ocsp.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should write unit tests for the NSS HTTP client functions in  net/ocsp/nss_ocsp.cc.    NSS calls these functions to perform OCSP (an HTTP-based protocol).  These functions themselves have nothing to do with OCSP.  So we can  test them against our TestServer. </pre>
