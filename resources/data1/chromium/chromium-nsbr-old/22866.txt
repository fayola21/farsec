<title>Issue 22866 -   chromium -    RFE: &lt;tab&gt; moves focus only to important stuff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Safari has an option in Preferences-&gt;Advanced  &quot;Press Tab to highlight each   item on a webpage&quot;.  Currently Chrome just tabs through everything on the   web page (including links)  which is typically not what the user wants.  In   Safari  by default  only text boxes  list boxes  buttons  etc are selected when   pressing &lt;Tab&gt;.  It would be nice if Chrome were smart about what it is   tabbing through and provided an option like Safari. </pre>
