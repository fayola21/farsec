<title>Issue 5850 -   chromium -    Attempts to open new tabs in popups should go to main window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open a popup window  hen inside it do something that should open a new tab   -- middle-click a link or right click an image and say &quot;open in new tab&quot;.    Right now  this opens in a second tab in the popup window  whose tabstrip   is invisible so it appears nothing happened.  Instead  we should open these   in the main window  like we do for app windows.    Less clear to me: whether downloads from the popup should open a shelf   somewhere in the main window (right now  they're in the popup).  Maybe the   current behavior here is OK. </pre>
