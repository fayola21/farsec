<title>Issue 3250 -   chromium -    [Application Crash] On tab closing while saving page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a big web-page  ready to be saved. for example the above one.  2. right click and choose save as  select desktop.  3. before the page is completely saved and the clock progress bar is not   yet finished  try to close the tab. (i had other tabs opened as well).      the page save should continue separately  or should be prompted that a save   is in progress and tab closing might abort it.      Chrome crashes and asks for a restart.    Please provide
