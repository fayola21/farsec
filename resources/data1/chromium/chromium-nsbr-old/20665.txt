<title>Issue 20665 -   chromium -    need source tarballs for channel releases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> deb's  rpm's and binaries are good but at the end of the day  most distros want to build their own packages.    I think chromium needs to release source tarballs at least  for channel releases so that distros and packagers can  have a reference to package against.    Maybe incremental diffs would be good too if the tarballs  are too big.   </pre>
