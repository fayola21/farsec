<title>Issue 11784 -   chromium -    Shift-click (open in new window) does not tile windows like IE does (tiling offset is smaller) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Shift-click (open in new window) does not tile windows like IE does (tiling  offset is smaller)    To reproduce:  1.  Make an IE or Chrome window smaller than full screen  2.  shift-click on a link  3.  Notice how IE offsets the window a full titlebar width.  Chrome does  about half the title bar.    IE switchers expect the full titlebar width for window tiling.    This came up in discussion with a Chrome switcher over dinner last night.   He switched from IE7 to Chrome  and is in fact even using the 2.0 beta  channel (I've never met a beta channel user in the wild before  especially  one so far away from the valley). :) </pre>
