<title>Issue 12348 -   chromium -    Initialize NSS with databases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now Chromium initializes NSS with a NSS_NoDB_Init call.  Without NSS certificate and key databases  Chromium still has  access to NSS's built-in list of root CA certificates  but  - Users can't add root CA certificates that they want to trust.  - Users can't have private keys and certificates.  This blocks    SSL client authentication support.  - Users can't add crypto modules such as smartcards.    It's time for Chromium to initialize NSS with databases.  NSS  now supports databases that can be used by multiple processes  at the same time.  We should work with Mozilla to specify the  location of a user's NSS databases and share them with other  NSS-based client applications. </pre>
