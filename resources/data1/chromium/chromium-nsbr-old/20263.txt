<title>Issue 20263 -   chromium -    Theme image generator seems to lead to default inactive frames being shown for already-installed themes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (This was originally reported by Tony)    &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Install a theme prior to the image-saving change (e.g. current Beta   version)  2. Update your chrome to one after the change (ToT)  3. Run Chrome    &gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?    The inactive frame is the default inactive frame  instead of the inactive   frame supplied by (or generated for) the theme. This problem persists until   the theme is reinstalled. </pre>
