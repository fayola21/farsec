<title>Issue 20936 -   chromium -    {Ctrl + Alt + B} should be disabled for extensions appearing on top - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The {Ctrl + Alt + B} accelerator  used for hiding/showing the extension   shelf  should behave differently when extension shelf is made to appear on   top. I believe it should behave the same way as {Ctrl + B} (i.e.    hiding/showing bookmark bar). </pre>
