<title>Issue 7295 -   chromium -    resort suggested URLs in the address bar according to user behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0    I suggest to use data derived from user behavior in sorting of URLs   suggested &quot;as-you-type&quot; in URL bar.    Example problem:  I have visited fahrplan.zvv.ch and fahrplan.sbb.ch before. Now  when I want   to get to fahrplan.sbb.ch  I start typing &quot;fa&quot;: fahrplan.zvv.ch is the   first suggestion  while fahplan.sbb.ch is the sixth. As I just glimpse at   the URL bar  full with fahrplan.zvv.ch  I tap Enter right away - and a   second after I realize that it is zvv  while I wanted sbb; I press Ctrl-L    type &quot;fah&quot;  and carefully select fahrplan.sbb.ch from the list.  It repeats every single time - I almost never need fahrplan.zvv.ch  while I   use fahrplan.sbb.ch multiple times a day. Though  the wrong sorting   persists.    If Chrome noticed that I spend only very short time on the first   suggestion  and switch to another suggestion soon  and resorted the items   accordingly - it would help. </pre>
