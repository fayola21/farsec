<title>Issue 3362 -   chromium -    Repeated reloading of view-source page will reload original page  not source page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.154.0 (Official Build 2776)  URLs (if applicable) : any                1. Go to any web-page  e.g. <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a>  2. Do a &quot;View page source&quot;  3. Hold down Ctrl-R for a couple of seconds. Just doing one     Ctrl-R won't do the trick.  4. It will reload the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a>  not      view-source:<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a> (but will keep     the view-source:.. in the address bar).        My initial thought is to not reload the original page  but   the source-page. But if this is somehow a feature  then   at least change the address bar.        Wrong page is reloaded.     </pre>
