<title>Issue 7984 -   chromium -    &quot;Pages&quot; section of page-cycler perf plots is referencing wrong data file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a page-cycler perf plot such as  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-</a>  core/intl1/report.html?history=150  click a build on the plot  then click the Pages button at the lower right.   Notice all the 404s rather than a nice list of per-page load times.    The problem is that the data files (12345.dat) were renamed with the trace   names (12345_t.dat). They also changed format slightly. </pre>
