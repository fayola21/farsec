<title>Issue 19353 -   chromium -    improve BackingStoreManager heuristics to reduce memory footprint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With change <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/146095">http://codereview.chromium.org/146095</a>  I changed the backing   store cache to be based on memory size rather than number of backing   stores.  With extensions we're adding a number of small render views  so   the number of individual backing store caches increased  causing the old   algorithm to not work well.    However  before this meant that the amount of memory the backing store   cache contained was affected by the size of your browser window.  A smaller   browser window meant that you had less backing store cache.  In the new   world  the total size used is just a memory cap  so if you have a small   window  more tabs will have their backing stores in the cache rather than   you using less memory.  For example  if you had an 600x800 browser window    in the old world  you'd use at most 5x600x800x4 bytes (~9MB).  There were a   maximum of 5 caches with 4 bytes per pixel.  If you had a 1920x1200 window    you'd use ~45MB at max.  The new algorithm uses the larger window size to   cap memory use  so the same amount of memory at max  but that means if you   had many tabs in a small window  you also could use up to ~45MB so that   would be an increase in memory usage over 2.0. </pre>
