<title>Issue 15488 -   chromium -    remember dialogs' window sizes (bookmark manager  etc.) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.191.0~svn20090626r19361-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : metacity      1. open the bookmark manager  2. resize the window  3. close the window  open it again    Dimensions are reset. Instead  the window width and height should be  remembered. This is true of all resizeable dialogs in chrome (if there are  others).    This is especially annoying on modern high-resolution screens with huge  amounts of bookmarks to manage; scrolling sucks :) </pre>
