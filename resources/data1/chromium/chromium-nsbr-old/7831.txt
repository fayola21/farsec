<title>Issue 7831 -   chromium -    Duplicate (tab) context menu item not available with only 1 tab opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.162.0    if you only have one tab/window opened  the tab's title context menu   doesn't have the &quot;Duplicate&quot; item available.    With 2 tabs/windows or more that context menu changes to the one with   &quot;Duplicate&quot;    IMO that option should be available with a single tab too as it is much   more intuitive than dragging the star to the tab bar </pre>
