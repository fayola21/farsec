<title>Issue 9034 -   chromium -    Tabs should restore in the right spot when restored from the New Tab Page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the 'restore tab' shortcut restores a tab to the right spot  but   doing so from the New Tab Page doesn't. The Google Toolbar Firefox NTP has   the right behavior.    Difficulty: This should work even when multiple tabs are closed and   reopened in the order they weren't closed in. </pre>
