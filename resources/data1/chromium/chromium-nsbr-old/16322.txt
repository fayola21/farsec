<title>Issue 16322 -   chromium -    browser_tests hangs and not run by any bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The browser_tests test hangs on the mac.    Windows uses the test on the try bots  so it seems like it might be important.  I'll do all the bot   work once it works. </pre>
