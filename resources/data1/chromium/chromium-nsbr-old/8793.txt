<title>Issue 8793 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Scrollbar not fully repainted when auto-scrolled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit Google Reader with enough news items that it doesn't immediately load   all their contents into the main frame.    Now place your mouse near the bottom of the scroll track and click to   scroll down.  If Reader loads more items  the scrollbar should then   automatically get smaller and scroll up (as the total frame height   increases).  What you actually see is the left portion of the scrollbar do   this while the right portion doesn't move.  This feels pretty broken.    Screenshot attached.
