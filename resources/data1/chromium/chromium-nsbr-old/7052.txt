<title>Issue 7052 -   chromium -    Newlines in Hebrew text not translated into spaces when nikkud is used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://benyehuda.org/ginzburg/Gnz002.html">http://benyehuda.org/ginzburg/Gnz002.html</a>           Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        Minimal HTML that causes the problem:  1. HTML document RTL text with newline in the middle of the text.  2. The line after the newline includes a nikkud character.        The newline should appear as a whitespace when the HTML is rendered.        No whitespace appears between the two words  the one before and the one   following the linebreak.    In the example URL: <a href="http://benyehuda.org/ginzburg/Gnz002.html">http://benyehuda.org/ginzburg/Gnz002.html</a> the header is   3 words; try it out in IE or FF to see. In Chrome  the first two   (rightmost) words are welded together -- the space is gone. In the HTML   source  this space is a newline.    I have found that the problem appears if the text after the newline   includes a diacritic (nikkud) character. Here is a minimal HTML that shows   the problem -- it clearly includes 3 words  but is rendered as 2 words:    ------begin HTML-----  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;  &lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=windows-1255&quot;&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;p&gt;_��__��__��__��_  _��__��__��__��_ _��__��_��___��__��_&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;  -------end HTML------   </pre>
