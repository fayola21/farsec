<title>Issue 18120 -   chromium -    Find-in-page should not ding while deleting characters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit a page  hit ctrl-f  and type some garbage.    Now delete the characters one at a time.  Notice that on each deletion we   ding until we get back to a string that's found.  This is strange and   annoying.  Expected behavior is that deleting characters should still trigger   researching  but not ding-on-error.    It seems like this used to work right. </pre>
