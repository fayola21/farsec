<title>Issue 22330 -   chromium -    Clobber bot builds should invoke gclient sync --force - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The bots got into a bad state earlier and clobbering didn't help.  Turns out    they needed the GYP hook to re-run.  They probably turned sour when gclient   was broken earlier in the day.    It would have been nice if doing a clobber would have forced the hooks to run   with --force.    (It would also be nice if gclient kept track of whether or not its state is &quot;dirty&quot;   - if a gclient run ends prematurely - and automatically enabled --force on a   subsequent operation if it is dirty.  But we already have a bug on that   somewhere else.  Is anyone still looking at gclient.googlecode.com?) </pre>
