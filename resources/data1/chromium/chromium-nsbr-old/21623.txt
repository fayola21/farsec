<title>Issue 21623 -   chromium -    Repeatedly accessing cursor files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> strace a chrome process.  Repeated output of  13:17:43.913785 open(&quot;/usr/share/icons/DMZ-  White/cursors/08e8e1c95fe2fc01f976f1e063a24ccd&quot;  O_RDONLY) = 114    This probably blocks the UI thread  and is especially bad on NFS systems.    I have vague recollections about filing a bug about how we recreate gtk   cursor objects rather than caching them  but my greps aren't helping me   right now.  Maybe Evan' will know. </pre>
