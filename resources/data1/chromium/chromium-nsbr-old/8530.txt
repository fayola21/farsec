<title>Issue 8530 -   chromium -    Chrome FREEZES randomly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : N/A      1. Click a Link    Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium    Issue: This issue seems to happen randomly on all different kinds of sites.    I have not seen any pattern to this freeze up at all.  What happens is that   I will click a link to visit another page  and the tab will freeze up.  I   do noticed  however  that the page never finishes loading when it freezes.    I proceed to use the task manager and kill the tab.  I browse back to the   website  and the same thing happens.  It always freezes again with that   instance of Google Chrome.  I must close the entire application (Chrome)   and then reopen to be able to visit the page.    I've had this happen pretty often (probably every other day)  and it is   very annoying  because I'll often have many tabs open and I have to close   them all so that I can visit the page.     </pre>
