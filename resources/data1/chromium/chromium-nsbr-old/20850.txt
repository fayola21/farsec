<title>Issue 20850 -   chromium -    Flash based widgets on iGoogle rendered incorrectly initially - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.4  URLs (if applicable) : www.google.com/ig  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OK      1. Create a sequence of data in a google spreadsheet  2. Create a graph of the data  3. Save the graph to your iGoogle page  4. Load the iGoogle page      Graph is rendered correctly initially.      Graph is rendered incorrectly but &quot;repairs&quot; as you move the mouse over the   widget.  It appears that the initial bad rendering is an extreme-close-up of   the upper left corner of the widget.    It *might* be required that the widget is not visible on the screen when the   page loads in order to replicate the bug.  (I.e.  in my tests the widget was   down-low on the page  and is not initially visible.  I have to scroll down to   see it after the page loads.)    See images attached.  1 shows the initial appearance  2 and 3 show how it   changes as you move the mouse over the image.  4 shows the correct   rendering which occurs when you move the mouse over the bottom portion   of the widget which triggers a complete re-draw for some reason. </pre>
