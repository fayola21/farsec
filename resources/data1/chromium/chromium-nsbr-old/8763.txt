<title>Issue 8763 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/svg/custom/use-on-g-containing-foreignObject-and-image.svg fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The RenderTree dumps are equivalent but trunk chromium outputs a blank   image (the baseline image has a green box). We have also been failing this   since the first webkit merge in October.    SVGImage is a weird piece of hackery which creates an embedded Page object    with a custom ChromeClient which forwards repaint requests back to the   SVGImage. SVGImage::draw() will then call into that Page's Frame's paint()   function.    I've traced through the code and we are (theoretically) rendering the   image  as we call paint and start rendering that page hierarchy. I'm   wondering if there's some problem with caching or accessing resources   across different Page objects  but at this point  I think someone who   actually knows this piece of the code needs to take this bug.    (PS: Because of the weird hackery in making a new Page object  you'll need   the attached patch to prevent crashing on reload or navigation away from   the svg page  as we assume that our BackForwardList will always have a   BackForwardListClient.) </pre>
