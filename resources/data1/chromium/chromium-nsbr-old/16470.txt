<title>Issue 16470 -   chromium -    Visual Studio relinks chrome DLL with each debugger run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build the chrome solution  2. Build the unit_tests solution and &quot;Set as StartUp Project&quot; in Visual   Studio  3. Hit F5  which will run the unit tests in the debugger  4. When the previous step completes  hit F5 again.  5. Notice that Visual Studio relinks chrome_dll and unit_tests even though   there are no code changes.    Having to constantly wait on linking is a significant drag on trying to   isolate a bug in the debugger  and it didn't used to happen before the   conversion to gyp.    Multiple runs in the debugger (with no code changes) should not have to   rebuild anything. </pre>
