<title>Issue 8244 -   chromium -    drag n drop in the bookmarks menu  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click on the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; to drop down the menu ( or any other   bookmark folder for that matter)  2. Drag one of the bookmarks down past the next one to change their order.  3. Alternatively  delete one of the bookmarks.       After dragging (deleting )  one of the bookmarks the menu remains open   making it possible to perform further sorting/managing tasks until the   cursor is moved and clicked elsewhere on the UI.        The menu disappears right away each time a bookmark is dragged( deleted)     rendering quick bookmark organizing tasks impractical.     Please provide
