<title>Issue 16127 -   chromium -    Merge generated c files (from webcore idls) to a single compile unit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently have link failures because webcore.lib is too large in official   WPO builds. We need to reduce the size of webcore.lib  in the short term  the   easiest way is to simply split it in two.    Also waiting on Microsoft for a fix but will probably require switching to   VS2008 which adds its own issues. </pre>
