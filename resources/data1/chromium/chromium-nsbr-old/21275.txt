<title>Issue 21275 -   chromium -    wish: should be possible to gaplessly play back multiple &lt;audio&gt; tags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	3.0.195.10 (Official Build 24604)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://dingoskidneys.com/~dholth/gapful/">http://dingoskidneys.com/~dholth/gapful/</a>        Firefox 3.x: fail      1. <a href="http://dingoskidneys.com/~dholth/gapful/">http://dingoskidneys.com/~dholth/gapful/</a>      It would be nice if there was a way to play back multiple audio tags with   no gaps. Unfortunately the spec doesn't provide for that.      The playback actually overlaps slightly for me (the end of one media   element plays back while the next tag is audible)   </pre>
