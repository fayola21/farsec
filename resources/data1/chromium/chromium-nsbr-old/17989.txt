<title>Issue 17989 -   chromium -    Write a HyperlinkView - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The download shelf and the info bar both use the cocoa text system to display   links. At least for the download shelf  it would be nice to have a special   HyperlinkView that probably is-a NSButton with a cell that draws underlined   colored text and a hand cursor in hover. This would fix a few cosmetic issues:    * While the mouse is pressed on the link  currently a caret is displayed at the   end of the text  * Pressing and then dragging the &quot;Show all downloads&quot; link selects the whole   text (which looks weird) and it's non-obvious how one can deselect it again.    The infobar might have similar issues. </pre>
