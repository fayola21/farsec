<title>Issue 249 -   chromium -    Javascript console graphs and resources do not display anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : all URLs  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Click Current Page &gt; Developer &gt; Javascript console  then Resources   button  2. The screen is blank with sections for Graphs (Time/Size) and Resources        The screen should show some graphs and charts.  My understanding is its   supposed to show charts about sizes of items downloaded and time to   download the items  is that correct?      Nothing is displayed.  Screenshot attached.  How is the display supposed to work?   </pre>
