<title>Issue 18508 -   chromium -    Could not install theme error: tints must be decimal numbers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.2    <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>        1. Use German Windows XP  2. Install a theme (e.g. Brushed)        Theme will be installed.        Error: Could not install extension from Brushed.crx: invalid values for the   images - tints must be decimal numbers    I guess the function for parsing decimal numbers is locale aware: for a   german locale it tries to parse decimals as x xx instead of x.xx.        </pre>
