<title>Issue 12175 -   chromium -    when a app modal dialog is showing and browser window is activated  activate modal dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an app modal dialog from app_modal_dialog* is shown  we want to always activate it when   the user tries to activate any browser window.  This makes it easier for the user to find the app   modal dialog.    See the windows code in browser/views/frame/browser_frame.cc and browser_view.cc as reference   (ActivateAppModalDialog). </pre>
