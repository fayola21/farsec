<title>Issue 22718 -   chromium -    JSON.serialize is slower than JavaScript implementation from json.org - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a JavaScript object  2. JSON-stringify it several times using JSON.stringify  3. Now do the same thing with a JavaScript implementation  like the one   from json.org (example at <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~annie/stringify.html">http://www.monkey.org/~annie/stringify.html</a>)  4. Note that the built-in JSON.stringify implementation is much slower than   the JavaScript implementation.        JSON.stringify should use native code as it does in IE and Firefox to make   the implementation faster than a hand-coded one.        Performance regression when using JSON.stringify (~twice the time to run as   a JS implementation)    <b>Please provide
