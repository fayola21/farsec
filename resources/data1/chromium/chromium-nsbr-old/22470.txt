<title>Issue 22470 -   chromium -    Images occasionally stop loading part way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often have images partially load and then stop  never to complete.  It   doesn't happen all the time  but I have seen it often enough to suspect   something is up.    Running on Ubuntu Karmic.  Network connection is 802.11 connected to ISP over   ADSL2+.  Latency is usually around 250ms  accessing US hosted websites from   Australia.    Often occurs loading images in RSS feeds (eg web comics)  or images on   flickr. </pre>
