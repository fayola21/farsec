<title>Issue 15300 -   chromium -    Realtek driver download page specifically disabled for chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://www.realtek.com">http://www.realtek.com</a> and browse to their driver download page.    After accepting the ToS  you get javascript dialogs claiming lack of  support for Chrome.  Attempting to download anything also brings up alerts  -- in fact they have a function called checkCHROME() :)    I believe the downloads are from an FTP site  which atleast on Mac dev  channel using a fake --user-agent still doesn't work.    Have not tested with Windows yet. </pre>
