<title>Issue 17312 -   chromium -    For non-html files  show the leap name (remote or local) in the tab title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> spun off <a title="Drag PDF file to Chrome: Non-ASCII file name showing as encoded file name" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3801"> issue 3801 </a>  <a title="For pdf files  tab text must be something other than 'untitled'" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2529"> issue 2529 </a>  <a title="Page title of local text file dragged into Chrome is &quot;Untitled&quot;"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2375">issue 2375</a>.    Glen has the following to say about this:     &lt;quote&gt;  I think showing the full URL for non-HTML remote resources is wrong (that   is  if  you're looking at a PDF or image  you should be shown the filename). I   guess  what we want is:  * URL for remote HTML content.  * Filename for all local content  and all non-HTML remote content (e.g. PDF   /  TXT / Image).  &lt;/quote&gt;   </pre>
