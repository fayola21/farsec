<title>Issue 16721 -   chromium -    When dragging a tab  the &quot;new tab&quot; button should hide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 195.0 (Developer Build 20617)    OS version               : 10.6 Build 10A402a  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): not applicable      1. Create a window with a few tabs  2. Create another window  3. Start dragging the newly created window from the tab.      The &quot;new tab&quot; button from the window being dragged should disappear.      It stays there.    I think this would help in removing any visual clutter since the window   changes opacity and there might be too many things visible at once.    If this is done  this might also help with <a title="New tab button visible while dragging a tab" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11126"> issue #11126 </a> </pre>
