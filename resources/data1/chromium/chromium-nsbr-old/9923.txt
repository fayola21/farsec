<title>Issue 9923 -   chromium -    Web application shortcut chrome can't navigate out of PDF - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.1      1. Create a web application shortcut for a site  2. Open that web application shortcut and navigate to a PDF      I should have some way to navigate away  back to where I came from or  somewhere else.      There are *no* browser controls  including the keyboard controls.  It would  be nice to configure the web application shortcut to expose certain  controls - like a home button to go to where it started  a back button  or  something like that.  fluidapp.com - their ssb configuration controls are  fairly extensive for that. </pre>
