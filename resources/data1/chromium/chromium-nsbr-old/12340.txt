<title>Issue 12340 -   chromium -    Layout test fails due to blinking cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The snapshot has the cursor but occaisionally the buildbots run and don't   have the cursor in their image.    LayoutTests/fast/body-propagation/overflow/004-xhtml.xhtml    RenderThemeChromiumWin::caretBlinkInterval() is suppose to make the not   happen but it appears to not be working in this case.     </pre>
