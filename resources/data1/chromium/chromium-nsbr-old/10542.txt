<title>Issue 10542 -   chromium -    Crash when redirecting from HTTPS with unverified certificate + HTTP AUTH to 2nd  different  HTTPS with unverified certificate + HTTP AUTH - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)  URLs (if applicable) : I have an example for this  but unfortunately it's   on the company intranet.          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Create two HTTPS websites with a self-signed cert which also have HTTP   AUTH login.  2. site1 generates a 301 redirect to site2      * I expect to see the &quot;Warning! This site uses an invalid certificate!&quot;   warning twice  the HTTP AUTH dialog box twice  and then to see the   destination page.        Chrome crashes completely and all Chrome windows close.
