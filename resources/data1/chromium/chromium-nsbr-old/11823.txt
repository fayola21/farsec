<title>Issue 11823 -   chromium -    Bookmarks API needs minor sprucing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that we have a better idea of the pattern that we're going to use for   extension APIs  we need to take a pass back through bookmarks and bring it   into line where applicable.    Here are the areas I see (looking at tabs as the current best example to   follow):    - remove() should take a single id argument.  - move() should be (int id  {[int parentId]  [int index]}  [callback()])  - setTitle() should change to update(int id  Object changes) with a note   that only title is currently supported.  - All the events should have the form onThingHappened(int subjectId  Object   details)  - The word &quot;bookmark&quot; should be removed from all the event names.    I still think that returning the children ids is not that useful for get()   and getSearch(). We have getChildren()  so we already have the ability to   walk a level at a time. Exposing the children ids just creates two ways to   do the same thing.    If we were to remove this  then we could change get() to just take a single   ID. </pre>
