<title>Issue 17174 -   chromium -    Theora block-level quant not supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.1 Chrome Win32   3.0.195 (195.0) Chromium OS X  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/tmp/sign_irene_cif-3qi.ogg">http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/tmp/sign_irene_cif-3qi.ogg</a>    Block-level quant isn't used in any released encoder  but I'm told Thusnelda will be using it Real   Soon Now. Anyway  support was added in ffmpeg <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=18986">r18986</a> and merged into ffmpeg-mt on May 31 in 94985fa. So it's just a matter of upgrading the libavcodec binaries shipped with Chrome/Chromium   binaries. </pre>
