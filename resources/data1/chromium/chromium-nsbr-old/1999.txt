<title>Issue 1999 -   chromium -    Feature: Search terms entered in Omnibar should be placed in Find Bar and carried over to new tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter search terms into Omnibar and hit return  2. 'Ctrl+F' -&gt; empty find bar  3. Enter word in find bar  4. Create daughter tab (click a link on the page whilst holding down Ctrl   key)  5. 'Ctrl+F' -&gt; empty find bar        The search terms should appear in in the Find Bar - as they do with the   google toolobar.    Words entered into the find bar should carry over to the find bar in   daughter tabs.    I would like to see search words appear in any unused space above the   webpage e.g. in the bookmarks bar (which I always show but don't really   utilise)        The Find Bar remains blank.  Words in Find Bar are not carried over to daughter tabs.  Please provide
