<title>Issue 8115 -   chromium -    Problem with searches from the iGoogle personal page anytime Chrome has just been lanched - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.it/ig?hl=it">http://www.google.it/ig?hl=it</a>         Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Launch Chrome with iGoogle set as start page (you're logged into your   iGoogle account)  2. Type any search key e press ENTER      You should be addressed to the Google search result page.      You will be addressed to <a href="http://www.google.it/">http://www.google.it/</a> (the normal Google search   page) without any search result and have to search again.    Now  if you do perform the search (or do not  it's irrelevant) and return   to your iGoogle home page  by clicking the Home Page Chrome button  you can   search and be addressed to the seach results normally.    OS is Windows XP SP2. </pre>
