<title>Issue 3818 -   chromium -    Google Mail hangs when Sign Out clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  visit <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>  2. Login with GoogleMail credentials  3. Once page loads  click &quot;Sign Out&quot; in top right-hand corner. (This links  to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?logout&amp;hl=en-GB">https://mail.google.com/mail/?logout&amp;hl=en-GB</a>)      The Welcome / Login screen for GoogleMail should re-appear.      The page freezes  you can move the cursor around it but it always shows as  a finger cursor (as it would when hovering over a link). If you type a  valid web address (e.g. www.bbc.co.uk) into a new tab  that tab window  remains blank - no page loads. (Although the autocomplete when typing the  URL appears to work fine.)    Please provide
