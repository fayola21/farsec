<title>Issue 7075 -   chromium -    Keyword provider is asynchronous  leading to flaky behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :2.0.158.0      1. Set up short (2 or 3 letter) keywords for searches  2. Open new tab  3. Type the keyword (with or without search terms) then press enter    quickly      The keyword should be recognised and it should take me to the search engine      The default search engine is used to search for the search terms plus the   keyword itself (ie treats it the same as if you hadn't set up the keyword)    The issue only occurs when typing quickly  so the keyword is not recognised   and made into the blue box like it is when typing slowly. The issue might   be worse when there are many tabs running.   </pre>
