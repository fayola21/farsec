<title>Issue 16049 -   chromium -    non-system titlebar too small when no tabstrip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When there is no tabstrip (e.g.  when on the developer tools window)  the   titlebar is just big enough to hold the minimize/restore/close buttons. It   should be the same height as when there is a tabstrip. Also  the tab's title   and favicon do not show.  </pre>
