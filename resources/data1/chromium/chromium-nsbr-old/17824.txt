<title>Issue 17824 -   chromium -    Double click on &quot;readonly&quot; Html input allows data entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Create a .Net Web Page and mark one a text control on it marked &quot;Read    Only&quot;  2. Publish the page  3. Browse to it  4. Double click on the control that has been marked read only  5. A list of previous text-box entries will appear - choose one  6. Submit the .aspx form      - You shouldn't be able to modify a read-only control      - Double clicking allows the input of previous entries    I also attached the &quot;Get Source&quot; file from when I get the source of the   page using Chrome  hopefully that helps... </pre>
