<title>Issue 3433 -   chromium -    Form and query part encoding should be UTF-8 for Unicode encodings other than UTF-8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   HTML5 specifies that the query part of a url in a UTF-16/32 page should be   encoded in UTF-8 (rather than UTF-16/32) before percent-escaping it.     See <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#resolving-urls">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#resolving-urls</a>    This is also what Firefox does. Firefox does that for form submission as   well. I have a patch that makes the attached test case work correctly  but   I guess it's not comprehensive enough  yet.        </pre>
