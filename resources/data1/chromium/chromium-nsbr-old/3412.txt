<title>Issue 3412 -   chromium -    Security info should be passed on with synchronous requests. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The code today does not pass the security info along to synchronous   requests  as that info is not currently used (see   resource_dispatcher_host.cc ResourceDispatcherHost::SyncEventHandler::OnResponseCompleted()).    We should implement this and add tests.       </pre>
