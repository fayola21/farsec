<title>Issue 17333 -   chromium -    Can't copy-paste text from OpenOffice to a contenteditable DIV - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.1 (Official Build 20697)    <a href="http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_content_editable.html">http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_content_editable.html</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Use Windows XP or Vista (perhaps others)    2. Launch OpenOffice.org Writer 3.1  and type some text into the document.    3. In Chrome  navigate to a site with a contenteditable DIV  such as Gmail   in rich text Compose mode  or this very simple page:  <a href="http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_content_editable.html">http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/chromium_content_editable.html</a>    4. Copy the text from OpenOffice.    5. Attempt to paste the text into Chrome  using the right-click menu    and/or Ctrl-V.      The text should be pasted to Chrome.      No text appears.    Copy-paste works just fine from Notepad to Chrome  or from OpenOffice to   Firefox3/IE7  but not from OpenOffice to Chrome.   </pre>
