<title>Issue 7933 -   chromium -    Some UnloadTest tests now hangs in --single-process mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Should it be permanently disabled in single process mode like the other   tests?  I don't know enough about the test  so filing this to keep track of   the issue. </pre>
