<title>Issue 20993 -   chromium -    Maxlength for IME input test failed in Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-maxlength-ime-completed.html    The test was added by <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/48011">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/48011</a> and failed in   Chromium layout test.    The test limits the input string to max length of 2  but the getSelection   returns the all input strings which is longer than 2.    Kent  since you add this test  could you take a look?     </pre>
