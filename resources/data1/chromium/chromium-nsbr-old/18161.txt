<title>Issue 18161 -   chromium -    Suggestion for url bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello. This is a suggestion to make Chrome a better browser. I would like to   see the option of having bookmarks displayed as their url addresses instead   of their default page title. Too often the page description does not give   enough info about the content and this can cause confusion when searching   through bookmarks. So instead of having to manually copy and paste the url   ourselves for each individual bookmark i think it would be a nice option if   we could view our bookmarks as full addresses instead  perhaps with an   optional customized category icon that we can choose to associate it with.   Thank you. </pre>
