<title>Issue 11516 -   chromium -    Get the test plugins building and running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some layout tests and some UI tests cover plugins.  At least the layout tests   should pass now  except that (I believe?) the test plugin we make doesn't   work on Linux.  I'm not sure anyone's tried it  so it may just work  but I   think it likely needs changes to work with the Linux-specific version of the   plugin API. </pre>
