<title>Issue 7802 -   chromium -    Add checks for Win7 at places where we are only checking for Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are number of places in the code where we check for Vista by calling win_util::GetWinVersion() method which used to return Vista for any higher   version Windows as well. But now this method has changed to detect Windows   7 and return that. We need to fix places where we have explicit checks for WINVERSION_VISTA to account for Windows 7.    Some places where this might apply:  - browser_main.cc -&gt; HandleIconsCommands()  - google_update.cc -&gt; CoCreateInstanceAsAdmin()  - IEImporter::GetFavoritesInfo  - ShellIntegration::IsDefaultBrowser    And many other places - <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?">http://www.google.com/codesearch?</a>  hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0&amp;q=chromium+WINVERSION_VISTA   </pre>
