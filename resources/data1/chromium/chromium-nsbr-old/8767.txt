<title>Issue 8767 -   chromium -    Can create multiple Downloads tabs from Download shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome	2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)        1. Download a file.  2. From the Download shelf  click on &quot;Show all downloads...&quot;.  3. Switch back to tab where you downloaded the file.  4. From the Download shelf  click on &quot;Show all downloads...&quot;.  5. etc.      What is the expected output?     Should only create 1 Downloads tab per window.  If there is already a  Downloads tab  then switch to it instead of creating new one. This would be  similar to the way Ctrl+J works.    What do you see instead?    Clicking on &quot;Show all downloads...&quot; creates a new Downloads tab each time.   </pre>
