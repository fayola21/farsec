<title>Issue 6370 -   chromium -    Feature request: Allow drag-and-drop of supported downloads back into the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you download an image or HTML file or other Chrome-readable file  you   can drag that file from the download bar to a location on your desktop.    You can then drag that file from the desktop into a Chrome tab and it will   try to open that file in the tab.    What you should ALSO be able to do is drag the download from the download   bar straight into a tab or to the new tab space to open the file in Chrome.   It seems straightforward enough to implement. </pre>
