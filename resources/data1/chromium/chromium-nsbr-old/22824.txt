<title>Issue 22824 -   chromium -    Under heavy system load: when navigating to an URL from the NTP before anything of the NTP has loaded the NTP doesn't load nor navigate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.7  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Make your computer really heavy loaded (high memory/CPU usage)  2. Put a site URL in your clipboard (faster than typing  althrough it also   does happen sometimes when typing a url fast)  3. Open a new tab and IMMEDIATLY paste the url in the omnibox and press enter  4. With a little bit of 'luck' it doesn't navigate or continue loading.  Once you see a loaded part of the NTP you can be sure you were too late... </pre>
