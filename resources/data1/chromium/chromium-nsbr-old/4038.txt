<title>Issue 4038 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager should get keyboard focus as soon as it is launched - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As soon as Bookmark manager is launched  it should get keyboard focus.    1. Launch Bookmark manager with Ctrl+shift+b or Menu wrench/bookmark manager.  2. With out clicking anywhere on the manager  try to use keyboard to work  with it eg: use arrow keys to navigate down the Treeview or Alt+F4 to close  the Bookmark manager    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.      Please note  we fail with this behavior only with Bookmark manager/About  Google Chrome/Chrome Task Manager.  It works fine with Options/Clear Browsing Data/Import Bookmarks dlgs.    Even though  all of them are of them same class type: Chrome_ContainerWin    Looks like  we should have some consistent behavior over here (?). </pre>
