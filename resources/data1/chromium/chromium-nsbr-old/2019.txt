<title>Issue 2019 -   chromium -    Drop down menus sometimes disapear when moving mouse over them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to www.ebuyer.co.uk  2. Hover over the main navigation menus ( Home  Computers  Sound &amp; Vision    etc)  3. Then move the mouse down and try to select something from drop down list   that appears.    Sometimes the menu will work ok  but if you do it a good few times you will   notice that sometimes the menu disapears as you move the mouse down onto   it.      The menu should stay and I should be able to select a link from it      The menu sometimes ( not every time ) disapears    Please provide
