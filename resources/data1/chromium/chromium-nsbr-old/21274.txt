<title>Issue 21274 -   chromium -    --show-extensions-on-top: initial size is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have three extensions installed (buildbot  mappy  and one other)  when I   launch  only the left-most toolstrip is visible.  The other two are cut off.    If I horizontally resize the window  one of the others suddenly appears  but   the other is still cut off. </pre>
