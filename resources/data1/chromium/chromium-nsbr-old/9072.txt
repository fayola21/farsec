<title>Issue 9072 -   chromium -    Failing layout test LayoutTests/fast/canvas/fillrect_gradient.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout test    LayoutTests/fast/canvas/fillrect_gradient.html    Is coming up as an image mismatch since this morning (build 5141).  Could   you take a look at this test and see if it just needs rebaselining?    Thanks!  Please feel free to assign to the appropriate owner  as necessary.   </pre>
