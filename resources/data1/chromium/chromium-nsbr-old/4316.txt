<title>Issue 4316 -   chromium -    Need to restart the browser twice to see the upgrade happen. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install 0.3.154.12  2. Have Chrome running  3. Over install with 0.4.154.13  4. Open About Google Chrome. As expected  you get a message asking to  restart Chrome for the change to take effect.  5. Close and open chrome.  6. Go to About Google Chrome again.    Issue:  Notice that the message asking to restart Chrome for the change to take  effect  shows up again... We need to Close and Open Chrome again to see the  Upgrade effect.    What is the expected output?   This message should be shown only once and not twice...       </pre>
