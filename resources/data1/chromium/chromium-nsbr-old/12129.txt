<title>Issue 12129 -   chromium -    Implement cross-origin XHR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our current implementation is a hack where we turn off security checks for   extensions. We need to only allow extensions to communicate with the origins   they have opted into in the manifest.    There is some upstream work at webkit.org going on to refactor XMLHttpRequest   security checks that we depend on to implement this correctly. </pre>
