<title>Issue 15093 -   chromium -    Bound the total number of sockets in a pool - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had an outstanding patch for this a while ago  but it has since bit-rotted   :(    The general idea is  that as a safe-guard against denial of service attacks   (and to bound memory consumption etc.) should have a bound on the total   number of open sockets allowed in the system. </pre>
