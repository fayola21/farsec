<title>Issue 2714 -   chromium -    Don't allow the user to have empty search engine list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Finally  I managed to get the empty search engines list (See the issue#   2573).    We can notice several bugs over here.    -Perform Imports from IE/FF  -Set one of the imported search engine as the default one  -Delete all Search Engines except the default one.  -Select the URL for the default one in &quot;Edit Search Engine&quot; Dlg and delete   it.   [the bug fix &lt;b/1239244&gt; is cracked here for imported one's]    -Now  your default label is gone on the Search Engine  so you can delete   the last Search Engine too :)    So finally user is having empty default Search engine.    With such a behavior:    Copy foo into clip board  you will get &quot;Paste and go&quot; instead of &quot;Paste   and Search&quot;  Let me know  a separate bug is required for this one !!   </pre>
