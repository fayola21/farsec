<title>Issue 6254 -   chromium -    Chrome does not support iphone style scrolling for tablets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1    Other browsers tested: IE7 / safari on iPhone       Safari 3: fail      Firefox 3: OK with addon           IE 7: OK      1. buy a tablet PC  2. drag pen or finger across the page to scroll up or down  3. groan as text is selected      - Page contents should scroll up or down as on iphone      - Text is selected    Additional info:    The iPhone and IE7 offer a very useful 'grab-and-drag' page panning   option. This mode is entered by clicking a dedicated icon (small 'hand'   icon) on the toolbar. When his mode is selected  'click and drag' events   are interpreted as scrolling requests. While holding the left mouse   button  or equivalently holding the tablet pen against the screen  the   page contents follow the pointer. On the iphone this is the default   scrolling mode.     This panning mode is very useful for tablet users who want to navigate   pages without mouse or keyboard  since it avoids having to use the narrow   scroll bar with pen or finger. It's one of the features I miss most in   Chrome.
