<title>Issue 13428 -   chromium -    Omnibox regression  typed URL is truncated. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)  WebKit	531.0  V8	1.2.6.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.183.1 Safari/531.0              Just enter a URL and Press enter  if you press enter a few milliseconds after finish typing   a part of the URL isn't written into the &quot;url variable&quot;    like www.google.de&lt;cr&gt;  it results www.google    this is just when you press enter fast after typing the URL  if you waiting a half second it works just fine.        URL is not fully written into the $URL variable (i think)          it sucks  but is better than ff :D    ---      marco@blackbox:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release   DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu  DISTRIB_RELEASE=9.04  DISTRIB_CODENAME=jaunty  DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&quot;Ubuntu 9.04&quot;      model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E6550  @ 2.33GHz    Linux blackbox 2.6.28-11-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 17 01:57:59 UTC   2009 i686 GNU/Linux         </pre>
