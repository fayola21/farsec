<title>Issue 1034 -   chromium -    Middle mouse click does not open new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Middle mouse button click on a div/table/etc link      Open link in a new tab      Goes to link in current tab.    Very frustrating this is  as unless your totally on top of the actual link    if you middle click in the parent element div/table/etc  it will open in   the current tab.    </pre>
