<title>Issue 17411 -   chromium -    Bottom window border becomes corrupted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: chromium-3.0.195.0-0.1.20090720svn21073.fc11.i586                  v8-1.2.14-1.20090720svn2510.fc11.i586  OS + version: Fedora release 11 (Leonidas)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager: Metacity (Gnome 2.26.3)        Using Chromium normally in GNOME  I notice that the bottom of the window   picks up some corrupted graphics that doesn't seem to go away.  This is   just from regular browsing and desktop use  but I can't tell what's causing   it exactly.        The window perimeter should be clean.  This does not appear to be related   to metacity because I tried chromium with and without window manager   bordering  and it looks just the same; the corruption is within chromium.        Some pixels get changed to black (on my system).  The pattern resembles   text  so my suspicion is that it could be related to tooltips or other   graphics being displayed by other programs or some other graphical   mechanism within chrome itself.  This could also just be random internal   corruption.    I'm attaching a screenshot showing the problem in two windows.  Resizing   the window doesn't appear to do anything  including minimizing  maximizing    hiding  etc.  I popped out one of the tabs and the corruption shows on the   new and original window.  Also  when I open a new window completely it is   there.  Closing and reloading chromium completely appears to clean it out   temporarily.   </pre>
