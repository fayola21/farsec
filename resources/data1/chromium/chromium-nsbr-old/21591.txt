<title>Issue 21591 -   chromium -    download adds a double dot extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.open new tab  2. paste   '<a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.r25707.tgz'">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium.r25707.tgz'</a> in   the url bar and hit return        The download starts for &quot;chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25707">r25707</a>.tgz..gz&quot; instead of   &quot;chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25707">r25707</a>.tgz&quot;    You can also see this from   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium_tarball.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/archives/chromium_tarball.html</a> as it   start the download for you (latest url instead).    NOTE: Windows (4.0.206.1) added the &quot;.gz&quot; but not the extra dot.  The Mac   needs to fix the extra dot  but I'm leaving this as OS-All because adding .gz   in the first place doesn't seem right. </pre>
