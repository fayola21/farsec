<title>Issue 13967 -   chromium -    theme base colors should be picked from system colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The default blue looks out of place on many linux system color themes   including ubuntu orange/brown.  Once themes support is more complete  it   would be nice if we could pull colors from the system and use those as the   base theme color.    Assigning to evan for now since I know he's done some work in having theme   use default widget background colors. </pre>
