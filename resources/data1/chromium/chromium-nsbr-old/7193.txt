<title>Issue 7193 -   chromium -    Tabs randomly go tiny &amp; don't stretch to fill available space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  URLs (if applicable) : any (random)  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. General multi-tab browsing; nothing specific      Tabs auto-stretch to fit available space      All tabs spontaneously shrink to identical tiny blips &amp; squash up on the   left hand side    I have only noticed this in the most recent build (2.0.158.0) but sometimes    on opening a new tab  all the tab title handles (sorry don't know the   proper term) suddenly decide to become very small  as if there were about   50 tabs open  and bunch up on the left hand side. Not even the X button   shows.    I haven't noticed any kind of pattern  number of open tabs  or specific   type of web page that trigger this behaviour.    Closing one or more tabs generally fixes it.    What makes it random is that afterwards I can re-open the last tab (the one   that apparently made Chrome break) and everything's just fine.  I can   continue opening more tabs indefinitely with no problems... until the next   time it happens.    Please see screenshot to understand what I'm barking on about ;-) </pre>
