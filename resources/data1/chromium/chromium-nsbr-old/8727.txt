<title>Issue 8727 -   chromium -    Linux dialogs are application-modal rather than window-modal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now dialog boxes are modal for the entire application rather than  just for the top level window to which they belong. This means that if you  have 2 chrome windows up  and a &quot;save as&quot; dialog open for one of them  you  can't use the other window.    This is not how Windows chrome works. In windows chrome actually runs the  dialogs in their own thread because Windows dialogs are blocking. We don't  have to run them in their own thread  luckily  but we do need to figure out  how to use GtkWindowGroups (which is a GTK 2.14+ API) or re-implement that  functionality for ourself  so that the focus grab doesn't affect all app  windows. </pre>
