<title>Issue 14496 -   chromium -    When the desktop size is changed  the window can end up parger than the screen. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works fine.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: No idea      1. Use a laptop  and connect a LARGE monitor.  2. Make the chrome window nice and big.  3. Disconnect the large monitor and switch to the laptop screen.  4. Be sad because you cannot see the bottom of the window  and cannot   resize the window b/c you cant reach the lower right corner.      The window should resize to fit in the smaller screen size.      The window does not resize and is larger than the available screen area.   </pre>
