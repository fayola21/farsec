<title>Issue 22165 -   chromium -    Big fat bookmark bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Big fat bookmark bar    I've seen this forever in Chrome  but most recently I observed it in:  4.0.210.0 (Developer Build 26210)    To repro:  1- open a new tab  2- type an URL  3- hit enter    Do that quickly  before the NTP has fully loaded (I think)  and you'll see   this problem. </pre>
