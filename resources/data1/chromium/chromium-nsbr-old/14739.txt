<title>Issue 14739 -   chromium -    Fitts'ier close button for Downloads bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  3.0.189.0    The Downloads bar's close button isn't as easy to hit as would be possible.   Why not extend its click target so that it hits the window edges (without   enlarging it visually)  so that just slamming the mouse pointer into the   lower edge would be enough in most cases? </pre>
