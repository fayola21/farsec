<title>Issue 11063 -   chromium -    100 open tabs freeze down a 2G-RAM-PC for an hour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.1    Continuing from <a title="many tabs with Flash slow down overall performance" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6088"> Issue 6088 </a>: Chrome launch and shutdown becomes a nighmare   when I run ~100 tabs (judging by number of processes in WinXP's Task   Manager)  even with plugins-disable command-line switch.    The computer with 2G of RAM and Core Duo @1.83GHz almost freezes for nearly   an hour  and only manually setting to Priority:Low; CPU Affinity:(only one of   them) for every chrome.exe process makes the whole system more or less   responsive (but far from the speed when Chrome is not running). </pre>
