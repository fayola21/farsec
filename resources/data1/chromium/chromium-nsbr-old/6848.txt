<title>Issue 6848 -   chromium -    Search for 'C# foo' can trigger accidental search infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If your corporate network has a machine at http://c/ then searching for   &quot;C# foo&quot; can trigger the accidental search infobar.  This is pretty weird   from a user perspective  as it's very unlikely the user actually meant   &quot;http://c/#%20foo    Not sure precisely what fix to the input classifier would prevent this. </pre>
