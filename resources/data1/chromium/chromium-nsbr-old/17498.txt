<title>Issue 17498 -   chromium -    new tab in popup window opens in first chrome window rather than parent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.194.3-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20926">r20926</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy Heron  CPU architecture: 64-bit  Window manager: ion3      1. Click the &quot;New window&quot; link in a Gmail conversation.  2. In the popup window  middle-click a link in one of the messages in the   conversation.      Per <a title="new tab in window created by window.open() opens in parent window" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15814"> issue 15814 </a>  the link from step 2 is supposed to open as a new tab in   the parent (e.g. initial Gmail) window.      The link seems to be opened as a tab in a completely unrelated window.    From brief testing  it appears to always end up in the first Chrome window   that was created. </pre>
