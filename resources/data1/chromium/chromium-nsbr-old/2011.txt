<title>Issue 2011 -   chromium -    BUG: No appropriate error message for low disk space when installing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.179.29      1. Try installing Google Chrome when there is less disk space than required   (go for  10MBs  for example)      An error window will show up saying there is not enough space.      Error 8 or 1 or something  different error every time.      Also  I tried installing Google Chrome and it automatically installed the Hebrew   version (it chose it according my Regional settings  apparently)  even though   the language on the Google Chrome download screen was set to English.  The search engines fit the Hebrew version and they did not change after I   changed the language of the interface.  I tried uninstalling Google Chrome and reinstalling  but I probably could not due   to disk space error (or I had to restart  something the uninstallation did not   notify me about).  I changed my Regional settings to English (US) and when I successfully   reinstalled it  the search engines were still the Hebrew ones. Bummer. </pre>
