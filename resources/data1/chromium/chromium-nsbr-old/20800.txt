<title>Issue 20800 -   chromium -    unable to navigate to selected page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> from bradfitz:  &gt; I have http://go/fbslinks in my browser history  but the new chrome won't  &gt; let me go to http://go/fbs (or any prefix of fbslinks).  No matter what I  &gt; try  it always goes to the first suggestion from history.  Even if I arrow  &gt; down to &quot;search google for http://go/fbs it *still* goes to  &gt; http://go/fbslinks      Markus was describing the same bug to me yesterday using about:plugins and   trying to navigate to about: </pre>
