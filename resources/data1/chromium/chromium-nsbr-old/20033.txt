<title>Issue 20033 -   chromium -    CLD test source contain raw non-ASCII bytes and cannot be compiled with a CJK codepage on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know why I haven't come across this earlier (because on purpose I  set the default code page on Windows to 949 - Korean - to catch this kind  of problems). Perhaps  compact_lang_det/unittest_data.h was not compiled  before.      </pre>
