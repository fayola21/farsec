<title>Issue 18057 -   chromium -    Clicking on tab often causes drag (if you use a lot of tabs and memory on a slow machine) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a lot of tabs  using lots of memory and slowing the machine  2. Click and release mouse on a not recenly used background tab and quickly   move mouse        Tab should become foreground tab but stay in window; you haven't dragged   it.      Tab slowly re-renders  then  when complete  is re-rendered somewhere out of   the Chrome frame  as if it were dragged.  I assume the UI events are being   delivered out of order due to the slow re-draw.    <b>Please provide
