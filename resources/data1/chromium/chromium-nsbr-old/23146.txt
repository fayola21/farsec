<title>Issue 23146 -   chromium -    Sign Chromium Mac continuous builds with Chromium cert - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now Chromium continuous builds are unsigned and as such when used get a   keychain prompt for every site for which a password is saved whenever they're   updated.    We should sign continuous builds with a Chromium cert so that this doesn't   happen. </pre>
