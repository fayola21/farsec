<title>Issue 7958 -   chromium -    Display issue for lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48    See attached screenshot  html and css files  open in Firefox and Chrome for   comparison.    I noticed a difference on a website I was browsing between Firefox and   Chrome. I looked at the code  and boiled the difference down to this. The   intended behaviour on the website was how it looks with Firefox  as with   Chrome everything gets shifted  but I do not know whether this is is   compliant with the standards. If Chrome is working as it should  then I'm   sorry.     </pre>
