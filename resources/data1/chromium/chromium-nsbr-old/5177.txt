<title>Issue 5177 -   chromium -    Vista: Arrow key selects the entire list in the Search Engine dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.31 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)    I don't think  this is regression  The build 149.30 also has the same behavior.      1. Bring up Edit Search Engine dialog (from Omnibox context menu).  2. Click on 1st entry in Search engine list.  3. Hit Up arrow key.              OR   Just double click on the header &quot;Default Search Options&quot; on top of the  Search Engine Dlg.    Result: The entire list is selected.    Expected: The event should be just ignored.    This is Vista only (both Enterprise and Business) </pre>
