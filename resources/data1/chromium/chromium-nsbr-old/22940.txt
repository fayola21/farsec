<title>Issue 22940 -   chromium -    Add web content background and fonts color option to Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I really don't know why this feature has not been considered as &quot;must have&quot;   in Chrome or event any visual softs. It really hard to be realised or   implemented ?    I love Chrome but I still stay with firefox because this weakness.  Now  after 3.0 realse  I'm really disappointed </pre>
