<title>Issue 13346 -   chromium -    Can't drag tab by hovering over the taskbar button for other Chrome window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.65 (Official Build )    OS: Windows XP SP2        1. Drag a tab out of a Chrome window.  2. Hover over the taskbar button of another Chrome window that is not   visible in the foreground.      Normally when drag&amp;dropping to a window  you can hover over a hidden   window's taskbar button for a second to bring that window to the   foreground.  Then you can drop the item into the window.      Nothing.     </pre>
