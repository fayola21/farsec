<title>Issue 9196 -   chromium -    Need to respect location and size information passed in STARTUPINFO - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  we ignore the location and size information that might be passed   in the STARTUPINFO struct.    We  or distribution partners  may need to launch in a different initial   size or location passed in during first launch.  If location and size   information are passed in through this struct  we should respect those   values and not fall back to default behavior. </pre>
