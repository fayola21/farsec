<title>Issue 12849 -   chromium -    Refactor setup (and possibly mini_installer) and add more unit tests for the installer code. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Overtime setup has grown and had lot of patches applied to it in bits and   pieces. Finally Carlos rant has made me file this bug. We should do some   serious refactoring to made the code unit testable and add unit tests for it. </pre>
