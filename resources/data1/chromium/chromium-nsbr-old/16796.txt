<title>Issue 16796 -   chromium -    Input method issue: When inputting text in a text box  if there is a composition string then pressing Backspace or Delete will cause the composition string be cleared and the text box refuses to accept any further input. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open any web page with a text box (eg. www.google.com) and move cursor  into the text box.  2. open a cjk input method and type something to generate a uncommitted  composition text. Make sure the text box only contains the composition text.  3. press backspace      backspace key event should be consumed by input method  which may modify  the composition text.      WebKit handles the key event and clears the whole composition text  and  then the text box enters a weird status that anything can't be inputted  from input method  except latin characters.    <b>Please provide
