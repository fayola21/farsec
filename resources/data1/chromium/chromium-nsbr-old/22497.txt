Locate a page with a drop-down / select input (any page will do  but I   noticed at first with this page <a href="http://www.last.fm/subscribe">http://www.last.fm/subscribe</a> )  2. Click to display the options for Currency  3. Click to choose Euro      The drop-down should have chosen Euro and closed the list of available   options      The list of options remains open. You need to click anywhere else on the   page to hide the drop-down. Also  if you click on the down arrow again  the   options are not displayed.     </pre>
