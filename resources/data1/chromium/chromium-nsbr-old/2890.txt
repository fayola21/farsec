<title>Issue 2890 -   chromium -    weird behaviour of moveTo and resizeTo methods - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use window.open to create new window and have a window handler.  2. Try moveTo and/or resizeTo after opening the new window with any   position or size.      &quot;moveTo&quot; should move window to the given coordinates.   &quot;resizeTo&quot; should resize the window.      &quot;moveTo&quot; moves the window correctly but changes its size to a very small   window.  &quot;resizeTo&quot; resizes the window as expected but moves the window to (0 0)   coordinates.    Please provide
