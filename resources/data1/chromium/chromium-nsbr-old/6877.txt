<title>Issue 6877 -   chromium -    need faster open link from non-browser application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.157.2      Firefox 3: FAIL    When opening a http: link from non-browser application (like MS Outlook or MS   Word or Miranda instant messenger)  every link takes several seconds before a web   page opens.    Looks like it executes chrome.exe for every link  i.e. loads 700k executable only   to find out that Chrome is already active and to pass the URL to it.  With the responsiveness Chrome displayes elsewhere  this aspect feels way too   slow. What about having a really small executable that can only check whether   Chrome is already running; and to pass URL to it if it is--and to launch a full   process if it is not? </pre>
