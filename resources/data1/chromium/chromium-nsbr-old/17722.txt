<title>Issue 17722 -   chromium -    Feature Request - Change No. of thumbnails visible on homepage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : N/A      The user should have an option to set how many thumbnails come on the   homepage and if the show recent activities and recommendations is disabled   the thumbnails should also occupy the bottom area and resize accordingly   such that a hell lot of blank space is not there...      There are fixed no. of thumbnails and nothing can be done about them        PS- Wouldn't it be better if you guys made a new template for Feature   Requests?  </pre>
