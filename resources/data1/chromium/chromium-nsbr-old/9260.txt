<title>Issue 9260 -   chromium -    Criteria checker needs new &quot;launch&quot; API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The criteria checker launches Chrome now without any support for setting z-  ordering  size or launch location.  Partners are building this  and we can   potentially make integration easier by providing a simple API as part of   the the criteria checker.    Once this issue is resolved:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9196">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9196</a>    We should modify the criteria checker's &quot;launch&quot; method to be:    LaunchGoogleChrome(int&amp; x  int&amp; y  int&amp; height  int&amp; width  HWND/pid   launch_behind_this_hwnd)    This will launch Chrome at x y with size height width and behind the given   HWND/pid.    parameters are optional: not providing them reverts to default behavior.    If an HWND/Pid is provided  Chrome should be launched behind that   application.  See documentation about STARTUPINFO and SetWindowPos on msdn. </pre>
