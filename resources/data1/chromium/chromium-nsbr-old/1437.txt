<title>Issue 1437 -   chromium -    Styled buttons have extra padding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.gljakal.com/chrome/button.html">http://www.gljakal.com/chrome/button.html</a>           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    See the url for more information and screenshots.  This will probably be fixed by advancing to a newer version of Webkit but    in the meantime  are there any workarounds?     </pre>
