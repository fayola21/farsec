<title>Issue 20857 -   chromium -    Chromium does not add file extensions after picking a file with &quot;Hide extension&quot; on - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.4    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Hit cmd-shift-3 to make a screenshot  2. Go to <a href="http://imgur.com">http://imgur.com</a>  3. Try to upload the screenshot        It should upload.        &quot;That's not a valid image! Valid image types are:  jpg  gif  png  apng  pdf  tiff  bmp and xcf.&quot;    The reason for that is that screenshots are by default created with &quot;Hide   Extension&quot; on and chromium doesn't seem to tack the extension back on.     The same issue exists when attaching screenshots to bugs on crbug.   </pre>
