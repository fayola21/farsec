<title>Issue 4305 -   chromium -    Should restart in maximized  if closed from maximized window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.17 (Official Build 5160)  I thought we have a bug for this  but could not able to find one and filing  this as tracking purpose only as it works fine in ToT (0.3.155.0_4898)).      1. Start Chrome with magic_browzR option and maximize the browser window.  2. Exit Chrome and restart Chrome.      What is the expected output?   Chrome should restart in Maximized mode.    What do you see instead?  Restarts in un maximized mode.    Also please note  Selecting &quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot; does  not help to restart in maximized mode  though all tabs are restored.    P.S: Works fine with 0.3.155.0 (4898) </pre>
