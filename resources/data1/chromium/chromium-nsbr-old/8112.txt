<title>Issue 8112 -   chromium -    Gmail keyboard shortcuts for conversation navigation (p(revious)  n(ext)) not working in 2.0.166.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     0. Login to gmail.com and make sure &quot;Keyboard shortcuts on&quot; is set in   Settings.    1. Open a gmail conversation with many emails in it (e.g 15+). Click   &quot;Expand All&quot; if need be. Wait for all emails inside the conversation to be   fully loaded.    2. Try to go from the first to the last email inside the conversation with   the &quot;n&quot; keyboard shortcut.    3. Once you've reached the last email  try to &quot;go backward&quot; using the &quot;p&quot;   shortcut.        - &quot;n&quot; should navigate through all emails inside the conversation    positioning the small arrow at the top of each message.  - &quot;p&quot; should navigate &quot;backward&quot;        - &quot;n&quot; seems to work as expected only for the first 3 emails of the   conversation. For subsequent emails in the conversation  it will scroll   down.  - &quot;p&quot; does not seem to work at all      Please provide
