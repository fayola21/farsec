<title>Issue 14727 -   chromium -    No way to drag page url to another application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In other browsers  there's a &quot;page proxy&quot; icon in the URL bar that  represents the currently loaded page. It can be dragged to other  applications such as Mail to include a link with title  or even to  bookmarks to create a new bookmark. It's highly useful  I rely on it all  the time. Copy and paste isn't enough as that loses information (page  title) and doesn't automatically create a link on drop.    It also serves as an affordance for selecting the entire url in the url bar  when clicked.    There is no such page proxy in chrome and it really hampers drag and drop  being a first-class citizen. Where can we put it? </pre>
