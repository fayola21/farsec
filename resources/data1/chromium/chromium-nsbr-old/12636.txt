<title>Issue 12636 -   chromium -    bug in UI_tests.exe (gets stuck in hebrew enabled vista) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     run UI_tests.exe on hebrew enabled vista (not just with hebrew support  i   think it has to be a hebrew enabled one)      the UI tests finish at some point      it gets stuck in this window  and no matter what i chose  i have to kill   the process    the only way i found to solve it was to add  --extra-chrome-flags=--lang=en-US    i have a feeling i am the first one who tried to pass the UI tests  on a hebrew enabled machine..... if i am wrong  then apologies!    Vista32 (hebrew enabled) SP1 compiled with VS2008SP1        </pre>
