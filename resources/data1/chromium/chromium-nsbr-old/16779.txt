<title>Issue 16779 -   chromium -    Media layout tests failing due to codec differences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20548">r20548</a> (<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/149554">http://codereview.chromium.org/149554</a>) the try bots now use the   Chromium FFmpeg DLLs which only support Ogg+Theora+Vorbis.    For now we've had to disable a bunch of layout tests until we can figure out   a way to have either the try bots use the Chrome DLLs or we get the layout   tests fixed up to use Chromium-specific test clips.   </pre>
