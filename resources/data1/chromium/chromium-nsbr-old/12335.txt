<title>Issue 12335 -   chromium -    Matches locations on search on secondary scrollbars move when scolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.65  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?">http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?</a>  hl=en#e_ObwTAVPyo/modules/libjar/zipwriter/src/nsZipDataStream.cpp&amp;q=OnData  Available&amp;l=99  Other browsers N/A      1. open above URL (or any page with 'secondary scrollbars' i.e. not on the   mail client window)  2. search a term (e.g. moutput on above page)  3. note the yellow bars on the scrollbar(s)  4. change scroll position in sub-windows        yellow bars on the main-client-window-scrollbar remain fixed relative to   the total page length  independent of scrolling  (So probably this bug is caused because 'secondary scrollbars' use the   wrong metrics for calculating 'yellow-bar' positioning?)        yellow bars  move  disappear  are not positioned correctly  (are shown on   the wrong scrollbar on the page...)    (screenshot: hard to capture: when moving scrollbar-positioning-block    screenshot doesn't show yellow bar was there before and is not showing   match location on page.) </pre>
