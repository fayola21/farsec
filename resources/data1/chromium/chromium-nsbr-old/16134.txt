<title>Issue 16134 -   chromium -    Figure out a way to run some *unittests on the codepage other than 1252 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   I'm working on a CL for issue 14153 ( <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/151065">http://codereview.chromium.org/151065</a>   ). A part of the fix is to add a case to NetUtil*.FileURLConversion.    That case would not fail even without my corresponding fix   (FileURLToFilePath() in net_util_win.cc) if the default OS codepage is set   to windows-1252 (Western European). However  it'd fail without my fix with   the OS codepage set to windows-932 (Japanese) or any single-byte code pages   (1251  1255  1256  etc).       There are two ways to resolve this issue:    1. Add a Windows buildbot with the OS codepage set to something other than   1252. 932 (Japanese) may be a good choice. If we do this  we may just start   with running {base net}_unittests    2. Where it's necessary to run a test with the codepage other than 1252    add something similar to ScopedSetLocale (used on Linux in   sys_string_conversion_unittest). SetThreadLocale() and setlocale() can be   used to do something similar on Windows  I guess.    The advantage of #1 over #2 is that it may reveal some problems we haven't   known about. On the other hand  it's another bot to monitor and maintain   and it may be an overkill.               </pre>
