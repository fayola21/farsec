<title>Issue 20697 -   chromium -    NNTP: Link underline colors are not correct - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The NNTP has three different text colors:    Thumbnail label: This is black in the default theme and needs to stand out against the background.    Links: The link color is used for the list mode most visited sites as well as for the links in the recently   closed panel. This is also used in the links in the tip in the footer and the link in the sync  message. This   needs to stand out against the NTP background as well as against the recently closed panel background   color.    Link underline: The link underline color in the default theme is a lighter blue. This is so that the   underlines are not so heavy. Instead of providing a third color for the theme authors this color can be the   link color with some opacity. See below for sample HTML:    &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgba(16  50  105  .3);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-  decoration:none; color: rgb(16  50  105);&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </pre>
