<title>Issue 4416 -   chromium -    menus not displaying correctly because stylesheet cannot be opened by Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version 0.3.154.9        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open the page www.bungie.net/      The bungie homepage opens up and there are numerous 'buttons' to click to   navigate around the website.      The buttons appear as columns of text with click-able links  perhaps a   problem with with some type of java scripting between Chrome and the   website or something  I have no clue  I am not a computer wiz.    Here are some screenshots:    Firefox: <a href="http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=36730912vj7.jpg">http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=36730912vj7.jpg</a>  Google Chrome: <a href="http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=69515534pj5.jpg">http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=69515534pj5.jpg</a>    No amount of waiting helps  it just stays in those columns.  It also only   does this for this specific website  no other websites have this problem.     </pre>
