<title>Issue 21901 -   chromium -    Implement NPN_Enumerate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/plugins/netscape-enumerate.html    Layout test fails because we don't support NPN_Enumerate.    Was deferred from http://b/issue?id=849056:  But since I know of no plugin which depends on this functionality  I   recommend we defer. If there is a plugin which needs this  we already have a   layout test for it. </pre>
