<title>Issue 5655 -   chromium -    Chrome intermittently fails to execute Flash embeds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. In Chrome  open a tab that has some Flash object in it  such as a Gmail   inbox or a YouTube video or both   2. In another tab  open <a href="http://demo.apture.com/demo/chrome_flash_bug.html">http://demo.apture.com/demo/chrome_flash_bug.html</a>    which does the following:     1. Using Javascript  creates a DOM element     2. Sets the innerHTML of this element to the HTML for a Flash embed      3. Appends this element to document.body      4. Repeats several times   3. To increase the probability of failure  open more Flash objects in other   tabs (e.g. several Gmail inboxes).     At regular intervals  this test page appends a Flash embed to the document.   This Flash embed is entirely empty -- it is a new Flash Basic 8 project   where the only change was setting the background color to green to you can   tell if it loaded or not.         There should be a green box between each &quot;|&quot; character.         In Google Chrome  there are occasionally white spaces where the Flash   object failed to load. The frequency of failures varies depending on what   is open in other tabs  ranging from less than 1% to more than 50%.    Please provide
