Navigated to <a href="http://pop.6park.com/life3/messages/77915.html">http://pop.6park.com/life3/messages/77915.html</a>    Issue:  The site rendered with garbage .    Other Browsers:  IE7: prompts a  dialog saying that the machine is not having right fonts to  display the language characters and need to install corresponding language  pack. Chrome should also do something like that instead of rendering junk  characters.    Machine details: Windows XP Media center edition Version 2002 SP2      </pre>
