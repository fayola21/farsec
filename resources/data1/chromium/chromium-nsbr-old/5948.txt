<title>Issue 5948 -   chromium -    rest.co.il: restaurant picture doesn't change when clicking the different picture numbers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> url: <a href="http://www.rest.co.il/sites/Default.asp?txtRestID=3093">http://www.rest.co.il/sites/Default.asp?txtRestID=3093</a>    Other browsers:  FF3 Also fails    Bug Description:  1. Navigate down the page to the picture gallery where you can see  different pictures of a given restaurant.  2. Press one of the numbers to navigate to another picture.    The bug:  Nothing happens.    Analysis:  Clicking on a number takes you to the fGalleryNavClick() functionon line 69  of the main page. This function triggers a Javascript error due to the  apparent use of an IE-only feature.    The line:  oGallery.filters[0].Apply();    fails on Chrome &amp; Firefox  removing this line or adding an if() to only use  it on IE should fix the issue. </pre>
