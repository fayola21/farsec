<title>Issue 1164 -   chromium -    Using '=' for ':' to assign values for the styles is causing the issue  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;  URLs (if applicable) :www.brianmize.com  Other browsers tested: IE7         Safari 3:na      Firefox 3:na           IE 7:OK    some fonts that appear in my site in IE7 aren't being displayed in chrome     Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if   possible.    I'm not sure if this helps  but I use a CSS with the following parameters:    body {font-family=&quot;Franklin Gothic Book&quot;;        color=black;        font-size=&quot;11pt&quot;;}  h1   {font-family=&quot;Franklin Gothic Book&quot;;        color=black;         font-size=36;}  a:link {color:blue; text-decoration:none}  a:visited {color:green; text-decoration:none}    the links are colored correctly  but the font doesn't get applied.  Perhaps   it may be I'm using old style scripting perhaps  but I thought I would   mention it anyway.    Thanks   Brian Mize     </pre>
