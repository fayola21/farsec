<title>Issue 22728 -   chromium -    Confirm closing multiple tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21    Will this feature be implemented? sometimes I load plenty of tabs and other   applications at the same time and when I tried to close my application   sometimes I accidentally close chrome as well.    I know it is possible to reopen all the closed tabs but we need to consider   the bandwidth usage as well. What happens if I was opening 20 youtube pages?   I don't want to keep downloading the the videos again (which is the case most   of the time)   </pre>
