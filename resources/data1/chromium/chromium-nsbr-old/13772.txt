<title>Issue 13772 -   chromium -    Last few letters of address get cut off  forcing me into searching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Quickly enter a website address (say hello.com)  2. Right after you've finished  hit enter (to go to the address)        You go to said site (www.hello.com)        You end up the DNS error screen (Link appears to be broken) and you see   chrome tried browsing to said site  except it's missing the last few   letters (hello.co or hello.c). Of course google suggest what the correct   site should be  but we all know you didn't make a typo!    <b>Please provide
