<title>Issue 1861 -   chromium -    New tab page doesn't update properly when bookmarks are changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. On a profile with a single bookmark go to the new tab page (don't close   it).  2. Add a new bookmark.  3. Notice the original bookmark appears twice now on the new tab page.        Shouldn't see a bookmark twice on the new tab page.        </pre>
