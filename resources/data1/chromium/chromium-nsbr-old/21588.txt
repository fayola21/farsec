<title>Issue 21588 -   chromium -    Timeout browser-level keyboard commands if page isn't responding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load a very slow page  2. Attempt to switch tabs with ctl-pgup      Because we're waiting for the page to respond to the keystroke  the browser   never gets to process the keystroke.  The tab doesn't switch.    I propose for important &quot;get me out of here&quot; keys we don't wait for the   page when it's slow.  These keys are:  - Tab switching: ctl/alt + number keys  ctl + pgup/pgdn  - Tab closing: ctl + w  - New tab/window: ctl + n  ctl + t    This jank occurs in two situations  which maybe we want to handle   differently:  1) When the page is still loading  and it doesn't yet have enough of webkit   / the DOM going to actually process keys?  =&gt; should just time out   immediately  2) When the page is slow to respond?  =&gt; should time out in a very short   period      Negatives: note that if the page *does* eventually handle this key  you'll   have a &quot;phantom edit&quot; problem.  For example  webkit.org navigates on   alt+number key  so if we ever time out that key stroke on webkit.org (in   case #2)  we'll switch tabs away  and when you return to the tab you were   previously on it will have mysteriously navigated. </pre>
