<title>Issue 16068 -   chromium -    Persist bookmark IDs across browser restarts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.191.3    Bookmark IDs aren't persisted across browser restarts  making it difficult  to track and store data with them.  As mentioned in <a title="Allow extensions to store additional information with bookmarks" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14448"> issue #14448 </a>   persistent IDs (and HTML5 local storage) will allow extension developers to  add new functionality to Chrome's bookmarks.   </pre>
