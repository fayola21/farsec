<title>Issue 6154 -   chromium -    Select scroll-bar does not scroll properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a page with a select (combo-box)  ex: <a href="http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwEvent~Storms">http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwEvent~Storms</a>  2. Click the combo-box  scroll to the bottom    Expected:  The scroll handle moves to the bottom of the scroll bar when you scroll.    Actual:  The scroll handle is blocked at the middle of the scroll bar.    This does not happen on the release version  so it is a regression. </pre>
