<title>Issue 13263 -   chromium -    inspector crashes when using console.group in extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It crashes with an assert saying that the inspector isn't enabled.    void InspectorController::addConsoleMessage(ScriptState* scriptState    ConsoleMessage* consoleMessage)  {  &gt;&gt;    ASSERT(enabled());    This could be a bug in how we're initializing the renderer for extensions    but I'm pretty sure we've passed in all of the prefs that enable the   inspector. </pre>
