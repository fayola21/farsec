<title>Issue 9621 -   chromium -    Options dialog accessibility issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit SHIFT + ALT + T to set focus to the toolbar.  2. Right arrow to the wrench menu.  3. Down arrow to 'Options'. Hit Enter to activate.  4. Tab through the fields  using a tool like Inspect32 to track focus and view the exposed MSAA   information.        Issues:  1. No labels for checkboxes and radiobuttons  which means that there is none programmatically   connected to the corresponding field. Expected behavior: get_accName for each form field will   return the label string.  2. MSAA focus cannot get to the checkboxes or radiobuttons.  3.  CTRL + (SHIFT) + TAB will not switch tabs.  4. Blue labels to the left does not get picked up when tabbing around  which means that they are   not programmatically connected to the corresponding field. Expected behavior: get_accName for   each form field will return the label string (as appearing in each blue label).       </pre>
