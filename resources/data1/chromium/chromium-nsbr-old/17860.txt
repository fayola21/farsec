<title>Issue 17860 -   chromium -    TileImageInt appears to have rounding issues. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Draw a bitmap filled with vertical lines using TileImageInt (e.g tab   background)  2. Repeatedly draw the same bitmap while varying 'something' about the   canvas it's in (width  for example)  3. Observe spacing between vertical lines changing.    It looks like there are rounding/scaling issues when using TileImageInt;   changing the tilemode to kClamp_Tile stops the errors from occuring  but   also prevents tiling from working.    This is an issue for themes  which frequently have content lining up across   very different parts of the UI - these issues also cause flickering while   animation occurs (e.g. if a tab slides across the strip  the areas around   the tab repaint and sometimes get out of alignment with their base layer). </pre>
