<title>Issue 7970 -   chromium -    Print using inline script does not work (using onload probably works) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Regular Chrome 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : See attached          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open attachment  2. When print window pops up  go ahead and print  3. See that &quot;THIS IS BEFORE THE SCRIPT&quot; shows but &quot;THIS IS AFTER THE   SCRIPT&quot;    I tried in Chromium (2.0.163.0 (9601)) and it just stuck in my print queue   as &quot;spooling&quot; and never came out of the printer at all.    If you cancel that print window from step 2 then Ctrl+P to get it back    then it works. The expectation would be that it would start a thread that   waits for the page to finish loading before it shows the print window.         </pre>
