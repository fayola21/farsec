<title>Issue 7456 -   chromium -    Problem with maximize when multiple monitors present and one is (not the default one) portrait mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   0. I am using 2 monitors for developing  one monitor is in portrait  one is   in landscape mode  1. Use 2 monitors  rotate one of the screen to portrait mode (in my case it   will be 1200x1600 mode)  left the other at normal landscape mode. Set the   default display to the landscaped one. (so the videos  games will use that   display)  2. Open or drag the chromium to the portrait monitor and press maximize   button.        Resize to the 1200x1600 (and other portrait modes) mode        Chromium will resize to the landscape size  so it will be wider but smaller   than the current screen mode -&gt; it will resize to the 1600x1200 mode      Please provide
