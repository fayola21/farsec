<title>Issue 17950 -   chromium -    Title bar gradient too dark when chrome is not active app - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1      1. Make chrome not frontmost          The title bar should become about as light as the title bars of other inactive   windows (e.g. finder). Also  the non-frontmost tabs on the chrome window   should be even lighter than the titlebar gradient.    This is pretty visible when having two finder windows in front of chrome   and comparing their title gradients. It's also pretty visible in expose for all   windows (f9) when chrome is not active.        The title bar gets just a bit lighter. The non-frontmost tabs have the same   color as the titlebar. </pre>
