<title>Issue 15534 -   chromium -    Crashed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I walked away from my computer with chrome open with three tabs running.    1.  Facebook (home page) <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?">http://www.facebook.com/home.php?</a>  2.  Facebook (Mind Games) <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fbmindgames/play.htm">http://apps.facebook.com/fbmindgames/play.htm</a>  3.  Digg (page 1)    When I returned my computer had gone to standby. It has done this many   times before with no problems.   I restarted the computer and had a window indicating that Chrome had   crashed and asked if I would like to restart.    After I click restart It looks like it tries to run but then the window   returns.   </pre>
