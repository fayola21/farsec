Visit <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option</a>  2. Choose a value from the combobox to the right  3. Notice that once an option is chosen  the combobox list is still open and does   not close automatically.      Once an option is chosen  the combobox should only show the selected option and   hide the rest of the list.      The list remains open.    See attached screenshot. </pre>
