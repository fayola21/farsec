<title>Issue 21028 -   chromium -    Info bubble should not use corner images that assume a white background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am changing info bubbles to use the system theme color instead of   hardcoding it to white.  On dark backgrounds  the corner images look odd    because they antialias using opaque pixels and assume a white background.    The ideal solution here is probably to switch to the method that Ben is using   in the Omnibox2 popup to draw rounded corners via Skia instead of images.    Failing that these should become alpha-blended so they fit against any   background. </pre>
