<title>Issue 14810 -   chromium -    Italic Tahoma font doesn't look italic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0 (Developer Build 18896)  OS + version : Mandriva 2009.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit):32-bit  window manager : Gnome 2.26.1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Unknown      1. Go to a webpage whose default font-family is Tahoma  and at least a   chunk of it has font-style set to italic.      The font should be slanted; like any other font set to italic.      It looks just like anything else.    I attached a screenshot of my website. </pre>
