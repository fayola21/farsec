<title>Issue 14940 -   chromium -    reply.data.tabUrl does not match port.tab.url - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have an extension and during onConnect I save port.tab.url  and later I   compare it with reply.data.tabUrl to make sure it's still the same page.    Randomly this does not work  because port.tab.url is being urlEncoded.    For example  if the page is <a href="http://bleh.com/bleh(blah)">http://bleh.com/bleh(blah)</a>   port.tab.url will   *sometimes* be <a href="http://bleh.com/bleh%28blah%29">http://bleh.com/bleh%28blah%29</a>.    reply.data.tabUrl is always right.     </pre>
