<title>Issue 6844 -   chromium -    Consider starting renderer processes from a background thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> CreateProcess isn't usually very slow (actually  it's surprisingly fast)    but can be avoided. Sometimes  when the system is under heavy I/O load  it   can be slow  and this makes the app janky.    There is also some security token stuff for the sandbox or out of process   plugins that can't easily be moved away from CreateProcess or removed which   can be taken along. </pre>
