<title>Issue 16464 -   chromium -    Windowed plugins leak a window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Load a page with windowed plugin (diamondx or flash)  2. Use xwininfo to see the tree of windows involved  3. Scroll the page  4. Note that we're creating more and more windows    Dean made a test plugin on Windows that shows that Firefox doesn't call   SetWindow when you scroll.  On Linux  us doing this causes this terrible   leak.    I will investigate deciding when it's appropriate to call SetWindow. </pre>
