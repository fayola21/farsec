<title>Issue 14196 -   chromium -    mint.com login page doesn't render - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to www.mint.com  - click &quot;log in&quot; at upper right    expected:  - page looks reasonable    actual:  - page content is duplicated and strewn all over the window as if it's  missing CSS.    I sent them an email about it  their reply was that they only support  Safari 3 and Firefox 3 on mac. We need to reach out to them formally.    It appears ok on windows. I haven't tested Linux. This is dogfood for me  I  use this site daily. </pre>
