<title>Issue 21398 -   chromium -    Fix/create perf graphs for tab creation and related metrics - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Here's 8 weeks worth of New Tab UI performance graphing from the Mac:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/new-tab-ui-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/new-tab-ui-</a>  cold/report.html?history=1500    It's fairly flat.  There's a small amount of movement in there  so it's   measuring something  but it's not measuring new tab UI time.  I recently   found that the new tab UI was taking between 2 and 3 seconds  just for the   time between when the renderer made its first resource request and when   all of the resources for the NTP were satisfied and available in the   renderer.  With delays like that  it's preposterous for the test results to have   been in 500ms that entire time.  When I recently fixed that performance   nightmare  the New Tab UI performance graphs didn't budge.    Here we are on Linux:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release-hardy/new-tab-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release-hardy/new-tab-</a>  ui-cold/report.html?history=1500    Again  no real movement on that test.  My changes should have had some   impact on Linux too.  None measurable  according to these graphs    though.    The Mac and Linux graphs do show some larger changes if you go back   further  but I don't believe that the actual performance has been as flat as   the graphs indicate  and I don't believe that the Mac was ever in the 500ms   neighborhood until last week.    The Windows graphs do show more movement:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-single-core/new-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-single-core/new-</a>  tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/new-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/new-</a>  tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-single-core/new-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-single-core/new-</a>  tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-core/new-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-core/new-</a>  tab-ui-cold/report.html?history=1500    Outside of XP Dual  the Windows results are in the 700-800 ms range.  I   don't believe that Mac and Linux are that much faster than Windows on   New Tab UI performance.  The Windows numbers almost seem plausible   (speaking without having ever used Chrome on a single-core system)    although Vista Dual feels too high.    Something is very wrong here. </pre>
