<title>Issue 19580 -   chromium -    Chromium crashes opening urls - xcb_loc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (23615)  OS + version : Gentoo Linux 2008.1  CPU architecture 32-bit:  window manager : Metacity or Compiz        1. Start Chromium [any page set as home works fine]  2. Open a new url (both from bookmark search direct input)  3. Chromium crashes    Error reported in the terminal:    chrome: xcb_lock.c:77: _XGetXCBBuffer: Assertion `((int) ((xcb_req) -  (dpy-&gt;request)) &gt;= 0)' failed.  Multiple segmentation faults occurred; can't display error dialog    Seems related to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10525">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10525</a>  but that issue has been marked as solved.    LDD on chrome do not report any lack.    I got this problem from build 23544 but I'm not sure if that was happening  with previous ones. I'm quite sure it was working fine with 234xx     </pre>
