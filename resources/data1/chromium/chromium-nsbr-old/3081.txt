<title>Issue 3081 -   chromium -    JavaScript Error objects don't have 'line' property - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When errors are caught in Safari  they have a 'line' property which tells   the line the error happened on. In Chromium  they don't.    This is a useful feature for developers  and is required to avoid branching   some layout tests which rely on it. Also  not having it is a minor   compatibility issue.    Note that there is no spec for this property. In Firefox  the property is   called 'lineNumber'  and I don't believe IE has it at all. I recommend we   use 'line' for compatibility with Safari.   </pre>
