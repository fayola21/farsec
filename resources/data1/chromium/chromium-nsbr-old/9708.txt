<title>Issue 9708 -   chromium -    Need new import_bookmarks preference - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if the first run UI is not shown  users are not given an   opportunity to import their bookmarks.  As a result  users don't know they   can import their bookmarks at all.    We have two automatic importing options now to import the search engine and   import history  but nothing to import bookmarks.    We should add another &quot;distribution&quot; feature  &quot;import_bookmarks&quot;:    {    &quot;distribution&quot; : {      &quot;import_bookmarks&quot; : true    }  }    - If the bookmark import cannot be done (because another browser is open)    or fails  fail silently and move on.  This is equivalent to the current   behavior when the FRUI is not shown; no bookmark importing is done at all. </pre>
