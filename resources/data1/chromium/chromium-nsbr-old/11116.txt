<title>Issue 11116 -   chromium -    task leak in ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease in ui_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the valgrind ui bot  I'm seeing task leaks like this:    16 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost:  at operator new(unsigned int) (vg_replace_malloc.c:195)  by ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease() (child_thread.cc:116)  by ChildProcess::ReleaseProcess() (child_process.cc:53)  by RenderWidget::~RenderWidget() (render_widget.cc:72)  by RenderView::~RenderView() (render_view.cc:220)  by RenderWidget::Release() (ref_counted.h:80)    That line is      owner_loop_-&gt;PostTask(FROM_HERE  new MessageLoop::QuitTask());  which makes me wonder a bit... if that message isn't  causing the message loop to quit  what is?   </pre>
