<title>Issue 13282 -   chromium -    Search: editting Google default search causes malformed URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	3.0.182.3 (Official Build 17055)  WebKit	531.0  V8	1.2.5.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.182.3 Safari/531.0      1. Open the browser with Google as default search  2. Open the Tools &gt; Options &gt; Manage under Default Search  3. Hit edit for Google  4. Hit OK      Because nothing was modified  no changes should be apparent.      The icon for Google search becomes the blank white page icon.   Every time you perform a search with Google as the default search engine    with or without using the keyword (google.com if settings left unchanged) a   malformed url is generated:    http://http//www.google.com/search?rlz={rlz code}&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-  8&amp;q={query}    where {rlz code} and {query} are replaced by the browser's rlz code and the   user's query respectively.    The problem  of course  is the 'http//' preceding 'www.google.com'    Haven't noticed a problem with the other default search providers such as   Yahoo and Ask. </pre>
