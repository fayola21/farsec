<title>Issue 14737 -   chromium -    extensions API: allow to reopen closed tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enhancement suggestion:    void chrome.tabs.getClosed(void callback(Tab[]))    for getting data related with the recently closed tabs and make   chrome.tabs.create accept a Tab object as the first argument for easily   reopening them (or duplicating an already open tab).    The returned list would be in most-recently-closed-first order (as seen on   the New Tab page) and tabs from closed windows would be flatly listed left-  first (so that extensions which want to restore a whole window can fetch   all tabs with the same windowId in a row for getting the same effect as   reopening a closed window from the New Tab page). As a consequence    creating a tab with a currently inexisting windowId (re)creates a new   window. </pre>
