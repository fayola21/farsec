<title>Issue 8561 -   chromium -    CFBundleIdentifier should be org.chromium.chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium.app's CFBundleIdentifier is currently com.google.Chrome.  For  Chromium.app  we should use org.chromium.chromium (or  if you prefer   org.chromium.Chromium).    We can probably take advantage of Info.plist preprocessing to avoid having  to fork this into separate files (sucky) or roll our own custom  preprocessing step (sucky if we can use something that already exists). </pre>
