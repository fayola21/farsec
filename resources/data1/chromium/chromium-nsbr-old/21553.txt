<title>Issue 21553 -   chromium -    Mac default UI colors are not quite right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Disable Anti-aliasing in RenderThemeChromiumMac::paintMediaSliderTrack. (change       context-&gt;setShouldAntialias(true); -&gt;     context-&gt;setShouldAntialias(false);)  2. Disable the Gradient in code for the buffer bar. (change setFillGradient() to context-  &gt;setFillColor(startColor))  3. Rebuild  Run  and open a webpage with a media tag that has a default UI and a white   background.  4. Open up DigitalColor Meter and example the pixels making up the time slider      The color values are not quite right.      The panel background is (102  102  102).  Everything is drawn on top of that.  This is relevant   because the border and slider background have alpha.    The css defines that the border is (255  255  255  0.2).   channel values should be 132.6  (255 *   0.2 + 102 * 0.8)    The css defines that the border is (255  255  255  0.08).   channel values should be 114.24  (255   * 0.08 + 102 * 0.92)    The css defines the slider color is (50  150  223  1.0).  Since there is no transparency  this should   be the read in color.    In summary  the expected values (assuming rounding should be):    border: (133 133 133)    slider background:  (114  114  114)    buffer bar: (50  140  223).    However  the drawn colors are:    border: (132  132  132)    slider background: (125  125  125)    buffer bar: (66  149  225)    So  something is wrong..  However  the UI still looks &quot;okay&quot; so this is not a high priority. </pre>
