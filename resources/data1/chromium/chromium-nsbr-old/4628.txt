<title>Issue 4628 -   chromium -    Add ability to intelligently position newly created window when dragging tabs out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you drag a tab out we create a new window at exactly the same size as   the one you dragged the tab out from. This is particularly annoying when   dragging across different sized windows. We should offer the ability for   the user to choose different strategies for the size and location of the   newly created window as they are dragging the tab around. </pre>
