<title>Issue 10501 -   chromium -    AutomationProxy::GetLastActiveBrowserWindow seems to be flakey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I was testing one of my changes  which was eventually submitted as   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13312">r13312</a>  the try server always reported failure for the UI test I added. But   I could run the test successfully on local machine.    I found out the test failed on try server because automation()-  &gt;GetLastActiveBrowserWindow() returns invalid handle. I worked around the   issue by changing to automation()-&gt;GetBrowserWindow(0)  which turns out to   be reliable.    We need to fix GetLastActiveBrowserWindow() but it is difficult to repro.    In the mean time  I will change a few places that use GetLastActiveBrowserWindow(). </pre>
