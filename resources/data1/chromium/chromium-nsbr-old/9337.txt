<title>Issue 9337 -   chromium -    After update  all search engines are gone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0    Apparently  after update to 2.0.171.0  all my search engines have just   vanished (including Google)  and only one was there. (the second one was   added after I've come here for bug filing). See screenshot.    I am sure I didn't remove them manually. </pre>
