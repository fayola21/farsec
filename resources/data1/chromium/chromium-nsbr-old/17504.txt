<title>Issue 17504 -   chromium -    [Linux] Middle click link in gmail chat pastes primary selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open gmail  2. Type/paste in a link  3. Select some text on the page  4. Try to open the link in a new background tab by middle clicking        The primary selection is pasted into the chat box even though the click is   not on the box. The primary selection should only be pasted if the mouse is   in the textarea when the click occurs (I guess?).    Here's a page that demonstrates the behavior:    <a href="http://www.calebegg.com/files/test.html">http://www.calebegg.com/files/test.html</a>    Select the text and middle click the link. The link is in a div that   focuses the textarea onclick. </pre>
