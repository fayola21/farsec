<title>Issue 12429 -   chromium -    Reload does not refresh cached resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My brother reports that he was using the latest (as of 05/21/2009)  development release of Chrome on Windows. Although he confirmed that the  same problem is reproducible with the Beta version.    He was unable to view one of his commonly-visited websites (www.heise.de)   because Chrome was using a cached style sheet that had been corrupted.    Our best guess is that a broken transparent proxy served a corrupted style  sheet while he was using his laptop during traveling. Transparent proxies  seem to be getting more common and buggier :-(    Chrome probably cannot do anything about transparent proxies causing havoc   but I would have expected that reloading the page once he was connected to  a good ISP to fix the problem. It kept persisting though. I had him change  ISPs (i.e. DSL vs. 3G)  disable virus checkers  reload the page  hold SHIFT  or CTRL while reloading the page  and none of these fixed the page rendering.    Finally  I asked him to explicitly clear his cache  and the problem went away.    Chrome probably should automatically refresh cached resources if the user  initiates an explicit reload. </pre>
