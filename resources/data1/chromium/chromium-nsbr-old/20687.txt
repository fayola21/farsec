<title>Issue 20687 -   chromium -    Opening Link in New Tab should Give Focus to New Tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0                    1. Right Click a Link on a Page  2. Choose &quot;Open Link in New Tab&quot;        I'm probably opening this link in a new tab because I want to continue   exploring this site without losing what's in this current tab. So in order for   a smooth browsing experience I'd expect the new tab that was just created   to get focus.        The tab opens in the background  meaning now I have to click that tab    which isn't THAT huge of an inconvenience  but Chrome is all about convenience and simplicity  right? I mean  I suppose I may want to open it   in the back ground to look at later I suppose  but much more likely I'm   wanting to branch out my browsing to a new part of the site  and want to   automatically go to the new tab instead of staying on the old one.    I'm sorry if this isn't a significant enough issue to be posted here or if I   posted it wrong. It's just that I figured if I never said anything nothing   would ever be done. </pre>
