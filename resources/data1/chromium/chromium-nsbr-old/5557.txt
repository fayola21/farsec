<title>Issue 5557 -   chromium -    MouseClick (in image map) event object carries incorrect click position info - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK     I have found that mouseclick position seems to be reported incorrectly in  Chrome's event object when click occurs within an image map.   Both layerY  and offsetY (and likewise with the X coordinates) report the absolute  position of the click in client area rather than position of click within  the map element (i.e.  within the image).  Thus becomes more difficult to  reliably determine where click occurred within the image relative to left  upper corner of image  especially if image is nested within other elements  like divs/tables.  This behavior is distinctly different than both  Firefox/Mozilla and IE.   </pre>
