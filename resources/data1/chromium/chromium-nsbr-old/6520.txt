<title>Issue 6520 -   chromium -    InfoBarDelegates can leak whenever a tab is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The InfoBarDelegate interface has an InfoBarClosed method that stipulates   when called  the delegate can delete itself  and several places do this   (for ex  SSLInfoBarDelegate).     However  InfoBarClosed() is not called when a tab closes. Some delegate   implementations clean themselves up by listening to NOTIFY_TAB_CLOSED  but   others do not (like SSLInfoBarDelegate)  and leak as a result.     If possible  it seems like InfoBarClosed() should be plumbed up to fire in   these cases.      </pre>
