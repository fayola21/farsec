<title>Issue 18625 -   chromium -    Have an idea for the 'Even more' field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Stats.    That's right  navigation stats: most browsed sites  most lenghtly visited    most linked to  most linked from  most pages viewed  most downloads made    etc. - you know it. It should be interesting and innovating  too - everyone   has site stats  but browser stats  I've never seen. And if you're doing it    might as well do a Chrome://stats/ page and use that field just for preferred   stats. And since there always be concerns  make it optional  so everyone's   happy.    That's it  did I win the prize? I wanna t-shirt  at least! :) </pre>
