<title>Issue 22807 -   chromium -    cannot unmaximize window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS n l  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE  Behavior in Firefox 3.x : Normal      1. Dunno exactly how it happened.  I _did_ use the mouse to drag the   corners of the browser window into the corners of my right terminal window   so as to fill up the entire screen  but I didn't use the 'maximize' button   because that makes the browser fill both windows.    I did close the browser once daily (I've only been using it for 3 days) and   noticed that when I restarted it  it decided on its own not fill the bottom   of the screen (where the taskbar exists on my left monitor  but doesn't   cross over to the right)  at which point I (both times) dragged the bottom   of the browser down to the bottom of the window to again fill the right   screen.    Today when I started the browser  it now fills all of the _left_ terminal   window  including covering over the taskbar  and won't accept any resizing   inputs  including clicking on the 'maximize' button.  It will accept   'minimize' (sends it to the taskbar) and 'close' buttons  but no resizing   of any kind.    What I've tried so far:  1. I cleared browsing data ('everything' except saved passwords).  2. I changed from 8 'Open the following pages' to 1 'Open the home page'   set to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  3. I 'Reset to default theme' though I hadn't changed anything.  4. I've returned all the windows settings (from the 'KDE control module')    from 'Window Decorations' all the way down to 'Translucency' all back to   default -- no small annoyance...  5. I've returned all KDE Panel settings back to default ('Arrangement'   through 'Taskbar')  6. I restarted X.  7. I rebooted my machine.  8. I removed the '--enable-plugins' from the Chrome applet (didn't help so   I put it back) </pre>
