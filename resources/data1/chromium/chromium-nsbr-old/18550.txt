<title>Issue 18550 -   chromium -    Theme font colors in bookmark bar are not used in new windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.4      1. Set the bookmarks bar to be showing.  2. Install a theme with a dark background color and a light font.  3. Open a new window with Ctrl-N  by selecting Google Chrome from the   Windows Start menu  or by dragging a tab out of its current window to   create a new window.      The font color on the bookmarks bar in the new window will be the same as   that in the windows that existed when the theme was originally installed.      The default font color is used.  For themes with dark backgrounds and light   fonts  this means that it is very difficult to read the names in the   bookmarks bar. </pre>
