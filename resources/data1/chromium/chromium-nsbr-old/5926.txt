<title>Issue 5926 -   chromium -    RTL: Text in [New Tab] should be truncated from RightToLeft instead of LeftToRight - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces on both top of Trunk and Dev channels.      1. Launch Chrome for any RTL    Notice the text in [New Tab] [for eg: Thumbnails title  Recent bookmarks  and Recently closed tab's title] is truncated from Left to Right. It would  be nice  if we can truncate the text from Right To Left  so that the user  can notice the main title of a page in all of those mentioned sections.    -Screenshot attached.   </pre>
