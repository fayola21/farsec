<title>Issue 21005 -   chromium -    Other tabs don't paint while a tab is loading (throbber spinning) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate/reload a slow-loading website  such as a particularly slow   google-internal code review site.  2. While loading  try to do something on another tab  such as gmail or   twitter (ie  &quot;same origin&quot; is not an issue).  3. Wait for slow-loading tab to finish loading.      other tabs should be usable while slow tab is loading.      While slow-loading tab is loading (throbber spinning)  other tabs do not   paint. After the slow-loading tab finishes (throbber stops spinning)  other   tabs paint  immediately reflecting any events that have happened there.   That is  even though not painting  they seem to be invisibly responding to   events.    Please provide
