<title>Issue 22095 -   chromium -    Excessive X invalidations of tab contents when it loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using gtkparasite  there are many re-paints of regions that look to be   unnecessary    Renderer region repaints when   1) tab bar gains focus   2) menus (wrench  back  etc) are clicked   3) right-click context menu is drawn (this happens in other apps tho)     4) When chromium loses focus  entire window (renderer + browser 'chrome')   repaints   5) When releasing wrench menu  both wrench and page buttons repaint   6) When entering or exiting the 'x' hover region on inactive tab  tab is   drawn 3 times </pre>
