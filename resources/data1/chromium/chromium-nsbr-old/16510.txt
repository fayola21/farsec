<title>Issue 16510 -   chromium -    web site update locks up other tabs? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. load <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/console">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/console</a>  2. scroll to the bottom and hit the merge link to enable merged mode  3. open a second tab and load something log  say   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Mac">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Mac</a>  %20(valgrind)/builds/59/steps/valgrind%20test:%20unit/logs/stdio  4. use the scroll wheel to scroll up and down and keep doing so        At some point  the scrolling will hang  the other tab will show it's spinner   as it's starting to reload the console.  Since the render should be in   another process for that tab  it's not clear why we're blocking our ui for   this update.  maybe it's something about the ipc of the dibs?  maybe we   send more then one update as the page render  just sorta a bad   experience.    might be worse the larger the window is  didn't investigate. </pre>
