<title>Issue 17560 -   chromium -    Clicking a link that results in a download from Gmail makes a tab that won't close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Possibly related to <a title="After drag-install of a .crx file  browser won't close" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12745"> issue 12745 </a>.    Go to a Gmail email and click a link that results in a download (email me if   you need an example). It will open in a new tab and the download bar will be   visible in that tab  and the URL will be &quot;about:blank&quot;. This tab will be   unclosable and the browser won't exit. Even if you close the download bar    drag to tab to another window  etc.    If you navigate to another URL from that tab  it will close. </pre>
