<title>Issue 22709 -   chromium -    Regression: chromium issues list displays inaccurate results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome stable build and Firefox stable build.    I bookmarked the chromium issues list page with the options &quot;All Issues&quot;  and &quot;sort down&quot; set so I can see the latest info. but SOMETIMES (most  times) when viewing the results  some issues are missing etc so I use  Firefox to check this specific page.    I saved 2 pictures (went to the page in Google Chrome  then went to the  page in Firefox one second after) which shows the problem. The first  picture displays the results in Google Chrome and the second picture  displays the results in Firefox. As you can see  Firefox has all the  modified issues etc and Google Chrome does not.       </pre>
