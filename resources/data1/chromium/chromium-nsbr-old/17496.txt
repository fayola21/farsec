<title>Issue 17496 -   chromium -    git-cl should show moves properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a reviewer  diffs sent by git folks are hard to review when they have   moved files.  gcl.py shows the status of deleted files as &quot;D&quot; and in the new   location  only what changed is colored.  git-cl just shows the deleted files   as &quot;M&quot; and the new location is all shown as new.  This makes it very hard for   a reviewer to look at what actually changed.  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/155905">http://codereview.chromium.org/155905</a> is a good example.    It's totally fine for people to use whatever source control mechanism that   they want.  But the tools they use need be up to par to the existing tools    so that reviewers can properly review their changes.    &lt;/rant&gt; </pre>
