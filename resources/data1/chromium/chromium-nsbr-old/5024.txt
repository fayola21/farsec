<title>Issue 5024 -   chromium -    remove ATL dependencies from webkit/activex_shim - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to remove ATL dependencies from Chromium so that people  can build it with Visual C++ Express.    webkit/activex_shim uses CComPtr and friends from ATL.    One alternative to removing the ATL dependency from this code (which looks  painful) would be to make the use of the activex_shim to be a compile-time  switch so that developers could easily build without it. </pre>
