<title>Issue 3415 -   chromium -    Scrollbars not appearing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was reported to my today from one of my coworkers using 0.3.154.0:      1. Navigate to <a href="http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-web-toolkit-doc-">http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-web-toolkit-doc-</a>  1-5&amp;s=google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5&amp;t=ReleaseNotes_1_5_Rpc  2. Put the laptop to sleep. Wake it up (repeat a few times).  3. At some point he noticed that the scrollbars on the page were missing   (see chrome-scroll-bug-1.png) even though the page was scrolled down.  4. Maximize  Restore did not fix the problem.  5. Resizing the window made the scrollbars appear  but they were drawn only   partly so he was still unable to scroll up (see chrome-scroll-bug-2.png).  6. Reloading fixed the problem.     </pre>
