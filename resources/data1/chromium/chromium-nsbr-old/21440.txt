<title>Issue 21440 -   chromium -    Preferences should remember current tab pane - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1      1. Open Prefs  2. Select 2nd tab  3. Close Prefs  4. Open Prefs        2nd tab should still be selected.        First tab is selected. This is pretty annoying  since a) all other apps i use   remember this and b) most of the times i use the prefs dialog is to use the   &quot;get themes&quot; button  so i have to switch tabs every time i open the prefs   dialog </pre>
