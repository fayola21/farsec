<title>Issue 17390 -   chromium -    Find in page - when backspacing  it keeps beeping even when field is empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> if i replace a beeping character by selcting it and retyping it (i use a   Hebrew letter in an English page) it doesn't beep because the field has the   same string after the change    why should holding the backspace button pressed beep endlessly when the   characters are already gone? </pre>
