<title>Issue 8143 -   chromium -    Proxy config for Linux (ProxyConfigServiceLinux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ProxyService::Create currently has this pattern:    #if defined(OS_WIN)    return new ProxyService(new ProxyConfigServiceWin()                             new ProxyResolverWinHttp());  #elif defined(OS_MACOSX)    return new ProxyService(new ProxyConfigServiceMac()                             new ProxyResolverMac());    There are two classes we need for Linux.    The first  ProxyConfigServiceLinux()  is the bit that hooks system proxy   settings into Chromium.  It ought to obey http_proxy from the environment   and whatever system settings for proxy Gnome uses.    The second  ProxyResolver*  is being made general in <a title="Implement custom PAC support leveraging V8" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2764"> issue 2764 </a>.  We can   pass NULL for the second argument to ProxyService() until that is figured   out. </pre>
