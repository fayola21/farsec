<title>Issue 20349 -   chromium -    Audio cuts out early near end of the clip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Find a clip that has audio to the very end.  Drum loops are a good  example (try searching for &quot;free drum loops&quot;)  2. Set the clip to loop  3. Add event handlers for timeupdate and ended events to examine how far  the clip has progressed versus when the ended event fires.  4. Play the clip      Depending on the size of the audio buffering  I've seen the clip fire  'ended' and loop back to beginning as much as 1 to 1.5 seconds before the  clip has actually ended.  We should be getting much closer to the duration  before firing 'ended'. </pre>
