<title>Issue 6821 -   chromium -    Replace ScreenToClient and ClientToScreen with MapWindowPoints to make Chrome RTL-proof - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b/682902&gt;    According to  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getwr/steps/WRG_mirror.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getwr/steps/WRG_mirror.mspx</a>    to take advantage of 'automatic' mirroring by Windows  we should use   MapWindowPoints in place of  ScreenToClient and ClientToScreen.  This will   make Chrome BiDi / RTL-proof down the road.    From Peter:  We fixed some of these but we should probably still audit the code to see   if there are more of these.    From Idan:  It is certainly true that it is not a good practice to use   ScreenToClient()/ClientToScreen(). However  the Chrome mirroring   infrastructure doesn't really rely on the HWND mirroring support and   therefore the fact that we do call these methods from a few places in the   code is  at least as far as I can tell  harmless. Thus  the priority of   this bug shouldn't be P2 since there is no impact whatsoever on the UI.    We should replace the aforementioned calls with calls to MapWindowPoints()   sometime in the future in order to follow the known l10n conventions.     </pre>
