<title>Issue 6858 -   chromium -    Rework &quot;phantom newline&quot; code in Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our anti-phantom newline code isn't perfect.  For example  try double-  clicking  then on the second click  don't release the mouse  but instead   start dragging to the right.    I think the fix is going to be to go back  rip out all code relating to the   phantom newline  and then  * Draw over it at the same time we EraseTopOfSelection()  * Ensure our text content/length getters and all code that uses them ignore   it   </pre>
