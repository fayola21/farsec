<title>Issue 18543 -   chromium -    bookmark button autosizing wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. show bookmark bar  2. right client and add folder  3. name it &quot;test&quot;        The folder I get displays as &quot;t...&quot;  so the sizing seems wrong.  slightly longer   names avoid the &quot;...&quot; so the size calc must be off by a tiny amount and some   strings strip it up. </pre>
