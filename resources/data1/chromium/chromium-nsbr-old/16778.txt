Make sure Chromium is the default web browser (System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Preferred Applications)   2. Start Chromium on Workspace 1  3. Switch to Workspace 2  4. Start Terminal and type <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  5. Right click on the above link and chose Open Link.      The link should open in chromium on workspace 1 and user should be notified   by flashing the program in task bar in workspace 2 so the user can click it   and user is switched to workspace 1 with open linked.      The link opens in the chromium on workspace 1 but user is not notified so   seems like nothing happened.   </pre>
