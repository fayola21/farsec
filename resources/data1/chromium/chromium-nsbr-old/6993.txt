<title>Issue 6993 -   chromium -    Support user theme metrics for OpaqueNonClientView - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The XP frame-drawing code is now pretty agnostic towards the actual   dimensions of things like the window border and titlebar height.  It would   be nice to enlarge our border images (or tile them in some way) and just   support the user's theme metrics  so that if people make their window   borders or titlebars bigger/smaller  we'll just obey that.    Super bonus: splitting the caption button images up in a way that makes   them tileable  and scaling them to match the user caption button sizes (may   not may sense given their shape difference from the standard XP caption   buttons).    Very low-priority. </pre>
