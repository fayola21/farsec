<title>Issue 7678 -   chromium -    [New Tab]'s Recently closed section should honor all combinations of clicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a new issue and never worked.    With different combination of clicks on a link in recently closed sections  of a [New Tab] should honor accordingly to the click combinations.    Eg:  1)Alt + Click/Alt+Enter Key -&gt; should bring up 'Save Page as' dialog box.   2)Ctrl + Click -&gt; should open the link in background tab  3)Shift + Click/Shift +Enter Key -&gt; should open the link in new window  4) Ctrl + Enter -&gt; should open the link in New tab in background    Right now  for all of the above key combinations  we always open the link  in the same tab.    PS: We honor the above key combinations in case of &quot;Recently Bookmarks&quot;  section. </pre>
