<title>Issue 21940 -   chromium -    Change the Windows Slaves to be Quad core instead of Dual core. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm sure there is a way to change the vmware settings to have the windows   slaves be quad core.    I tried in the past  and it blue screened  but  it might be just that it   needs more configuration.    That could eventually speed up the build.    Bev: Can you take a look on the new server racked?    Reassign to me if you can't make it work or don't have time!     Thanks </pre>
