<title>Issue 8422 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Problems installing?&quot; link to the 'Flash missing' infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A top reported issue is that users don't realize they need to close Chrome   to complete the Flash install. We can't change the Flash install UI  but we   can try to notify them when they hit this problem. To do that  we want to   add a link to the missing plugin infobar that points to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95697">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95697</a>  (see attached screenshot) </pre>
