<title>Issue 12215 -   chromium -    High rate of page faults for Win2003 x64 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;a few of us have hit what appears to be bug a in Chrome. i don't have repro   steps yet but eventually one of the processes starts hard faulting endlessly.   i haven't had this problem on Vista x64 or our old XP boxes so it may be   particular to Win2003 x64. should i just get a memory dump from the offending   process or is there some better way of filing a bug?&quot;     </pre>
