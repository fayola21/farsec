<title>Issue 12459 -   chromium -    Extension image transcoding saves all images as PNG - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a result of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11680">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11680</a>  we   re-encode images from an extension in the browser.  However  regardless of   the input image type (GIF  JPG  PNG  etc)  we write them out as PNG with the   same filename (ie  foo.gif will actually be a PNG).    This is not a problem so far  since we ignore file extensions when loading   these images in the browser.  But it is pretty lame. </pre>
