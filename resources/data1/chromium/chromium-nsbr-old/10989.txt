<title>Issue 10989 -   chromium -    Some keys stopped working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 2.0.171.0 (Official Build 12323)    A bunch of keys just stopped working  in Chrome only.  I cannot type 's'   't'  'c'  'h'  'v' in any type of input in Chrome (I've tested the omnibox   text input  contentEditable region).  This is true for all tabs  including  new tabs.  Everything is fine in my other apps.    I have no idea how to repro this  it just started happening.  Exiting and  restarting Chrome made the issue go away.  Sorry for the somewhat useless  bug report  but it seemed worth having on file. </pre>
