<title>Issue 9848 -   chromium -    linux: unable to use selection copy/paste between chromium windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) open chromium and navigate to google.com.    2) Select text on google.com    3) Use middle mouse click to try to paste into the search box.    We hit a dcheck in render_widget_host_view_gtk since the selection is now  cleared (by the middle mouse click?).    My guess is we need to not send the middle mouse click to webkit if we're  doing a paste (i.e.  the middle mouse click should either be sent to webkit  or paste). </pre>
