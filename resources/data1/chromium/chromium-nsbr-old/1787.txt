<title>Issue 1787 -   chromium -    &quot;Application shortcuts&quot; made from an incognito window open a normal window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Use Chrome to login to Gmail normally  2. Create an application shortcut  3. Logout from Gmail  close Chrome  4. Use the new application shortcut to start Gmail  5. Gmail is started in a non-incognito window        Application shortcuts created from incognito windows should start up   incognito windows. Also  since creating an application shortcut saves   information about your incognito browsing (the target URL)  a warning might   be desirable before actually creating the shortcut.        Application shortcuts created from incognito windows start using a non-  incognito window.     </pre>
