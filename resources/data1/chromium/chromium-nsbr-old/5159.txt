<title>Issue 5159 -   chromium -    Image loading causes appearance to scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to an image-intense page  2. Scroll down before the page finishes rendering  3. Watch everything jump around  4. Profit?      The browser will try to maintain a stable viewport      The scrollbar stays at the same absolute position  causing the content  you're trying to see to &quot;fall&quot; out of view    This is particularly annoying when reading forums with images - the link  includes an anchor  but after the page finishes loading  the anchor you  were linked to is pages below what you're looking at. </pre>    </td>  </tr>          <tr class="cursor_off">  <td class="vt issuecomment">        <span class="author">Comment <a name="c1"  href="#c1">1</a>  by  <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/u/jasneet@chromium.org/">jasneet@chromium.org</a></span>   <span class="date" title="Fri Jan  9 17:07:38 2009">Jan 09  2009</span>   <pre> Please provide
