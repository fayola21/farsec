<title>Issue 23030 -   chromium -    Opened a web page and could not close down the tab window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Well  there was no security breach  it is just annoying  that you cannot   close the window when a malicious site opens in your browser tab. I have   attached the complete site in a file and the URL  where the site resides.    So  you open the page  and then you cant close the tab. If you detach the tab   into another Google Chrome window you cant even close the main Chrome window.    The only solution is to SHIFT+ESC and kill the associated process.
