<title>Issue 10538 -   chromium -    Rendering issues in Wordpress editor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.5  URLs (if applicable) : Any Wordpress Install        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK    Note: Everything was working fine before I updated Chrome to the new   version  so I'm pretty sure that's a problem with the new version.      1. Login to Wordpress Admin  2. Click New Post  3. Switch to HTML editor OR try to enter a custom field        - HTML Editor : When you enter HTML mode  you're supposed to various   buttons to add a link or insert HTML tags.  - Custom Field : When you add a Custom Field  you're supposed to see what   you add. :-)          - HTML Editor : Buttons are here but are completly empty.  - Custom Fields : You can write in the &quot;Value&quot; field  but you just don't   see it... It's invisible. The text you enter might appear if you highlight   it  or if you place your cursor on it  sometimes (like in the screenshot).       </pre>
