<title>Issue 8521 -   chromium -    Google Search Features page looks malformed in Chrome/Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html">http://www.google.com/help/features.html</a>           Safari 3 [3.2.2 (525.28.1)]: OK      Firefox 3 [3.0.7]           : OK           IE 7 [7.0.5730.11]     : OK      1. Visit <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html">http://www.google.com/help/features.html</a>  2. Look at the sub-headings of Weather  Stock Quotes  Time  Sports Scores    etc...  3. Notice that  in Chrome  these sub-headings are far over to the right.        One would expect that  as in the other browsers  these sub-headings would   appear to the left  as the designers likely intended.        These sub-headings appear far over to the right  which looks really  really   odd.        I have attached four screenshots for each of four different browsers    including Chrome  to illustrate the point. </pre>
