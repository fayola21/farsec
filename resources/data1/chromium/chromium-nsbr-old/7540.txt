<title>Issue 7540 -   chromium -    chrome fails to work across some network problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : Any           Safari 3: not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        Chrome seems to hold on to some network information (DNS server addresses?)   longer than other browsers  which can lead to it not working while other   browsers do.    1. This morning  I connected my laptop via my home WiFi network and used   Chrome for web mail. Worked fine. I closed/slept the laptop  keeping the   browser open. I got onto a WiFi-enabled bus and got connected to its   network but Chrome could not continue the web mail session. I ended up   starting Firefox and found that it worked fine but Chrome continued to not   be able to load anything. I got to work  connected to the LAN  and the   Firefox browser still worked fine while Chrome still could not connect at   all. I closed all Chrome windows  opened new ones  and then Chrome worked   fine again.    2. We recently had a lot of networking problems with our DSL provider.   (Earthlink DSL in Santa Clara  CA) Eventually I got help(!) from a phone   support person who found that at that time we could connect using dotted-  decimal addresses but not with normal domain names  and he gave me DNS   server addresses which I entered into our Linksys WiFi router. Since then    our home network is mostly operational again  although sometimes it still   fails  and some of those times I can use dotted-decimal addresses while   occasionally even that fails.    I observed that when the network failed and came back after a couple of   minutes (by itself or by me power-cycling the modem and/or router)  Chrome   would be stuck while other browsers would continue to work. I am pretty   sure that I did sometimes have Firefox open before as well as during the   network failure; occasionally also IE 7. Closing all Chrome windows and   restarting Chrome got Chrome to work again too.    In summary  Firefox and IE seem much more robust against network (DNS?)   failures or configuration changes while the browsers are open than Chrome    to the point where if I used only Chrome I would believe that the network   is down much more often than it actually is.    I tend to keep a number of tabs open  which makes this behavior especially   painful.    Question:    Is it possible that Chrome has a DNS server address cache that is never   released  or not for a long time? Or could it be some other setting that it   holds onto? It should try to get fresh configuration data  especially when   it can't connect to any of the configured DNS servers  or maybe generally   when it can't connect to the network.     </pre>
