<title>Issue 8416 -   chromium -    Address bar no longer gets focus on opening new tab/window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab or window (either through Ctrl-N or Chromium shortcut)            The cursor should focus on the address bar so that you can start typing a   URL or search query.          The focus appears to be somewhere in limbo - pressing Tab once takes me to   my first &quot;most visited page&quot; link so it is somewhere between the address   bar and the first &quot;mvp&quot; link.  So each time I open a new tab or window I   now have to click in the address bar before I start typing.    Please provide
