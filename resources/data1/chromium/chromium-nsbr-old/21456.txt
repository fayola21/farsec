<title>Issue 21456 -   chromium -    Web sites are able to open a full-screen windows that the user can't dismiss - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.207.0 (Developer Build 25570)  OS + version: Arch Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: Metacity  URLs (if applicable): <a href="http://www.stonephotography.ca/">http://www.stonephotography.ca/</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): untested      1. Visit <a href="http://www.stonephotography.ca/">http://www.stonephotography.ca/</a>.  2. Click ENTER SITE.  3. Try to close the resulting window.      Chrome should expose some mechanism for closing the window -- either the   regular window decorations or some other kind of close button. (Firefox   opens a complete window including URL bar and status bar.) F11 or ESC   should force the window out of full-screen mode.      There is no GUI for closing the window. The user must know the keyboard   shortcut to escape. Even the keyboard shortcut will not work if Flash has   grabbed focus in the new window  as in the example. F11 doesn't toggle   full-screen mode. An inexperienced user could very easily get trapped in   the new window with no way to exit. </pre>
