<title>Issue 13712 -   chromium -    Page elements overlap at bottom of page in auto.sina.com.cn - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 3.0.184.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17844">r17844</a>)  URL = <a href="http://auto.sina.com.cn/z/gzhighlander/index.shtml">http://auto.sina.com.cn/z/gzhighlander/index.shtml</a>    IE 7: OK  FF 3: Not OK  Chromium: Not OK  Safari 4: Not OK      1. Go to <a href="http://auto.sina.com.cn/z/gzhighlander/index.shtml">http://auto.sina.com.cn/z/gzhighlander/index.shtml</a>     What is the expected output?     No layout problems.    What do you see instead?    Page elements overlap at the bottom of the page. It looks like the elements  at the bottom are not positioned correctly.  Because this page looks  correct only in IE  I make the assumption that the site developers might  want to test the site against other browsers.  Therefore  I'm marking this  an Evangelism issue.    The renderer emits the following output to the Javascript console:  ------------------------------------------------------------------  &lt;table&gt; is not allowed inside &lt;tbody&gt;. Closing the current &lt;table&gt; and  inserting the new &lt;table&gt; as a sibling.    See attached picture.   </pre>
