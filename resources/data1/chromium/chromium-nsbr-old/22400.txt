<title>Issue 22400 -   chromium -    odd bar appears at the bottom of each window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2    OS version               : 10.6.1    An odd whitish bar appears at the bottom of each Chrome window. This   happens even if I create a new window or quit and reopen Chrome. Even   stranger is what happens when I resize the window. It's hard to describe  so   I've attached a movie  but basically the whitish bar stays where it is with   respect to the bottom of the screen but as the window size changes the bar's   position moves up over it and becomes gray instead of whitish. I'm not sure   what caused this; I'm pretty sure it wasn't there when I first opened 4.0.211.2. </pre>
