<title>Issue 3072 -   chromium -    Scrolling a page with different plugins is not smooth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to http://tswinappserver/chrome/plugins_testing/all_plugins/Plugins_page.html  2. Try to scroll through the page by holding and dragging mouse button    What is the expected output?   Should be able to scroll through the page smoothly    What do you see instead?  Scrolling through the page is very bad    FF3/IE7/Safari4 seems to work better than Chrome       </pre>
