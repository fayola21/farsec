<title>Issue 11086 -   chromium -    Easily determine link target - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When clicking on a link in a web page  there's no way to know whether the   result will be a new window  a new tab  or remaining in the existing tab.  Is   it possible to either make the mouse pointer icon vary depending on the link   target  or perhaps have that information in the status area.  Alternatively    would the proposed extension system support this kind of thing?   </pre>
