<title>Issue 20020 -   chromium -    User Scripts load after the page is loaded... They take long to open! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : ALL            Firefox 3.x:OK          1.Add any user script  2.Load the site and watch      User Script should be enabled before the page appears to the user      First page loads   then slowly the user script appears   LOL chrome is so fast that it loads pages faster than loading user script.    I tried Deviantart Cleaner V6 (user style . org) and u too can check how slowly it works        </pre>
