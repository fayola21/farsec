<title>Issue 10665 -   chromium -    Font fallback should eventually fall back on fontconfig - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebKit generally manages font fallback (consider CSS rules)  so when it   requests a font by name we should not allow fontconfig to do font fallback.    However  if it finds no matches at all  we ought to allow fontconfig to do   its best effort at matching.  This is conceptually simple but the APIs   involved (webkit  skia  etc.) make it difficult.    agl suggested in <a title="Don't depend on msttcorefonts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9100"> bug 9100 </a> that FontCache::getLastResortFallbackFont() could   pass a magic font name so that skia could know to do this behavior.  This bug   is a tightening of <a title="Don't depend on msttcorefonts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9100"> bug 9100 </a>.    I have a patch (contributed by Dan Erat) for this. </pre>
