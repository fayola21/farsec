<title>Issue 15509 -   chromium -    GoogleUpdate.exe: The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I frequently encounter this error on a Windows XP machine. An error dialog   box pops up with title &quot;GoogleUpdate.exe - ApplicationError&quot; and message &quot;The   application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142). Click on OK to   terminate the application.&quot;.    It seems to appear periodically  with frequency of ~2 hours (very   approximate).    I attached an exact screenshot of the message in case it helps.    I was not sure how to mark/assign this bug. Feel free to adjust it. Please   let me know how can I help diagnosing the problem.   </pre>
