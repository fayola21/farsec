<title>Issue 8277 -   chromium -    Chrome does not launch first-run second-tab if launched with a parameter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When launching Chrome for the first time with a URL parameter  the second   tab with the &quot;welcome&quot; page does not show.    1.  Install Chrome.  (Close it when it auto-launches...note that the   welcome page 2nd tab does launch.)  2.  Delete the first-run sentinel  3.  Launch chrome from the command line with 'chrome.exe   &quot;http://www.cnn.com&quot;'  4.  Notice that Chrome is launched  search bubble appears  but second   &quot;welcome&quot; tab does not appear.    In theory  the second 'Welcome' tab should appear in this case.  Is this   the intended behaivor?  This seems related to the separation between   chrome.exe and setup.exe.     </pre>
