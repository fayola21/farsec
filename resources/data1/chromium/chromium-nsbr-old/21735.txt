<title>Issue 21735 -   chromium -    Report line number in case of extension errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For some kinds of extension errors  we don't report the line number:    - Validation errors to extension APIs  because we throw an error inside a v8   extension  which becomes the source.    - Asynchronous errors from extension APIs.    In both cases  we can get the correct stack information by creating an   exception  then catching it and trimming the last line or two from the stack. </pre>
