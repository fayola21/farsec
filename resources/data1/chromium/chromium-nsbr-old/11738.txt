<title>Issue 11738 -   chromium -    Implement Linux BookmarkBubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we have a placeholder BookmarkBubble widget.  We need to  implement the real thing  and wire up everything to the bookmark system.    One UI piece that I had worked on  and wanted to pass along.  Windows uses  this link-style widget for &quot;remove&quot;.  There is a GtkLinkButton  however  it  is pretty much designed to only open URIs in a browser (with a  application-global URI hook).  It is not really usable for our purposes.   It is really just a button that contains a label  so we can probably  reimplement the functionality.  There are some things you have to handle   like changing the label state on mouseover  and doing the underline on the  pango attributes. </pre>
