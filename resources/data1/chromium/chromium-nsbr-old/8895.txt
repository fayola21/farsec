<title>Issue 8895 -   chromium -    100% CPU usage on Myspace profile and 11MB of RAM left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?</a>  fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=67483231  Other browsers tested: IE7  IE8         IE8 RC1 : FAIL          IE 7 : FAIL    When i view a certain Myspace profile that has lots of videos and pictures    and i scroll down the page  chrome pauses for about 10 seconds  then   scrolls down the page. Then chrome freezes.   I don't think my pc is slow because it's a p4 2.8ghz with 512mb ram and i   closed antivirus and all other programs that were running. When i visited   the Myspace profile and pushed ctrl atl del and looked at my pc's   performance  it said it was using 100% cpu usage and i only had 11000 K out   of 515056 K Physical memory left.   The particular Myspace page that causes this high cpu and ram usage and   delay in scrolling is located here:  profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=6748323    I had to ctrl alt del Chrome because it was still frozen after 1 minute of   waiting.     </pre>
