<title>Issue 18106 -   chromium -    get and ship latest xdg-mime once it supports setting MIME type handlers on KDE4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Chrome under KDE4.  2. Use Chrome's UI to set it as the default browser.  3. This might not make Chrome the default for opening HTML files.        Part of being the default browser is that Chrome should be the default   application for HTML files. </pre>
