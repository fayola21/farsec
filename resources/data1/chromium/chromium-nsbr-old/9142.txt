<title>Issue 9142 -   chromium -    complement and comments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>         i like google chrome for its simplicity and ease of use. and most   importantly  the start up of the browser was fast   and surfing to website   is a breeze ... nice work   google team ...     as compared to other browser like internet explorer  opera  firefox  and   safari  it is definitely a good browser that stands out on its own.   although  in some cases  there seems to be lack of features found in other   browsers  it is however good enough for surfing and general browsing.   although its good to have more useful features and configurable option    however  to add more of it might impair the google chrome slower and less   responsive  and more error prone ?     to conclude  i believe google chrome  with the rest of google service like   google search  blog   reader etc  stands out to be one of the best free   service option for users in the world...     cheers google :) :) :)     nice work : ) :) :)  </pre>
