<title>Issue 5858 -   chromium -    chrome-resource scheme was mistakenly replaced with chrome:// - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/12418">http://codereview.chromium.org/12418</a> replaced the chrome-resource   scheme with chrome://  which clashes with the existing chrome:// scheme   used by Mozilla.    I believe this was simply a mistake  and should be reverted. </pre>
