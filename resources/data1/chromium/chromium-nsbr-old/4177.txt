<title>Issue 4177 -   chromium -    Hammer gets confused when you redefine COMPONENT_LIBRARY_DIR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Gears SConscripts redefine COMPONENT_LIBRARY_DIR to be one that   includes the target architecture and OS.  This confuses Hammer and/or   SCons  and libraries can no longer be found.  Running with --implicit-deps-  changed seems to fix the problem  but has drawbacks.    A simple workaround that works for me is to manually call   env.Install('$COMPONENT_LIBRARY_DIR'  lib).         </pre>
