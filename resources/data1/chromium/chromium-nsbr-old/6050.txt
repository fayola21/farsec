<title>Issue 6050 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Dump render tree&quot; and &quot;Dump body text&quot; menu items to Linux test_shell. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think I recently encountered some message that it should have them  and   after short look at the code it looks doable.    I have some work in progress which should be ready to post to review in few   days. </pre>
