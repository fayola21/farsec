<title>Issue 19229 -   chromium -    Chrome does not forget proxy settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : tot  Ubuntu Karmic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit      1. Set http proxy in gnome-network-settings  2. Browse  3. Move to non-proxied network  4. Unset http proxy in gnome-network-settings  5. Browse      Browsing works without proxy.      Browsing does not work; requests time out.    This happens consistantly when using http proxy on a network  then moving   away and attempting to not use the proxy.  A browser re-start fixes the   problem. </pre>
