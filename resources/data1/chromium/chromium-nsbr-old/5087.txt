Spun off <a title="drag and drop links on German systems" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4049"> issue 4049 </a>  2. Not sure if this issue will go away after we fix <a title="VK_OEM_3 should not be used as accelerator." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3696"> issue 3696 </a>  so file a  separated one for it    Build: 0.4.154.29 (Official Build 6138)     OS: Any    Other Browsers:    Safari: N/A  Firefox3: N/A       IE7: N/A    Pre-steps:  Add both English keyboard and German keyboard on OS    Steps:  1. Launch English Chrome  2. Switch keyboard to English   3. Observe the shortcut key for &quot;Debug JavaScript&quot;  4. Switch keyboard to German  5. Observe the shortcut key for &quot;Debug JavaScript&quot; again    Result:  Step3: Shortcut key is Alt+`   Step5: Shortcut key is Alt+��__    Expected:  We didn't change Chrome UI language  but the shortcut key changes when the  keyboard changed  it might confuse user. Is it better we use some locale  neutralized key and keep it consistent between different keyboards?    Notes:  It also happens when switch keyboard to French  Italian  Spanish  Russian       </pre>
