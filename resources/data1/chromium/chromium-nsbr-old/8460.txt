<title>Issue 8460 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Additonal commands on context menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Please add an additional commands on context menus such as:  1. Open (Ctrl+O): under Wrench icon  I hardly knew that Chrome can able to open html files using keyboard   shortcut. I'm much more in Opening and browsing in browser.    2. Undo Closed Tab: when right-clicking on the Tab title.  I knew there are several ways to undo closed tab  but please add this on   context menu such as Ctrl+Shift+T/Open new tab then choose to open a closed   tab  but please made it a shortcut on right clicking on the Tab title just   like in FF.     3. Properties: when right-clicking (on images).  It's really annoying to save an image just to know their   dimensions/size/image type then clean it later. </pre>
