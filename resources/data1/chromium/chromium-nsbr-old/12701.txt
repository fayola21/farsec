<title>Issue 12701 -   chromium -    Ability to set a new icon for an experimental group - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a way to experiment with a different set of desktop shortcut icons to   see if changing the icon to something more recognizable improves our   retention rate.   I think the right way to do this is to include a few icons in a build and   then have an install time decision to choose one of them based on some   experimental criteria.    The first step is to get some experimental icons which I will work on. </pre>
