<title>Issue 17844 -   chromium -    [Download shelf] Downloaded items buttons should resize in the download shelf if the downloaded filename is short  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J61)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 3.0.196 SNV Revision: 21633  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Download a file with a small name (eg: leaks.zip).      Expected:  We should get a button in the download shelf for the downloaded file. The button should resize   based on the length of filename.    Actual:  We get a button which is too big for the filename. Hence more than half the button is blank.      This feature is the same on both Windows and Mac.  According to <a title="[Mac download shelf] No download items" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14659"> bug 14659 </a> we have an upper limit for the size of this button.     </pre>
