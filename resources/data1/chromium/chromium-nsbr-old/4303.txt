<title>Issue 4303 -   chromium -    Maximize doesn't position the window properly with the taskbar on the side of the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have my task bar on the left side of my monitor. When I maximize Chrome    it leaves a blank area between the task bar on the left and the Chrome   window to the right. The width of this area is identical to the width of   the task bar. It seems to work properly when the task bar is on the bottom. </pre>
