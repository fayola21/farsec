<title>Issue 14166 -   chromium -    Chrome issue with WebGolf Package - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You may be interested to know that commercial package WebGolf (used by a   lot of GolfClubs in Ireland) has some problems with Chrome - specifically   only half of time sheets showing up. When Chrome users contact WebGolf they   simply reply per below and encourage folks not to use Chrome.    May be worth someone contacting WebGolf to address what must be a straight   forward issue as I know from folks who have had this issue that they are   simply avoiding Chrome as the solution and sticking with IE.
