<title>Issue 11504 -   chromium -    Linux clipboard memory leaks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was re-reading some of the base/clipboard_linux.cc code recently and I  noticed several memory leaks. I didn't bother to fix them because of our  plans to completely re-write it. This bug is just a placeholder to remind  me to fix it up if for some reason we don't wind up re-writing it. </pre>
