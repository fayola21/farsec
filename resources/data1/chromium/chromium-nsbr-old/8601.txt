<title>Issue 8601 -   chromium -    Reduce utf8 &lt;-&gt; utf16 conversions in Linux omnibox. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Windows code and rich edit works in utf16 (well  maybe ucs2 for the   edit control).  The model and surrounding code expects to work in   std::wstring.  This means that in a few places where the windows code has a   cheap accessor  we are doing a utf8 -&gt; utf16 conversion  since all of our   GTK code is working in utf8.  There are probably a ton of super inefficiencies here that can be solved with a little bit of reworking. </pre>
