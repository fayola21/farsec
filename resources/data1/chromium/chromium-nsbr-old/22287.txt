<title>Issue 22287 -   chromium -    Startup tests leak chrome processes on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I added 5 new startup tests related to extensions. For some reason  running   the startup tests on Mac leak chrome processes. The startup tests wait for   the processes to die  and eventually times out:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Mac/builds/2">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Mac/builds/2</a>  101/steps/startup_test/logs/stdio    This bug is about figuring out why the new startup tests result in leaked   processes on Mac  but not Windows or Linux. </pre>
