<title>Issue 14296 -   chromium -    [www.lady8844.com]: Texts overlap. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.lady8844.com/xiangshui/">http://www.lady8844.com/xiangshui/</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?  Not sure if this is an issue of Chrome or of the design of the page.  Pay attention to the rolling texts  some pieces are overlapped  as the   attached picture showing.          What is the expected result?  Texts should not overlap any other.            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. visit <a href="http://www.lady8844.com/xiangshui/">http://www.lady8844.com/xiangshui/</a>  2. scroll down  find the rolling text part  3. wait to see the messed texts.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  IE6: OK  IE7  FF3  Maxthon2: bad  as same as Chrome    Please provide any additional information below.  I guess this might be an issue of the web design? IE6 could display it   well  so no harm to have a look at it. Thanks!       </pre>
