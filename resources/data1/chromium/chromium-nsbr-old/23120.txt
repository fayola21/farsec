<title>Issue 23120 -   chromium -    New tab creation should take &lt; 250ms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open Chrome (especially on a lower-end machine)  load a bunch of tabs  2.  Try creating a new tab.      New tab takes &gt; 250 ms to load (sometimes seconds).  NTP loads in slowly.    New tab should create instantaneously.    This may be related to mature profiles  and may be a dupe of <a title="Startup should take &lt; 250ms"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23117">bug 23117</a>.   </pre>
