<title>Issue 1022 -   chromium -    Secondary popup (via alert()) shows in top left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Firefox 3: OK          IE 7: OK    1. Load a page with a popup that pops a new popup doing alert()    Popups should &quot;animate in&quot; as usual  and THEN show the alert also down  there I guess.    Popup animation is skipped  and second popup comes in top left part of  screen.   Code for &quot;alert-popup.html&quot;:  &lt;script&gt; if (!location.search)   window.open('alert-popup.html?' '' 'width=300 height=99'); else { //trigger second popup   alert(location.search);   window.open('alert-popup.html?2' '' 'width=300 height=99'); } &lt;/script&gt;  </pre>
