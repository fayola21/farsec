<title>Issue 20101 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar always appears in new tab page although &quot;always show bookmarks bar&quot; is off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2 (Official Build 23795)  OS + version : Goobuntu  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : xfwm4        Not sure how I did it  but I toggled the bookmarks bar a few times and now   it's off for every page  but the NTP still shows it.     1. Press ctrl-T to open a new tab  2. Observe the bookmarks bar  3. Navigate to some URL  4. Bookmarks bar has now disappeared        Bookmarks bar setting is global and affects NTP as well.        New tabs get the bookmarks bar until I navigate away.     </pre>
