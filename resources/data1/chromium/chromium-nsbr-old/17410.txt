<title>Issue 17410 -   chromium -    If a content script listens to no DOM events  it can get GC'd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create an extension with a toolstrip that has a button which  when clicked    opens a message port to the currently selected tab and sends a message. In   the content script  have a listener which logs to the console and/or   appends something to the bottom of the document. In general this works   fine  except in the following cases:    A) If  before clicking the button in the toolstrip  you first open the   javascript console. Reloading the page doesn't fix this as long as you keep   the console open. If you close the console and then reload the page  then   it works.     B) If you launch the browser giving a URL on the command line. It will work   if you reload the page though  or for other tabs you subsequently open.    This was happening with a Debug build done with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21203">revision 21203</a>.     I've attached a zipped up directory with a test extension that can be used   to show this problem happening.    </pre>
