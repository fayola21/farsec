<title>Issue 9559 -   chromium -    FTP browsing fails with 3rd party ad blocker in use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.0 (12844)  URLs (if applicable) : Any public FTP (<a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org">ftp://ftp.mozilla.org</a>)  Other browsers tested: IE7 (Vista x64)  IE8 (Win7 x64 build 7068)              IE7: FAIL            IE8: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK    I use a 3rd party application for filtering advertisments on the web - Ad   Muncher (www.admuncher.com).  When browsing FTP with Ad Muncher running    the connection fails.  This also happens in IE7 and IE8.  Firefox 3.0.8   browses FTP just fine.      1. Install Ad Muncher (<a href="http://www.admuncher.com/download.shtml">http://www.admuncher.com/download.shtml</a>)  2. Browse any FTP site  3. Watch the connection fail      Normal FTP browsing      Connection seems to fail. (Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown error.)    I tested this on a WinXP SP3 32-bit VM with Ad Muncher installed  and both   IE and Chrome are able to browse FTP normally.  It seems to only fail on   Vista/Win7 with Ad Muncher installed.      If any more information is needed  please let me know and I'll provide what   I can. </pre>
