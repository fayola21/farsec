<title>Issue 8569 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: emusic.com: Load Images Despite 404 Header Response - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;             Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Load Page  2. Load Image      Display image in page      Broken image icon displayed    eMusic.com serves &quot;no album art&quot; img's with a 404 response but includes  generic album art contents.  Historically all browsers have supported this   but with the latest builds all I get is a broken image when used inline but  works if loaded individually.  I believe something has been updated in  WebKit cores since it happens with the latest Chrome beta builds and I  believe Safari 4.  I would appreciate any help  thanks.    The album art on this page currently doesn't load inline:  <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Four-Gods-Amateurism-MP3-Download/10953374.html">http://www.emusic.com/album/Four-Gods-Amateurism-MP3-Download/10953374.html</a>    Here it does display the image despite 404 response:  <a href="http://images.emusic.com/music/images/album/284/109/533/10953374/300x300.jpg">http://images.emusic.com/music/images/album/284/109/533/10953374/300x300.jpg</a>    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found  Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1  Content-Type: image/gif  Content-Length: 5310  Date: Mon  09 Mar 2009 19:22:26 GMT  Connection: keep-alive    GIF89a  ?       </pre>
