<title>Issue 12675 -   chromium -    Password autofill not triggered in some cases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Navigate to a page that has a login form. (ex: gmail login)  2. Save that page (with the save as menu)  3. Login to the page (so we store the password)  and click on the info-bar   to save your password  4. Copy the saved page to a local HTTP server (such as Tomcat or Apache)  5. Navigate to the page on your local server  note that the login form   should not be filled  6. Type your user-name then click on the password field    Expected:  The password if filled in the password field.    Actual:  The password is not autofilled (nothing happens).    Notes:  The password autofill is designed such that it does not autofill a   user/password form automatically if the URL from where the password has   been saved does not match the URL of the page where the form appears.  In that case  the user needs to enter its user-name and the password is   autofilled when the focus leaves the user-name field.     </pre>
