<title>Issue 14723 -   chromium -    [Mac] Single click on chromium location bar does not select the contents of the location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Does not select the contents of   the location bar.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (windows): Selects the contents of the location   bar.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (mac): Does not select location bar (configuration   option available  see browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll in about:config).  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Selects the contents of the location bar.  Behavior in Opera for Mac and Windows: Selects the contents of the location   bar.      1. Open a chrome/chromium window  2. Single click at a random point on the location bar  without selecting   any text.   3. Notice that the contents of the whole location bar does not get selected   on chrome for mac.      A configuration option to enable single clicking to select the whole   contents of the location bar  should be added. Firefox has this option by   setting &quot;browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll&quot; to true. This option is set to   false on mac  and true on windows by default.       The contents of the location bar does not get selected. Some people are   used to the &quot;click selects all&quot; feature from other browsers(opera mac    configurable in firefox mac) and other platforms (opera chrome firefox on   windows)    </pre>
