<title>Issue 21737 -   chromium -    Split up base/sys_info_posix.cc  base/debug_util_posix.cc for Mac and Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  we have sys_info_posix.cc and sys_info_mac.cc.  We also have   debug_util_posix.cc and debug_util_mac.cc.    We have neither sys_info_linux.cc nor debug_util_linux.cc.    We should keep the common POSIX definitions of the functions in the _posix   files as needed  but we should stop #ifdefing implementations of functions   that diverge.  Instead  we should move the Mac implementations of these   functions to the _mac files  and we should introduce _linux files and move the   Linux implementations into there. </pre>
