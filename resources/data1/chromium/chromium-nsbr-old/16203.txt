<title>Issue 16203 -   chromium -    Translations site does not work in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookdown.pl">http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookdown.pl</a>  2. Type a word in the text field  hit enter.  3. Nothing happens.      In other browsers  this submits the form and a translation appears  but in   Chrome  even spoofing another user-agent  this doesn't work.    This may be related to the fact that this form uses the &lt;ISINDEX&gt; tag   instead of a typical form &lt;input&gt; tag.  Most likely an evangelism issue.    FF3: OK  Chrome 2.0.172.33: Not OK  Safari 4: Not OK </pre>
