Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/zeitgeist08">http://www.youtube.com/user/zeitgeist08</a>      Video should play without any issue      XP SP2   Pentium 3 machine with 512 MB RAM :   On loading the page it plays fine. But when i try to forward the video at   some point  it responds and forwards the video at that point. But when i   click on back point (rewind) it doesn't respond. I see plugin unresponsive   message. After waiting for few seconds i try to play the video but it   doesn't respond. Waiting more it finally plays for sometime then stops.   Then page hangs.    Vista Business  Pentium 4 with 2047 MB RAM :  playing the video had no issues like forwarding/going back. video was   playing fine  but on scrolling the page video paused and plugin   unresponsive message popped. after that video was fine.
