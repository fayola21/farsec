<title>Issue 16067 -   chromium -    Ctrl+N in an Incognito window should open an incognito Window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an incognito window  2. Press ctrl+N to open a new window    What is the expected output?   I'd expect an incognito window to open  since I'm browsing in incognito mode  and   that I wouldn't have to use &quot;ctrl+shift+n.&quot;      What do you see instead?  A normal window opens.    Notes  This is 100% consistent with the behavior described in the keyboard shortcuts.  That   said it's just somewhat counter intuitive (as a user)  when I'm browsing in a window   that's in incognito mode I'd expect that new windows I'd open would be in the same   mode (just like when I press ctrl+t to open a tab  that tab is in incognito mode...   which make sense since it's in the same window). </pre>
