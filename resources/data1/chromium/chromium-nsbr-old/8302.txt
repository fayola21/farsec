<title>Issue 8302 -   chromium -    Clicking on past end of line in text box not placing cursor at end of line in large text boxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1             Safari 3: Not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    When editing a large text box with a scroll bar (e.g. large wiki page)   clicking the mouse past the end of line (i.e. to the right of the last   character of text on that line) works as expected on the first display-able   portion of the text box (without scrolling the box down)  (&quot;as expected&quot; =   places the cursor after the last character on the line)    When trying to edit a lower portion of the text box (scrolling it down by a   page) when you click the mouse past the end of line the cursor does not   change position to the last character on that line  instead it places the   cursor approx 35-40 lines lower in the text box. </pre>
