<title>Issue 20833 -   chromium -    Chrome Mac should use Mac editing behaviors instead of Windows editing behaviors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some editing behaviors are controlled by a setting  such as:  1) Clicking below the last line of an editable area puts the caret at the end of the last line on Mac  but   in the middle of the last line on Windows.   2) Pushing the down arrow key on the last line puts the caret at the end of the last line on Mac  but does   nothing on Windows. A similar case exists on the top line.    The setting is set based on PLATFORM(MAC)  so Chrome  no matter what platform  falls back to Windows   behaviors. See WebKit/WebCore/page/Settings.cpp where it sets   EditingMacBehavior or EditingWindowsBehavior depending on PLATFORM(MAC). The right fix is probably to change   PLATFORM(MAC) to OS(MAC)  but that will need buy off from WebKit (maciej?).    This issue causes at least the following LayoutTests to fail:  LayoutTests/editing/selection/click-in-margins-inside-editable-div.html  LayoutTests/editing/selection/click-in-padding-with-multiple-line-boxes.html    Another bug showing a symptom of this: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20029">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20029</a> </pre>
