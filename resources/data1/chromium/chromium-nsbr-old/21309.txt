<title>Issue 21309 -   chromium -    Find Highlights and Dom Changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Find highlights go bad if the DOM changes underneath it.    1. Create a few gmail &quot;from&quot; filters.  2. Go to gmail / settings / filters  3. Do find &quot;from&quot;.  4. Without dismissing the search  delete one of the filters.  5. Hit the find windows 'next' button (&gt;).      The find count should have decremented by 1  and the find highlight should   have jumped to the next find. Instead  it has the same count  and highlights   are nowhere to be found.     </pre>
