<title>Issue 5261 -   chromium -    Add MacCyrillic to the ICU data file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We unforked TextCodecICU.cpp after putting in some changes to the file in   the upstream (<a href="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22116">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22116</a>)  but left alone    a part of the file adding macryllic aliases which we don't include in our   copy of ICU.     This leads to a crash in the debug build (release build is ok).     Adding it increase our data size by a few to several kBs. Until we persuade   the upstream to make those aliases conditional on 'ENABLE_MAC_ENCODING' (or   something like that)  let's just add maccyrillic table to our copy of ICU.     An alternative is to comment out two lines in our copy of TextCodecICU.cpp    but it's forking it 3 days after unforking it.  </pre>
