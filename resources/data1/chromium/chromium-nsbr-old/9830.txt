<title>Issue 9830 -   chromium -    Backing store gets lost - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chromium splash page  2. Click on a link  3. Press the &quot;back&quot; button.      This should navigate back to the splash page.  Instead  it gives a gray   page.  According to Evan  we're somehow losing the IPC channel or the ACK or   something so the backing store never gets created. </pre>
