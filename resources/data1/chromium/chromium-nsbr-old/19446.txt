<title>Issue 19446 -   chromium -    Tab to search should reject non-http[s] schemes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I went to dell.com a few times to look at a few things. It has a search   box that we recognise and add it to the &quot;tab to search&quot; box.    But this now disables &quot;site&quot; searches in Google. If I type    site:dell.com foo  it will actually do a search  ignoring my &quot;site&quot; specifier.    I suspect the first item is being treated as a URL  and then we compare   the host names or TLDs.    It seems like we should also add a check for &quot;http&quot; here  and if it's any   other scheme  not default to tab-to-search. </pre>
