<title>Issue 16921 -   chromium -    Chrome won't load any page  even startup page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.194.0  OS + version : ubuntu 2.6.24  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : KDE    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): opens pages  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): opens pages    I'm not sure what happened - I had a power event while everything was open  and when the computer came back up Chrome would open but not load any page  at all.  Nothing.  Not the splash screen  not a webpage  nothing.  I tried  removing and re-apt-get installing it  but that didn't help.  I cleared all  my browsing data and that didn't help  either.  It's basically completely  worthless at this point  forcing me back to firefox. </pre>
