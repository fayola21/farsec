<title>Issue 6764 -   chromium -    Importer unit test should test importing search engines on IE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The importer unit test (importer_unittest.cc) tests the importing of search   engines for Firefox 2 and 3 only  not IE.  It should test for IE as well.    Note that in order to do that we'll probably have to mock the Windows   registry.      Imported from Buganizer #1169230 </pre>
