<title>Issue 12789 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't resize windows when screen resolution changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.1  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable) Safari resizes the windows when   the screen resolution shrinks.        1. Set your screen resolution to something high  or connect a large external   monitor.  2. Open a window in Chrome and make it large.  3. Set your screen resolution smaller than the window size.      The window resizes so that it's within screen boundaries.      The window doesn't resize. It remains too large to fit on screen.   </pre>
