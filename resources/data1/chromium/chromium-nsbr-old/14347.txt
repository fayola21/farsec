Clicking on the sale conditions link below the form (http://espace-  client.voyages-sncf.com/leisure/fr/popup/conditions_vente_utilisation_vsc?  rfrr=MesInformationsPersonnelles_body_Conditions%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rales%20de  %20Vente%20et%20d'Utilisation%20du%20site%20voyages-sncf.com) opens a tiny   pop-up window. It's impossible to notice the text inside.          What is the expected result?    The pop-up window should be wider.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Clicking on the link below the form  2.   3.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes  it works in FF 3.0.8 : the pop-up window is roughly 800x600 which is   enough to read what's inside.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
