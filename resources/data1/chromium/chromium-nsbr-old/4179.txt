<title>Issue 4179 -   chromium -    Search does not highlight hits in recent builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0  URLs (if applicable) : ALL  Other browsers tested: NA      1. Start chromium  2. Search for something (using ctrl-f)  3. Cycle through hits with return key      You expect (and alder versions did this correctly) to see the hit   highlighted.      There is no highlighting  however once you pres esc the latest hit is   highlighted.    I am running windows vista sp1 64bit   if you need any more info ill gladly give it but i cant think of anything   atm.   </pre>
