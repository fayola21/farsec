<title>Issue 16009 -   chromium -    Cleanup media::Pipeline error handling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the media pipeline enters an an error state  it should gracefully fail   and do nothing instead of aggressively DCHECKing (which crashes the   renderer).    This can be accomplished with the help of a Null Object pattern where we   delegate all method calls to an object which does nothing. </pre>
