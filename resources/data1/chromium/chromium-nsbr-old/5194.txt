<title>Issue 5194 -   chromium -    Memory tests not producing data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The memory_test.exe (running on the perf buildbots) is producing 0 values   for all data except the commit_charge.    This has been going on for quite some time (weeks/months).    The output also contains the error  [1205/160527:ERROR:memory_test.cc(63)] Error preparing temp directory for   test    which may or may not be related.
