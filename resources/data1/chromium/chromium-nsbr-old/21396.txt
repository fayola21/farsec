<title>Issue 21396 -   chromium -    Warm up a plugin process (for Flash) early - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is like <a title="Warm a renderer up early during the startup process"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21395">bug 21395</a>  which is for providing a warm renderer process.    Flash takes a while to start up.  If we could keep a plugin process for Flash   around  preloaded  waiting and ready to go  the load time for sites using   Flash would improve.    The twist here is that it's probably not worthwhile to just warm up a generic   plugin process  and we're not currently equipped to do that anyway because   the plugin process needs to take the plugin name on the command line.  We   could perhaps refactor things so that all platforms used a &quot;plugin zygote &quot; but   the lion's share of plugin initialization time (at least in the case of Flash) is   probably in Flash itself. </pre>
