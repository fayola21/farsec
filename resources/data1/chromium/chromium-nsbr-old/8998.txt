<title>Issue 8998 -   chromium -    Scrollable TBODY with FireFox 3 but not Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Versions : 2.0.170.0 and 1.0.154.48 (and previous versions)  URL: <a href="http://karl.lalancette.googlepages.com/ScrollableTBODY.html">http://karl.lalancette.googlepages.com/ScrollableTBODY.html</a>        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL       Any table having a fixed height TBODY with overflow:auto  ...and enough rows to overflow the fixed height TBODY.      A fixed height TBODY with a vertical scrollbar.      A full length TBODY without scrollbar  :(    Additional information:  IE7 will even do worst than Chrome; it will apply the TBODY fixed height to   the rows if the TR height is not defined! :| (Fixed for the screenshot)  If you look the source of my example  the third column filled with spaces   in THEAD and TFOOT is a tweak to prevent the horizontal scrollbar on TBODY    in FireFox 3.  Note also that FireFox 3 is the only one that displays the TBODY borders I   defined :| </pre>
