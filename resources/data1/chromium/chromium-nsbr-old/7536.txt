<title>Issue 7536 -   chromium -    Strip CRLFs more completely from merged WebKit files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> During a WebKit merge  a file that is merged but has no conflicts ends up   with CRLFs if the merger is using kdiff3 (maybe BeyondCompare too).    When svn calls kdiff3  it's actually calling a wrapper script (or two    depending on your OS). While we wait for svn:eol-style to be applied   upstream -- or even after it is  in case some files slip through there --   it should be pretty easy to move the force-LF code from merge.py out into   the wrapper script  so it gets applied whether or not there are conflicts   to resolve.    This is in addition to setting svn:eol-style=LF on WebKit files  which is <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23631">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23631</a> .
