<title>Issue 9079 -   chromium -    xiaonei.com: the 2nd dropdown list is not changed according to the change of 1st dropdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1 (Official Build 11427)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://reg.xiaonei.com/register.do">http://reg.xiaonei.com/register.do</a>           Safari 4 (41759): Not OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Go to above URL  2. Input some text in &quot;��_��_��_��_��__��__��_���&quot;  then select an item on &quot;_��__��__��_&quot; and &quot;��__��__��__&quot;    now two dropdown lists will display on &quot;��_��___��_��_��_&quot;  the 1st dropdown is   province  the 2nd is city. When user selects an item from province  the   list of city should be changed according to the change of province.  3. Select an item from 1st dropdown (province dropdown)      The 2nd dropdown(city dropdown) should be changed accordingly        The 2nd dropdown is not changed  if repeat step 2 and 3  then the 2nd   dropdown is reflecting the previous change of the 1st dropdown.    This issue happens in all version of Chrome. In Safari 4  the 2nd dropdown   keeps unchanged all the time  so it is different with the issue in Chrome. </pre>
