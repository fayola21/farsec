<title>Issue 17099 -   chromium -    UI to set the minimum  font size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.195.0 (Developer Build 0)                  Google Chrome fonts are too small for me to read.    Most browsers have a way to set a minimum font size.  I prefer the way that the   Firefox extension NoSquint works  which zooms text only (not images) in  and   doesn't mess up a page layout most of the time  which minimum font sizes seem to. </pre>
