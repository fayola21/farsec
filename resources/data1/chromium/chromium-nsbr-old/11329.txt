<title>Issue 11329 -   chromium -    WebCore/platform/graphics/FontCache.cpp needs to be unforked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the version that chromium uses is different from WebKit and this needs to be fixed.    Removing this fork will cause a ~20% perf hit for the international page cycler.  The internatonal   page cycler test intentionally uses more fonts than users are likely to use  so the perf hit isn't   something that users would notice in browsing scenarios.     </pre>
