<title>Issue 20089 -   chromium -    Suggestion: old window should disappear when a recently closed tab is reopened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a window (lets call it window 1)  2. Open several tabs in window 1  3. close window 1  4. Open a new window (lets call it window 2)  5. reopen window 1 from the recently closed section  6. Notice that Window 2 is still open and has no value  7. Notice that it is annoying to close window 2 since window 1 appears in front of it.         Since window 2 has nothing on it  then it shoul disappear when window 1 is reopened.        Window 2 stay open with nothing but the New Tab page on it.     <b>Please provide
