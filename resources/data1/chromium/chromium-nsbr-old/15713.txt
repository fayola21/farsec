<title>Issue 15713 -   chromium -    Background window frame flickers fighting for focus. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a window and setup a Google calendar event so that a notification will   pop up.  2. Open another tab and drag it to its own window. Place this window in front of   the first window so that there is some overlap between them.  3. Switch to another application and wait for the calendar popup to fire up.      The notification should bring the calendar window in front of the second window.    The actual behavior is that the calendar window is now in front of the second   window  but the two chrome windows are sort of fighting for focus so there is   some flicker in the frame of the window that was previously in front.
