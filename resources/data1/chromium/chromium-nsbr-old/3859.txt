<title>Issue 3859 -   chromium -    Investigate extension matching  instead of content sniffing  for FTP resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When receiving a file over FTP  Chrome currently treats it the same as a  case of a HTTP resource received with no Content-Type headers  and indulges  in content sniffing without paying any attention to file extensions.     This means that .TXT or .EXE files may be - quite confusingly and  counterintuitively - rendered as HTML when accessed over ftp:// Although  it makes sense from a technical standpoint  it violates the principle of  least astonishment. A different  more reasonable logic is applied to local  files  where extensions are taken into account.    The same behavior is followed by MSIE  Firefox  and Safari. Opera performs  extension matching  however. Since Opera behavior is more intuitive  we  should investigate making this a default  time permitting. It appears to  pose a very low risk of breaking anything.    The problem got reported as a security issue  but I don't believe it is one:    <a href="http://packetstormsecurity.nl/0810-exploits/firefox-check.txt">http://packetstormsecurity.nl/0810-exploits/firefox-check.txt</a>   </pre>
