<title>Issue 16435 -   chromium -    perf overview graphs don't really handle the platform differences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html</a>    Linux/Mac don't use the same memory graphs since the data isn't the same    so switching to any of those summaries gives no data on mac/linux.  It would   be nice to tweak the page so the mac/linux sections list  and only the   platforms supporting the data keys would be displayed instead of large   blanks. </pre>
