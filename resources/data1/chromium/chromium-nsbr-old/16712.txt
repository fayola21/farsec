Open Options &gt; Basic. Set a specific home page and click the radio  button to specify that the home page should be shown at startup  2. Close Chrome|Chromium  3. Launch Chome|Chromium      My specified home page should be launched at startup      Chrome|Chromium shows the about:linux-splash page rather than my specified  home page    Sending this via Epiphany because I keep getting 400 Bad Request errors  when trying to sumbit it from within Chromuim    Having placed the Home button on my toolbar lets me get to my Home page  easily  but I shouldn't have to since I am allowed to set a preference  otherwise.    </pre>
