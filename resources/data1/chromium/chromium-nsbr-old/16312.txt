<title>Issue 16312 -   chromium -    Need Tango-styled icon for GNOME - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current Chromium icon on Linux (GNOME) is pretty ugly -- it doesn't  scale well to larger sizes  and it doesn't follow the Tango style  guidelines. I've spoken to Jakub Szypulka  and he'd be interested in  producing a better-looking icon if no legal problems arise (trademark   copyright  etc.).    Please reply with your opinion on this; it would be nice with a more slick  icon on Linux. </pre>
