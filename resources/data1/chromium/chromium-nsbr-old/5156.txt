<title>Issue 5156 -   chromium -    Can't middle-click out of a context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open any UI context menu (e.g. the Tools menu or the session history   dropdown).  Now middle-click a tab.  The middle-click is ignored.  It would   be nice if instead it closed the menu and got passed through to be handled   normally  as left- and right-clicks do. </pre>
