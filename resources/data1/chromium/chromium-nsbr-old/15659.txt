<title>Issue 15659 -   chromium -    MakePathRelative fails with varying case in drive letters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My Preferences file has a path in it like this:    E:srccrsrcchromeReleasetest_user_dataDefaultExtensionsilpne  gfhimflflifcnmgpeihglhedbnn0.1    It was being compared to a parent path like this:    e:srccrsrcchromeReleasetest_user_dataDefaultExtensions    This was failing the IsParent test  even though drive letters are always case   insensitive (I have no clue why one code path was getting a lower case letter   and one got an upper case letter)   </pre>
