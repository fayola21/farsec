<title>Issue 4436 -   chromium -    Chrome does not accept relative path to an HTML file when started from command line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.18 (Official Build 5194)  URLs (if applicable) : any local HTML file  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Open the Command Prompt  2. cd to a local directory on your computer that contains an HTML file eg.   index.html  3. Try the following:        &quot;C:pathtochrome.exe&quot; index.html        &quot;C:pathtochrome.exe&quot; .index.html      The index.html file should be loaded in Chrome in both cases.      Chrome prepends &quot;http:// in front of the reference and tries to load it as a   network resource.    I can only get it to work by specifying the full pathname to the file starting   from the drive letter.  That is  only this will work:        &quot;C:pathtochrome.exe&quot; &quot;C:fullpathtothefileindex.html&quot;    Chrome must be fixed to also accept relative pathnames  not just full pathnames. </pre>
