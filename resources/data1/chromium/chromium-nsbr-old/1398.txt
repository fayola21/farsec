<title>Issue 1398 -   chromium -    Unable to browse back without having to click somewhere on the current page after downloading a picture from that page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Browse a site with pictures  2. Find a picture you want to download  3. Left click and choose &quot;Save Image As...&quot;  4. Choose save location and click OK  5. Now without doing anything invoke a &quot;Browse One Page Back&quot; with either   back space or if you have a mouse button that does it.      What is the expected result? Browse back one page      What happens instead? Nothing    For some reason I guess the download bar gets focused instead of the   browser page or Tab on which I downloaded the picture from.    Back browsing will again be possible after I click somewhere on the page to   make it be the active control.      Please provide
