<title>Issue 12007 -   chromium -    Dragging tab over RDP shows dashed outline of tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use RDP  2. Click on a tab  3. Drag the tab to the right  don't tear it off.      Notice two things:  . The tab that you're dragging turns into a dashed rect. This is horrid    you can't even see the title/favicon of what you're dragging around!  . The dashed rect doesn't even line up nicely with where the tab was.    If we're going to optimize for RDP  we need to at least show the tab    especially when the tab is still in the tab strip  otherwise it's pretty   mysterious as to what is going on. </pre>
