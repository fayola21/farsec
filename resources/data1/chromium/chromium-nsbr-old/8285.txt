<title>Issue 8285 -   chromium -    Figure out the right thing for RenderWidgetHostViewMac::SetSize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The WebContents object uses RenderWidgetHostViewMac::SetSize to size the  newly created widget to the correct size. At the time of this call  we're  not yet in the view hierarchy so |size| ends up being 0x0. However  this  works for us because we're using the Cocoa view struture and resizer flags  to fix things up as soon as the view gets added to the hierarchy. Figure  out if we want to keep this flow or switch back to the flow Windows uses  which sets the size upon creation. </pre>
