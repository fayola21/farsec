<title>Issue 20598 -   chromium -    GTK theme colors no longer apply to tab bar background and window borders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2 (Official Build 24690)      1. Launch Chrome  2. Select &quot;Set to GTK+ theme&quot; in &quot;Options-&gt;Personal Stuff&quot;.      Controls and colors match the GTK+ theme  including the tab bar.      Since this version  the browser window's tab bar background remains blue   (as with the default theme). The controls within a tab are rendered as was   expected.     </pre>
