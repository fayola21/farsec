<title>Issue 4804 -   chromium -    Need to update new tab page to deal with closed window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of 4686 I added the ability to restore closed windows. This   resulted in slightly different data being passed to the new tab page. In   particular each entry now has a &quot;type&quot; key that is either &quot;tab&quot; or   &quot;window&quot;. For &quot;window&quot;s the dictionary has an additional key  &quot;tabs&quot;  which   is a list of dictionary values for each tab. </pre>
