<title>Issue 15851 -   chromium -    Option to have download bar be tab-following or window-following - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3        1. Download File  2. Download bar follows you around from tab to tab        An option to have the download bar be tab-following or window-following        There is no option to follow tab.      Additional Comments:  I know it's a hot issue between the two sides  but an option to take back   the valuable screen space from other tabs without closing it for the   downloading tab would be nice. </pre>
