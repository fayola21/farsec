<title>Issue 8329 -   chromium -    'Esc' should cancel Alt+Shift+T mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the current behavior  there is no way user can exit/cancel the  Alt+Shift+T mode without executing any command.    -Press Alt+shift+T while focus is on Browser window  (Hoping you will  consider the <a title="All keyboard shortcuts broken  while keyboard focus is in content area !!" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8316"> issue 8316 </a>) to get keyboard focus on toolbar.  -Use arrow keys (Left/Right) to go to different buttons/menus on the menu.    Use 'Esc' to cancel the Alt+shift+T mode. You can't. You need to execute  any command in order to exit this mode.    FF 3.x/IE 7.x Use 'Esc' to cancel the Alt+Shift+T mode.   </pre>
