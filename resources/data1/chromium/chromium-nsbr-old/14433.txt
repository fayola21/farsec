<title>Issue 14433 -   chromium -    [www.virginamerica.com]: Pop-up Credit Card offer froze Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="https://www.virginamerica.com">https://www.virginamerica.com</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?      I purchased plane tickets last week from virginamerica.com (in Chrome   browser). After purchasing the tickets  it took me to a confirmation page   which also featured a pop up with their credit card offer. The credit card   offer froze Chrome. I was unable to select &quot;No Thanks&quot; and close it. I was   unable to click the page behind it and navigate or view the confirmation   page in its entirety.      What is the expected result?      One should be able to select &quot;No Thanks&quot; and close the credit card pop up    allowing them to navigate the entirety of the confirmation page. I'm not   entirely sure this is a Chrome issue  as I would have to buy more plane   tickets to test this in a different browser and to reproduce the problem in   Chrome.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Unfortunately  to see if the problem is reproduceable you have to buy a   plane ticket from virginamerica.com in Chrome.  2. Once you arrive at the reservation confirmation page  their credit card   offer should freeze the browser.    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Too pricey for me to test. :)    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
