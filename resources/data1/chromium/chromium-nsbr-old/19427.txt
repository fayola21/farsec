<title>Issue 19427 -   chromium -    Mac: http auth and download blocker dialogs disable tab closure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 202.0 (Developer Build 23501)      1. Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html</a>&gt; or   &lt;<a href="http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/carpet%20bombing/repro.html">http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/carpet%20bombing/repro.html</a>&gt;.  2. Without dismissing the dialog  try to close the tab.      That you can close the tab.      The menu is disabled and the button doesn't work.    (Note that you can  however  navigate away from the page without dismissing the dialog. This is   perfectly logical behaviour.) </pre>
