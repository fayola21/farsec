<title>Issue 20264 -   chromium -    Remove bookmark time migration code in 2010 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Cookies never deleted due to Win/POSIX epoch difference" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14734"> Issue 14734 </a> resulted in some time 'fixing' code in the bookmark manager. The   code in question is BookmarkCodec::DecodeNode where it checks whether the   date is before 1970 or not.    The times on disk will get updated the next time the user adds or modifies a   bookmark. This will only be incorrect for Linux and Mac users we had before   this change went in.    After a &quot;while&quot; all these users should get updated times and we can remove   this code. </pre>
