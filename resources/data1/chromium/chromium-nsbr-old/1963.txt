<title>Issue 1963 -   chromium -    Should create search engines for forms that use javascript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a site that uses javascript for form submission.  2. Enter in a search term and press enter.        At this point you should get a search engine for the site  but we currently   don't add one as we ignore javascript form submissions. Our logic should be   that if we see the term the user input as a term in the query param of the   resulting URL we generate a search engine.        </pre>
