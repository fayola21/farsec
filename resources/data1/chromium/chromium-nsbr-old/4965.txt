<title>Issue 4965 -   chromium -    need cross-platform FTP implementation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ftp currently only works on Windows because we use wininet to implement it.    We need a solution for Linux and Mac.  It probably makes sense to write  a portable FTP implementation.      The first step  in any case  is to add ftp unit tests into   url_request_unittest.cc.    Ibrar Ahmed has already started on the unit tests.  Darin Fisher has a few thoughts on a design for portable FTP.   </pre>
