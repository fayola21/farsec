<title>Issue 10697 -   chromium -    In Google Translate  the balloon does not appear. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Official Build 13645)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://translate.google.com/">http://translate.google.com/</a>  Other browsers tested: Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.         Safari 4: n/a    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Visit the Google Translate and enter any URL.  2. The text translated presents itself perfectly.  3. However  the balloon promised in the frame (&quot;View original web page or   mouse over text to view original language&quot;) does not appear.        The balloon with the original language should appear.      Nothing happens when the mouse is over the text  only appears highlighting   blue.    Attached two screenshots  one in Chrome  another in IE.    Anyway  good work!   </pre>
