<title>Issue 22690 -   chromium -    Need to exercise FILE_PATH_USES_{DRIVE_LETTERS WIN_SEPARATORS} on non-Windows platforms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Those defines are there ostensibly to test aiding  although we don't   actually use them for testing and in fact  I get compile errors when turning   them on related to Windows-specific assumptions (passing strings to   functions expecting wstrings  etc.).    As a start  I will look into fixing the compile errors so that one can   manually toggle those switches for existing tests.  Ideally  we'd build the   filepath unittests with different permutations of those switches on every   platform. </pre>
