<title>Issue 9710 -   chromium -    Chrome imports from IE (even if you choose Firefox) if Firefox is started before FRUI is completed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install chrome and make default browser. Close chrome.  2. Delete user profile directory and first run file   3. Open chrome again (to bring up FRUI) but don't do anything yet in the   FRUI. (If you go to &quot;Customize settings&quot; the import should be from IE)  4. Open FF and make it default   5. Go back to FRUI and choose to import from Firefox.       Chrome still imports from IE (and not FF)      This is affecting both stable (1.0.154.53) and dev build (2.0.172.2)   </pre>
