<title>Issue 20821 -   chromium -    fs_usage shows that Chrome is reading and writing on the disk several times every second. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.203.5  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Open a couple of tabs in Chrome (gmail.com  google.com).  2. Run fs_usage in your terminal as a root user. (sudo fs-usage)  3. Stop fs_usage after a few seconds.    Result:  We see that Chrome is doing several read/write operations every second.  This shouldn't be happening.        fs_usage output:    12:30:58  write                                                                                     0.000016   Google Chrom  12:30:58  read                                                                                      0.000007   Google Chrom  12:30:58  write                                                                                     0.000018   Google Chrom  12:30:58  read                                                                                      0.000006   Google Chrom  12:30:58  sendmsg                                                                                 0.000022   Google Chrom  12:30:58  recvmsg                                                                                   0.000011   Google Chrom  12:30:58  recvmsg                                                                                   0.000004   Google Chrom   </pre>
