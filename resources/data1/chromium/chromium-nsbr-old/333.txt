<title>Issue 333 -   chromium -    Request: Instead of just being able to save what you download- be able to run. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)              Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    Currently  you can only save in Chrome. You cannot &quot;run&quot;  or &quot;open&quot;  as   other browsers can. I would very much like that feature-   </pre>
