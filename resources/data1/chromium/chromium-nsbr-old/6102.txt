<title>Issue 6102 -   chromium -    Add a histogram for certificate chains that have an MD5 signature. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To help us decide when it is time to stop accepting certificates  that contain MD5 signatures  jar suggested that we can build a  histogram into Chromium that gets a count of &quot;chains that had an  MD5 signature&quot; vs &quot;chains that didn't have an MD5 signature&quot; using  buckets 1 vs 2. </pre>
