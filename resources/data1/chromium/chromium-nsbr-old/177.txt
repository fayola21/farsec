<title>Issue 177 -   chromium -    Define exceptions for invalid SSL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 1583    Firefox 3 got some bad reviews for not giving an easy way to easily get to  pages using self-signed SSL certs for example. Chrome provides a one-click  access but it requires this click every time you load the page.     There has to be a way to define an exception for this page which would let  it act like a page with a valid/non-selfsigned cert.     I understand there are some security concerns here but having to click a  button every time you visit a legitimate site with a self-signed cert (many  university sites for example!) is very bad. </pre>
