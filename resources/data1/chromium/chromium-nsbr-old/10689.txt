<title>Issue 10689 -   chromium -    Add line-at-a-time reading to FileStream - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's often useful to read in text data files one line at a time. In   particular  chrome/browser/safe_browsing/filter_false_positive_perftest.cc   reads in data in this fashion using iostreams.    This functionality should be added in a cross-platform way to the FileStream   class. </pre>
