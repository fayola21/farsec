<title>Issue 6865 -   chromium -    Use indented edit rather than spacer graphics in location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Speculative: We might save a couple graphics and make some code simpler by   replacing the spacer graphics at the edges of the location bar edit with   just setting the edit's paragraph format to indent a bit on both sides.    This would probably eliminate the need to forward mouse clicks from the   spacer graphic area and might simplify some of the security state syncing   code.    I might need to mess with the selection-erasing code to make sure we don't   draw a selection in this area.   </pre>
