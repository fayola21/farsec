<title>Issue 7057 -   chromium -    Need more password manager tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There aren't sufficient tests in place to ensure we don't regress various   password saving semantics  for instance:    - communication from WebContents (DidStopLoading  DidNavigate) occur at   correct moments.  - multiple logins per domain  - action URI checked before autofill    Some of these are covered by PasswordFormManagerUnittest  but we don't have   a full end-to-end test that would involve loading HTML in a renderer and   verifying the correct behavior. </pre>
