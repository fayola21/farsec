<title>Issue 17322 -   chromium -    importer_unittest.cc should pass a non-null target_profile argument to ImporterHost::StartImportSettings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This issue was reported by Coverity's FORWARD_NULL checker.    Coverity says that ImporterHost::StartImportSettings has a  null pointer check for target_profile near the beginning  but  later deferences target_profile without a null pointer check.    It turns out that this is safe because we only pass a null  target_profile argument from importer_unittest.cc  and  importer_unittest.cc makes sure writer_-&gt;BookmarkModelIsLoaded()  and writer_-&gt;TemplateURLModelIsLoaded() are true  which  causes us to skip the code that dereferences target_profile.    I think the proper fix is to change importer_unittest.cc to  pass a pointer to a dummy Profile object to  ImporterHost::StartImportSettings  so that it does't need any  null pointer check for target_profile. </pre>
