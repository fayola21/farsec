<title>Issue 6475 -   chromium -    WebKitCSSMatrix.idl needs to be added to the build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My merge is bringing in WebCore/css/WebKitCSSMatrix.idl. I added it to the   derived sources makefile bug got this error:  &quot;Don't know whether a JS value can fail conversion to type WebKitCSSMatrix.   at src/webkit/port/bindings/scripts/CodeGeneratorV8.pm line 1693.&quot;    I'm leaving it out of the build for now since I'm not sure how to fix this.    This is the cause of the layout test failure LayoutTests/transforms/2d/cssmatrix-interface.xhtml </pre>
