<title>Issue 6342 -   chromium -    Being able to play video file while it is being downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43      when i am downloading video files  i would like to be able to play(preview)   those files while they are being downloaded. to get the idea whether i want   to download it or not.      if i try to play those files mostly using vlc player  i cant because file   is being used by chrome  other players fail too.    for IE i have to search the file in Content.IE5 but i am able to play them   as they are downloaded       </pre>
