<title>Issue 2753 -   chromium -    App's window positions should be persisted on fly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like we are not persiting App's window positions (dimentions)   until we close the them. We should do on fly  if the APP window is resized   as we do incase of Browser windows.    Eg:  -Launch a App window and resize it.  -Duplicate the app window.    Expected:  Duplicated window should have same dimentions as the resized app window.    Result:  Duplicated window has the dimentions of APP window before it is resized.                 </pre>
