<title>Issue 3447 -   chromium -    '&gt;' is not properly escaped when entering the URL manually. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a small HTML form using GET request.    At this stage  create a tiny HTML form using the GET method. The form  should continue a text field and a &quot;Submit&quot; button. Make the form post it's  results to a CGI script or servlet that you control.    2. Input a '&gt;' sign in the input field  press submit. Observe the '&gt;' being  passed &quot;url escaped&quot; to the other side. This is correct behavior.    3. At this moment  the address bar will contain a URL with your input.  Click on the URL  and press &quot;Enter&quot;. Observe the '&gt;' being passed unescaped  to the CGI/servlet    Expected result is that the '&gt;' sign will always be escaped before  POST-ing/GET-ting the URL    In my tests (using apache2 web server)    REQUEST_URI env. variable always contains the unescaped '&gt;' character when  using chrome  and contains %3E in all other browsers                Please provide
