<title>Issue 21066 -   chromium -    onclick not firing with display:inline; float:right; z-index: {0 1} unless position:relative present - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The attached HTML file is a self-contained (manual) test.    Yeah  it's an unlucky combination of various CSS styles that conspire to   hide the onclick event. It may look contrived  but it's actually a   distilled test case from a real web-app (Google Wave).    All three of Firefox (3.0)  Safari (3.1) and IE (7.0) fire onclick  but   Google Chrome does not.    By Chrome  I tested these versions: Windows (2.0.172.43)  Mac (4.0.203.4)   and Linux (4.0.203.2).    Windows is Windows Vista SP1. Mac is Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.3. Linux is  Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 64-bit.   </pre>
