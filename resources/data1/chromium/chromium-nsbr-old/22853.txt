<title>Issue 22853 -   chromium -    Most of skia_utils_xxx should move to app/gfx - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are several skia/ext/skia_utils_xxx files with functions for doing   things like platform-specific color conversions.  We should move these to   app/gfx except where needed by WebCore code; the only things in skia/ext   should be things we have to have for WebCore. </pre>
