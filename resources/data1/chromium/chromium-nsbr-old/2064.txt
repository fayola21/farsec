<title>Issue 2064 -   chromium -    Wishlist: text size is remembered for a website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27              Firefox 3: OK        1. Open a website  2. Change text size  3. Open another website in the same tab  4. Re-open the first website      The text size the user set for the website should be remembered from one  visit to another to improve user experience. If I made a text bigger it was  because it was too small for my taste  and I'm likely to want it changed in  further visits.      Text size set by the user was not remembered   </pre>
