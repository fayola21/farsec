<title>Issue 21668 -   chromium -    Double clicking a flash widget selects the widget - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;            1. Open Google Maps  2. Go into Street View Mode  3. Double Click anywhere      In Safari and Firefox  the expected result is either a zoom if available or basically nothing happens.      In Chromium  the entire flash object gets selected  and doesnt zoom. The   user has to click out of the flash object before the area gets deselected.   The same problem arises when an app in Facebook is used.  </pre>
