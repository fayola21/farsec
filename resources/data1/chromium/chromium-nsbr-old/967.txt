<title>Issue 967 -   chromium -    Network stack and AJAX should survive changing IP addresses - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Google chrome 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://docs.google.com">http://docs.google.com</a>         Safari 3: not tested      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. connect to the ISP without a router with a DHCP address  2. open the docs.google.com   3. disconnect the connection physically and reconnect with a router in-  between (In my case  I used anygate.. but I guess that it will be   reproduced with any routers)  4. change the IP to a static one which is different from the previous   address  5. open the docs.google.com again      docs.google.com should be opened       an error message pops up (similar to HTTP error 400)      I guess that the google chrome with AJAX connection doesn't work in case of   IP change in the middle of transactions       </pre>
