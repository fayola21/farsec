<title>Issue 16346 -   chromium -    Browser process hangs with cocoa exception about images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - load gmail  - wait a couple seconds    It's intermittent  but fairly reproducible. In the OS console  you'll see:    Thu Jul  9 12:00:54 dhcp-172-29-45-134.her.corp.google.com Chromium[43087]  &lt;Error&gt;: CGImageCreate: invalid image size: 0 x 0.  2009-07-09 12:00:54.354 Chromium[43087:10b] *** Assertion failure in  -[NSBitmapImageRep initWithCGImage:]   /SourceCache/AppKit/AppKit-949.46/AppKit.subproj/NSBitmapImageRep.m:508    And then the browser process will peg at 100% cpu in the message pump. It's  unable to load pages from here on out and needs to be quit (even though you  can open new tabs  they're useless).    It's probably related to favicons and us getting a bad one somewhere and  not dealing with it correctly. Note the favicon for gmail does correctly  display in the tab. NOt sure when this regressed. </pre>
