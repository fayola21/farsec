<title>Issue 10884 -   chromium -    Win7 taskbar functionality for application shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I create a chrome application shortcut and pin it to taskbar in Window 7    it does not react correctly when opened.  More specifically  once clicked  all   the highlight indicators default to chrome browser icon and not the chrome   application icon.  This is confusing and makes navigation more difficult. </pre>
