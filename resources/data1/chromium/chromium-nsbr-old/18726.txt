<title>Issue 18726 -   chromium -    Ogg Video lurches when slowed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Play an ogv (such as term2.ogv from frank's testmatrix)  2. Slow it to half speed  3. Watch it stutter.    Frank suspects:  1. muxing  2. inaccurate timers  3. rate not applied properly to timing    When it didn't stutter  it was ignoring playback rate and waiting 60ms   between paints even if longer was required. For some reason  it's still   playing the video too fast  but catching itself and dropping frames until   audio catches up again. This cycle seems to repeat itself in very small   segments so each segment appears synced even though it's playing slightly   too fast. I'll keep looking into it  but as I don't know where to start to   fix it  I'll leave it unassigned. </pre>
