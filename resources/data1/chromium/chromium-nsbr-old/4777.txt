Single clicking tabs to switch sometimes makes them stick to mouse    pretty much like moving tabs around or extracting tab as single window.  2. After dropping the tab  Chrome crashes.      Tabs should not stick on single click  that should only happen on left   button dragging.      drag  drop  kaboom.    Please provide
