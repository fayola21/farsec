<title>Issue 19776 -   chromium -    When login dialog is shown  the Options dialog hides behind the browser window  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [from http://b/1602004    When the user presses &quot;Sync my bookmarks&quot; in the Options dialog  we show the   setup wizard. This is an HTML dialog  and hence we have to tell the browser   window to show that dialog. This means that the browser window will come on   top of the Options dialog. The user experience is weird in this case since it   could appear as if the Options dialog is gone  but it's still there  behind   the browser window.    One option is to dismiss the Options dialog when the user clicks &quot;Synchronize   my data...&quot; </pre>
