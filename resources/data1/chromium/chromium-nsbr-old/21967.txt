<title>Issue 21967 -   chromium -    Add WebSecurityOrigin to the WebKit API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add WebSecurityOrigin to the WebKit API    For now  this class should just have a toString method.  A toURL method might   also be nice.    The purpose of this class is to allow for more methods to be added in the   future on WebSecurityOrigin.  This way we won't have to change the signatures   of other methods that currently pass a security origin. </pre>
