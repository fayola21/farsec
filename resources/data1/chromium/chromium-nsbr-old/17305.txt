<title>Issue 17305 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes if you pass in a string to chrome.bookmarks.remove - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.193.1    chrome.bookmarks.remove expects either an bookmark ID or an array of  bookmark IDs to be deleted.  If you pass in a string like &quot;3&quot; (or array of  strings like [&quot;3&quot;  &quot;5&quot;]) instead of an int 3  Chrome crashes.    chrome.bookmarks.removeTree doesn't crash but instead throws an exception  claiming that the parameter is an invalid type.  This is much nicer and  helped me track down the original issue.  Of course  I'd prefer if Chrome  just converted the strings to ints  but a readable exception works just fine. </pre>
