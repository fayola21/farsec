<title>Issue 18302 -   chromium -    uTorrent WebUI hangs when restoring session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.197.0~svn20090801r22243-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture: 32-bit  window manager: Metacity and Compiz  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Haven't tested yet :)      1. Turn on the &quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot; option;  2. Open uTorrent's WebUI (possibly you have to save the password after   authorization - that's what I did);  3. Close Chromium;  4. Open it up again.      A request for the login/password; optionally with the fields filled out   already (as FF does it); or  ideally  the web interface without any   prompts.      The tab hangs. </pre>
