<title>Issue 13752 -   chromium -    New import_home_page parameter - should be able to import just home page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  we have special installerdata / master preferences flags for   importing different aspects of the user's current browser on install.    (examples: import_bookmarks  import_search_engine  import_history)    However  we *don't* have a parameter to only import the user's home page   setting from their previous browser.  It looks like we do import the user's   home page when the first-run UI is shown  but we'd like to be able to do so   without showing the first-run UI.    Ideally  this should just be a parameter called &quot;import_home_page&quot;  live   with the other master prefs  and when set to &quot;true&quot;  merely imports the   user's home page from their previous default browser.    Carlos  did we ever find an owner for import? </pre>
