<title>Issue 23081 -   chromium -    CachedResource memory leak in renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The renderer exits with a leak message like the following in the Visual  Studio debug console if a page has been previously loaded that contains  resources such as image or CSS files:    LEAK: 1 CachedResource    This leak is due to the Cache object being a singleton that never gets  deleted.  Any CachedResource objects in the Cache will be leaked by both  test_shell and chromium when the renderer exits.  It's possible to force  deletion of everything in the cache by calling:    WebCore::cache()-&gt;setDisabled(true);    Is it best to (a) call this function before test_shell and the renderer  process exit  (b) let these objects leak  or (c) take some other action to  make sure the CachedResource objects are properly cleaned up? </pre>
