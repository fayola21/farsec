<title>Issue 5308 -   chromium -    Mach based IPC implementation for OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We prototyped a Mach-message based IPC implementation on OS X  but have  decided to try to use a pipe-based implementation common to the Linux build.    This issue is a placeholder for the Mach implementation should we ever need  to use the code. The attached file contains the implementation including a  patch for message_pump_libevent to allow it to receive Mach messages.   </pre>
