<title>Issue 18607 -   chromium -    crash at end of file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Goto test matrix  <a href="http://fbarchard-v64.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/index.html">http://fbarchard-v64.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/index.html</a>  play red2.mp4  set rate to 2x (right click)  play to end  let it sit there for about 2 minutes    What is the expected output?  nothing bad should happen.  Ideally the CPU usage would go down and memory   wouldnt leak.    What do you see instead?  &quot;snap&quot;     </pre>
