<title>Issue 8775 -   chromium -    Local text file with spaces in filename is urlencoded in tab title  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.170.0 (Developer Build 11631)    FF3: OK  IE7: OK        1. Open a local text file (file protocol).     Example: &quot;C:tempsample 2.txt&quot; title becomes &quot;sample%20.txt&quot;.  2. Check filename in tab title.    Urlencoded filename is also visible in tab history.  This is also true of .htm files that have no title.    What is the expected output?     Filename should be displayed with spaces  not with urlencoding.  It would  be more user-friendly.    What do you see instead?    Filename is displayed urlencoded in tab title and tab history.   </pre>
