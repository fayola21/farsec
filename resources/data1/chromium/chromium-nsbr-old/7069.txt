<title>Issue 7069 -   chromium -    isOverSize() has an arbitrary (and too small) limit for image size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In /trunk/deps/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/platform/image-  decoders/skia/ImageDecoder.h there's a function isOverSize() which   basically results in us refusing to render any images over 32MP. This limit   seems arbitrary and unfortunate. I understand we're trying to avoid   rendering a 400GB image and totally hosing a person's computer  but I was   browsing today and hit an image that was ~6000*8000 (it happened to be a   schema) and Chrome was the only browser that wouldn't render the image.     Is there some way we can do something smarter here  rather than just   refusing to render the image? </pre>
