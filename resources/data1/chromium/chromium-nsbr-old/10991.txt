<title>Issue 10991 -   chromium -    Fullscreen does not cancel toolbar focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=14426">r14426</a>)    This may blocked on <a title="'Esc' should cancel Alt+Shift+T mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8329"> issue 8329 </a>.    I guess  if user is in Alt+Shift+T mode and switches to full screen  then   we should cancel the Alt+Shift+T mode.    -Alt+Shift+T on a browser window to get keyboard access on toolbar using   arrow keys.  -Switch to full screen mode.  -Use arrow keys (Right/Left) to navigate thr the buttons/menus on toolbar.    Notice you can see all the tool tips and menus even in full screen mode.  Screenshot attached.   </pre>
