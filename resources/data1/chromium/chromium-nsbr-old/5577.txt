<title>Issue 5577 -   chromium -    Horizontal Scroll of Amazon Makes Screen Weird - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open the webpage in a browser window that is more narrow than the   contents.  2. Scroll to the right.  3. Put your mouse over the images.    I couldn't get it to do it in a new tab  but when I had been browsing   Amazon for a while  it started doing what it shows in the pictures. The   links and images would shift right  showing half the contents to the left    covered by the contents when they were shifted. It is most likely a webkit   problem. It may not be reproducible  but it seemed like an odd bug at the   time.                Please provide
