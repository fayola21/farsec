<title>Issue 16875 -   chromium -    set the webkit preferences for the minimum font size to a reasonable value per UI language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are two webkit preferences for the minimum font size. Currently  one of   them is set to 1  effectively making any font size be used. That's very bad   for some languages with a lot of strokes in a single character.     Until we have different minimum font size pref per language/script  at least   we have to make the minimum font size for Chinese  Japanese  Korean  Arabic   and Thai (and some other languages) to 10 or 12.     Adding the UI for that is <a title="should only have one font-size preference  instead of one for normal text and one for monospace text"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10524">issue 10524</a>.      BTW  a user can still edit the preference file directly to change the value   without UI.   </pre>
