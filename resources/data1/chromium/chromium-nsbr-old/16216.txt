<title>Issue 16216 -   chromium -    expose histogram data as JSON to extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should expose the data in about:histograms to the extensions API.  This   idea came up when discussing <a title="about:performance - a personal view of chrome performance"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16214">issue 16214</a> where we'd like to provide end-users   with more digestible performance data about Chrome on their computer.  If we   exposed histogram data to extensions  then this kind of feature could be   rapidly prototyped and written as an extension. </pre>
