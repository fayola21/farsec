<title>Issue 11762 -   chromium -    Include YEAR in chrome/VERSION - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Cc people who have touched chrome/VERSION recently)    We'd like a place to stick the year used in the app's copyright message  presented in the Mac's Get Info window and other similar places.  It seems  that the best place to put this would be in chrome/VERSION  which currently  contains MAJOR  MINOR  BUILD  and PATCH.    I'd like to add YEAR to this so that we have a single platform-neutral  location from which to pull the year to be used in the copyright message.    Are there any objections? </pre>
