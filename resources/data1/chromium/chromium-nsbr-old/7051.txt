<title>Issue 7051 -   chromium -    Maximized Chrome window does not change when display resolution changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43  URLs (if applicable) : n/a                  1. Run Chrome in a Windows XP VMWare Player session in a window.  2. Maximize Chrome.  3. Maximize VMWare Player.          Maximized Chrome should respond to screen resolution changes and stay   maximized.  -OR-  Maximized Chrome should unmaximize and return to being a   normal window when the screen resolution changes.          The windows desktop resolution has changed but the maximized chrome window   has not changed size but still retains maximized window decorations rather   than regaining its easy grab title bar.       </pre>
