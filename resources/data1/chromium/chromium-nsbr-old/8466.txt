<title>Issue 8466 -   chromium -    Feature request: New incognito window button next to new tab button. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think it would be useful to have a &quot;new incognito window&quot; button next to   the &quot;new tab&quot; button  as shown in the attached image. It would make it   easier for new users to find the incognito feature as well as make it   easier for veteran users to quickly open a new incognito window. </pre>
