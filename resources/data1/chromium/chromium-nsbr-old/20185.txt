<title>Issue 20185 -   chromium -    After pushing 5K bookmarks  Chrome Crashes when trying to delete a folder with more than 200 child objects - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.202.0 (Official Build 23673)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.4  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.202.0 Safari/532.0    This is the build downloaded from Chrome dev channel site using external   IP. It was being tested against mock server with chron's changes.      1. Enable sync on 2 clients  one of the client has more than 6K bookmarks   (use attached bookmarks file)  2. Wait until both clients done with sync  3. Bring up bookmark manager for both clients and while that's open delete   a folder with lots of child (&gt;200).    What is the expected output?   Chrome should not crash and sync should work fine.    What do you see instead?  chrome crashes (so far twice). Find attached crash reports + user data dirs         </pre>
