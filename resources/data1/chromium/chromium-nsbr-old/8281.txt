<title>Issue 8281 -   chromium -    Implement browser_window_controller updateLoadingAnimations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to figure out what type of animations are required when a page is  loading (tabs spinning  throbber  etc) and let that determine what needs to  be done within updateLoadingAnimations. Windows uses a timer  which we may  or may not need.    Windows additionally has the tab_strip walk each of its tabs and update the  animation state based on whether or not its tab contents is loading each  time the timer fires. </pre>
