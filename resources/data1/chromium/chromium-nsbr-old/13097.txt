<title>Issue 13097 -   chromium -    Set LSMinimumSystemVersion to 10.5 to avoid launching on pre-Leopard systems in a friendly way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13087">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13087</a>    Instead of giving users who try to launch on 10.4 messages like this:    dyld: Symbol not found: _kLSQuarantineTypeKey    Referenced from: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome    Expected in:  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices    we should declare to the OS that we require 10.5 so that it can give a more  effective error when someone attempts to launch on an older system. </pre>
