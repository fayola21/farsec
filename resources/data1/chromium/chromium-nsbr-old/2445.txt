<title>Issue 2445 -   chromium -    Link to help center for clearing cookies on cookie redirect error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   The cookie redirect error page encourages users to clear their cookies for   this site.  It would be nice to at least link to the HC article on how to   do this (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95626">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95626</a>).    &quot;This webpage has a redirect loop.    The webpage at $URL has resulted in too many redirects. Clearing your   cookies for this site may fix the problem. If not  it is possibly a server   configuration issue and not a problem with your computer.&quot;       </pre>
