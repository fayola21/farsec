<title>Issue 15250 -   chromium -    Print Selection not Available on all Websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.1  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com  hotmail.com          In the main window of a gmail thread  selecting text and trying to print   selection does not work.  The option is grayed out.  The workaround is to   use &quot;print all&quot; and then select the text to be printed.    In the message section of hotmail  selecting text and trying to print   selection similarly does not work.    This is a continuation of <a title="Cannot print selection" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1682"> issue 1682 </a>.    Note: as of this posting  the print selection option is only available in   the Dev channel.
