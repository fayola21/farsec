<title>Issue 9779 -   chromium -    Items on the download bar should have some visual indication when started - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a downloaded file that has been downloaded (such as an application   installer setup.exe)  clicking the button to launch it shows no visual   indication that it has been launched.  Which can lead you to click again as nothing seems to be responding    starting it a 2nd time.    A simple day to prevent accidental over-clicking would be to disable the   button and change its caption to &quot;Opening...&quot; for a few seconds. </pre>
