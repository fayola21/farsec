<title>Issue 15325 -   chromium -    Malicious page causes browser crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Note: this URL causes a browser crash  so don't idly click on it.  <a href="http://kh.nu/bhz/">http://kh.nu/bhz/</a>    The program 'chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.    (Details: serial 9 error_code 3 request_code 15 minor_code 0)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)   </pre>
