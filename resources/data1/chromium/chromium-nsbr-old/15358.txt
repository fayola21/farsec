<title>Issue 15358 -   chromium -    LANG=he_IL.UTF-8 doesn't pick the right language pack on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install language-pack-he (sudo apt-get install language-pack-he)  Run &quot;LANG=he_IL.UTF8 ./out/Debug/chrome&quot;    It properly sets the UI to RTL  but the strings are not properly picked up.    I think something is wrong in the language detection (probably because of   the _IL.UTF8?). </pre>
