<title>Issue 12275 -   chromium -    Elevation needed during an update of Chrome!! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Why do we need this? If we need to write any registry values @ HKLM for user-  level installs    Here is the scenario  Say if the user has 154.65. This version doesn't write   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREClassesChromeExt. When the user gets updated to   172.28  the user will still not have those values. If and only when the user   does a fresh install of 172.28  they will be written. I'm not sure what this   breaks. Extensions???     </pre>
