<title>Issue 2685 -   chromium -    Add preferences for per-script/per-CSS generic family fonts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   IE and Firefox let users select fonts per script(langGroup in Firefox). For   generic family  IE has only fixed and proportional.     On the other hand  Firefox has UI for serif  sans-serif and monospace with   fantasy and cursive  fonts configurable via 'about:config'.   In about:config (or directly editing preference files)  a user can assign a   series of fonts to use for a given langGroup and a generic family.     The latter we may not do. However  at least  we have to the former. A   couple of W3C I18N WG members also asked me about this feature.     To do that  webkit needs to be modified as well as 'chrome-proper' (UI    backend). A first batch of webkit change was submitted to the webkit   bugzilla.     </pre>
