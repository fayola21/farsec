<title>Issue 7362 -   chromium -    Find bar graphics glitch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Tested on 1.0.154.46  and 2.0.160.1      1. Press Ctrl F  2. Press Esc  3. Carefully watch Find bar go away    When the find bar goes away  there is a brief period where the gray pixel   borders do not line up  making it look choppy.  This is shown in the   circled area of the screen-shot  but is only there for a VERY small period   of time (I had to write a script to do the screen capture  which has a 2 ms   period in which it catches the glitch). </pre>
