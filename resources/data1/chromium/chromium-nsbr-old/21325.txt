<title>Issue 21325 -   chromium -    Move the &quot;response has body&quot; logic in RDH to net/http - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From codereview comment:    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/173536/diff/2001/2003#newcode156">http://codereview.chromium.org/173536/diff/2001/2003#newcode156</a>    We should try to have the RDH sniffing logic call functions from the network module  rather than duplicate the conditions for when a   response may contain a body.    This is both a code-cleanup task  but there could also be bug here with how mimestniffing is done for HEAD requests  and some   other codes. </pre>
