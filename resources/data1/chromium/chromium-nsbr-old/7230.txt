<title>Issue 7230 -   chromium -    Window snapping - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An old feature request filed by pkasting internally:    Per Ben's suggestions  we should try to prototype some kind of window   snapping behavior a la Winamp.    To start  I would suggest snapping to facing edges of windows  or to screen   edges  within 10 px.    An extension of this that might need experimentation is to snap to adjacent   edges.  ASCII art doesn't play nice with this variable-width font  so just   think of having two windows next to each other  one taller than the other    and of dragging the bottom border of the shorter window down to make it the   same height as the taller window.  When you get close enough  I think the   border you're dragging should snap to the location of the adjacent window's   edge  to create a continuous line.    Finally  we could extend the resize handling so that snapped edges acted as   a single edge for the purpose of resize drags  whether facing (obviously;   the edge then behaves like a splitter) or adjacent (this might be weird).   </pre>
