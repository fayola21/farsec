<title>Issue 7550 -   chromium -    Text Update: Missing java plugin dialog still says SE6 UP10 (BETA) is not installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make sure that you don't have java installed yet  2. Go to a site with java applet i.e.  <a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml</a>      What is the expected output?       What do you see instead?  GetPlugin dialog says Java6 U10 (Beta) is not installed.  Java 6 U10 is out of beta now and the link when you click on the &quot;get  plugin&quot; actually points to the most recent version of java       </pre>
