<title>Issue 5833 -   chromium -    If default spell-check dictionary is changed  command line options is not honored.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know  we do this purposefully (?)       1. If I change the default spell-check dictionary from en-US to different  lang (say ru-RU)  then launching Chrome with command line option say  lang=el-GR should set the dictionary to el-GR (?).    What is the expected output?   Dictionary should be set to el-GR    What do you see instead?  Dictionary is set to ru-RU always for any language options.    I see the following inconsistency behavior with spell-checker.    -If user does not change the spell-checker thr UI at all  then  spell-checker is set to command line language.    -If user changes spell-checker thr UI at least once  then command line  language option is ignored for spell checker. This behavior is demonstrated  until user deletes the user profile.  [other tactics like changing back spell-checker to default one  in this  case en-US OR &quot;Restore to defaults&quot; don't help !!    Sid  Please close  if it is working as intended.   </pre>
