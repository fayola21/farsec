<title>Issue 783 -   chromium -    Customisation of new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new tab page should be able to be customised  in a way resembling the   iGoogle personalised homepage (<a href="http://www.google.com/ig">http://www.google.com/ig</a>).  For example  it would be nice to be able to choose what search engines to   display on the right (some engines are there because I used the once but   never use them again)  possibly some news feeds (with the upcoming RSS   support) or just some favourited pages that would differ from the bookmarks   and the most visited pages. Possibly even be able to chose a background or   something !   </pre>
