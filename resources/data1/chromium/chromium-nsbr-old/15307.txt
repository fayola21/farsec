<title>Issue 15307 -   chromium -    app_unittest is not run in any bot. neither is it a part of try server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I made a stupid mistake in that led to <a title="REGRESSION: Small font  no menu labels if app_locale == 'en'" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15286"> issue 15286 </a>. I should have run all  the tests locally  but I didn't and relied on try server  instead. And  I  overlooked that L10NUtil*.* is now a part of app_unittests and  app_unittests is not run in any bot (try bot or regular).     Because app_unittests is not run on any regular buildbot  I missed the  failure until alerted by Mark. All these wouldn't have happened if I had  run app_unittests locally.     Nonetheless  it'd help catching mistakes like mine if we run app_unittests  in some of buildbots. </pre>
