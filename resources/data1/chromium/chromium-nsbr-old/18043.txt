<title>Issue 18043 -   chromium -    Window frame paints inactive when info bubble or &lt;input&gt; dropdown is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the opaque custom frame*  open an &lt;input&gt; dropdown or click on the   toolbar star button. The browser's frame will paint inactive  which is   weird  because it's still the active top level window.    *I didn't test with the glass frame. </pre>
