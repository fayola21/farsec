<title>Issue 21903 -   chromium -    Tabs should resize immediately if rightmost tab is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0    1. Click most-rightest-ish tab    Expected: Tabs should resize immediately (assuming they're not at their   maximum width yet)  so that another close button slides to under the mouse   cursor. (this should only happen if the rightmost tab is closed)    Actual: Resizing is delayed until mouse moves strip.    The &quot;Expected&quot; also matches what chrome/linux does. </pre>
