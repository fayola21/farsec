<title>Issue 10669 -   chromium -    Edit Thumbnails should support return key/space bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   While user is in edit thumbnails mode  Hitting return key/space bar should    delete the focused the thumbnail.     -Click on Edit Thumbnails link in NTP.  -Do tabbing to get keyboard focus on a thumbnail.  -Hit return key/Space bar.    Expected:  #########  Both events should delete the focused thumbnail. If not supporting the   space bar  We should at least support return key to delete the focused   thumbnail.    Result:  #######  Space bar event is ignored. Return key navigates to thumbnail's webpage -   this is weired.  </pre>
