<title>Issue 6861 -   chromium -    Modal switch between tab-to-change-focus and tab-to-search is confusing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you try to use tab-to-search when it's not available  we change focus   out of the address bar.  This is a pretty high penalty.    Maybe instead we should make tab do nothing when the user has an edit in   progress and no tab-to-search choice is available.  This will still let you   tab over the address bar  but reduce the penalty for getting this wrong (?  ).   </pre>
