<title>Issue 4597 -   chromium -    Autoscroll only while button is pressed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;I tested the auto scroll feature in recent chromium builds&gt;    I am used to press a special scroll button on my mouse to activate auto   scroll and have it deactivate once I leave the button. Chromium keeps the auto scroll active as long as the button is pressed  which can be neat too   at times but does not match my usage pattern. Is it somehow possible to   change the behavior?  </pre>
