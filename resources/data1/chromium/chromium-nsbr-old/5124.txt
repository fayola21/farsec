<title>Issue 5124 -   chromium -    Application shortcuts should support F1 key (for help support)  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 0.5.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6362">r6362</a>)    I will notice F1 key support in Chromium latest builds.    Browser window supports this key but where in application shortcuts fails.  Looks like we missed it.     </pre>
