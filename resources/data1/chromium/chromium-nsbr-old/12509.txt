<title>Issue 12509 -   chromium -    Support multi-user installation on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.28    Add an option to the installation program to install chrome for all users.    Install the program to either &quot;program files&quot; or &quot;program files (x86)&quot;   instead of the user's AppData directory.  See <a title="Multi-user install breaks links for other user" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12506"> issue #12506 </a> why local   installations aren't always desirable.    I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Chrome  even with a global install   directory  should still support multiple languages for one install so   different users on say Vista Ultimate can still see Chrome in their language.   </pre>
