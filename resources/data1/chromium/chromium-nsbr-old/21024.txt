<title>Issue 21024 -   chromium -    extension API: should be able to reference individual type fields to avoid doc redundancy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the extension API definition  you often wind up referencing the same   fields of a defined type in isolation.  For example  the update() method may   only allow some of the fields to be updated  so you can't just $ref the whole   type.  It would be cool if you could refer to a field within a defined type.   For example:    &quot;title&quot;: {&quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;BookmarkTreeNode.title&quot;}    This way  you'd automatically inherit the docs for BookmarkTreeNode.title and   avoid copying and pasting it everywhere you used it. </pre>
