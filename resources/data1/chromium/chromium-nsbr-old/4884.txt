<title>Issue 4884 -   chromium -    Chrome omits period before extension names in save dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Save a file (say  picture.jpg)  2. Click on the filename and change it to something else  (say  my_picture)   leaving off the extension.  3. Click Save      The file should be saved as 'my_picture.jpg' since Chrome already knows   that it is a .jpg file.  Chrome attempts to append the extension to the   filename  but omits the period before it  so that the file appears to be an   unknown file type when the user tries to open it.
