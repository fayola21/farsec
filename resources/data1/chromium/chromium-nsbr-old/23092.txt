<title>Issue 23092 -   chromium -    Thread switchboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The idea is to create an object that would know when our threads I/O  file    etc) become available and are destroyed during shutdown.    Currently we cannot send messages from some threads to others because the   target thread is shutting down earlier than the source thread. If we had a   thread switchboard  the PostTask to the other thread would safely fail and   not crash.    Filing a bug so that the idea doesn't get lost. I plan to implement it. Feel   free to clarify the idea in the comments. </pre>
