<title>Issue 3855 -   chromium -    .pdf files cause Chrome to freeze - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;REPLACE this with your version. Ex: 0.3.154.3&gt;             Safari 3: Ok      Firefox 3: Ok           IE 7: Ok      1. Open an embedded .pdf file  2. Allow the .pdf file to fully open  3. Scroll down the .pdf file and Chrome will freeze for around a minute and   will continue to do so when you continue to freeze after it unfreezes the   more you scroll down.        .pdf files should open in a browser without causing the browser to freeze        The browser freezes and becomes very unstable.     </pre>
