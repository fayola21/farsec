<title>Issue 5705 -   chromium -    Security dialog text: &quot;You have never visited this site before today.&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://launchpad.net/">https://launchpad.net/</a>      1. Visit some https-site for the first time. (For testing: There are some   URL:s to choose from at launchpad  one per area.)  2. Click the padlock to view Security information.      Readable text. Maybe &quot;Today is your first visit to this site.&quot;  and maybe   it wouldn't need to be so angrily colored?      &quot;You have never visited this site before today.&quot;  The problem comes at the last word. (Is this only a problem for non-native   English speakers?)   </pre>
