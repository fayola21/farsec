<title>Issue 4762 -   chromium -    Some strings untranslated in Hebrew Bookmark Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 0.4.154.25 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5918">r5918</a>).  Precondition: Have Hebrew setup. I'm using VMWare XP/Hebrew.        1. Ctrl+Shift+B to bring up Bookmark Manager.    What is the expected output?     Bookmark Manager strings should be translated to Hebrew.    What do you see instead?    Some strings are untranslated and appear in English. See attached picture.     </pre>
