<title>Issue 2028 -   chromium -    Inconsistency: on New Tab page  'View page source' is disabled  but Ctrl+U works - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 and build 1983  URLs (if applicable) : New Tab page      1. Open a new tab  2. Press Ctrl+U      Nothing should happen.      The page source opens.    I think this is an inconsistency: in the context menu  'View page source'  is disabled  but Ctrl+U still works.  Maybe you want to let the user access the source  in such a case 'View page  source' should be enabled. </pre>
