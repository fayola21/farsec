<title>Issue 8195 -   chromium -    Can not send mail using Yahoo mail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This started happening recently (I am not entirely sure in which dev   channel build) but now I can reproduce it in dev channel as well on ToT   (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=10608">r10608</a>).    Log into Yahoo mail (new 'outlook' interface) and try to send any mail   (either reply or compose new) and a javascript alert box pops up saying   Yahoo mail has encountered unexpected error. Works fine in Safari 4 </pre>
