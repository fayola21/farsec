<title>Issue 496 -   chromium -    Change start page to static conent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    Feature request:    Allow users to change the start page to static content instead of most   visited  much like Opera's Speeddial.    Normally 'Most visisted' would work for everyone  but personally I clean my   history every night (automatic CCleaner).        </pre>
