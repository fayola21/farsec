<title>Issue 22383 -   chromium -    Strange bar along bottom of Chrome for Mac browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2  OS version               : OSX 10.5.8    This strange bar started appearing along the bottom of my Chrome for   Mac browser windows when I started the browser recently. I have never   seen this problem before  and I can't think of anything specifically that   would have caused it. Here's a screenshot:  <a href="http://grab.by/52q">http://grab.by/52q</a>    And here's a screenshot to show that it isn't part of the Downloads bar:  <a href="http://grab.by/52t">http://grab.by/52t</a>    And a screenshot of the status bar resting on top of it:  <a href="http://grab.by/52y">http://grab.by/52y</a>    Note that the bar is sometimes colored in two different shades of gray  this   happens when the window is resized  like so:  <a href="http://grab.by/52u">http://grab.by/52u</a>    Restarting Chrome or my computer has no effect on the issue.   </pre>
