<title>Issue 10710 -   chromium -    History url database chunking makes inline autocomplete flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today I typed a letter that didn't autocomplete for a while  then suddenly   did.    This means the second pass in the history URL provider returned a typed match   that the first pass didn't.  The most likely explanation for this is that the   URL was typed long enough ago that it was expired to our older database   chunks.    I think pass 2 reports its results all in one shot  so all we really need to   worry about is making inline autocompletion work sanely here.  In that case   the key is that URLs should be inline autocompleted using a heuristic based   only on the current month's stats. </pre>
