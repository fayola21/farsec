<title>Issue 3838 -   chromium -    Should have consistent language across all over with Chrome Installation process and UI. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set your sys local to Hindi (or any other language is fine)  2. Download Google Chrome from www.google.com/chrome (Please don't select  any language in the language box  just the default one)  3. Install Google Chrome.    You will notice the weird the experience.    The Download dialog and Installing Google Chrome dialog shows up in your  sys language (that is Hindi) and FRUI and the entire Front-End UI (Menus)  is in English.  And again the shortcuts created under Start/All Programs/Google Chrome/ are  in your sys language (Hindi).    Not sure  what is the expected behavior over here. But Mark says  we should  have one consistent language across all over Chrome  downloading/installation/FRUI/UI)(Menus) .  That's why it is here :)   </pre>
