<title>Issue 18069 -   chromium -    Chrome fails to start occasionally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37 (WinXP)      1. Start chrome from shortcut or command line occasionally fails to start   chrome.      Chrome should start every time it is launched.      Nothing.      Chrome used to work fine for a while.  Suddenly  after using chrome for a couple of hours  the shortcut fails to   start chrome.  Trying a hack I found in some other post  opening a &quot;cmd&quot; window and   running chrome made it work a couple of times  but then it stopped working   too.    I figured there's a timing issue or some bad handle code  so I tried to run   strace (StraceNT) on chrome  look what I got :    [T1500] ReadProcessMemory(148  252850  182ec24  50  ...) = 1  [T1500] ReadProcessMemory(148  252910  182ec24  50  ...) = 1  [T3348] ReadProcessMemory(1c4  253088  12d398  50  ...) = 1  [T1500] ReadProcessMemory(148  252a78  182ec24  50  ...) = 1  Heap corruption detected at 00A84128  Exception = c0000005  Address = 7c9118b5 (first-chance!)
