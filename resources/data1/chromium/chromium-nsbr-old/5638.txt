<title>Issue 5638 -   chromium -    Closing a tab should do fast shutdown (terminate) when possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When shutting down the browser  we try to use a fast shutdown mechanism by   terminating the renderer process if there's no RenderView in that process   that has an unload or beforeunload handler.  We should extend this feature   to closing individual tabs and browser windows when not shutting down as   well. </pre>
