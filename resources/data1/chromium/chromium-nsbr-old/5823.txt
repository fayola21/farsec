<title>Issue 5823 -   chromium -    Regression: copying text from the renderer than copying text in another app makes other app unresponsive for a couple of seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Copy some text from the page.  2. Go to another app and copy some text        Notice the other app becomes unresponsive for a couple of seconds. Also   notice that as soon as you close the Chrome app the other app wakes right   up.    I regressed this on the Chromium buildbot and determined it was introduced   between svn revisions 5019 and 5022. The only patches landed in this range   are from Ricardo. </pre>
