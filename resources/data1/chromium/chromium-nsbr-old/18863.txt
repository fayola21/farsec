<title>Issue 18863 -   chromium -    Click on Wrench icon and move mouse to File icon doesnt open file menu  and vice versa - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Click on the File icon  and the menu opens.. Drag your mouse over the other   icon (the wrench) and the menu doesn't change to the wrench popup menu. I   shouldn't have to click again to get the menu to come up. Once one menu is   open  if I drag my mouse over the other icon  its respective popup menu   should be shown.      When I click on the File icon  and the menu opens.. I drag my mouse over   the other icon (the wrench) and the menu doesn't change to the wrench popup   menu. I shouldn't have to click again to get the menu to come up. Once one   menu is open  if I drag my mouse over the other icon  its respective popup   menu should be shown.      Click on File icon brings up file menu  but moving mouse over the wrench   icon while the File menu is currently open  only leaves the file popup menu   open. You have to then actually click the wrench to bring up it's popup   menu.    <b>Please provide
