<title>Issue 18154 -   chromium -    Let users whitelist site / external protocol pairs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a webpage tries to launch an external protocol registered in Windows  (i.e. dothis:) a security dialog pops up  title is &quot;External Protocol  Request&quot; and prompts user to allow this and &quot;Launch application&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;.    It would be wonderful to be able to have a third button to trust this given  protocol from now on  without having to click &quot;Launch Application&quot; every  time it is called. Some kind of &quot;trusted protocols&quot; setting. Even better if  there is a way to register this kind of protocol in some registry setting.  It is totally legitimate when an application registers a windows protocol  upon installation and wants to use it via Chrome.   </pre>
