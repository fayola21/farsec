<title>Issue 19278 -   chromium -    Modal dialog box spam w/keychain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know that this is the same as the other keychain spam bugs.    I'm seeing one keychain modal dialog box per website that I try to log into.   The modal dialog box also opens on the wrong monitor (browser on monitor   to left of primary  modal keychain dialog opens on right).    Unrequested modal dialog boxes are banned in Chrome because they're   friggin annoying. At the very least  I should only ever have to unlock once per   session for all sites. (I would consider this part Mstone:MacBeta) We should   integrate at a lower level so we can provide our own UI and not spam the user   with annoying prompts. (I would consider this Mac-stable  whatever release   that might coincide with). </pre>
