<title>Issue 15909 -   chromium -    Chrome exits (or crashes) when waking from sleep with a different screen size. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4  OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Open chrome on a laptop when the lid is closed  but it is connected to   an external monitor  keyboard  and power.  (E.g..  at work)  2. Close the laptop to make your mac sleep.  2.1. (optional) go home  and get comfy on the sofa with a nice beverage.  3. Open the mac's built-in laptop display.  4. After logging back in  chrome will be conspicuously gone.      Not disappearing.      It disappears.    There is a *slight* chance that this might be related to 12789... since this   new behavior sort of nullifies the behavior listed in that bug.   </pre>
