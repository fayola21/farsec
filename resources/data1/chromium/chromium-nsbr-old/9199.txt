<title>Issue 9199 -   chromium -    saved passwords feature request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (12281)  URLs (if applicable) : NA  Other browsers tested: NONE        1. Log on to a site that requires a username and a password   2. Allow Chrome to save the username and the password  3. Over time you can accumulate a lot of saved passwords        Let's say I'd like to perform a clean install of my OS. It would be nice if   there would be a function to export all of the usernames and passwords that   have been saved by Chrome.        Right now all you can do is to go to Options -&gt; Minor Tweaks -&gt; Show saved   passwords and write them down one by one. </pre>
