<title>Issue 10683 -   chromium -    Incorrect page width when tab loads in background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.sanlam.co.za/wps/wcm/connect/Sanlam_Investments_EN/sanlaminvestm">http://www.sanlam.co.za/wps/wcm/connect/Sanlam_Investments_EN/sanlaminvestm</a>  ents/home           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Browse to URL above (notice that page content fills entire width of   window)  2. Ctrl-Click one of the listed links  e.g. Sanlam Investment Management   (SIM)  3. Wait for tab to load completely before focusing it.  4. Reload the new destination tab  then it looks OK. But it should look OK   on the initial load too.      Destination page content fills entire width of window  similar to the   original URL.      Destination page content fills about 70% of width  centered.  I'll attach a   screenshot.  This issue probably needs a reduced case.     </pre>
