<title>Issue 7046 -   chromium -    Re-use renderer processes intelligently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome has a limit to the number of renderer processes it will create  to   avoid overloading the user's machine.  If this limit is reached  Chrome   randomly assigns new tabs (i.e.  SiteInstances) to existing processes  as   long as the Profile matches.    In this case  we should try to more intelligently assign new SiteInstances   to existing renderer processes.  For example  we should try to assign a new   SiteInstance to a renderer process showing pages from the same site  if one   already exists.  This will help improve isolation between sites.    The heuristics should be smart enough to avoid overloading a single   renderer process  though.  For example  putting all Google Apps into a   single process will degrade their responsiveness.   </pre>
