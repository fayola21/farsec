<title>Issue 22243 -   chromium -    Different font rendering between 32 bit and 62 bit builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25617">r25617</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (64-bit):  window manager : Gnome            1. Compare font rendering in 32 bit and 64 bit builds with the same   settings      Font rendering should be the same.      Font rendering is different.    I've always found the font rendering of Chrome on Linux a bit weird on   previous builds  but I never reported it as I know it was a widely known   bug. I was happy to see that it had been solved when I updated Chrome on my   work pc a few days ago. However  when I got home and tried it on my home   laptop  the weird rendering was still there.    I have exactly the same settings on both computers in terms of desktop and   font rendering (I actually had both computers side by side when I was   setting up my work pc)  and the build version is also the same.    The only difference is that my laptop is running the 64 bit build and my   work pc is running the 32 bit build.    I am using the official google-chrome-unstable debs from   <a href="http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/">http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/</a>    Just to clarify: 32 bit version has good font rendering  64 bit is weird.    I am providing two screenshots  one of the &quot;good&quot; font rendering and other   of the &quot;bad&quot; font rendering. I'll provide a couple more when I get home   because I just noticed these screenshots might not be the best example.   It's more noticeable on the fixed width font (and on serif fonts  I'll also   try to provide a screenshot of those too).    Let me know if I can provide any additional info. </pre>
