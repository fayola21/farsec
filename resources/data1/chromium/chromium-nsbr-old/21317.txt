<title>Issue 21317 -   chromium -    Refactor paste and go out of AutocompleteEdit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The tab strip drag and drop code (in BrowserRootView) uses the autocomplete   edit view's paste and go functionality directly. It would be nice to move   this into a more general place (perhaps just a convenience function) that   doesn't requite an autocomplete edit. </pre>
