<title>Issue 4823 -   chromium -    &quot;Save As&quot; files should be listed in downloads page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I spent 30 mins on external bug tracker  to track a bug for this behavior  but failed. Finally  realized  we have it on local bug tracking system. So  moving this(b/1210220) to external tracker... As I need to file another  bugs related to this behavior.    Repro  #####  1. Navigate to any web page (For eg: google main page is fine)  2. Save the page using 'Save as'. (From right click context menu or menu  option)  3. Notice this [saved] file is not listed in downloads page [though it is  listed on download shelf ]    Funny Part:  -----------------  Right Click on any link on a webpage and save them  then we show up in  Downloads page.  Even we show up full-page plug-ins (eg: pdf)  in downloads page.    Looks like very inconsistent behavior. </pre>
