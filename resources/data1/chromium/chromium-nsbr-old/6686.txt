<title>Issue 6686 -   chromium -    Downloads screen truncates URLs and BW stats for display when there is more than enough room to display them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.

This is ESPECIALLY true for bandwidth   statistics since it would never need a significant amount of space!      Text is truncated.    Please provide
