<title>Issue 11361 -   chromium -    remove thumbnails should be renamed to manage thumbnails (read why) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.178.0 (15144)    i noticed you renamed the &quot;edit thumbnails&quot; to &quot;remove thmbnails&quot;    as a very active participant in chrome's help forum  i can tell you that   people who don't know chrome will swamp the help forum with requests &quot;how to   i remove a single thumbnail ?&quot; as the &quot;remove thumbnails&quot; seems like it will   not open the options that it does (just like clear downloads does it   immediatly)    if you can't stand the &quot;edit&quot; at least change to &quot;manage&quot;    thanx in advance </pre>
