Open a program - say Word or Google Talk  2. Open Chrome (so that other programs are still active and below it) and   use it.  3. Often  on mouseover  certain buttons/regions from the background window   get activated.      No matter what  buttons or other regions from windows below Chrome should   not get activated  since Chrome is the window on top.      Certain buttons/regions from windows in background/below Chrome get   activated. Sometimes  if I click (within chrome)  the window below comes up   to the top. This is a very crippling bug - affecting the usability of   Chrome. Screenshots attached (DOC).    <b>Please provide
