<title>Issue 14542 -   chromium -    [www.orkut.com]: Rendering of the &quot;ajouter aux applications&quot; link is a bit below the title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=9145006585335130698&amp;rl=t">http://www.orkut.com/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=9145006585335130698&amp;rl=t</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?      if you connect to Orkut and check the profil page  you will notice that   (using the french interface)  ajouter aux applications is very close to the   title. In IE this is not the case.        What is the expected result?      having a space between &quot;ajouter aux applications&quot; and &quot;applications&quot;       What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. connect to orkut with your Google Account  2. check the profil page      Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    IE6 is fine            </pre>
