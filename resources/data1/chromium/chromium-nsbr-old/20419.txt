<title>Issue 20419 -   chromium -    Imported IE Bookmarks do not keep order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just got this bug report from a user - when we import bookmarks from IE  we   don't retain their ordering information  and instead import everything in   alphabetical order. Maybe we're only looking at the favorites directory?    Ordering information is a pretty important part of users' bookmarks. </pre>
