<title>Issue 1911 -   chromium -    wasted pixel lines in chrome UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Google Chrome  2. Maximize the window        It would be expected to fill the available screen space.      There is a wasted single pixel line at the top and bottom of the Chrome   window. Presumably this is to provide a border to separate the task bar   from the Chrome window. It may be desired to leave this one pixel line to   separate the task bar  but it is not needed on the part of the screen where   the task bar is not present. Additionally  some users may place the task   bar on the left or right side of the screen in which case both top and   bottom wasted pixel lines are undesired. In this case if a separator were   desired  it needs to be on the left or right side where the task bar has   been placed.    Please provide
