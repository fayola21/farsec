<title>Issue 7979 -   chromium -    Link in application window should open tab in recently used tabgroup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Create an application window shortcut and open it (I'll call it AppWin)  2. Open 2 other Chrome windows (Window A and Window B)  3. Click a new window link in AppWin    What happens?  The link creates a new tab in Window A    What I'm hoping for?  The link creates a new tab in Window B    I'll often have AppWin showing me my web mail  one window having some   documentation and reading  and another window with current stuff. Any   current stuff I need to open from my mail opens in a certain window  and   always the same. How does Chrome choose which external window to create a   tab in? Most recently created? Most recently had focus?    This isn't a bug. It's either a feature request or just a clarification on   behaviour so I'll know how to work around it (I could always move all tabs   from A to B  and all from B to A if new tabs are showing up in the wrong   window) </pre>
