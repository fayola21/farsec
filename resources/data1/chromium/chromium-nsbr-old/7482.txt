<title>Issue 7482 -   chromium -    Some layout-tests could pass if we could differentiate our test_shell from the user-agent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout-test fails because of a platform difference:  LayoutTests/http/tests/misc/timer-vs-loading.html    This test redirects to a hanging page implemented with a php script.  Because of some network stack related issue (see <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?</a>  id=9001#c9)  the script sends few chars causing the test to fail for us.    If the test_shell had its own user-agent  we could modify the php script not to send these   char in our case and the test would pass (and we could upstream it).  For now the test has been marked as SKIP.    If more tests like this one come up  it might be worth doing this.       </pre>
