<title>Issue 16918 -   chromium -    can't attach dragged tabs to windows under ion3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.194.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20577">r20577</a>  OS + version: Jaunty Karmic Koala (alpha)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager: ion3 20090110-2    Tab dragging isn't working for me in ion3.    When I begin dragging the active tab  it is immediately detached from its   window.  I would expect it to instead just get reordered in its window's tab   list unless I move the pointer up or down.    Once the tab is detached  I'm unable to reattach it to its previous window or   to another window.  When I release the mouse button  a new window is always   created for the tab.    During the first second or two after the tab is detached  Chrome seems to   stutter and not update the position of the scaled-down tab image in response   to pointer movement -- the image just remains at the location where it was   detached.  If I release the mouse button at this time  Chrome misses the   ButtonRelease event and continues to keep the pointer grabbed until I click   the button again. </pre>
