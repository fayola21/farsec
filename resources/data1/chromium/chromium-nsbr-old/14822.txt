<title>Issue 14822 -   chromium -    Gnome panel disappears when Chromium hides the window decorations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.0~svn20090620r18892  OS + version : Ubuntu Karmic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): both  window manager : Metacity (with compositing)      1. start something that uses the systray  like liferea or gwibber  2. start chromium  3. uncheck &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; in chromium  4. click on a tray icon in the gnome panel to raise the app  click again to  hide it        nothing (no change between before and after step 4)        the gnome panel disappears. It's still there though  it's just invisible.  It's possible to make it reappear by blindly looking for the panel  preferences  then changing its background to something else and back to  what it was.    It's possible to retrigger the bug by toggling the pref in Chromium and  restarting at step 3.    100% reproducible here.    Note: this is with Metacity (not Compiz) with  /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager set to True in gconf. </pre>
