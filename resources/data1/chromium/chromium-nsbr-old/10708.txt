<title>Issue 10708 -   chromium -    Selecting a Check box/Radio button in Chrome is become very hard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces on DEV: 2.0.174.0  Beta:2.0.172.6 and Trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13975">r13975</a>)  Works fine in Stable.    Selecting a check box/radio button is become very hard in Chrome. Previously   user was able to select them by clicking any where on the LABEL of the   control. But we don't select them until unless user clicks on the control it   self.    Eg: try to select any check box in Clear browsing data dialog by clicking on   label of the control.  </pre>
