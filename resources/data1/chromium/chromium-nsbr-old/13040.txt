<title>Issue 13040 -   chromium -    no horizontal scrollbar in view source zooming to enlarge fonts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.182.3  URLs (if applicable) : view-source:<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>      <a title="view source is showing pretty small"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3220">issue 3220</a> was filled about the fact that &quot; view page source &quot; is in tiny   letters    my first solution to it was zooming the page (using &quot;Ctrl +/-&quot; for example)    it works pretty good except no horizontal scrollbar appear  which makes this quick solution impractical... </pre>
