<title>Issue 17129 -   chromium -    TestUtilityProcessHost leak - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both Mac and Linux valgrind bots have been reporting  this occasionally:    9 189 (64 direct  9 125 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost   in loss record 219 of 393    operator new(unsigned int)   (ome/chrome-bot/valgrind-svn/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:195)    (anonymous   namespace)::UtilityProcessHostTest_ExtensionUnpacker_Test::TestBody()   (chrome/browser/utility_process_host_unittest.cc:110)    The code says    // process_host will delete itself when it's done.  but that doesn't seem to reliably be the case. </pre>
