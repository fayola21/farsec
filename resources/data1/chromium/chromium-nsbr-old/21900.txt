<title>Issue 21900 -   chromium -    Tabs crash when trying to load pages with adobe flash content on gentoo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Try to view any page with flash content.        The page should load correctly and the adobe flash content should work.        When I try to access any page which uses the adoble flash plug-in like a  Youtube video  the tab never ends to load the page. After some time  the  browser shows an error message.   In Youtube I see only a gray area where the video should be. I also noticed  that  when I'm in the problematic tab  the keyboard shortcuts stop working  and if I try to close the tab it takes a while to do so.       <b>Please provide
