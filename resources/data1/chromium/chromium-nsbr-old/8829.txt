<title>Issue 8829 -   chromium -    Sync messages sent to UI thread trying to sign into Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trying to sign into Gmail yields the following error:    [79326:523:328625575238397:FATAL:/Users/pinkerton/src/chromium/src/chrome/browser/renderer_host/render_view_host.cc(664)]  Check failed: false. Can't send sync messages to UI thread without pumping  messages in the renderer or else deadlocks can occur if the page has  windowed plugins! (message type 8219)    when you type in the text fields.    Avi said he'd implement the proper messages based on the code the linux  folks added for the same error based on <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/28026">http://codereview.chromium.org/28026</a>. </pre>
