<title>Issue 13714 -   chromium -    Clean up skia/ directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to figure out where skia/ext and skia/config is going to live. This   directory used to contain all of skia  which has now moved to   third_party/skia.    skia/ext and skia/config are special cases in that they're the only   dependencies required by our WebKit port (checked in upstream) to compile.    We should figure out what the permanent home for these files are  and move   them there.    I think all the patches and stuff from skia/ can be deleted. </pre>
