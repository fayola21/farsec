<title>Issue 14745 -   chromium -    Can't reasonably zoom in without using a mouse (on selected keyboard layouts) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0        Firefox 3.x: FAIL (the shortcut can be changed by an extension)           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Enable a keyboard layout where both the + and = are located on a number   key and thus have to be shifted (e.g. a Swiss  Hungarian or Turkish one).  2. Try to zoom in without using the mouse or the numeric keypad (inexistent   on notebooks).      Ctrl+Shift+1  Ctrl+Shift+0 or whatever would produce a + or = when the Ctrl   key isn't pressed should zoom the page.      Nothing. Work-arounds are to Alt+Shift+T to the toolbar  hit Right enough   times  etc. or to change the keyboard layout. </pre>
