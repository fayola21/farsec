<title>Issue 16971 -   chromium -    Chrome 3.x  js-generated tables are sorted incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.194.0 Safari/531.5  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/">http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/</a>         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/">http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/</a>  2. Stay there      The table should be sorted in the same order as the elements.      Chrome sorts the table by key.      The table is generated from embedded js dicts. Snippet:    var search_results = {    44807: { ... }     44101: { ... }   }    In every other browser  the table is sorted in the array's order; 44807   first  44101 after. Chrome sorts it by id  44101 would come first then.  I'm not sure if this is a chrome bug  or a bug in every other browser.   Leaving this up for debate.    As a sidenote  Chrome 2.x sorts differently .. I couldn't figure out how   exactly  and since I don't have it its a bit hard to test.   </pre>
