<title>Issue 7306 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Pieces of webpages not repainted properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently running 2.0.159.0.  I feel like this regressed either in this   build or in b158.  Possibly a WebKit merge issue.  This is a nasty one    makes chunks of the web unusable.    Visit <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?id=19095342#itemanchor_19095342">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?id=19095342#itemanchor_19095342</a> .    Note the dark grey &quot;spoiler text&quot; box after the words &quot;Not-uh!&quot;.  Click   this box.    Expected: Box disappears  revealing text.  Actual: Cursor changes  but nothing repaints.  Clicking at a point to the   right of the box will reveal text between your original click location and   the box' right edge; a similar effect occurs when clicking to the left of   the box.    I have also seen this reproduce in different ways on other sites  e.g. the   GAIA login for this bug tracker  where whole sections of the page will be   unpainted until the user maximizes and restores the browser  or some such;   but this is the easiest reproduction. </pre>
