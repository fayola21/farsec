<title>Issue 17894 -   chromium -    Mac: Find ignores Mac standards  system support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	3.0.195.1 (Official Build 21222)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like   Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195 Safari/532.0    The Mac provides a specialized pasteboard for sharing the Find command's target  and has a stock set of   commands and command keys that should drive it. Mac Chrome ignores all this.      1. Go to TextEdit.app  2. Select some text and choose Edit &gt; Find &gt; Use Selection for Find (or type Command-e)  3. Go to Mac Chrome  4. Choose Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find Next (or type Command-g)        Chrome should search for the text you had selected in TextEdit        It searches for whatever it was searching for before.    Note also that Mac Chrome doesn't implement Use Selection for Find </pre>
