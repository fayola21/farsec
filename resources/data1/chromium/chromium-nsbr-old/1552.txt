<title>Issue 1552 -   chromium -    Facebook - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may be a facebook issue... they probably have to do some browser   detection adjusting for Chrome  but when you click &quot;Comment&quot; next to   someone's status change  the AJAX box doesn't slide out from below. It   doesn't even appear. And when looking at someone's photos you can't click   through pages in their photos.    These are probably problems with Chrome and AJAX/Javascript stuff.   </pre>
