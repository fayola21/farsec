<title>Issue 13487 -   chromium -    Document include_globs and exclude_globs feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I really like the matching url mechanism  but I would love to see it  improved by a black list mechanism. Basically  the same mechanism as  &quot;matches&quot; but used to specify patterns of urls where you don't want  your scripts to run.    Something like :  {   &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My First Extension&quot;    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The first extension that I made.&quot;    &quot;content_scripts&quot;: [     {       &quot;matches&quot;: [&quot;http://*/* &quot;https://*/*&quot;       &quot;except&quot;: [&quot;<a href="http://www.mywebsite.com/*&quot;">http://www.mywebsite.com/*&quot;</a>]     }   ]  }       </pre>
