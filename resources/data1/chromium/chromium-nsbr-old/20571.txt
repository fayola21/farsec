<title>Issue 20571 -   chromium -    Triple-click in omnibox followed by middle-click doesn't paste - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.202.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23795">r23795</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture: 32-bit  Window manager: ion3  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A      1. Click in the omnibox and type some text into it.  2. Triple-left-click in the omnibox to highlight all of the text and copy   it to the PRIMARY selection.  3. Middle-click in the omnibox.      The highlighted text should be pasted into the omnibox.      The highlighting is cleared but nothing gets pasted.  When I middle-click   in another app after doing this  I end up pasting some text from a previous   selection.  It looks like it's still owned by a Chrome window  though.    James  do you have any guesses about what's happening here?  The   'paste_clipboard_requested_' stuff from your <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=24705">r24705</a> seems like it could be   related  but I'm still seeing this when I revert your change  so it's   probably something that I broke. </pre>
