<title>Issue 7226 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behavior with &quot;Close tabs opened by this tab&quot; of tabstrip context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1223490&gt;    Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8889)    --On the [New Tab]  hit ctrl+h to history page or ctrl+j to downloads page.  --Right click on the [New Tab]'s tabstrip.    You will notice  &quot;Close tabs opened by this tab&quot; option is enabled in the  intertitial context menu.    If it is by design then     For Ctrl T on [New Tab]:  We should enable the same context menu option on  [New Tab] for Ctrl + T also. </pre>
