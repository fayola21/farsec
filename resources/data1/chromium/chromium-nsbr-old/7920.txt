<title>Issue 7920 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Shift+T should not undo SSL Error page ! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces in Trunk: 2.0.165.0 (Developer Build 10094) and DEV: in  2.0.164.0 (Official Build 9941)    NO repro steps in Stable: 154.48    -open a [new tab] &amp; Navigate to <a href="https://www.sourceforge.net">https://www.sourceforge.net</a> [SSL Error page  shows up -don't respond to it]  -Close the tab  -Ctrl+Shift+t to undo/restore the tab.    Expected: Previous page should be restored. In this case [new tab]    Result: SSL error page shows up.    If we think we change here by design  then other bug over here is:    After step3: [undoing the SSL error page]  -Navigate to any webpage (eg:google home page) in the same tab.    That's it  you end up with infinite backward navigation between google and  SSL error page :(   </pre>
