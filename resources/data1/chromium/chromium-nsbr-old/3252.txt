Select the &quot;scrolling window&quot; profile in SnagIt  3. Open a Chrome window with a vertical scrollbar (news.google.com is a   good one)  4. Capture the content portion of the Chrome window.      Note that the scrolled off portion of the page is not captured in the   screenshot. The entire page  even the part scrolled off  is captured in   Firefox on XP and Chrome on Vista.    [originally reported by Jonathan Rosenberg]     </pre>
