<title>Issue 4898 -   chromium -    File extension wrong for saved files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Save a file (e.g. some .jpg).  Delete the suggested name and type something   else  without an extension (&quot;foo&quot;).    Expected: File named foo.jpg  Actual: File named foojpg    Additional problem: The &quot;file type&quot; list is unpopulated  making it   impossible to tell Chrome whether you want the file saved as &quot;foo.jpg&quot; or   just &quot;foo&quot;.    I believe both of these are regressions; I'm almost certain the first is.    Not sure who touched this code last  seems like it was either Sid or Glen. </pre>
