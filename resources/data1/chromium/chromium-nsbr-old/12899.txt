<title>Issue 12899 -   chromium -    Snapshots needed! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have dozens of snapshots in different folders and therefore I can switch   between the different builds and compare them.    But since several days all versions are crashing all the time (especially   when lot of tabs are opened). This is the first time  I would really like to   recourse to one stable version of chromium to finish some private stuff.    I'm not going to use any automatic updater on my computer.    So I ask myself  where to find the snapshots of the updated (stable)   versions?! </pre>
