<title>Issue 2210 -   chromium -    Object with undefined height is causing the issue  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : Chrome/0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.winserver.com/aupinfo">http://www.winserver.com/aupinfo</a>         Safari 3: Not Tested      Firefox 3: Not Tested           IE 7: Not Tested           IE 6: OK    Firefox 1.5: OK     Opera 9.27: OK   K-meleon 1.2: OK    o What steps will reproduce the problem?    Create a simple web page and add &lt;object&gt; tag to after the &lt;BODY&gt; tag and   before some viewable display you EXPECT to be at the top of the page.     Example:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;  &lt;style&gt;body {margin: 5px; border: 2px solid black;}&lt;/style&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;  &lt;H2&gt;Welcome to whatever...............&lt;/H2&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    Open the page with Chrome.    o What is the expected result?     The &lt;H2&gt; tag is rendered at the top of the page.    o What happens instead?    It appears CHROME is given &lt;OBJECT&gt; some (random?) width and height and is   rendering the &lt;H2&gt; at some location other than the top.    The workaround was to get the object a default style height and width.    OBJECT {    width: 0px; height: 0px;  }    Attached is the screen shot for the above example.    NOTE: THIS IS IMPORTANT.    Many people use HTMLHELP to create Windows CHM Help files for their   products and they may also copy the *.HTM source file to their WEB SITE for   online viewing.  Just like we do at the <a href="http://www.winserver.com/aupinfo">http://www.winserver.com/aupinfo</a>   url.     I suggest only Safari and Chrome will have this problem.       </pre>
