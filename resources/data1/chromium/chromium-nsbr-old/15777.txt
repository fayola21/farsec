<title>Issue 15777 -   chromium -    Need to update how we handle focusing to match new WebKit code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2009-July/008635.html">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2009-July/008635.html</a>    &quot;&quot;&quot;  In order to get focus memory for tabs working properly  we need a notion of   whether or not the underlying Page is focused.  We need this since Web   pages should be able to shift around programmatic focus in background tabs   and have the new focused frame and focused node be remembered if you switch   back to that tab.    Our current code was relying only on the window being active plus the frame   being focused to decide that it should draw focus rings and blink carets.    However this isn't good enough in the case described above.    I have just added a new boolean to FocusController that indicates whether   or not the Page is focused.  The Mac and Windows ports have been patched to   update the Page focused state properly (I hope).    Other ports will need to call page-&gt;focusController()-&gt;setFocused(true) or   setFocused(false) now in order for everything to work properly.  &quot;&quot;&quot;    I'll update this bug once I roll deps </pre>
