<title>Issue 15630 -   chromium -    Network code isn't robust to filesystem going away (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Mondays  we get a bunch of email from people saying that &quot;The site's   security certificate is not valid!&quot;. This seems related to a whole cluster   of weird behaviours reported on the chrome-linux  probably because people's   kerberose tickets expire over the weekend.    Spewing multiple times a second:  [12157:28244:1203445930168:ERROR:/work/chromium/src/net/base/x509_certificat  e_nss.cc(469)] CERT_PKIXVerifyCert failed err=-8179    I am assuming this has something to do with the networking code not being   robust in the face of the filesystem going away. </pre>
