<title>Issue 12658 -   chromium -    It should be possible to control the type of window with the extension system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It should be possible to control the application and incognito window   styles using the extension API.    One question: does the underlying system support combining the styles? Like   an incognito application window? If so  the API should  too. Even if the UI   doesn't currently support it  but we think it might someday become   possible  our API should expose it and just throw an error when they are   combined.    Proposed additions to windows.create():     {    ...    application_mode: true   /* optional  defaults to false */    incognito_mode: true   /* optional  defaults to false */    ...  }    We could add these to window.update()  where they are supported by the   underlying code. </pre>
