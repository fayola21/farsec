<title>Issue 22158 -   chromium -    Daily Auto-Updating Google Chrome Build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now our crash data is lagging approximately 1-2 weeks behind our current tip of tree.  This is causing us problems   finding regression points  iteratively attempting fixes  and making more aggressive use of CHECKS.  More over it would be   helpful in getting the software in our users hands more rapidly to help find feature breaks (and see when feature defects   have been cured w/ out waiting a week or two for the next dev cycle)    Proposal:    Build a breakpad enabled chromium build along side the standard chromium builds (revision for revision)  and store in the   outputs in a non-public archive.    The auto-update mechanism:  Right now <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/win/LATEST/REVISION">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/win/LATEST/REVISION</a>  which represents the last all green is   updated by a chron script.  When the chron build executes and finds a green build  it would update a special   LATEST/REVISION location w/ the new version and mini-installer binaries (this special update would happen no more than   once a day).  Since we have the matching compiled binaries this would effectively be a copy.    The special chromium build would &quot;auto-update&quot; by polling (5 hour interval  startup  etc...) on this special   LATEST/REVISION location and install mini-installer    Crash reporting:    We'd report crashes back in a way that would specially indicate the source of the chromium build (i.e. a specific product   or version moniker)    TBD (offline discuss):  Since data collection is involved  we'd need to figure out how we will manage the EULA and at what point this would occur. </pre>
