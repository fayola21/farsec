<title>Issue 5374 -   chromium -    https page (if the page does not exist) set as home page should always redirect to http. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.36 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6676">r6676</a>)    I'm not sure  when we regressed here. (See the bug: b/1206549 )  Copy and Pasting the repro steps from the internal tracker:    -Set <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> as home page.  -while [New Tab] or other webpage has the focus  hit Alt + Home Key to  navigate to Home Page.    Initially the URL &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>&quot; appears in Omnibox and then  quickly changes to &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&quot;    You will get &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>&quot; in the Omnibox for 2nd or 3rd hit of  &quot;Alt + home&quot;.    Though it is a low priority.     </pre>
