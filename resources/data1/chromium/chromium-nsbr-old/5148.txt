<title>Issue 5148 -   chromium -    Links don't become visited - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version     : 0.5.155.0 (Build 6424)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html">http://www.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html</a>           Chrome 0.4.154.31: OK       Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit given URL      Passed all tests :-)  To be more precise: The :visited selector should control/beautify a   visited link.       The visited link responds to the :link selector instead of :visited.      It is not only this website. In all websites the visited links look like   unvisited links. Their color should become purple but it stays blue. </pre>
