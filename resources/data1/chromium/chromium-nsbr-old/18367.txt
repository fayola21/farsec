<title>Issue 18367 -   chromium -    Hardcoded colors in omnibox2 unreadable on some system themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The old Omnibox code went to some length to ensure that text and background   colors were always distinct enough (in luminance) that they would be   readable.  The new code doesn't do this  and hardcodes some text colors   (e.g. the light grey used for pieces of Suggest results that match the   user's input)  while taking other colors (e.g. the mouse hover color) from   the user's theme  at least partly.    As a result  on Linus' Windows Classic box  a hovered suggestion is totally   unreadable.  I suspect (but haven't tested) that a light-on-dark theme   would result in even less readable text (i.e. all elements unreadable).    Not sure we can ship in a state where some users can't read our results :(    The solution here is probably to not hardcode text colors  and instead get   them from the theme. </pre>
