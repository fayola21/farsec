<title>Issue 3832 -   chromium -    No context menu for item in cronology - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3        Every item present in the cronology list does not have a contextual menu.      I expect the same contextual menu I receive for every link.      I can open the url in another tab using the mouse middle button but for   example I cannot open it in another window.     </pre>
