<title>Issue 6771 -   chromium -    AutocompletePopupView and AutocompleteEditView should be actual views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now these draw themselves using direct access to HWNDs  win32 graphic   calls  etc.  They have their own mirroring code  event handling  screen   positioning based on ugly accessor hacks to get at other parts of the UI    etc.  All this should die. </pre>
