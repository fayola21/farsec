<title>Issue 4604 -   chromium -    The buttons on download shelf are not repositioned/repainted properly  after deleting a file. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.23(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5672">r5672</a>)    PLEASE note  it is not dupe of the <a title="Redraw issue/truncation with confirmation item on Download Bar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3562"> Issue 3562 </a>.      1. Download a file twice in the same tab.     [ my intention is to have any two items in the download shelf ]  2. Delete the left most file in download shelf from Downloads page.  3. Come back to tab with download shelf and observe the downloads shelf.    What is the expected output?   The next button(file) should repositioned to the beginning of the download  shelf.     What do you see instead?  It is not repositioned (screenshot attached).    PS: Works fine in 0.3.154.3 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=3339">r3339</a> </pre>
