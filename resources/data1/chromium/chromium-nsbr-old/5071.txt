<title>Issue 5071 -   chromium -    Maximizing with multi-monitor setup doesn't work right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have two monitors with different resolutions or just with the windows   taskbar on the side  2. Try maximizing the Chrome window on both monitors      Chrome doesn't appear to use the regular maximizing routines  but to size   the window according to the size that it thinks the desktop is.  I have a   1900x1200 monitor and a 1280x1024 monitor at home.  When I maximize Chrome   on the 1280x1024 monitor  the window is still 1900x1200 so I don't see most   of it.                Please provide
