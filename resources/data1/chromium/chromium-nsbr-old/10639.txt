<title>Issue 10639 -   chromium -    C++ accessible string map for GRIT resources. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (following on from email thread):  To make our resources accessible to DOMUI pages and themes in a human-  readable way  it would be nice if we could generate a map of resource names   to resource IDs.    Stripping the IDR_ and lowercasing would be a nice-to-have. </pre>
