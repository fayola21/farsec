<title>Issue 16443 -   chromium -    Support Cocoa event model in Mac NPAPI plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The first cut of the Mac plugin support code only supports the Carbon event model (or more   accurately  the MacOS 9 event model :-)).  Apple recently defined a new event model (the Cocoa   event model) which is much cleaner and supports more modern capabilities (additional mouse   buttons  wheel scrolling  etc.).  While almost no plugins currently request the Cocoa event model    this will change rapidly now that Safari 4 has shipped.  In particular  plugins with rich UIs such as   the Google Earth plugin will want to adopt the new model ASAP.   </pre>
