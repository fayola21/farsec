<title>Issue 5119 -   chromium -    Session restore prompts to restore after crash while in incognito  but doesn't restore anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome normally  go to google.com  wait a few seconds  then shoot   it down with task manager.  2. Launch Chrome with --incognito    At this point  Chrome will launch in incognito  realize that it crashed   last time and suggest to restore. However  selecting to restore will just   make the infobar go away and not do anything else.    Scott said it is probably easy to fix so that we restore the crashed non-  incognito window. </pre>
