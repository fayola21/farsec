<title>Issue 5470 -   chromium -    Chromium: Save Password Bar shows up even after sign-out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.155.0(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6925">r6925</a>)    Not sure  when it is broken.      1. Login to Gmail internet a/c  2. Don't respond to Save password bar.  3. Sign out.    What is the expected output?   Save Password bar should not show up.    What do you see instead?  Save Password bar still shows up  even after sign-out.         </pre>
