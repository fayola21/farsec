<title>Issue 21302 -   chromium -    Merge chromium's config.h.in into WebCore's config.h [Step 1] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium today has its own config.h (over here   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/webkit/config.h.in">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/webkit/config.h.in</a>)  which was forked   a while back from webkit's config.h. I'm preparing the ground for the webkit   port  I'm depreciating chromium's config.h and moving its chromium-specific  defines into the ifdef PLATFORM(CHROMIUM) section of webkit's config.h.    Due the complexity of this step  it is broken into two issues:  Step 1: Merge in changes from webkit's config.h into chromium's config.h.in.   Step 2: Copy config.h.in into webkit as the new config.h.  Step 3: Delete chromiums config.h.in and make it use webkit's config.h.    This issue is for tracking step 1. </pre>
