<title>Issue 8794 -   chromium -    [Wishlist] &quot;Clear All Downloads&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> First thing  you should add a Wishlist bug type :-P    Now on to my real thing  could you perhaps add a button in the downloads   window that says &quot;Clear all downloads&quot;? I don't like having my entire   download history staring at me in the window.     </pre>
