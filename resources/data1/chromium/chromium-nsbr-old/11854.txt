<title>Issue 11854 -   chromium -    Extensions should be allowed to load some chrome:// URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I try to load a favicon image using chrome://favicon/ I get the   following error message in the console.    Not allowed to load local resource:   chrome://favicon/<a href="http://glenmurphy.com/projects/">http://glenmurphy.com/projects/</a>    Is there a reason to not allow all chrome:// URLs from extensions? I would at   least expect to be able to use favicon  fileicon  thumb and theme. </pre>
