<title>Issue 1039 -   chromium -    Better handling for large number of tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Add large number of tabs using the &quot;+&quot; button on title/tab bar      - Ability to add any number of tabs seamlessly  - Tabs  which are actually used for identification of website and holder   for &quot;title&quot;  are properly distinguishable      - The tabs become smaller and smaller  with no text visible after some   point - depending on the screen size (width)  - After some point  it is not allowed to add more tabs (75 in my case -   1280 x 768) and the &quot;+&quot; button gets hidden or truncated. Sometimes it is   visible over the last tab  but not clickable.    Please provide
