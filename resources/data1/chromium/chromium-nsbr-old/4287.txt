<title>Issue 4287 -   chromium -    Export Bookmarks should suggest *.html as file type to Save As. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.16 (Official Build 5093)        1. Ctrl+Shift+B or menu to bring up Bookmark Manager.  2. Tools Menu &gt; Export bookmarks.  3. In &quot;Save As&quot; dialog  note that in &quot;Save as type&quot; dropdown  the only  choice is &quot;All Files.&quot;  4. Enter a filename  e.g. &quot;ChromeBookmarks.&quot;  5. Note that the file is saved without .html extension.  6. Tools Menu &gt; Import bookmarks.  7. Note that the file just saved is not visible in the &quot;Open&quot; dialog   because the filter in &quot;Files of type&quot; dropdown is *.html.      The user should be able to export a file  and expect that file to be  visible when importing.     Chrome should probably suggest *.htm  *.html as the file types.    </pre>
