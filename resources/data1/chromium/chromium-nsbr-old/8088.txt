<title>Issue 8088 -   chromium -    Mouse hover from out of Tab strip's context menu should un-select menu item. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a regression. Repros since from the beginning.     If tab strip context menu loses keyboard focus  then we should un-select  the menu item.    -Right click on a Tab strip to show up context menu.  -Highlight a menu item and slowly move mouse to context area   (for easy repro steps  slowly move mouse horizontally from highlighted  menu item to content area.)     Result:  The selected item should be unselected once it loses the focus.    I don't think this is by design.    No context menu exhibits this behavior.   </pre>
