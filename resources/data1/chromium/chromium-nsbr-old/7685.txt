<title>Issue 7685 -   chromium -    test_shell - problem with &lt;select&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open <a href="http://labs.flog.co.nz/raytracer">http://labs.flog.co.nz/raytracer</a> in test_shell.exe and click to   &lt;select&gt; element ( Pixel size: ) - you need to click twice to open it.    I understand it is not a big issue  as far as it happens in test_shell but   not in real browser  but may be someone can give some ideas why does it   happens? </pre>    </td>  </tr>          <tr class="cursor_off">  <td class="vt issuecomment">        <span class="author">Comment <a name="c1"  href="#c1">1</a>  by  <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/u/jon@chromium.org/">jon@chromium.org</a></span>   <span class="date" title="Fri Feb 13 13:32:16 2009">Feb 13  2009</span>   <pre> Please provide
