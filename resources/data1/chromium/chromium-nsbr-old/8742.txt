<title>Issue 8742 -   chromium -    Chrome should provide a simpler means for developers to clear the browser cache and set cache policy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.1           Safari 3: Provides menu option      Firefox 3: Bad UI  but about:config param for the persistent. Web   Developer Toolbar extensions provides a solution           IE 7: Provides a cache policy UI in options           IE 8: Developer tools have a fast &quot;clear the cache button&quot; in   addition to older cache config UI      Chrome makes it difficult for web developers to know that they're dealing   with the latest version of resources that they may be actively working on.   This problem has had various solutions on other browsers over time  but   Chrome's default &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; menu item duplicates FF's   terribly slow UI for the common-case developer workflow need to just clear   the cache. Safari provides a menu in the &quot;File&quot; dialog and a keyboard   accelerator to clear the cache  and this seems like something we should   support. Additionally  a button in the web inspector to clear the cache   would be a big win. </pre>
