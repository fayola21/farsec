<title>Issue 1795 -   chromium -    spell check doesnt work? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 2.152.0    Quite often the spell check determines words are incorrect but wont suggest   corrections. I for instance  it wont suggest corrections for heavially   (heavily)   but it shows that its incorrect.     i dont know what the technical words for it is  but broaden the scope of   the spell check allowing it to search for more possibilities for correct   spelling.       </pre>
