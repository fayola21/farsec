<title>Issue 20844 -   chromium -    design-mode iframes do not properly scroll to keep cursor visible when typing non-wrappable words - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/editing/selection/designmode-no-caret.html      1. Open the test case  2. Hold down the j key (until scrollbars appear)  3. Hold down the k key    Expected:  The frame should scroll to keep your caret visible (and you should see k's)    Actual:  you keep seeing a line of j's with the caret (not flashing) 2 letters from   the right edge of the frame.    Repro on both Safari and Chrome and only occurs if you don't put spaces in   your typing.    bug filed upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19490">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19490</a>     </pre>
