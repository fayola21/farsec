<title>Issue 5507 -   chromium -    Status bar popup is very distracting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Could you please do something about the annoying and distracting status bar    popup?     Google chrome is the most convenient browser in my opinion  but I think the   goal to make it compact was taken too far by removing the traditional status   bar. I'd much rather have 20-25 extra pixels at the bottom in place of a popup.     As a user it's annoying  but as a developer it's even more annoying since my   link hover states cannot be fully enjoyed because the users are distracted by   the status popup.     Plus only short urls are visible in the popup status bar. </pre>
