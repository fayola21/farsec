<title>Issue 19929 -   chromium -    Focus wonky with window sheets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 202.0 (Developer Build 23612)  OS version           : 10.5.8      1. Go to a page which produces one of those dialogs  e.g.   &lt;<a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html</a>&gt;.  2. Select File/Open Location(s)... or press Cmd-L.      The location bar's contents are selected (in nice blue) and the location  bar is given keyboard focus.      The contents are selected  but focus is not given; you get a nasty grey  instead. You *can* click the location bar with your mouse and give it focus  though. </pre>
