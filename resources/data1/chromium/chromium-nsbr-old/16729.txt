<title>Issue 16729 -   chromium -    Don't use hardcoded IE for post-install survey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  when the user is uninstalling Chrome  we launch IE to show a user   survey so users can relay why they're uninstalling.      However  the call to launch IE is hard-coded  and will fail if IE is not   present.  We should change this implementation to use IEFrame.dll  the   previous default browser  or some other means to show the user survey. </pre>
