<title>Issue 16516 -   chromium -    Integrating Find In Page into address bar search. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The idea of chrome's &quot;address bar&quot; was to be able to search/do anything in   one bar so integrating the Find In Page into the address bar should be   paramount. The time wasted to open up &quot;find in page&quot; goes against the   principles that chrome is founded on.    Features include...  Find as type.  The ability to choose between 4 highlight colours. (The 4 colour types of   Google logo)    Please find attached an image of the featured idea requested that I made   illustrating how it would look.    Here is a link to it as well... <a href="http://i44.tinypic.com/2eq7urc.jpg">http://i44.tinypic.com/2eq7urc.jpg</a> </pre>
