<title>Issue 7404 -   chromium -    Do not close the browser if the last tab is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> One annoying thing that often happens to me when using Chrome is that if I   have just one tab open and want to close that but not close the browser   then I have to first open a new tab and then close the tab.    it will be nice if we can open the new tab page when the user closes the   last tab. We can still close the browser when the user presses X on the   browser window  but if he presses X on the last tab we can either have an   empty window or open new tab page.     </pre>
