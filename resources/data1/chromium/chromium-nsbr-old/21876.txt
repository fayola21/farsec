<title>Issue 21876 -   chromium -    [feature] option to delete browsing data before a specified time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1  URLs (if applicable) : n/a             IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to the clear browsing data page  2. Look in the drop down menu  3. Note that you will only find 'everything'  'last 4 weeks'  'last week'   and 'today' (translated)    I think it would be just as usefull (or even more usefull) to have the   option to clear the browsing data of (for example) MORE than a X time ago.  For example: two months ago I visited site A. This site gave me cookies    cache-items  a note in the history list and all other plausibilities. But   for items of more than a month ago I don't think it is useful to keep the   data. So I want to delete it all. I go to the clear browsing data and the   ONLY option I have is to delete ALL my history (of today till the moment I   cleared it all the last time). But I do not want to delete my history of   today. So I am not able to delete all browsing data of more than for   example a month ago  because I would lose all my 'new' data too...    So please add an option to do this! </pre>
