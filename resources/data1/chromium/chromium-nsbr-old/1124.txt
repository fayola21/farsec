<title>Issue 1124 -   chromium -    Not able to open Vcards and save them in programs as Outlook - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>           What is the expected result? In my case we have a corporate directory in   this directory you can download Vcards  if you click on the link the card   opens and will then be saved as contact in Outlook.      What happens instead? The card opens in plain text and can't be saved in   Outlook      Please provide
