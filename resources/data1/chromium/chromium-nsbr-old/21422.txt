<title>Issue 21422 -   chromium -    Drag and drop handler hang when  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Happens on Vista. I haven't tested other operating systems.  1. Find a .cab file. Download it with whatever you want. I happened to use    <a href="http://platformdl.adobe.com/NOS/getPlusPlus/1.6/gp.cab">http://platformdl.adobe.com/NOS/getPlusPlus/1.6/gp.cab</a>  2. Browse to the .cab file in Explorer.  3. Drag one of the files in the .cab over the Chrome window without letting   go of the mouse.      Chrome shouldn't try to handle the dragged file unless it's actually   dropped onto the window.      Chrome tries to handle it mid-drag which causes both the Explorer window   previewing the .cab and the Chrome window to hang.    <b>Please provide
