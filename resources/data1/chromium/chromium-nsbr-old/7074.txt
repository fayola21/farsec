<title>Issue 7074 -   chromium -    Tabs shrink to minimum width when opening new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.158.0  OS                   : Vista      1. Open a new tab from link or ctrl+t  2. All opened tabs shrink to minimum width  hiding favicons and text  3. Close any tab  4. After a pause the tabs resize to the correct width again    Seems to be random but will typically occur multiple times during a   browsing session. </pre>
