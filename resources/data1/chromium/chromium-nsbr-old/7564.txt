<title>Issue 7564 -   chromium -    Remove the autofill empty values clean-up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some code has been added that removes empty values from the autofill DB.  (empty values were previously stored  <a title="Form autofill should not show the empty vaules with arrow keys" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6111"> bug #6111 </a>).    This code could probably be removed in few months  once we assume all users have run that   code and their DB is clean.    The places to look for the clean-up:  autofill_manager.h: void ClearEmptyEntriesInWebDatabase(); should be removed  web_data_service.h: void ClearAutofillEmptyValueElements(); should be removed.  web_database.h: remove bool ClearAutofillEmptyValueElements();  pref_names.h: remove kFormAutofillEmptyValueCleared[];       </pre>
