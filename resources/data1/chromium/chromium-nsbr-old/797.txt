<title>Issue 797 -   chromium -    Running 8+ tabs for about 5 hours - Hard Disk grinding when switching between tabs. High I/O usage. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Opened many tabs with various web sites.  2. Switch between tabs.  3. Chrome becomes clunky/unresponsive and hard drive light is solid.   Windows task manager shows extremely high I/O Read/Write bytes.        Expect switching between tabs to be quick and responsive. Should not be   writing such a massive amount of data to the hard disk.         Reads more data from the disk then a virus scanner (~2.5x more) Acts like   it is out of memory and is paging to the disk all the time.    Please provide
