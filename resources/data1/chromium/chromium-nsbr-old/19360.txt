<title>Issue 19360 -   chromium -    Can't copy table from Excel to Google Docs  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : latest version as of August 1  2009          Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 8:OK    I can't copy from excel spreadsheets into gmail or google docs when   using the chrome browser. It works with firefox and explorer.  I work at Google and have this problem internally.    To Reproduce:   highlight a group of cells from an excel spreadsheet  press Ctrl-C  then go   to the gmail email you are editing and press Ctrl-V.    Expected behavior:  With firefox I just get a copy of the formatted table (especially if my   gmail is in   formatted mode).     Chrome behavior:  Some of the time  with chrome it immediately turns into a bunch of numbers   ... but   other times it works.  The same thing has been happening with pasting into google docs.     </pre>
