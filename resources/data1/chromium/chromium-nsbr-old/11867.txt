<title>Issue 11867 -   chromium -    Mouse events don't always make it into toolstrips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hover over a toolstrip that has a button  2. Switch to some other window without moving the mouse  3. Observe that the button stays highlighted    Toolstrips don't always get notified of mouseout events. I'm not sure if the   normal TabContents does something special to make sure this happens that   we're missing  or if the problem exists there too and is just worse because   of the small size of toolstrips. </pre>
