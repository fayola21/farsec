<title>Issue 18271 -   chromium -    Bypass proxy list should only be applied when using manual proxy settings. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the Internet Explorer proxy settings:    (1) check autodetect    (2) specify a manual proxy (for any protocol)    (3) set a some proxy bypass list    Assuming the autodetect succeeds and we are using the wpad PAC script:      * IE will not apply the proxy bypass rules    * Chromium WILL apply the proxy bypass rules    Chromium should be behaving the same as IE and only applying the proxy bypass   to the manual proxy rules. </pre>
