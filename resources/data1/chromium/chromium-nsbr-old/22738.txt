Add meta to opt in for Google Chrome Frame from   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/developers_guide.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/developers_guide.html</a>  2. Add CFInstall JavaScript code  3. Open page in IE6  4. Frame with instructions to install Google Chrome Frame cover the page   and there is no way to cancel installation.        There should be a 'Cancel' button together with possibly 'X' button near   the right top corner of the iframe (or in the div containing the iframe) that   allows to cancel plugin installation and use page in IE.    Rationale:    Not everyone has administrator rights on their computer or even WANT to   install another plugin. Maybe they want just to check out the page.    Additional points for:    - Adding a notification that the site may not look as expected when   viewed without a plugin  - Allow user to dismiss this dialog until next visit/never show this dialog   again          <b>Please provide
