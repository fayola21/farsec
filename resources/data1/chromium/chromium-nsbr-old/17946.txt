<title>Issue 17946 -   chromium -    [buildbot] Target type (release/debug) should be a property - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The build factories are set at buildbot startup and are immuable.    By having a property for the target type  the build steps class would   determine at &quot;step execution time&quot; the exact step to run instead of &quot;hard   coding&quot; the paths and values at build factory creation time. </pre>
