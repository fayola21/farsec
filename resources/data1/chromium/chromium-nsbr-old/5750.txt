<title>Issue 5750 -   chromium -    Toolbar accessibility mode does not remember which button is active when focus is lost/regained - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Press ALT-SHIFT-T to go to toolbar accessibility mode  2. Press the right arrow key to move the accessibility focus to the page button  3. focus another window (ex: explorer)  then focus back the browser window    What is the expected output?  The current accessibility focused node is the page button.    What do you see instead?  The current accessibility focused node is the back button.  Also the page button still shows the &quot;hot state&quot;.    Notes:  Not sure if the behavior should be the one described above  or whether we should remember which view had focus before we   switched to the toolbar accessible mode. Example of that mode would be:  - page is focused  user press alt-shift-t  location bar gets focused  - Alt-tab twices (so the browser's window loses and regains focus)  - page is focused again (not the location bar)       </pre>
