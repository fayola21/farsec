<title>Issue 17538 -   chromium -    No support for ARM processors in dev channel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While it would be fairly easy to do custom builds  I would really like to see   a Chromium developer channel build for ARM processors. Since WebKit and V8   generally support the ARM architecture pretty well  it is a shame to see the   other two platforms only get precedence.    Given the development of more and more ARM-based Netbooks and desktop-like   computing devices which would require such a browser (and a desperate need to   quit using Firefox.. Google Gears just isn't available for ARM)    Oh  Gears for ARM (for Firefox) and the Google Talk Voice/Video plugin for   ARM would be great too (especially since a real Flash player is nearly   here..) </pre>
