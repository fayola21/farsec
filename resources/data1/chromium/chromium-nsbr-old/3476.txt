<title>Issue 3476 -   chromium -    Massive CPU/lag spikes in 0.3.154.3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On both my work and home machines (both dual-core  lots of RAM) I've   experienced a new issue with 0.3.154.3: massive CPU load while scrolling   certain tabs.    When this has reproduced  it's been on <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/latestchatty.x">http://www.shacknews.com/latestchatty.x</a> .  The trigger may be some   particular Flash ad being loaded at the top of the page (?)  which is why   it's so hard to reproduce this at will; it could also have to do with   navigating back and forward between pages (maybe something isn't getting   cleaned up properly on navigation?).  CCing jam/ananta (for plugins) and   brettw (for navigation controller) in case they have ideas.    The behavior I see is that scrolling the page  with either the wheel or   scroll thumb  suddenly becomes _horribly_ laggy.  The Chrome task manager   shows the renderer process for that tab (not the plugin or browser   processes!) taking tons of CPU (&gt;50% almost immediately on scrolling  and   continuing to spike upwards as I keep scrolling).  (By contrast  when the   problem is not occurring  dragging the scroll thumb as fast as possible   continuously gets the renderer process up to a peak of about 40% CPU --   seems kind of high to me  but the app remains very responsive.)    At this point the browser is nearly unusable  as any time I try to scroll   the tab my machine basically comes to a dead halt.  Restarting the browser   definitely fixes the issue.  No more data yet.   </pre>
