Go to &quot;1 other request&quot; {this is an algorithmic program used by facebook   to suggest friends}  2. When u get to the page where suggested friends are listed then [a   maximum of 5 friends are listed at one time]   3. One can close the one of the friend suggestion and then the next friends   suggest gets replaced by it  4. Problem: Over the data regarding the friend suggestion is not loaded at   all  some how it is blank. It works fine on other browsers  i dont have the   screenshots now because all my friend suggestion are over as if now  i will   get them in near future and upload them.         The data pertaining to ever friend suggestion should be loaded  IF GOOGLE CHROME GIVES ERRORS IN FACEBOOK  IT WILL BE NOT A HIT PRODUCT  AS   FACEBOOK IS USED FREQUENTLY AND EXTENSIVELY BY SO MANY PEOPLE.      4.
