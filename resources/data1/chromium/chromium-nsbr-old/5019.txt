<title>Issue 5019 -   chromium -    Form handling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.29  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.ingdirect.com.au">http://www.ingdirect.com.au</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE        Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. log in as account holder  2. attempt to transfer funds to an external account        A new page with confirmation should open       returns to the first page - same reaction as if the cancel button were hit.  The login procedure works fine with this site and I have been able to do   similar operations with other sites.    Obviously I can't give you the account login details for my web banking   software. So I realise this won't help you very much.    Cheers   Ron </pre>
