<title>Issue 367 -   chromium -    Machine learning for omnibox (match input strings to result URLs) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 3: -      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: -      1. Enter a keyword in the omnibar          Omnibar shows links from history etc  without clear ordering      Omnibar should return the most frequent visited URL's on top  so that my   popular sites are always directly visible.    Firefox does a great job by 'learning' which sited are my favorites  this   will allow me to open frequent visited sites by just entering two letters   in the awesomebar and press enter  the omni bar does not seem to learn that   well.    </pre>
