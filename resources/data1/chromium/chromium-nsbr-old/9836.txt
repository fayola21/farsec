<title>Issue 9836 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: unable to change target folder/filename of downloaded page/file  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0 (Developer Build 13252)  URLs (if applicable) : any    Regression info: regression happened between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13165">r13165</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13174">r13174</a>.  Please  note that in the changelist  dialogs (including download dialogs) were  refactored in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13168">r13168</a>.     * This issue applies to both saved pages and files.        Precondition: Options &gt; Minor Tweaks &gt; Download location &gt; Ask where to  save each file before downloading: checkbox should be checked.     1. Open any web page.   2. Right-click on content area &gt; &quot;Save as...&quot; to open &quot;Save As&quot; dialog.  3. Select a different target folder to save to.  4. Click &quot;Save&quot;.    What is the expected result?    Page should be saved to the folder you selected.    What happens instead?    Page is saved to the previously set folder: you are unable to change the  download folder.  You are also unable to change the filename of the saved  page from that which was originally suggested in the dialog.   </pre>
