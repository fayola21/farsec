<title>Issue 10833 -   chromium -    Standalone-looking windows should not close with last browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The bookmarks manager window and the Options menu look like standalone   windows  but they close if you close the last browser window.  Either they   should not close or they should look different.  Presumably the latter  I   dunno. </pre>
