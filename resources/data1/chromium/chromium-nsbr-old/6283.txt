<title>Issue 6283 -   chromium -    External trybot submitters don't get results by e-mail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Thanks to your work I can submit jobs for the trybot  but despite passing  -e 'my-email' option I don't get any e-mails. You said there are some  exceptions on the server side.    Of course the try jobs themselves run fine and I can see the results on the  waterfall.    If it helps  I can post you entire command I use for submitting (just  please check if it should be public in case I should post it). </pre>
