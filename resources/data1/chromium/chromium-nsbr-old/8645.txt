<title>Issue 8645 -   chromium -    After DWM switch  all Chrome taskbar buttons gone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you toggle DWM on your computer  all the Chrome taskbar buttons   disappear until you reactivate each window manually.    This is because of NonClientView::SystemThemeChanged  which hides the   window while the frame is updated. During this time it seems the Windows   taskbar rebuilds itself and since our windows are hidden we're not added.   Not sure of the best way to fix this. </pre>
