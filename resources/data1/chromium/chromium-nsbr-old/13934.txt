<title>Issue 13934 -   chromium -    Chromium will send a client certificate before the server certificate is verified on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug report documents a problem that Chromium will have on Windows (when   Chromium supports SSL client authentication) because of a limitation of the   Schannel API.    Under the Schannel  the server certificate is not available until the SSL   handshake is finished.  So Chromium verifies server certificates after SSL   handshakes are finished.    But if a server requests SSL client authentication  we must pass a client   certificate to the Schannel in the middle of a handshake.  So Chromium will   send a client certificate before the server certificate is verified.    Since IE uses the Schannel  IE has the same problem. </pre>
