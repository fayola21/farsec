<title>Issue 18188 -   chromium -    scrollbar keeps scrolling when mouse moves far away and brings up context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a page with a vertical scrollbar (I have not tested horizontal)  2. Click the scrollbar and drag it... do not release the left mouse button  3. Move the mouse far enough from the scrollbar so that it resets its   position (still holding the left mouse button)  4. Right click to bring up the context menu (without letting go of the left   mouse button)  5. Release the left mouse button  6. Dismiss the menu by clicking somewhere on the page (not on the   scrollbar)  7. Now move the mouse back to the scrollbar  and it will begin scrolling   whenever you move the mouse  even though no buttons are pressed. Clicking   the scrollbar fixes it.        Whenever the mouse button is released  the scrollbar should deactivate and   stop following the mouse.        The scrollbar acts as though you are still holding the mouse button down.    <b>Please provide
