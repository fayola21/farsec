<title>Issue 6038 -   chromium -    Bounds computed incorrectly for dragged tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While dragging a tab within the tabstrip  its bounds are computed as being   in whatever &quot;slot&quot; of the tabstrip we think it corresponds to.  This can   cause problems when we HitTest() while dragging  e.g. to determine if we   should close the tab on a middle click; we use the &quot;tab slot bounds&quot;   instead of the bounds corresponding to the visible tab graphic  leading to   slight weirdness.    It would be nice (IMO) if we could also do something about the gap between   the tabs and the New Tab button in the case when the dragged tab is   considered to be at the end of the strip  since this has always looked   weird to me. </pre>
