<title>Issue 6223 -   chromium -    Drag and drop a new tab from RTL Chrome: the docked window usually showing out of current screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [I might not describing the issue very clearly here :).]  But  I'm for sure  we have a bug here :)      1. Launch Chrome for any RTL (Eg: Hebrew is fine)  2. Open two tabs and drag and drop a tab to a new window.      The co-ordinates of the dropped window are taken from Left to Right instead  of Right to Left. I think this is because the mouse pointer on 'Drag and  hold' window is not on tabstrip (see the 1st screenshot).     With this behavior (mouse pointer not on tabstrip on the 'drag and hold'  window) If I drop window (release mouse button)  then window goes off  screen the to the monitor ( see the 2nd screenshot)     </pre>
