<title>Issue 5102 -   chromium -    Allow spellchecking  two languages simultaneously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please add bilingual support for dictionaries (like the Sony Ericsson UIQ   v3 phone do).  That is  to have spell checking for two dictionaries simultaneously  without the need to switch.  In most countries we have to type both in our native language and in   English simultaneously (my example precisely  I'm Portuguese)  and I can't   have both Portuguese spell check and English while typing.  The idea is not have to switch dictionaries  Google would accept two   dictionaries and spell check using both.     </pre>
