<title>Issue 11015 -   chromium -    2 main issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When i am browsing on the internet and i open a NEW TAB  it gets  crashed. The message always displayed is Aw! Snap. It happens most of the  times. Out of 10 New Tabs  5 of them report an error like this and then  they don't open.  2. When i have multiple tabs open and i need to close one of them  i click  on them to CLOSE but they don't. The tab keeps on working on something as i  am able to see the circle moving on the tab when it is loading a page and  that activity keeps on going and i am unable to close that tab for hours  and then i need to open another browser for surfing.        1. The new tab must not crash at all at the beginning and in the end too.  2. The tab that processing whatsoever must close down when the user asks it  to. Some might think that it is due to some malware or spyware that is not  letting the tab to close down.
