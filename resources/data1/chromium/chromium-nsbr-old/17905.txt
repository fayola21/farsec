<title>Issue 17905 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes on second similar download after setting 'Always Open Type' for any file type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J3050)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chromium:    Chromium version: 3.0.196 SVN Revision: 21633    &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Download any file using Chrome.  2. Set that file type as 'Always Open Type' from download shelf.  3. Download the similar type of other file.    Expected result:  3.1 Chrome downloads the file and opens it.    Actual result:  3.2 Chrome crashes.    Note:  - Once we set any file type as 'Always Open Type'  other file type works   fine. Chrome crashes only for file type which we set it first. (I tested with   zip  gz  dmg)  - I tested this using Chromium so we don't have a log for this crash. </pre>
