<title>Issue 13598 -   chromium -    download shelf doesn't show for new tab downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	3.0.183.1 (Official Build 17570)  WebKit	531.0  V8	1.2.6.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.183.1 Safari/531.0        1. middle click on a pdf link  (or right click and open in tab)      Do something useful  like download the pdf.      I get a new tab with about:blank loaded  titled &quot;Untitled&quot;.  The tab has a   blue down arrow next to the X  but nothing else.  I can't get to the pdf   file  or figure out what url got me here.    If I single click  or right click and open in a new window  it downloads   the file and a tab appears at the bottom of the page where I can open it.    Then I checked the &quot;Always open files of this type&quot; option  and now when I   middle click  the pdf downloads and then opens.  But the opened tab still   shows about:blank instead of the url. </pre>
