<title>Issue 22159 -   chromium -    Mac chromium freezes soon after startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0    OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Start Chrome  2. Wait a few minutes (possibly 0 minutes)        Life goes on as usual.        Chrome freezes. Anguish  despair. It looks fine but it doesn't respond to  clicks. It allows new tabs to be created  but any URLs typed in are ignored  as are all attempts to navigate anywhere. While this goes on  a whole CPU  is hogged by a chrome process.   </pre>
