<title>Issue 21281 -   chromium -    When you reload a development extension  you get a new ID - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load an extension via --load-extension or the &quot;load extension&quot; button in   chrome://extensions/  2. Press reload in chrome://extensions/ for that extension.  3. Notice that the extension gets a new ID (...aa  ...ab  .etc).        This messes up extensions that use persistent storage since they end up in   a new origin each time they are reloaded.    --load-extensions should somehow get a consistent origin. Maybe we should   hash the name or something? Or give them an origin like local-  path_to_extension?   </pre>
