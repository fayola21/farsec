<title>Issue 6273 -   chromium -    More privacy by using incognito window as default browser. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to set chromium incognito window as the default browser.    For example when I create a second or a third Facebook account I have to confirm   the new account by clicking on a link in an email. I use outlook and when I click   on the link  the Facebook-server can read the confirmation link and the cookies on   my computer and from now on the server associates the two accounts. I don't want   that.    Also Google is greedy regarding user behavior and there are some more reasons to   prefer staying not assigned by following links.    Therfore I would like to use incognito window as default or as least as option   while clicking any link or external bookmark on my computer.    In between chromium exists the key combination CTRL + SHIFT + N to open a new   incognito window. But there exists no possibility to open a link directly in an   incognito window without using the context menu.  For example holding CTRL + SHIFT while clicking the link would be an option. </pre>
