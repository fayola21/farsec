<title>Issue 9680 -   chromium -    html elements do not return correct height or offsetheight values - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Tested using &lt;div&gt; elements - create a div  use css formatting but do not give height values  add text   between tags.  2. Use javascript (jQuery) to retrieve height value [$('#DivID').css('height')].      1. Value returned should be calculated real height of &lt;div&gt; not counting margins  padding  and borders    shown in pixels.   2. offsetHeight should (I think) return the value including the borders  margins  and padding (this is   surmised behavior).      1. Height value returned is not the actual value. Typically it is much less than what is expected when   dealing with a single line of text. This value can also be much larger than expected if the &lt;div&gt; contains   children &lt;div&gt; elements.  2. Value is not set even when given in an external css file  although visually appears to take and use the   css value.  3. Value is updated when changed directly via javascript (jQuery)  and then returns correct value   thereafter.  4. Height and offsetHeight always seem to return the same values  as if copied from one to the other.      <b>Please provide
