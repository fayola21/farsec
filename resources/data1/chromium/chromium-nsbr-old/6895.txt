<title>Issue 6895 -   chromium -    New Tab URL is suboptimal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1216544&gt;    User should not be able to bookmark the New Tab.    Comments From Peter:  ####################  That is by design.    I think the real problem here is that the &quot;chrome-internal:&quot; URL isn't very  good from a user perspective.  You can see this URL by hovering or editing  the New Tab bookmark but it's not intuitive.  &quot;chrome-newtab:&quot; would be  better  and &quot;about:newtab&quot; or similar would (IMO) be even better.    We can whitelist whatever we want in the omnibox  but I don't want to do  that until we decide what the user-visible URL of this page should be.   </pre>
