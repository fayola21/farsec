<title>Issue 6010 -   chromium -    Tool for collecting minidump during a chrome hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a few hang reports in the issue tracker and I'm worried not much   progress will be made on fixing them because they're hard to repro.  In   fact  when chrome hangs on my machine  I don't really know what to do   either.    It would be nice if we had an external binary that would generate a   minidump of a hung chrome so we can collect information on hung chrome   processes. </pre>
