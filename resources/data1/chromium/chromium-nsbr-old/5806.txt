<title>Issue 5806 -   chromium -    Empty item in Omnibox dropdown when + is added to URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On build 1.0.154.36:    1. Type in a company name  such as homedepot or deltadental into the   Omnibox and notice (for the latter) it suggests deltadental.com/ as the   third item in the list.  2. Arrow down twice to select that option.  3. Accidentally press + instead of Enter (I meant to navigate but hit +   which is next to Enter on my Icelandic keyboard layout).    What happened was that a plus was added to the URL (as expected) but the   third item in the Omnibox became blank (not expected). I can repro this   every single time on two separate computers but not with all URLs though. </pre>
