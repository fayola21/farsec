<title>Issue 3787 -   chromium -    Double click on tab strip = double click on title bar with single tab (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0.3.154.8 (Official Build 3988)    1. Launch only one instance of Chrome browser window and have only one tab  opened.  2. Double click on tab strip.      What is the expected output?   Double clicks should be ignored as in case of having two tabs.    What do you see instead?  Browser window maximizes and un-maximizes for double clicks.       </pre>
