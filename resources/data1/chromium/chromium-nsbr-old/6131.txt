<title>Issue 6131 -   chromium -    Make the layout tests less dependent on system UI settings (mock uxtheme  etc) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make the layout tests less dependent on system UI settings (mock uxtheme    etc)    Currently  if you want to run layout tests  you have to be on XP using the   default Luna theme.  This causes problems for developers on Vista for   example.  We should be able to mock all of the system APIs when in layout   test mode to provide fixed rendering for form controls while in layout test   mode. </pre>
