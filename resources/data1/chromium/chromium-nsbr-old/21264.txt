<title>Issue 21264 -   chromium -    SSL Error for good certificates in chrome-linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I don't know. I started using a long-running chrome instance after coming   back to work from the labor day weekend  and saw SSL errors when connecting   to HTTPS-enabled pages on google.com and amazon.com. The chrome instance   had been running since at least friday and worked fine then; on tuesday   when I came back  it was showing me these errors. (Perhaps some in-memory   cache of certificates had become stale?) A restart fixed the issue.        No SSL Errors for pages with a good certificate.        Red SSL Error page with this text:    &quot;The site's security certificate is not trusted!    You attempted to reach www.google.com  but the server presented a  certificate issued by an entity that is not trusted by your computer's  operating system. This may mean that the server has generated its own  security credentials  which Google Chrome cannot rely on for identity  information  or an attacker may be trying to intercept your  communications. You should not proceed  especially if you have never  seen this warning before for this site.&quot;    <b>Please provide
