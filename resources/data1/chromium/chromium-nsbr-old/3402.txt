<title>Issue 3402 -   chromium -    Minimalist adress bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Being able to resize the address bar would be a good feature. I    personally  don't really care about all that stuff - and browsing in   1600x1200 the bar is almost 1400 pixels wide. A huge waste of space. Your   typical address or search isn't even 1/4 of that. The bookmarks toolbar could then be positioned next to the address bar  instead of under it or   hidden. Would also like to have the option to not display &quot;http://www. for   even less &quot;waste of space&quot;. Visual example attached.  </pre>
