When I launch Chrome it starts to scan my machine as if Google Desktop   is installed. Don't like this  will not use chrome unless this is removed.   Really like browser  better than IE &amp; FireFox because its faster and the   layout is simple and maximizes space page can use  would be a pitty not to   use it because of the above mentioned.
