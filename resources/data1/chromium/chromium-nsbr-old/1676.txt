<title>Issue 1676 -   chromium -    Cannot import from minefield (locale  or nightly build  or non-default profile location  or what  issue?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I 'm using the latest minefield nightlies (3.1b1pre)  with an installer  build (not a zip build)  and chrome does not provide an option to import  any data from my profile.     (Of course  neither did it for my opera  safari for windows  or k-meleon   so that's another issue).    Then I read somewhere that maybe its a mix up with locales... So  I tried  the locale switch with the quick locale switcher extension in minefield; no  luck...     My OS locale is Greek  my Windows interface and Firefox interface is English.     Without changing anything in Fx  chrome starts an installer in Greek   ending up with a setup with an English-UI  and nowhere my fx profile to be  traced...    I uninstall chrome  I delete its folder in local settings/app data/google   switch the fx locale to Greek with the extension proposed  restart fx   download chrome again  with exactly the same result. No Firefox in the  'import from' options...    i don't get it why locale should interfere with the setup (which I doubt)...    Then  someone said &quot;is your profile and/or Firefox in a non-default  location?&quot; Yes my profile is in a non-default location.    Again  why should this be a problem  when profile.ini contains all that is  needed to locate it?    I even cleared the fx cookies from google chrome  between testing  no luck  ever. </pre>
