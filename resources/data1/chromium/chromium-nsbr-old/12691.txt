<title>Issue 12691 -   chromium -    WindowDelegate Windows have larger OK buttons than Cancel in classic rendering mode  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was originally filed as &lt;b/1089629&gt;    Switch to Classic rendering mode and notice that the default OK buttons in   dialogs such as Import Settings/Clear Browsing Data/etc are a little bigger   vertically than the Cancel button.    Default buttons look bigger because of a single pixel black border around   them. It seems we are not adjusting the y position of the default button to   account for this border  making the button look misaligned.    For a screenshot  see <a title="Alignment issues with Clear Browsing Data dialog." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11487"> issue 11487 </a>. </pre>
