<title>Issue 9593 -   chromium -    ProcessSingleton race condition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Open chrome browsers rapidly  it is most reproducible if chrome has just      been upgraded.        Expected: the second browser process finds the first and forwards the   command line which cause a new tab to open on the first browser. Second   browser exits.    Seen: the second browser does not detect the first and tries to open the   profile db. It fails because it is locked by the first browser process. A   disembodied error dialog (from chrome  not a crash) appears that has   incomplete information.    It is a race condition  but Anantha has a test that can make it happen 10   to 20% of the time.    Cause:    The ProcessSingleton does a look + acquire not close in time  if there is   an upgrade there can be seconds between the two operations.    I have no clue why even the look (during ctor) and the acquire (called   Create()) are distinct methods  I think this should be done automatically   at construction.         </pre>
