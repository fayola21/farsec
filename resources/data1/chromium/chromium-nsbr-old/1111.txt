<title>Issue 1111 -   chromium -    Wrap tabs in Tabs bar to multiple lines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27      Tabs are wraping to multiple lines.   Opera has that feature and it's kinda useful if you like to open more than   ~10 tabs at a time. </pre>
