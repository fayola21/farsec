<title>Issue 3032 -   chromium -    Dangerous downloads should be saved in jail folder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today when downloading a dangerous file (.exe for example)  we save the   file in the download directory with a temporary name   (dangerous_download_xxx.download).    We should save the file in a jail folder (ex: .jail) under the download   directory  so not to confuse users that look in their download folder with   temporary files.   </pre>
