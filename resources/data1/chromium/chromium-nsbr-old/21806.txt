<title>Issue 21806 -   chromium -    webkit renders web site too wide  producing a long horizontal scrollbar (about 4x wider than the page should be) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: '3.0.195.21'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://olliegolightly.com">http://olliegolightly.com</a>           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. visit site      &gt;page loads with no scrollbars  unless window is small enough to warrant   them      &gt;huge  big  long horizontal scroll bar present    The site renders well enough  being centred on the page  just as it should.   There just happens to be a ton of whitespace to the right of the content.   The use of the site is not compromised; but why does it do that? A CSS   quirk?    Thanks!   </pre>
