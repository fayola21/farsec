<title>Issue 22044 -   chromium -    Convert Linux buildbots to Make build. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Scons startup can be expensive  especially on the full builders. Switching   the buildbots to the gyp Makefile generator could improve base cycle time by   3-4 minutes (e.g. Chromium Linux Builder (dbg) takes almost 4 minutes to do   a &quot;noop&quot; build  just relinking new version info). </pre>
