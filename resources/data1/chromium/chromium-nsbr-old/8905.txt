<title>Issue 8905 -   chromium -    Channel changing is broken after the beta appears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had the dev channel and I downloaded the Beta of Chrome and after the   installing i got Google Chrome 1.0.154.48. After another download i finally   got 2.0.169.1.    I saw that there is Google Chrome 2.0.170.0 and opened the channel chooser   and clicked on dev. The about dialog told me i have the latest version. So   in uninstalled Chrome and installed the stable version  opened the channel   chooser and saw dev is already selected. About Chrome tells me still   1.0.154.48 is the latest version. I switch to beta  no update. Back to dev:   no update too. </pre>
