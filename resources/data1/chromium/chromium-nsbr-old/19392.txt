<title>Issue 19392 -   chromium -    Default install experience should have different settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the default installation experience has Chrome with no default   home page (unless one is imported)  the home page is the new tab page  and no   home button appears.    Based on user feedback  we'd like to change the default install experience to   this:    - home page is set to www.google.com  - home page is NOT new tab page  - home button appears ON by default    This should be done natively  not through installerdata parameters. </pre>
