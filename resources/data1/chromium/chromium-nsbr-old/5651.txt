<title>Issue 5651 -   chromium -    Reduce string conversions during fixup and autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Juan Francisco Sacco from Core Security Technologies has found a buffer  overflow when URLs are pasted on the URL text box. Also an scenario when a  buffer overflow is triggered through a long URL stored in the navigation  history was found  although we are trying to reproduce the last one in a  more deterministic fashion.    After further investigations we will probably publish an advisory  explaining this issues but we wanted to report them first.    We would like to continue this communications through email  (advisories-publication@coresecurity.com).    Jos��_��_ Orlicki  Researcher  Core Security Technologies </pre>
