<title>Issue 21195 -   chromium -    iGoogle shows old page on relaunch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version 4.0.202.0    steps to reproduce:    1. set a customized iGoogle as the start page  2. use all day  3. at end of day quit chrome and shut down computer  4. next day start computer  log in  start chrome  5. iGoogle is showing whatever it was showing at the end of last day    There are some gadgets that show fresh data such as Finance and NYTimes.   All of my RSS feeds such as Top Stories  Slashdot  etc. show whatever they   were showing the previous day at shutdown. If I do the same thing in   Firefox I get a fresh iGoogle when I first launch on the new day. There is   some caching difference between the two. I don't know if this is Chrome's   fault or if iGoogle is serving different cache information to the two   browsers.               </pre>
