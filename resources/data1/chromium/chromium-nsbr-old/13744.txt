<title>Issue 13744 -   chromium -    Functionality for opening tab in new window is overly eager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. Click non-active tab to activate          Tab becomes active      Tab is moved into new window  instead of being the active tab inside the   already open chrome window.    This started to happen after the recent upgrade. I know more people are   having this problem. It seems that the functionality for opening a tab in a   new window (clicking and dragging tab) is triggered when simply activating   the tab.   </pre>
