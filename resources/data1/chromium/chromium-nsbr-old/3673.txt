<title>Issue 3673 -   chromium -    Download bar doesn't go away - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3  URLs (if applicable) : Any           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3:OK           IE 7:OK      1. Download something  2. Close the tab that did the download without closing the Downloads bar.  3. The Downloads bar is still there  but can't be closed (clicking on it   does nothing).  4. Optionally minimize and maximize Chrome  the Downloads bar becomes   totally white.  5. Creating a new tab fixes that.        The Downloads bar to go away with the closed tab.        The Downloads bar stays  but it isn't functional anymore.    -------------    The first screenshot shows that the Downloads bar is a ghost (the scrollbar   is below it...)  The second screenshot shows how the &quot;Ghost Downloads bar&quot; was replaced by a   white bar. See how the scrollbar ends before the end of the window...     </pre>
