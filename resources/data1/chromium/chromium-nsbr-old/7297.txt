<title>Issue 7297 -   chromium -    Spell-checker interfering text selections + context menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0  URLs : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>             IE 7: OK       1. Enter the New Issue page for rxample  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>  2. In the big text box (it won't work in the title text box) write this   phrase without the &quot;&quot; in a new line &quot; :chrome: &quot;  3. Click the word (chrome) 3 times so the whole line is selected (or just   select it some other way...)  4. Right click the word (now selected with the rest of the line) to copy it   using the context menu      It should copy the whole line      Only the word is copied  without the 2 &quot;:&quot; and spaces because once you   right click the selected line only the word will stay selected    It only happens in text boxes where spell-checker is enabled   </pre>
