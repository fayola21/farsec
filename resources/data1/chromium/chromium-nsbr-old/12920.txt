<title>Issue 12920 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Popups don't show Chrome icon on Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm">http://www.echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm</a>  2. Click on the link for Yahoo    What is the expected output?   The top left corner of the popup should contain Chrome icon    What do you see instead?  I don't see it. I don'e see even an empty page icon. It's different.    This happens only on Vista with Chromium 3.0.183.0 (Developer Build 17187)    Works fine on Win7 RC1 and XP </pre>
