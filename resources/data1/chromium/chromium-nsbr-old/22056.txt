<title>Issue 22056 -   chromium -    Sync Setup hangs/gets into deadlock state while running sync integration test sometime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Look at the buildbot output for Sync Integration Test..Or try to run Sync   Integration test using pre-submit script on buildbot slave.  2. Test fails sometime - Mostly pointing that it fails to setupsyc or timeout   during setupsync. </pre>
