<title>Issue 14301 -   chromium -    [www.rbsdigital.com]: RBS says Chrome not a supported browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="https://www.rbsdigital.com">https://www.rbsdigital.com</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] What is wrong?      <a href="https://www.rbsdigital.com">https://www.rbsdigital.com</a>    The Royal Bank of Scotland doesn't support logins to its digital banking   site from Chrome. It does sometimes work  but frequently you get told to   use another browser. Today  when I checked  I was able to login  but   yesterday for example I wasn't. I emailed them about a month ago to   complain and they replied:    'We operate a browser policy whereby each new browser that is released is  tested to our security standards  any that meet these standards are  added to our list of supported browsers. This list is constantly  evolving as we are in contact with the browser providers to resolve any  concerns we have.    The combination you were using previously would have allowed you to  access our service  however it was not actually supported by this  helpdesk. We have updated our systems to ensure only the browsers we  support are available to our customers.    In addition to this  please note that we do not support any Beta  versions of browsers released  it is not until the full version becomes  available that we will be able to complete testing it's compatibility  with Digital Banking.    Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.    Yours sincerely    S Bradley  Royal Bank of Scotland plc'      When I check their policy today they say the following:    Browser compatibility  You can use Digital Banking service with a wide range of browsers.      Operating System	Browser  PC Users	Microsoft ��_��_ Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP or Vista	  Microsoft ��_��_ Internet Explorer version 5  6 and 7    or Netscape��_�� Navigator��_�� version 7.1 and up    or Mozilla 1.5 and up    or AOL 8.0 and up (AOL subscribers only)    or Firefox 1.0 to 3.0    or Opera 9.x    Mac Users	OS X	  Netscape��_�� Navigator��_�� version 7.1 and up    or Mozilla 1.5 and up    or Firefox 1.0  1.5 and 2.0    or Safari 1.3 to 3.0    Mac Users	OS 8.1 to 9.2	  Microsoft ��_��_ Internet Explorer version 5.1.7    or Mozilla 1.2.1      What is the expected result?  You should be able to login using Chrome. I don't know if this is something   we can fix technically  or whether we need to discuss it with their team   directly to resolve the issue. However  as it is a major bank in the UK    and not a niche site  we should ensure that their customers can access it   through Chrome.           What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="https://www.rbsdigital.com">https://www.rbsdigital.com</a>  2. Attempt to log in to digital banking (hard to reproduce though as you   need to be a customer and signing up is not easy).   3. Problem is that they only spot it's Chrome intermittently.     Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Yes  it works fine in FF.     Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
