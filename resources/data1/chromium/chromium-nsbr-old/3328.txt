<title>Issue 3328 -   chromium -    DHTML perf test should not depend on timer clamping - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Raising the setTimeout() clamp caused a huge loss in the DHTML perf test.    This is worrisome  as it means a major component of what the test is   measuring is the time spent waiting for these  which I don't think the test   was intended to do.  Now a regression of the same absolute magnitude will   cause a smaller proportional loss on the test and be hard to notice.  We   should rewrite the test to not care about setTimeout() clamping. </pre>
