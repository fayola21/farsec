<title>Issue 1674 -   chromium -    Can't focus popups -- blur() and focus() seem to have opposite behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Calling win.focus() on a popup does not have an effect.        This is particularly problematic on this site:    <a href="http://www.deutsche-bank.es/pbc/login/">http://www.deutsche-bank.es/pbc/login/</a>    After loading the page  a popup is constrained to the bottom of the window.  Now if you click the &quot;Operar&quot; link to go to the sign in page  nothing   happens.    What is happening  is &quot;Operar&quot; tries to set focus to the popuped up window:    function lanzarLogin() {    if(navigator.win &amp;&amp; !navigator.win.closed) navigator.win.focus();    else {      GoPBCt('menuPrincipal' '');    }   }        This site is fine in Firefox  because rather than hiding the popup  it   blocks it altogether. So when you click the login link  it knows to open a   new window.   </pre>
