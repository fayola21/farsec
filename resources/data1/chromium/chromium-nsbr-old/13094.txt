<title>Issue 13094 -   chromium -    Scrollbar Drawing Mismatch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Unfortunately I do not know how to get into this situation  no repro steps   but documenting it here perhaps someone else will.    Chrome Windows got into the situation where it rendered some scrollbars   natively and some with the Chrome look. Even for the same page. In this case   I was in Google mail (mail.google.com) and the same page in two different   tabs had different scrollbars  both for internal and page-leve scrollbars.    A screenshot is attached.   </pre>
