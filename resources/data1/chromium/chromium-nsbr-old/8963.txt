<title>Issue 8963 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: bookmarks UI disappears when starting a navigation from the NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: bookmarks UI disappears when starting a navigation from the NTP    Observed in:  2.0.171.0 (Developer Build 12076)      1. Open the New Tab Page  2. Enter an URL in the location bar        If the navigation is slow  then you will see the bookmarks UI (not the   bookmarks toolbar) disappear immediately.  The NTP contents will shift up    and then once the navigation results in response headers  the NTP contents   gets replaced by the contents of the newly loaded page. </pre>
