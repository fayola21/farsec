<title>Issue 3735 -   chromium -    Dragging a bookmark from the &quot;recent bookmarks&quot; page to the bookmark bar should not rebookmark it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had a bookmark I just made that I wanted in my bookmarks bar. I dragged   it from the &quot;recent bookmarks&quot; box in the new tab page to the bookmarks   bar. This worked great.    However  it then appeared twice in the recent bookmarks page since I had   effectively just &quot;re-bookmarked&quot; it. I'm not sure if such a drag should   move from the location where it currently is (but that's what I expected   when I did this) or duplicate the bookmark. In either case  it should not   appear twice in the recent bookmarks list.    This bug might go hand-in-hand with offering more bookmark management   options from the recent bookmarked box (I should be able to delete them   from the  for example). </pre>
