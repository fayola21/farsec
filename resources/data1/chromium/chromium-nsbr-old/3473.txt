<title>Issue 3473 -   chromium -    [performance] Better v8 bindings for getImageData() putImageData() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the bindings for CanvasPixelArray cause every array lookup/update   to call through to the C++.    This will not be very performant when looping through many pixels. Instead   it would be better to create something like a JS array so local accesses   are fast  and only marshall when getting/setting the pixel buffer. </pre>
