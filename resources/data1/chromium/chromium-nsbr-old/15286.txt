<title>Issue 15286 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Small font  no menu labels if app_locale == 'en' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I updated to trunk build 19219 and there were no locale resources loaded.   The default font for web pages was ~1pt and no menus had strings.    I believe this is caused by <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=19183    I discovered that the following lines in User DataLocal Settings cause the   issue:       &quot;intl&quot;: {        &quot;app_locale&quot;: &quot;en&quot;     }     [n.b. Changing &quot;en&quot; to &quot;en-US&quot; works.]    It's possible that <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19183">r19183</a> has just uncovered a latent bug. Perhaps before   we were failing with locale=en and defaulting to locale=&quot;en-US&quot;.    Now  it looks like we're just failing to find en.dll and resorting to &quot;no   locale at all&quot;.    I believe a lot of users have app_locale=en in Local Settings  so this is a   Dev release blocker. </pre>
