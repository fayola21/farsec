<title>Issue 14877 -   chromium -    RSAPrivateKey decoding ocassionally fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There have been sporadic crashes in SignatureCreator unit tests and in   RSAPrivateKey tests.    These both seem to stem from errors encoding and decoding private keys that   have integers whose most-significant bytes are zero.    When encoding  any zero most-significant bytes should be dropped  but an   extra zero most-significant byte should be added back if the most-  significant *bit* (the sign bit) would otherwise be 1. This is to force the   value to be positive.    When decoding  a single leading zero byte should be initially dropped  as   it was probably there to force the value to  be positive. But then zeroes   must be added back up to the expected size of the field  which can be   derived from the modulus size. The modulus should not have the problem of   leading zero bytes  as it is specifically chosen such that its high byte is   &gt; 0. </pre>
