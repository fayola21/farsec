<title>Issue 119 -   chromium -    Install Fails - &quot;forbidden by system policy&quot; - on W2K8 with low-rights user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a non-administrator user on Windows 2008 x64 Standard  2. Attempt to install Chrome from inside IE7 or using ChromeSetup.exe  3. After the &quot;download&quot; completes  error 1625 &quot;This installation is   forbidden by system policy&quot; is thrown.        Since Chrome is installing into AppDataLocal  it should not need local   administrative access to complete the install.  If Administrative access   is necessary  then the OS's CredUI should be triggered by a signed binary   manifest.         An error pops during install.  This makes it impossible to use Chrome as a   low rights user  since installing as Administrator installs into   UserAdministratorAppDataLocal and Chrome is not available to other   users on the system.  An alternative fix would be an install mode that   allows the user to choose the more traditional Program Files location for   the binaries.     </pre>
