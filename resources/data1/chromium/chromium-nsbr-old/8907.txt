<title>Issue 8907 -   chromium -    cannot refresh a single picture in a webpage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.When I have a low speed network connection  especially when opening a web   page will cause more than half a minute  2.Sometimes  several pictures in the web page cannot be displayed when the   web page finishes being downloaded. Thus  in the Chromium browser  you see   an icon in place of the undownloaded picture.  3.You cannot make this unshown picture re-download itself again in order to   show it without refresh the whole webpage. Whereas  in IE 6 and 7  there's   an option for you. Just right click the unshown picture  and there comes   the menu &quot;Display Picture&quot;  which will cause re-downloading of the single   picture.         Add an option when I right click the download-failed picture  which will   enable the browser to re-download the very picture without refreshing the   whole page.      Single picture refreshing.     <b>Please provide
