<title>Issue 19364 -   chromium -    Cannot select scroll via drag select in maximized window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198.1  OS + version : Goobuntu 8.04 2009070700  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : Gnome 2.22.3  URLs (if applicable) : E.g. <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a> with a long email  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Clicking on text then dragging   down makes the window scroll while the selection area grows.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Scrolling does not occur.      1. Second monitor with Maximized Chrome window.  2. Visit a page like Gmail that has a long text area.  3. Try to click and select more than one screen's worth of text.      I expect to be able to select text by having the window scroll.      Scrolling does not occur.   </pre>
