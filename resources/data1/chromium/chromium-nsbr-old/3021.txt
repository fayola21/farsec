<title>Issue 3021 -   chromium -    Can have many context menus up at same time  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  WebKit: 525.19    Preconditions: Have a slow-loading site  preferably on a slow computer.        1. Open the slow-loading site (I used <a href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a>)  2. Before it finishes loading  right-click many times at various points  within the empty spaces of the client area.  (This won't happen if you  right-click after the page has finished loading.)      What is the expected output?     Should see only 1 context menu at a time.      What do you see instead?    It is possible to have multiple context menus up at once.      This doesn't happen in IE or FF.    See attached picture.   </pre>
