<title>Issue 17706 -   chromium -    incredibuild doesn't rebuild properly after changes to grd files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (moving from an email discussion on chromium-dev to a bug)    To repro:  - Insert a new string into a grd file  - Build chrome with incredibuild  - Launch chrome and an assert triggers (actual assert varies depending on   how the resources got displaced).      I suggested having a gclient sync that deletes the header file that the grd   file outputs because that will force incredibuild to rebuild C++ files that   include the generated header.    My next comment will include some data showing that this isn't a problem   with regular builds. </pre>
