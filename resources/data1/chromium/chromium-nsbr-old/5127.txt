<title>Issue 5127 -   chromium -    Open Browser window of application shortcuts should get keyboard focus to Omnibox. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium: 0.5.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6362">r6362</a>)      1. Create a application shortcut using Chromium.  2. Make sure  Keyboard focus is not set to Omnibox of the current  tab  --THIS IS IMPORTANT.  3. Click on the dropdown button (top-left) of application shortcut and  select &quot;Open browser window&quot;    What is the expected output?   The new tab should be opened and keyboard focus should be set to Omnibox.    What do you see instead?  The new tab is opened but keyboard focus is not set to Omnibox.    Observation:  ############  Works fine in Release build 0.4.154.31 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>) even if step 2 is not met. </pre>
