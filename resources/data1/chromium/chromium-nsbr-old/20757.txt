<title>Issue 20757 -   chromium -    Downloads bar not completely themed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.2      1. Download something in the Baseball theme        You can read the status text in the download shelf (e.g. time remaining   until file opens).        The text is blue  which makes it very difficult to read with the brown   background. The text should be white. A similar problem was just fixed on   the NNTP for the Baseball theme.   </pre>
