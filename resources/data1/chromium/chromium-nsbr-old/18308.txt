<title>Issue 18308 -   chromium -    When clicking on the bottom pixel of the tabstrip  window vertical resize control appears. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Move mouse pointer to bottom pixel of tab strip  2. Click down.        Nothing should happen. Instead  I see a &quot;vertical resize&quot; cursor and can   drag resize the window from this point. I'm using Ubuntu Jaunty  default WM    &quot;Normal&quot; effects setting. </pre>
