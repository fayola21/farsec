<title>Issue 23154 -   chromium -    Option+Click behavior different than that of Firefox/Safari - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.219.3 (27320)    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Saves to download folder  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Saves to download folder  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Option + Click on a Link      The target is saved to the default Download folder &quot;~/Downloads/&quot;      &quot;Save As...&quot; dialog appears asking you where the file should be saved. This   is different than the behavior of Firefox and Safari.    I don't know if this qualifies as a defect or not  but it's worth noting that I   much prefer Firefox/Safari's behavior in this matter. </pre>
