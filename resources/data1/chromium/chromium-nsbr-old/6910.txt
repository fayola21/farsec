<title>Issue 6910 -   chromium -    Need crash handling tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [copied from internal bug list]    This is a test I added but it fails on vista.    This test is supposed to verify that we can get dumps from browser crashes.    The test works fine but sometimes a renderer has time to start before the   browser crash and DCHECK because the pipe is not created. This make the   test fail.    I'll disable it for now and find a better place to crash the browser   process. </pre>
