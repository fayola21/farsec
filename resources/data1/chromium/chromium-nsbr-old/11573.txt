<title>Issue 11573 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: depot_tools should always include a copy of python (and probably svn) on windows since the version of python on the system may be insufficient - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: depot_tools should always include a copy of python (and   probably svn) on windows since the version of python on the system may be   insufficient    some of our tools like break if python or svn from cygwin are used.  they   just aren't compatible  and the number of variants of python installations   on windows is just too much to try to deal with.    getting the right version of python installed has to be one of the main   reasons why people have trouble building mozilla on windows.  we should not   repeat those mistakes.  now it looks like chrome is having the same kind of   problems.  not good.    depot_tools should default to containing all of the required tools.  if   someone wants to use the version of python or svn from their system   instead  perhaps they can opt into that mode instead of making that be the   default. </pre>
