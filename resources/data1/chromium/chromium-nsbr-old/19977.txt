<title>Issue 19977 -   chromium -    Debugging symbols for FFmpeg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently use mingw and gcc to build ffmpeg library. We then link them   with visual c. Since the debugging symbols of gcc is not compatible with   visual c  we cannot obtain any strack trace when it crashes.    We need to come up with a solution to enable capturing the stack trace. </pre>
