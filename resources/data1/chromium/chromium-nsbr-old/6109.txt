<title>Issue 6109 -   chromium -    Windows decor is not mirrored on non-RTL Vista for RTL Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1128173&gt;    From Idan:  When running &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot; on Windows Vista  the entire Chrome UI   is properly mirrored but the windows decorations ('close' button    'minimize' button  etc.) still use left-to-right layout.    The reason for this problem is rooted in the fact that XPFrame has its own   implementation of the windows decoration while VistaFrame delegates the   windows decoration handling to the OS windowing subsystem. The Chrome   mirroring infrastructure does not rely on the inherent Windows support for   RTL UI layout and therefore the top level HWNDs for XPFrame and VistaFrame   are not created with the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL flag. Thus  on Vista Windows does   not render the Chrome window using a right-to-left layout.    I haven't looked into this problem in great detail but I am guessing that   what we can do is create our top level HWNDs with WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL but then   flip everything back to LTR when rendering into an HDC  when reporting   mouse coordinates  etc. This is not the cleanest solution  but if we want   to keep the mirroring infrastructure platform independent  then this might   be the only way to go about this.    Attaching two images that show the problem. Note that when the window is   maximized  the decors (close  minimize  etc.) are obscured by the rightmost   tab (which is also the first tab on RTL). The other image shows the   restored browser window. Note how the Windows decors appear on the right   and not on the left like they should on RTL locales.    The same problem happen with other browser windows on Vista such as the   prefs dialog  the import dialog  etc.   </pre>
