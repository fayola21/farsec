<title>Issue 15228 -   chromium -    Alt+Shift+T: Esc flashes find-in bar continuously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on All channels + ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=19118">r19118</a>).    This could be corner case of <a title="Esc flashes find-in bar continuously" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12729"> issue 12729 </a>  which has been fixed. Filing this   as a new issue  instead of recycling the old issue.    -Alt+Shift+T on browser window  -Use arrow keys to go to Page menu and select Find-in bar from the menu.  -Esc to dismiss the find-in bar.    Hitting Esc key again and again  flashes find-in bar.    PS:  ToT  repros with single browser window opened. With channels  2 browser   windows need to be opened.   </pre>
