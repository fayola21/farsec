<title>Issue 11252 -   chromium -    Extensions share process between incognito and regular profiles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ExtensionsService handles creation of new extension instances.  Since it is   shared between the Profile and the OTRProfile  it lumps extension instances   into the same bucket.    One solution would be to stop sharing the ExtensionsService  and make a copy   for OTR instead. </pre>
