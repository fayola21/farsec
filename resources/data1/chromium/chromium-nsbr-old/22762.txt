<title>Issue 22762 -   chromium -    website drop down pick lists do not collapse after selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.7                    1. Go to a website with drop down selection boxes.  2. After making a selection  the drop down box does not collapse.        The drop down box should collapse after making a selection.      Although the data changes according to what was selected  the drop down list does not collapse    which is an undesirable effect.    I have noticed this issue only on the recent builds of Chrome. It does seem to be inconsistent at   times. I've recently noticed it on any drop down lists in Google Calender  however.    </pre>
