<title>Issue 2218 -   chromium -    magic_browzR breaks window resizing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2166">r2166</a>    Starting with --magic_browzR on Vista SP1 with Aero Glass produces a window   that has borders that are too thick  and borders that are not resizable.    If I put the mouse cursor over the border  it doesn't change to a resize   cursor  and dragging simply moves the entire window (as if I were dragging   the title bar).    The NC hit testing never returns any of the resize border results; it's   returning HTCAPTION for the entire window frame.     </pre>
