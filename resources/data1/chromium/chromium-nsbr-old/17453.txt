<title>Issue 17453 -   chromium -    &quot;valgrind didn't finish writing %d files?!&quot; warning from tools/valgrind/chrome_tests.sh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often one will see the warning      valgrind didn't finish writing %d files?!  in the valgrind buildbot logs.  This happens  whenever there are incomplete XML logs   i.e. logs that don't end in &lt;/valgrindoutput&gt;.    There can be several causes.  Valgrind sometimes  takes time to finish writing (so the script now waits)   valgrind's behavior on fork() leaves something  to be desired (we're still working on getting that right)   and valgrind might sometimes crash while outputting a   leak summary (not sure about that one).    It's probably benign  though it's possible some of  the causes lead to true incomplete files  in which  case we might be missing some warnings.   </pre>
