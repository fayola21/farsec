<title>Issue 20256 -   chromium -    Scrollbar doesn't repaint when closing find box on Google Docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create or visit some Google Doc with a bunch of content.  Hit F3 (to bypass   the Docs find bar that captures ctrl-f)  type &quot;a&quot;  then close the Find bar.    Note the yellow marks in the scrollbar don't disappear.  Scrub the scroll   thumb over them and watch them go away. </pre>
