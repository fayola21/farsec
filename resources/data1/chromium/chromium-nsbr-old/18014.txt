<title>Issue 18014 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: LayoutTests/editing/style/remove-underline-from-stylesheet.html fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test started failing in the WebKit merge from 46369 to 46426.    It looks like when the test calls underlineCommand() it's supposed to toggle   underlining off  but it doesn't.    The likely culprit seems to be <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/46373">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/46373</a> . </pre>
