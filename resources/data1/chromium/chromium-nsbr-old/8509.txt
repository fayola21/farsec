<title>Issue 8509 -   chromium -    High CPU programs cause &quot;Plugin is unresponsive&quot; msgbox's that steal window focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GMail Offline should always be a Normal Priority page. When CPU intensive   apps  like games  are launched they choke Google Gears out of CPU time. The   result is the &quot;unresponsive plugin&quot; message box     Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0 on WinXP Pro  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3        Firefox 3: OK      1. Open GMail and go into Flacky Connection Mode  2. Fire up your favourite CPU Hogging program  possibly a videogame in   fullscreen mode running in a different resolution  3. Wait  4. Screen flickers  you are returned to Windows desktop and a message box   appears: &quot;The following program has become unstable: Google Gears&quot;  5. Fire up Task Manager  6. Set priority for all instances of Chrome to Normal  7. The message box is gone and GMail Offline refreshes  8. Finally return to what you were doing  after some extra screen   flickering.      No disruption should happen. Ideally  GMail Offline would automatically set   the process priority to Normal.      The user has to stop whatever it was doing and either let Chrome kill the   plugin  or let Chrome try again (which will trigger the messagebox again)    or go to Task Manager and set the proper priority setting for the process. </pre>
