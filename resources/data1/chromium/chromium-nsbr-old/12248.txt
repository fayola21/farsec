<title>Issue 12248 -   chromium -    add -fno-rtti to linux build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It doesn't look like we have this flag  it would be nice to have.    Dean claims that our code is clean.  I tried to add it to common.gypi  but   get a lot of third_party C code that produces warnings:  cc1: warning: command line option &quot;-fno-rtti&quot; is valid for C++/ObjC++ but   not for C    Maybe set it in common.gypi and remove the flag in third_party .gyp files? </pre>
