<title>Issue 8554 -   chromium -    Focus on opening (or new tab) does not go in the address bar... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.168.0                  1. Open Chrome (or create a new tab)  2. The focus does not go in the address bar      Well  that I can start typing and I guess the results from my previously   visited sites.      I have to go there manually.    I looked at the existing bugs  and didn't find anything. Sorry if this is a   duplicate.    Thanks   Christian </pre>
