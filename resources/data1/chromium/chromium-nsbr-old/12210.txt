<title>Issue 12210 -   chromium -    ui-tests --single-process is failing due to crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The change to makeOpenIncognito synchronous seems to have broken the ui-tests   --single-process. It's crashing.    The result can be seen from experimental waterfall.    Should try fix the issue without disabling the test for single process. </pre>
