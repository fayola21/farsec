<title>Issue 6912 -   chromium -    Dragging images from a web page to the desktop does not generate a proper file name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load a web page that has an image (say  &quot;foo.png&quot;) with no ALT text  2. Drag the image to the desktop  3. Notice that the file saved to the desktop is &quot;.png&quot;    If the image has ALT text in the HTML  the file will be named properly   using the ALT text and the image type as the file extension. If there is no   ALT text  the file will consist only of the file extension and no name.     </pre>
