The same button also could exist in normal mode    if one wants to review the features of the current build.&quot;    also please see comment 6 <a title="Need better documentation/notification about new versions" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2530"> issue 2530 </a> which is positive. </pre>
