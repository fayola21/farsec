<title>Issue 12094 -   chromium -    HTML &lt;COL&gt; element not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.23  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_col.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_col.asp</a>         Safari 4: Fail    Firefox 3.x: Fail o.O           IE 8: OK      1. Go to provided URL and press &quot;Try it Yourself&quot; button      In the example provided  third column is defined as &lt;COL align=right&gt;; so   we'd expect that column to be right-aligned      The column is left-aligned: tag &lt;COL&gt; was ignored      Providing a style for &lt;COL&gt; element  such as &lt;COL style=&quot;color:steelblue&quot;&gt;   doesn't work either...  Dost my eyes deceive me and IE actually beat all other browsers to   something?   </pre>
