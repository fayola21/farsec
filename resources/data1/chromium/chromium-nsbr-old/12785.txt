<title>Issue 12785 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Horrifically slow typing performance in Gmail's rich text editor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: Horrifically slow typing performance in Gmail's rich text   editor    Observed in 3.0.182.0 (Developer Build 16846)    Repro steps:  1. Reply inline to an email.  2. Type a number lines of text.  3. At some point  the associated renderer starts thrashing the CPU on each   keystroke    Composing replies becomes pretty impossible when in this state.    I've noticed that if I wait a while  the problem goes away until I again   type a number of characters.  It feels like there is some garbage   accumulation that gets flushed out periodically -- garbage collection issue   perhaps?  Or  is this a Gmail editor issue unrelated to V8? </pre>
