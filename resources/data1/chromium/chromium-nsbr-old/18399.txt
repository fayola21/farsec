<title>Issue 18399 -   chromium -    Tab captions can become blurred - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Can't specify explicit steps to reproduce this  but I've encountered this   problem twice today.    Sometimes when I switch to Chrome  tab captions are displayed blurred. See   the first screenshot and compare it with the second showing normal non-  blurred captions.    Captions become normal after tabs repaint (e.g. because one of them has   been closed.)    Chrome version 3.0.196.0 </pre>
