<title>Issue 21407 -   chromium -    recently closed tabs text is not localized for all plural formats  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have IDS_NEW_TAB_RECENTLY_CLOSED_WINDOW_SINGLE for 1 and   IDS_NEW_TAB_RECENTLY_CLOSED_WINDOW_MULTIPLE for &gt; 1.  This doesn't work for   all languages as the plural rules aren't always the same as in English.    See the code in chrome/common/time_format.* for how we handle different   plural formats for times.  generated_resources.grd has examples of how to   format the strings for translation (e.g.  IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SEC_SINGULAR    IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_TWO   IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_FEW    IDS_TIME_ELAPSED_SECS_MANY). </pre>
