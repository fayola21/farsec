<title>Issue 14570 -   chromium -    add a gyp target for running tools/checkdeps/checkdeps.py - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice if there were a gyp target for running checkdeps.py.    Alternately  maybe a presubmit check?  It's kind of slow if your disk cache   is cold  so I'm reluctant to say it should be a presubmit or build   dependency.    On a side note  checkdeps only works if you're using an svn checkout  not if   you're using git. </pre>
