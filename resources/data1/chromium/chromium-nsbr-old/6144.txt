<title>Issue 6144 -   chromium -    CommandLine reference params in browser_main should be const - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our C++ style guide says that references in parameter lists are only to be  used with const objects. The CommandLine objects in browser_main.cc violate  this  and we should fix this. It makes interoperating with other code that  respects the guideline annoying. </pre>
