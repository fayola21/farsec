<title>Issue 16710 -   chromium -    Backend tips service causes Interactive UI tests to hang much of the time. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WHAT:  1. Uncomment this line in in_process_browser_test.cc  compile and run  interactive_tests.exe:    command_line-&gt;AppendSwitch(switches::kDisableWebResources);    The tests should hang (if they don't  try varying the value of  kStartResourceFetchDelay  in web_resource_service.h).  Tests will generally  hang for a value of 5000 or 2000; they seem to hang about 80% of the time  on the interactive test buildbot for the standard 5 second delay.    WHERE:  The error indicates that the tests are dying in the DieFileDie method of  InProcessBrowserTest  when it gets called by SetUp; DieFileDie is unable to  destroy the temp user directory.    Because this error seems to be associated with the testing harness  as  opposed to a failure of the test itself  we decided to switch off the tip  service fetch thread for the interactive ui tests for the time being.   </pre>
