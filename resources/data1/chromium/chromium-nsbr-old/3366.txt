<title>Issue 3366 -   chromium -    Adjusting volume during flash video causes freeze initially - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.3.154.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/10/10">http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/10/10</a>          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit a website with a flash video ie: <a href="http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/10/10">http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/10/10</a>  2. Once the video begins playing adjust your volume using the hotkeys on   your laptop keyboard or in my case the front of the laptop      Volume Adjusts without any problem      Volume adjustments cause video to freeze    A couple of other notes:    If the video is long and runs for a while adjusting the volume later in the   video tends to get better results.    Reinstalling sound drivers did not fix issue.    If I use the volume control from task manager and slide the slider manually   it causes no issue.    I had <a title="Suboptimal perfomance on pages with Adobe Flash" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=93"> issue 93 </a> before of freezing while scrolling and the latest build   fixed it. </pre>
