<title>Issue 18738 -   chromium -    MetricsService.CrashRenderers is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a run today on XP Tests (dbg):    [----------] 1 test from MetricsServiceTest  [ RUN      ] MetricsServiceTest.CrashRenderers  C:bslavechromium-dbg-  builderbuildsrcchromebrowsermetricsmetrics_service_uitest.cc(113):   error: Value of: local_state-  &gt;GetInteger(prefs::kStabilityRendererCrashCount)    Actual: 0  Expected: 1  C:bslavechromium-dbg-builderbuildsrcchrometestuiui_test.cc(162):   error: Value of: actual_crashes    Actual: 0  Expected: expected_crashes_  Which is: 1  Encountered an unexpected crash in the program during this test.  NOTE:   This test is expected to fail if crash_service.exe is not running. Start it   manually before running this test (see the build output directory).  [  FAILED  ] MetricsServiceTest.CrashRenderers (2484 ms)  [----------] 1 test from MetricsServiceTest (2484 ms total)    I notice this test has a Sleep(1000) in it  which worries me.    According to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/flakiness-report/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/flakiness-report/</a>   this is   one of our top flaky tests.    Darin  I'm assigning this to you for triage.  The test is pretty old and   your addition of that Sleep() back in August of 2008 is the last meaningful   change specific to this test that I see.  I'm not sure who the right person   to track down the flakiness here is. </pre>
