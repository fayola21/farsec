<title>Issue 22411 -   chromium -    Downloads on OS X stop after 41.9 MB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mirrors.us.kernel.org/ubuntu-">http://mirrors.us.kernel.org/ubuntu-</a>  releases/jaunty/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso  OR any other large file on   any known good server.  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK        1.  Download the above file by using the ubuntu download page (enter   'ubuntu iso' in the location/magic search bar and go from there)  2.  Notice that your large file download always dies at 41.9MB no matter   which file from what site.  Retry as many times as you want.  2.5.  The download looks as if it successfully finished in Chrome but if you   show the file in the finder you'll see that it only got ~41mb of it.  3.  Retry in Firefox 3.5.x and it works fine.   </pre>
