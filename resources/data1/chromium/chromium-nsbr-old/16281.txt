Backspace and delete two characters at a time.     I'm on Ubuntu Hardy (amd64) and have the following in ~/.xinput.d/all_ALL    ---------------------------------------    # exported enviroment variables  XMODIFIERS=&quot;@im=SCIM&quot;  GTK_IM_MODULE=&quot;xim&quot;  QT_IM_MODULE=&quot;xim&quot;  # command and arguments to invoke scim  XIM_PROGRAM=&quot;/usr/bin/scim&quot;  XIM_ARGS=&quot;--daemon&quot;  # package dependency (note that the format used here is not environment  # variable  but some format for libapt-pkg-perl and is parsed by grep   # so can't be quoted  and no spaces allowed)  DEPENDS=    ------------------------   </pre>
