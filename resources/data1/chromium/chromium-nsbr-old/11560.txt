<title>Issue 11560 -   chromium -    Linux: Find bar should restore focus to previously focused widget on closing when find was unsuccessful - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.15412-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15412">r15412</a>  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>      1. Load google.com homepage  2. ctrl-f Advertising Programs -&gt; observe that the link is highlighted  3. esc tab hoping that the keyboard context in the document body will be   near the found text  but be disappointed because tabbing between links   appears to start at the top of the page  ignoring the ctrl-f you did.      The found text should be considered the current location of a virtual   cursor so that hitting tab or shift-tab should be relative to that   location.      Tab/shift-tab ignore the location of the most-recently found text  instead   always starting out from the top of the document body.     </pre>
