<title>Issue 2635 -   chromium -    Unit tests should not generate actual DNS queries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Presently  when net_unittests.exe is run  the results of the test depends   on some DNS queries being successful.  We should instead mock the host   resolver layer to perform hostname to IP address mappings manually.      Ideally  all host names should just map to 127.0.0.1 during the unit tests    and any test that actually needs to open a socket should connect to a   server running on the local machine. </pre>
