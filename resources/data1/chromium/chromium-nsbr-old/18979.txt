<title>Issue 18979 -   chromium -    chrome.bookmarks.create fails if the URL doesn't start with a protocol - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.197.11    Attempting to create a bookmark with this code fails with the cryptic error  &quot;Error during undefined: Can't find bookmark for id.&quot;    chrome.bookmarks.create({&quot;parentId&quot;: &quot;1&quot;  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;test&quot;  &quot;url&quot;:  &quot;www.google.com&quot;});    Putting &quot;http:// in the &quot;url&quot; field fixes things.  Sadly we (extension  writers) can't easily add a protocol to the URL unless we want to rewrite a  protocol detection function (to ensure we handle valid URLs like  &quot;about:config&quot; and &quot;chrome://extensions&quot;).   </pre>
