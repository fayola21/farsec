<title>Issue 5118 -   chromium -    Tab dragging is broken on the trunk - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is fairly easily reproducible on the trunk.    Open about 3-4 tabs in a maximized window. Try to drag a tab out of the tab   strip. You will see a fugly black square (is that intended behavior?). If   you place the dragged tab on the black square  the tab renders incorrectly   [see screenshot squished_tabstrip.png].     If you try to maximize/restore the tab by double clicking the tabstrip then   it causes even more fuglier repaint issues [see screenshot   black_border.png]. </pre>
