<title>Issue 21782 -   chromium -    Breakpad initialization synchronously calls lsb_release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Breakpad startup calls base::GetLinuxDistro() which calls lsb_release and   waits for its output.    lsb_release is a Python script  which does a gajillion stat()s and opens    many of them on NFS.    % grep &quot;9893.* stat&quot; strace_log | wc -l    259    Adam said the code used to just read the file directly and only during a   crash.  If we must run this script  we should at least do it asynchronously   (and then maybe wait for its output if we crash before we get its output). </pre>
