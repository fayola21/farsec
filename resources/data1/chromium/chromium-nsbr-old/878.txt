<title>Issue 878 -   chromium -    delete history entries from omnibar and new tab start page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;             Safari 3: N/T      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      1. Start typing an entry  2. Select it with the arrow buttons  3. Press &quot;delete&quot;    (A similar interface ought to also be available from New Tab  but there's  no equivalent feature for other browsers so I don't know what it would look  like)      (arguably this could be considered a feature request)  Entry is deleted and will never appear again (unless it is navigated to  again) - Firefox 3 does this for both awesomebar and search bar.      Nothing. </pre>
