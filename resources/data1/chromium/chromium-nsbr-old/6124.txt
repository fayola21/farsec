<title>Issue 6124 -   chromium -    Image Dragging to Google Presentations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.42  URLs (if applicable) : docs.google.com      1. Drag an image in a tab to the tab with a Google presentation open.      The dragged image is added to the presentation.      The tab with the presentation in it changes either to the page that the   image links to or the image itself.    This might not be a bug  just an annoyance.  I am not sure how the behavior   of dragging and tabs is formally defined.     </pre>
