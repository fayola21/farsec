<title>Issue 16502 -   chromium -    Both default and regular playback rate aren't respected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> HTML5 audio/video tags currently do not respect the playback value reported.    Load a video and set its defaultPlaybackRate to something other than 1.0    Play the video  its playback rate will report the same value as   defaultPlaybackRate  however the audio/video itself does not respect the   change. </pre>
