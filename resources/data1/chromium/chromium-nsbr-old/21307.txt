<title>Issue 21307 -   chromium -    gclient.py does not support svn+ssh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A third-party who would like to host a modified version of the Google  chromium in a secure Subversion could enter in its .gclient a url like  svn+ssh://bruno@svn.corp.....    However glient.py interprets the username (before the @) as a revision  number. This causes an error. </pre>
