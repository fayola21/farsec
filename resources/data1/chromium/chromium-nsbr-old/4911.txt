<title>Issue 4911 -   chromium -    Incorrectly Determines &quot;My Documents&quot; Location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25      1. Have a non-standard &quot;My Documents&quot; location (e.g. I re-installed Windows   to the same partition  deleting the old &quot;C:Windows&quot; and &quot;C:Program   Files&quot;.  However  the old &quot;C:Documents and SettingsUser Name&quot; remained    so my new profile is located at &quot;C:Documents and SettingsUser   Name.HOSTNAME&quot;.)  2. Save a file.  Note that Chrome uses the incorrect &quot;My Documents&quot; folder   (e.g.  in my case  Chrome seems to be simply concatenating &quot;C:Documents   and Settings&quot; + &lt;User Name&gt; +&quot;My DocumentsDownloads&quot;  instead of using   whatever win32 provides to get the correct &quot;My DocumentsDownloads&quot; folder    that is  &quot;C:Documents and SettingsUser Name.HOSTNAMEMy   DocumentsDownloads&quot;).      Chrome uses my NEW &quot;My Documents&quot; folder.      Chrome uses my OLD &quot;My Documents&quot; folder.   </pre>
