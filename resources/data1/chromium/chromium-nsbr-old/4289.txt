<title>Issue 4289 -   chromium -    IDL compiler runs for every build regardless of whether or not there are changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Every time I press F5 now even if I haven't changed anything  midl runs. I   think this is related to some of the indexing changes recently.    This is a huge productivity suck since it requires relinking chrome_dll. </pre>
