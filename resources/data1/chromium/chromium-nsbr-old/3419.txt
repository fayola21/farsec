<title>Issue 3419 -   chromium -    Image resizer gives poor performance for full page zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you have full page zoom  the image resizer  which is kind of slow  is   now run for every image. This gives poor performance.    We need to figure out a way to either not run good image resizing when full   page zoom is enabled  or do it asynchronously. </pre>
