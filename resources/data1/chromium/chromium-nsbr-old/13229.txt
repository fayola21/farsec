<title>Issue 13229 -   chromium -    Regression: File listing for file:///... is garbled if files/directories have non-ascii names. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a file with non-ascii names  e.g.  C:tmp_��_��__��_��_��_��__.txt  2. Open the directory by typing file:///...  e.g.  file:///C:/tmp/  in the   omnibox.  3. See what is shown.      File/directory names should be correctly shown  e.g.  as:      _��_��__��_��_��_��__.txt  Instead  they are garbled  e.g.  as:      ��__��_��_��_��_���Ε�_��_��_��_��__.txt      Chrome/Win has this issue.  Chrome/Mac doesn't.  Chrome/Linux hasn't been tested.    Firefox3/Win works fine.       </pre>
