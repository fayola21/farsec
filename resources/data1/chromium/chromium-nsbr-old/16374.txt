<title>Issue 16374 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: window.close() doesn't work from modal dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This regressed in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15698">r15698</a>.    The reason is that when showModalDialog is used  there's a nested message   loop.  The code was changed to use PostNonNestableTask  which will never   execute until the dialog is dismissed (but this message is used to dismiss   the dialog). </pre>
