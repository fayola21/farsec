<title>Issue 17502 -   chromium -    Chrome Apps Should Appear as Seperate Icons on the Windows 7 Taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.37                     IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1.  Create a Chrome App on a site like Google Tasks  Gmail  Google Docs    etc  eg: browse to <a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig">https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig</a>  &quot;Page Icon&quot; &gt; &quot;Create   Application Shortcut...&quot; save to desktop  2.  Launch the Chrome app  3.  Launch another standard Chrome browser    Expected: The Chrome App has its own independent icon on the Windows 7   Taskbar and is not combined with other Chrome Apps or Chrome Browsers.    Actual: All instances of Chrome  be them browsers or apps  are combined   into one square area.    Note: An example of the expected behavior is launching IE HTML Application   .hta files that show up as their own independent application icon on the   taskbar.  For an example of this  try the little .hta application at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/taskalone/">http://code.google.com/p/taskalone/</a>   Then open IE browsers  notice how the   taskalone &quot;IE Application&quot; has its own separate icon from the browsers?    I'd expect the same from Chrome.    Attached is an image for context   </pre>
