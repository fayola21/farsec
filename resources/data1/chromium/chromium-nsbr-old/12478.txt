<title>Issue 12478 -   chromium -    No way to disable autoscroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The middle click AutoScroll function seems alot more finicky then other   browsers for some reason  and there needs to be an option either in   preferences or some about page to disable that functionality  as it can   often be a major frustration to suddenly be scrolling a page when you missed   a hyperlink by one pixel  or you have a sensitive middle mouse button. </pre>
