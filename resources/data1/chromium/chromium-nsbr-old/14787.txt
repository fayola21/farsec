<title>Issue 14787 -   chromium -    content_scripts aren't run for non-html documents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.189.0    Currently  there seems to be no way of injecting script code into e.g.   text/plain or image/* documents and also into view-source:*  even though   they're internally rendered as HTML documents as well (just containing a   single &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;img&gt;).    This prevents e.g. adding an image toolbar  mouse gestures or other   functionality to some of what can be rendered in the content area. </pre>
