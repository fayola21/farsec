<title>Issue 2231 -   chromium -    New Window Sessions problems with multiple google accounts... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I used GC to login to one of my gmail accounts.  2. I opened another new window (from quick launch of XP OS) to login to   another gmail account and just entered gmail.com into address bar.  3. Unfartunately second window automatically logged into first gmail   account.   Remaining Browsers like Firefox  Opera  Safari and IE opening   with new window with new login page for gmail.com  but not logged into   first account.    Expected new window needs to open login page(when I enter gmail.com in   address bar).      but automatically opening first window's gmail account.    Please provide
