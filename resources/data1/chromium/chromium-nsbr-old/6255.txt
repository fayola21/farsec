<title>Issue 6255 -   chromium -    Text 'Clear data from this period: everything' is misleading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1      1. try to clear select browsing data for any time period      option should say 'anytime'      option states 'everything'    In the current phrasing  trying to delete only the cache for any time   period asks the user to select 'clear everything' which looks a little   scary the first time. Please rephrase to 'Anytime'. </pre>
