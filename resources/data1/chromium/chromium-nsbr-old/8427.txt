<title>Issue 8427 -   chromium -    IFrame form elements have incorrect values after changing src of iframe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48             Safari 4 Public Beta: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 6: OK           Opera 9: OK    1. Extract both files in the attached zip  2. Open test.htm  3. Inside the IFrame check the checkbox  type 'ABC' in the text box  select   'Option 1' from the select.  4. Press the Reload IFrame button    Note: I have found a workaround for now and that is to give the IFrame src   a parameter with a random value or nonce. I've included the workaround in   the test files.        The check box in the IFrame should be unchecked  the text box should be   blank and the select should be blank.  If you look at view frame source it   shows these items not having values/checked/selected.      The check box is checked  the text box has 'ABC' and the select reads   'Option 1'  these values do not match the view frame source.       </pre>
