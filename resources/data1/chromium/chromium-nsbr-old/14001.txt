<title>Issue 14001 -   chromium -    bot should verify Xvfb has started before starting tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The linux buildbots run Xvfb before running tests that need connection to an   X server.  The tests use the X virtual framebuffer instead of starting up a   full X server.    There's some flakiness on the bots not being able to connect to Xvfb and   failing immediately:    Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :9    Maybe Xvfb is crashing or slow to start.  agl suggested writing a small   program that blocks until an X connection can be established with Xvfb.    This program would run before starting a test binary. </pre>
