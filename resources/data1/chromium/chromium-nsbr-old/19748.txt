<title>Issue 19748 -   chromium -    Some dev tools sanity tests failing on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ...  #elif defined(OS_LINUX)  #define MAYBE_TestShowScriptsTab DISABLED_TestShowScriptsTab  #define MAYBE_TestSetBreakpoint DISABLED_TestSetBreakpoint  #endif      These should be fixed on linux and enabled.    (Filing this bug so I can put a bug number in the code  but I haven't   actually committed the change that enables the rest of the tests yet.) </pre>
