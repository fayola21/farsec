<title>Issue 5729 -   chromium -    RTL: TabStrip context menu should be positioned properly  If window is not maxmized. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happens in both ToT  Chrome(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7133">r7133</a>) and Chromium (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7307">r7307</a>)      1. Launch Chrome/Chromium for any RTL (arabic is fine) (make sure your  browser window is not maximized)  2. Right click on 1st tabstrip.      What is the expected output?   The Context menu should be positioned properly inside of the window.    What do you see instead?  The context menu is positioned entirely out side of the window.  (Screenshot attached.)    Please note  We honor the coordinates the context menu  in case of  maximized window.   </pre>
