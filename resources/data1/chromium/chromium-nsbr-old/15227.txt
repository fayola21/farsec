<title>Issue 15227 -   chromium -    rebaseline tool should remove dupes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just rebaselined a test that was failing on Windows and Linux. The linux   expected results were exactly the same as the Windows ones. We should   detect that case and only commit the Windows ones since   run_webkit_tests.sh looks at the windows results if there are no Linux   ones.    That's just one specific case. In general  we should have it look at all   dupes. It should match the logic of the ExpectedFilename function in   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/tools/layout_te">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/tools/layout_te</a>  sts/layout_package/path_utils.py.    Alternately  maybe this should not be part of the rebaselining tool. Maybe   there should be a separate tool that checks for dupes that takes a list of   tests. Then the rebaseline tool can just use that tool once it's done   rebaselining. </pre>
