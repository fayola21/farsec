<title>Issue 6875 -   chromium -    Certificate Management UI enhancement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Bug imported from Buganizer #1074952    Jay said:    The Certificate Management UI should be improved:    - the window location should be correctly set (now it is always 0  0). We are using a Windows call and have no access to the   window it creates. Giving it a parent window aligns it to the top left corner of the parent window  which is better but makes   it modal (which is not what we want)    - the default opened tab should be &quot;trusted roots&quot;    --------------------    WTC said:    Jay  the CryptUIDlgCertMgr function that you use exists on Windows XP or later only:  <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380286.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380286.aspx</a>    So we need to make sure CryptUIDlgCertMgr fails gracefully on Windows 2000  or use the second method I described in bug   986072.    The text &quot;Control which certificates are trusted when using HTTPS&quot; only describes half of the purposes of the certificate   manager dialog.  We need to improve the text (for example  &quot;Manage the user's certificates and trusted root CA certificates&quot;)   or just remove the text.     </pre>
