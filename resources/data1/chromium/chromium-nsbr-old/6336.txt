<title>Issue 6336 -   chromium -    Other-bookmarks menu scrolling arrows show no indication for the end of scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1      1. Have enough bookmarks in your Other-bookmarks menu so that the scrolling   arrows will show.  2. Scroll to the end of the menu (down)      The down arrow should disappear just like it does in the Windows Start menu   if scrolling is enabled in it.      The arrows look the same  there is no indication whether the user reached   the end/beginning of the menu... the arrows don't even gray out   </pre>
