<title>Issue 1635 -   chromium -    Select box options appear at different place when box partially off-screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a random phpMyAdmin (I used version 2.11.6) and add a new table.  2. If you have a 1248*1024 resolution  the auto_increment select box  appears partially off-screen.  3. Click in that partially off-screen box and the options appear somewhere  else.      The options should appear below the initial selectbox (dropdown).      They appear almost in the middle of the screen.    Please provide
