<title>Issue 8217 -   chromium -    Criteria checker is not resetting 6-month flag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run criteria checker with TRUE (to set the 6-month flag)  2. Reset the registry key it creates to a date in the past  or move system   clock ahead by more than 6 months.  3. Re-run the criteria checker.  It says the 6-month flag still applies    and the registry key is still there  even though it is far in the past.      The registry key should be deleted  and the criteria checker should return   true.       </pre>
