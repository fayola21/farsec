<title>Issue 681 -   chromium -    Chorme frame rate issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>  I just checked out Google Chrome��_��__iim a flash game developer and chrome  gets lousy frame rates��_��__compared to FireFox and MS IE.  one game im working on gets a solid 25 fps on both FireFox and IE��_��__but in  Chrome i get 15 fps...this is an issue because gamers will opt to use a  browser that preforms well with flash games. </pre>
