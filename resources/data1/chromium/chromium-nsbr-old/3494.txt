Download Chromium from <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/3463/mini_installer.exe">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/3463/mini_installer.exe</a> and save it   as it is.  2.

The new file gets downloaded as 'mini_installer (1).exe' and 'mini_installer.exe' gets deleted as a temporary download file.    <b>Please provide
