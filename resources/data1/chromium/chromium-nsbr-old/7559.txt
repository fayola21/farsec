<title>Issue 7559 -   chromium -    [Feature request] Launch foxit reader after a pdf file is downloaded  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : All that points to a pdf  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE        1. Click e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1998/153-">http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1998/153-</a>  21/15321-14.pdf    2. Get seriously annoyed when a small stupid &quot;error-box&quot; comes popping up    which has title &quot;Acrobat plug-in.&quot;  and which content is a yellow-warning-  exclamation mark along with the words &quot;Could not launch Acrobat&quot;  and a   &quot;OK&quot; button.    3. Dismiss the dialog by either OK or Close  and watch the launching page   become very dark grey (the favicon is then loaded normally  it appears).        That Foxit Reader (currently v.2.3) should launch with the PDF inside.        That little error-dialog appears.    Additional info:    I've tried as best I can to get rid of Acrobat. I have no idea where   Chrome believes &quot;Acrobat plug-in.&quot; resides - there should not be anyone.   Firefox launces Foxit correctly - it simply download the file normally  and   then launch Foxit.    The workaround is obviously to instead right-click  and download it  and   then simply click it. However  on smart-ass &quot;javascript-links&quot;  this   workaround doesn't cut it  and I have to resort to launching Firefox.    Also  I'm apparently not the only one experiencing it: My significant   other  which is a scientist and thus read a boatload of pdfs daily  having   her own laptop installed from her university (implying that I haven't   messed it up!)  experiences exactly the same. (Thus  she dismissed Chrome   as a viable browser).    Maybe this info has any correlation: JNLP files does not launch java -   Chrome simply downloads the file  and then I have to click it. </pre>
