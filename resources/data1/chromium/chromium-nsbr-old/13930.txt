Go to above URL  2. When video plays to the end  move mouse on the video      The &quot;pause&quot; button should switch to &quot;play&quot; button  and when click on it    the video should be able to play again.      The &quot;pause&quot; button doesn't switch to &quot;play&quot; button  thus couldn't replay   the video.    Works fine in Safari 4 with webkit 44515   </pre>
