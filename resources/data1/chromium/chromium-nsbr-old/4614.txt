<title>Issue 4614 -   chromium -    Move StatsTable to narrow strings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have lots of string literals in our binary for the stats table stats   names.  On Linux and Mac  these are 4 bytes per character.  There is no   need for unicode names  since we control all of the stats names.    This will be an ugly change  since it will reach in all over (v8  bindings    stats viewer  etc)  but I think it makes sense to do. </pre>
