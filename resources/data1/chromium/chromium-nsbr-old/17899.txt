<title>Issue 17899 -   chromium -    Pausing on a breakpoint in javascript prevents from opening new tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested on both:    Google Chrome	3.0.193.2 (Official Build 21134)  WebKit	531.3  V8	1.2.14  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/531.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.193.2 Safari/531.3    Chromium	3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 21844)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.2.14.10  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.196.0 Safari/532.0      1. Pause a breakpoint in the javascript debugger.  2. Try to open a new tab...no tab is opened      It would be nice if pausing js in a tab wouldn't prevent me from opening   new tabs.  If I have another tab open  I can switch to that and open   additional tabs.    Maybe when a tab is paused in the debugger  it could be indicated visually   somewhere on the tab? </pre>
