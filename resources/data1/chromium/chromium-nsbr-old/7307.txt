<title>Issue 7307 -   chromium -    Erroneous selection start - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.46      1. Position mouse at the center of a character  2. Click and hold left-mouse to start selection  3. Move the mouse to create a text selection      The starting character should be included in the selection.      The starting character (on which the mouse was positioned) doesn't get   selected  and instead the selection starts from a character that comes    immediately after it (or several characters  depending on how fast you move   your mouse) in the direction of the mouse move    The attachment shows snapshots with the starting and ending mouse   positions. You can clearly see that the first character is not selected   when mouse was dragged slowly  and that the first 3 characters were not   selected when the mouse was dragged quickly.     </pre>
