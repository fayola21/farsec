<title>Issue 8150 -   chromium -    Complex script support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently don't pass layout tests that involve complex scripts because   we haven't implemented support in our WebKit port.    An implementation of this may be able to just borrow from the GtkWebKit   port  but it seems it will more likely touch Skia.  It may be the case that   work on this is already being done for Android  so you'd best ask agl or   Mike Reed before working on this. </pre>
