<title>Issue 10527 -   chromium -    Right-click in Edit Thumbnail UI should not remove thumbnail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.175.0 (Developer Build 13665)  Edit Thumbnails UI was just introduced in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13611">r13611</a>.         1. Open New Tab page.  2. Click on &quot;Edit thumbnails&quot; link in &quot;Most Visited&quot; section.  3. Right-click on a thumbnail.    What is the expected output?     Just the context menu.    What do you see instead?    Thumbnail is removed from Most Visited list (and context menu pops up).    ------    Also  I think it would be a little more user-friendly to initiate the  Remove operation upon mouse-up (currently it's on mouse-down).   </pre>
