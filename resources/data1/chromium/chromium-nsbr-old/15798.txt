<title>Issue 15798 -   chromium -    Extensions get channel connect events for other extensions in the same process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Create a simple extension that listens to the chrome.self.onConnect event.  2. Copy it  making another identical extension.  3. Give the first a content script that connects to its extension.  4. Run chrome in --single-process mode  and install both extensions.  5. Cause the content script to run.  6. Observe both extensions getting the onConnect event.    We should filter onConnect as targeting a specific extension. </pre>
