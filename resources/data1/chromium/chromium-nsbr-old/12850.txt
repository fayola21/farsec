<title>Issue 12850 -   chromium -    Histograms gathered from subprocesses should wait till all renderers respond - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Current approach to gathering about:histograms and UMA histograms from   renderer involves giving all renderers a fixed time to respond.  This   should be changed to allow us to proceed as soon as all renderers have   responded  and to wait (longer) if one of them is slow to respond. </pre>
