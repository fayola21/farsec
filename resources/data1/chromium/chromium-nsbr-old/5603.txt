<title>Issue 5603 -   chromium -    Save As dialog is slooooooow (sometimes) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a bunch of images in separate tabs  and let them all finish   loading.  2. Go to one of them and try to save it.  3. Do it often enough and the Save As dialog pauses for up to 10 seconds   (!!!) before displaying.        I expect the Save As to be fairly constant speed -- almost instant. BTW  I   moved all files from the download directory to make sure that it wasn't   because the file list was huge.        Most of the time it works fine. Occasionally it becomes extremely slow and   takes 10 seconds to open the dialog.    Please provide
