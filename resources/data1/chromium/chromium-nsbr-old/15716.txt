<title>Issue 15716 -   chromium -    Need API to set focus to existing HTML dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the 'Create Application Shortcut' dialog (page &gt; Create Application   Shortcuts...)  2. When the dialog opens  repeat step 1.          You would expect the existing application shortcut dialog to be given   focus  but nothing happens today because there is no way (that I know of)   to easily identify the view and give focus to it when all you have is the   delegate pointer passed to BrowserShowHtmlDialog.     </pre>
