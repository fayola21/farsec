<title>Issue 9655 -   chromium -    Shockwave Problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0  URLs (if applicable) : shockwave.com          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      Select any game on shockwave.com.  The one I had selected was <a href="http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/rr2detonator.jsp">http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/rr2detonator.jsp</a>  The ad loads first as normal.  However  when the game itself loads  it is   not in the box as it is supposed to.  Furthermore  when you scroll down    you can usually try to center the feed...  The image chrome-unscroll.jpg is how it first shows up.  When scrolling   down  you end up with the image chrome-scroll.jpg.  ie.jpg is what the page   is supposed to look like. </pre>
