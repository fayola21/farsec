Open an xbap (xaml browser application)  for example:  <a href="http://thewpfblog.com/examples/motionGraphics/motionGraphics.html">http://thewpfblog.com/examples/motionGraphics/motionGraphics.html</a>      The application would download and run.      &quot;The application has failed to start because xpcom.dll was not found.  Re-installing the application may fix this problem.&quot;    The message pop-up shows multiple times (maybe 4-6).   </pre>
