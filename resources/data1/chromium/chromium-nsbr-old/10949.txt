<title>Issue 10949 -   chromium -    Use GTK widget renderering in web content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we use a widget theme cribbed from Android.    It'd be nice to use GTK  but our renderers don't have access to X and GTK   depends on X.  So to implement this  we'd need to have the renderers be   able to IPC up to the browser when they need a rendered widget  and then   for the browser to send the pixels back down to the renderer.    Depending on the GTK theme:   - if it only uses cairo  we don't need to involve X at all;   - if it uses the GdkGC-like APIs for drawing  we might be able to fake it   out to draw on a pixel buffer;   - if it calls into X there's no way to avoid it.  This is especially sad   because it means rendering is blocked on round-trips to X.  Hopefully we   can cache a lot of rendered widgets to not make it too bad.    See also gtk_widget_get_snapshot  which is part of GTK 2.14 and a version   ahead of our target.  :(    <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-">http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-</a>  snapshot </pre>
