I Imported the bookmark from Iceweasel on the dev version before the   3.0.190.2   2. I updated Chrome to 3.0.190.2 version and did the same action (Imported   the Firefox bookmark)    What happens:  Now when I go to Other bookmark I see two folders:   Imported from Firefox   and   Imported from Firefox (1)   The two folders has the same content (bookmarks)    What should happen:  I think bookmark should only be synchronized with the one already imported.
