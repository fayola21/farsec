<title>Issue 8341 -   chromium -    Do we show &quot;no bookmark found&quot;  if results not found with B'Manager ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10814)    I can see two issues over here    1) type foo in bookmark's manager search box (for which you don't get the  result).  Result: A dark thick black bar shows up in the right pane with the text no  bookmarks match the query 'foo'.    I believe this could be design change. If so it is very hard to read the  text. It would be good if we can make it more transparent.      2) the search term 'foo' is persistent in the Bookmark's manager search  box. So when you bring up B'Manager next time  you will automatically get  the search result.  In previous builds  the search terms are cleared on reopening B'manager.   </pre>
