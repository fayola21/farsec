<title>Issue 299 -   chromium -    Asking for proxy userid and password multiple times and browser hangs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I Connected to my office VPN which has a proxy server to access internet  2. Launched chrome and typed www.google.com.   3. Got a dialog to enter proxy id and password. Once I enter the   credentials and submit  it asks for the id and password again and again.   After few attempts  the browser hangs.   The same things works with IE (with same id and pwd)      Once the proxy id and pwd are entered correctly  the actual site should   load      The proxy id and pwd dialog reappears again and again.    Please provide
