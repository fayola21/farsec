<title>Issue 11297 -   chromium -    Browser crash: ssl_client_socket_win.cc(508): check failed: transport_buf_ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to skylined.deviantart.com.  2. Enter some stuff in username/password and click &quot;login&quot;  3. An error message popups up - Chrome browser process crashes.    I've attached a screenshot of the crash message. (We really should make it   possible to copy+paste the text).    I just deleted my output directory and rebuilt Chrome 2 (lkgr 15038). This   does not repro with Chrome 1.*. </pre>
