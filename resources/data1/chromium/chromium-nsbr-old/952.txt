<title>Issue 952 -   chromium -    chrome is trying to wear out my disk!  (possible Anti-malware problem) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)    The user reported the following:  * Started Chrome.  * After 1 minute chrome shows 3mb read  172kb written  disk quiet.  * Opened a wikipedia page on the one minute mark  * After the 2nd minute chrome had 20mb read  10 mb written  disk quiet  * During 3rd minute disk activity starts   racks up 106mb read  115mb   written  * During 4th minute disk still thrashing   counts up to 164mb read  190mb   written.  * Exited from chrome   disk stops making noise in a few seconds.  * During this 4 minute test  the only think i did was open the wikipedia   page   i then just watched  no mouse activity at all.    I suspected this might be downloading the anti-malware protections.  I told   the user to disable Anti-malware from the options panel.    User reports:  * YES!  This completely eliminated the extra disk activity.  Thanks.        </pre>
