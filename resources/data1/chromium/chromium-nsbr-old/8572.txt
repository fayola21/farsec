<title>Issue 8572 -   chromium -    Render view repainting sometimes delayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. put focus on location bar  2. tab to a link in the render view  3. using the mouse  click on the location bar  4. move the mouse over the render view        After step 3  there should be no orange selection box around the previously  selected render view link. Instead  that box doesn't disappear until step 4.    This does not occur when the focus leaves the render view via tabbing. I  don't know if there is some way we are supposed to let the renderer know it  needs to repaint. </pre>
