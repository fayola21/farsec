<title>Issue 5285 -   chromium -    Should be able to edit Most Visited sites thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="No way to delete items from the Most visited page..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=685"> Issue 685 </a> requests the ability to delete Most Visited sites thumbnails. I'd  like to add the request to make them editable. Specifically  one of my most  visited sites (corporate google mail  in fact) has a long URL that works  for outside the corporate firewall  and a short URL that only works inside.  I tend to visit by bringing up the VPN  waiting for it to come up  and then  using the short URL  because  frankly  I can't remember the long URL; but  that means that one of my most visited thumbnails is useless. It would be  faster if I could just edit the thumbnail once to the long form  then click  on it  instead of waiting for the VPN to come up.    A more general case is if a page I visit often changes its URL  it would be  nice to be able to edit the URL that directs to immediately  instead of  waiting a long time for my browsing history to change it. </pre>
