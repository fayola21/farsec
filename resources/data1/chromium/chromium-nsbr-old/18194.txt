<title>Issue 18194 -   chromium -    copying the URL from the omnibox to the clipboard includes the URL in HTML format - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox and IE only include the URL as plain text.  This causes the URL to   be HTML when pasting into an app that knows about HTML (e.g.  MS Word).    Maybe this is by design  but if that's the case  I wanted a bug that I can   point people at. </pre>
