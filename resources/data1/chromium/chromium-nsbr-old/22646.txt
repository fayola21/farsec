<title>Issue 22646 -   chromium -    code share page and tools menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If we want to do this  this should probably be split out into a bunch of   bugs to cover each place/platform.    In doing the Mac l10n  I'm coming across places where some of the context   menus build differently on each platform.  It seems like over time as we go   to add/tweak things  this means more hunting to keep all platforms in   sync.  By contract the context menus for the html area are done such that   the menus items come out of cross platform code and issues command   IDs.  It seems like this approach might make some sense for the other   places.    The areas I'm specifically thinking about:    Page Menu    Wrench/Tool Menu    Bookmark bar right clicks (on items  on background  etc.)    Right clicks on tabs    Download shelf (on items  shelf  etc.)   </pre>
