<title>Issue 17288 -   chromium -    chrome.bookmarks.move callback should pass back the moved bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.193.1    It would be nice if the callback function for chrome.bookmarks.move could  get the moved bookmark as a parameter.  This would make it similar to the  behavior of chrome.bookmarks.update  which passes back the updated bookmark  to the callback.    I don't think this is an essential feature  but it would make things a  little easier when moving lots of bookmarks around. </pre>
