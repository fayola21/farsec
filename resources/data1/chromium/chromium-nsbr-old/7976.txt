<title>Issue 7976 -   chromium -    Unneeded horizontal scrollbar in Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Goto Google Mail (mail.google.com/a/google.com)  2. Enable Right-Side-Chat Labs  3. Go back to Google Main        It should be possible to resize the window such that the  horizontal scrollbar goes away.        There is always a horizontal scroll bar. Even when resizing the  window much wider  the scrollbar is always 'almost full'.    This problem does not occur in Seamonkey 1.1.14. This problem  does occur in older versions (release) of Chrome.   </pre>
