<title>Issue 23122 -   chromium -    Certificate view in Mac page info dialog sometimes shows incorrect status - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to an SSL site that uses a chained certificate (e.g.   <a href="https://www.paypal.com">https://www.paypal.com</a>  2. Bring up the View Page Info dialog  3. Click the View Certificate Information button        Should see a dialog with &quot;This certificate is valid&quot;; instead it reads  &quot;This certificate was signed by an unknown authority&quot;    The problem appears to be the result of the certificate viewer not having  access to intermediate certificate authorities that server sent in the SSL  handshake. Since the certificate viewer can't trace the lineage back to a  trusted anchor  it comes up with a different trust result than the  networking layer  which has those intermediate certificates. </pre>
