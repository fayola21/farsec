<title>Issue 16405 -   chromium -    Merge WebPluginContainer and WebPluginImpl now that WebCore::Widget is refcounted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We had split these two classes so that the Widget object can be deleted (by   WebKit) while our object stays alive since reentrancy can happen in multi-  process mode.  Now that Widget is refcounted  we can just add local refs when   we have reentrancy. </pre>
