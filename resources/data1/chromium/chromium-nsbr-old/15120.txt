<title>Issue 15120 -   chromium -    New new tab: Chrome doesn't open the latest downloaded file with proper application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 3.0.191.0 (Developer Build 19059)     OS: Any    Other Browsers:         Webkit: N/A  Firefox3.0.11: N/A            IE8: N/A    Steps:  1. Run with --new-new-tab-page  2. Go to <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/uses.doc">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/uses.doc</a>  3. Download the file twice  4. Open a new new tab   5. The files you just downloaded in step 3 should be displayed under   &quot;Downloads&quot; section now     &gt;&gt;uses.doc and uses(1).doc  6. Click the firstly downloaded file (uses.doc)  observe  7. Click the secondly downloaded file (uses(1).doc)  observe    Result:  Step6: Chrome will open it with office if you you have office installed   which is correct  Step7: Chrome will download the file again which is wrong    Expected:  Chrome should open the latest downloaded file with proper application   rather than download it again    Notes:  1. It seems in new new tab  Chrome is always trying to open the latest   downloaded file inside Chrome  so if the file is a doc file  Chrome will   download it again  if it is a jpg file  Chrome will view it inside Chrome   rather than open it using &quot;Windows Picture and Fax Viewer&quot; in my case    2. This issue doesn't happen when you open the latest downloaded file from   download shelf or download page  </pre>
