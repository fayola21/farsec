<title>Issue 14497 -   chromium -    Clear the cache for theme resources when the theme changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we change the theme it would be nice if we don't have to generate random   URLs to bypass the cached version of the old theme.    For example if I load &quot;chrome://theme/foo&quot; and then change the theme and   reload &quot;chrome://theme/foo&quot; it is important to get the new image resource. </pre>
