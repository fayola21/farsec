<title>Issue 21551 -   chromium -    Don't use custom schemes for &quot;view-cache:&quot; and &quot;view-net-internal:&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Look into eliminating the custom schemes for:      view-cache:    view-net-internal:    Instead try to express them using the chrome:// URL scheme:      chrome://http-cache/    chrome://net-internals/    This is per Adam's comment in the thread &lt;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/70563d33b38a6d5f&gt;:">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/70563d33b38a6d5f&gt;:</a>    &gt; Can we move this to chrome://net-internal/ ?  Proliferating random  &gt; schemes adds up to a security issue.  The &quot;chrome&quot; scheme has a bunch  &gt; of mitigations to reduce attack surface.    Currently &quot;view-cache:&quot; and &quot;view-net-internal:&quot; are registered by URLRequestJobManager  as part of the network module's code base:    &lt;<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/url_request/url_request_job_manager.cc?view=markup">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/url_request/url_request_job_manager.cc?view=markup</a>&gt;    It is desirable to have the job handlers stay as part of the network module's codebase. However the registration could move into the browser module. </pre>
