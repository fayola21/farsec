<title>Issue 9312 -   chromium -    Undocked bookmark bar graphics glitch on New Tab navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (Official Build 12323)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open a new tab  2. Ensure the bookmark bar is undocked with the browser toolbar  3. Navigate anywhere that will take a few seconds to load        There should be no change to new tab page graphics until the new page   begins rendering.        The bookmark bar abruptly docks with the browser toolbars as soon as   navigation begins  but it remains the same size as the undocked toolbar.    This did not occur in 2.0.170.0   </pre>
