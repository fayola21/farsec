<title>Issue 7900 -   chromium -    Opening a recently saved html page triggers multiple tabs to open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 2.0.165.0 (10094)      1. Go to www.google.com or any webpage  2. Do save page (as web page complete)  3. After the page finished saving and downloading  open the saved file (or   click on the down arrow of the download icon and choose Open)    What is the expected output?   Only one tab is opened    What do you see instead?  Numerous tabs are opened         This might be a regression from <a title="REGRESSION: Save As: empty file name for webpages." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7616"> issue 7616 </a> which appears to be fixed in   this build.   </pre>
