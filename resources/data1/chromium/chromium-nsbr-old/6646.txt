<title>Issue 6646 -   chromium -    Characters typed in the Omnibar appear slowly - jerky  unresponsive behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    The Omnibar seems to search through an expansive set of items to filter   when suggesting a destination in response to characters typed in the   Omnibar. This can be a noticeably slow operation. While it is acceptable   for the dropdown list to update slowly  it is poor behavior for the input   area itself to respond slowly. Characters typed should appear immediately    even if the list below takes some time to update.    Alternatively  the display of the updated list should be interrupted when   the user continues typing  or it should not display until the contents of   the list to display have been determined. Either way  it should not affect   the update of the input box. </pre>
