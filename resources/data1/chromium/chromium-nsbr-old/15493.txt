<title>Issue 15493 -   chromium -    XMLHttpRequest in Worker does not pop up HTTP Authentication dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ..instead it just stops executing the script.  Not a security issue  just a bug.    Repro:  Try to load <a href="http://figushki.com/test/xhr/http_auth/load_protected.html">http://figushki.com/test/xhr/http_auth/load_protected.html</a>    The worker created on this page tries to load the file protected by HTTP  authentication.    Expected result:  (as happens in Safari 4 and FF 3.5): The browser pop ups a dialog asking  for password. Once password is entered  subsequent XMLHttpRequests do not  need the dialog while browser stays open.    Observed result:   No dialog  page 'hangs'.
