<title>Issue 3567 -   chromium -    No unresponsive dialog during onbeforeunload javascript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google chrome is susceptible to denial of service while handling  &quot;onbeforeunload&quot; event in body tags. The malicious script render the  browser useless when a event is created in a any kind of loop. As a result  of which browser can not be closed and remain in useless form.    No doubt if a script is injected with alert boxes the chrome asks not to  open the same alert next time. If a user clicks that and follow the routine  the alert box does not appear. On the contrary the chrome will not be  closed and remain in same intact layout. for Example: If an attacker  redirects a user to the web page with malicious layout the user will not be  able to close the event if he wants too.    The resultant script that do the tricks are:    &lt;body onbeforeunload=&quot;  for ( var chrome_t = 0; chrome_t &lt; 999999; chrome_t++)   {   alert('I think we re bugging Chrome');   }  return false;&quot;&gt;    &lt;body onbeforeunload=&quot;  while(1)  {   alert('I think we re bugging Chrome');   }  return false;&quot;&gt;    The test is conducted on Google version .30.    Provide your status over this.     </pre>
