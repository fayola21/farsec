<title>Issue 3307 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Drag text to search in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i noticed that i can drag highlighted links to the tab-bar to open them in   a new tab.  i would very much like to have similar behavior with regular text  allowing   me to drag highlighted text to the tab-bar to search in a new tab.    like many other requested features  this one is also a-la FF (or maybe an   extension).    thanx for a great browser. </pre>
