<title>Issue 22737 -   chromium -    Extreme CPU usage when playing Video with Adobe Flash Player - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2    OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (OK):  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (OK):        1. Go to Youtube  2. Play ANY Video  3. Watch CPU Usage in Activity Monitor within Mac OS X Activity Monitor      Video should play and CPU usage should stay in a common usage range      As soon as the Youtube Video starts playing the CPU usage rises to 80% and  up. 3 processes  each using around 60-70% occur in the activity monitor  (see screenshot).  I know that Adobe Flash Player is the REAL problem  as all other browser  for Mac  especially Safari  have the same effect  but this effect is  tremendous in Chrome  and makes it unusable right now. </pre>
