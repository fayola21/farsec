<title>Issue 16650 -   chromium -    Tab title has a title even though the title has changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0      1. Create a file called test.html containing the following:  &lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;    2. Load this file in Chrome    3. Edit test.html to now contain the following text:  asdf    4. Reload the tab in chrome.  The title of the tab still says &quot;Testing&quot;      It is expected that if the HTML has no title  then the tab title should be   the URL  &quot;(Untitled)&quot; or whatever the Chrome convention is for empty   titles.        It displays the old title text.     </pre>
