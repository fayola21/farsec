<title>Issue 11279 -   chromium -    More friendly message: delete all profile data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The checkbox at uninstall to &quot;delete all profile data&quot; should be more   informative to users so they know what profile data means.    Perhaps something like the first run text? &quot;Delete all history  bookmarks    and passwords?&quot; </pre>
