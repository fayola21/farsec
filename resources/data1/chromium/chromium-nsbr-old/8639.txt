<title>Issue 8639 -   chromium -    Background behind tabs and system buttons disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.169.0        Can't reproduce it on demand  it just happens after a while. Restarting the   computer makes it disappear for a while.    I use a main Chrome window with a few (6-10) tabs  and extra &quot;Create   application shortcut&quot; windows for Gmail and Google Reader.    At the moment my Chrome window looks like this when maximized:    <a href="http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug.png">http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug.png</a>    That's my desktop showing trough  but it shows other application windows if   they happen to be under. Clicking where the Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons   should be produces no effect at all  i.e. the buttons don't work  but the   focus doesn't change to the application that is showing trough either.    When I de-maximize the window it looks like this:    <a href="http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug2.png">http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug2.png</a>    Or sometimes like this:    <a href="http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug3.png">http://sputnik.pl/pies/chromebug3.png</a>    While resizing the window there's a non-Aero application taskbar flickering    trough  but I was unable to secure a screenshot.    It seems to be a bit random. At the moment Chrome window looks like on the   screenshots  Google Reader window lost Aero but otherwise works as   advertised  and the Gmail window works without a glitch. Maybe some system   resources problem  I run many apps at once.    Otherwise the application seems to work without issues. </pre>
