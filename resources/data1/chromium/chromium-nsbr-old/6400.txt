<title>Issue 6400 -   chromium -    Feature request: Add other Google searches to search engines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.156.1    Currently Chrome lacks a decent facility for detecting other forms of   search when they're used. When I want to use  for example  Google News  I   tend to do a regular Google search  then click the news link  because it's   fewer clicks that way.    However it's even fewer clicks to type in something like &quot;news&quot; to select   it in the unified search box. Currently to set this up  it's necessary to   go to the Google News home page  then do a search to make Chrome pick it   up. Although it may be difficult to do this algorithmically and therefore   fairly  it would be so much more useful if it noticed when you click a   certain link to try the search in a different service and added the   functionality there and then. </pre>
