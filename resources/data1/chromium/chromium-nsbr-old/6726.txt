<title>Issue 6726 -   chromium -    recognize URL having International Domain Name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL need to be displayed LTR no matter in LTR environment (such as English   Chrome) or RTL environment (such as Hebrew Chrome).    URL might contain non-Ascii characters  such as   an international domain name  for example http://___��__��____��__��_.com/    And URL might appear as title or other not-tagged-as-URL text fields.    For such text  we can not blindly adjust string for locale direction by   calling l10n_util::AdjustStringForLocaleDirection(). We need to parse the   text to check whether it is a URL or not  if it is URL  we need to   explicitly mark it to have LTR directionality  instead of checking whether   such text contains strong RTL characters or not and mark a URL containing   IDN to have RTL directionality.   </pre>
