<title>Issue 19630 -   chromium -    Google Translate - Back button does not work after translation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 2.0.172.39  Firefox: OK  IE8: OK    1. Go to <a href="http://translate.google.com/">http://translate.google.com/</a>  2. Write some text and click translate which should take you to another page.  3. Click the back button to go back to the previous page.    What should happen: The back button should take you to the previous page.  What happens Instead: You remain on current page / the back button does not take you to   the previous page.    I think this affects some other websites.       </pre>
