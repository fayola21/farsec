<title>Issue 17925 -   chromium -    Fatal crash when playing with extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1 (but present since the extensions first   appeared)    If I have Chrome opened and I want to package and install an extension  then   I have to:  - close Chrome  - run Chrome in the packaging mode (it works only if Chrome was not running)  - run Chrome again (with --enable-extensions of course)  - install the extension  - sometimes close and restart Chrome once more if the extension seems not to   have installed itself properly.    That's a lot of closing and starting Chrome. And if I instantly find a typo   or other such bug in the extension then I need to either uninstall it    correct the code  and run the above procedure once more  or I can replace the   files in the extensions directory  and restart Chrome.    Now  finally  what's the problem:    After extensive closing and restarting Chrome  packaging  installing and   uninstalling extensions for some time  I get a fatal Windows crash  featuring   blue screen and restart. (I don't know what the blue screen says because the   machine restarts almost instantly.)    This is not reliably reproducible  but happened to me so many times that I   have no doubts that it is Chrome that causes it. This sometimes happens even   if I wait for all Chrome processes to disappear from process manager before   restarting after I close it. The crash comes usually several seconds after   Chrome start  but  as I said  it is not reliable. </pre>
