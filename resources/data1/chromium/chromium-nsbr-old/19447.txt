<title>Issue 19447 -   chromium -    Command-W (File:Close Tab) will not close the last tab in a window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     I found steps to reproduce!    1. Command-click on a link to download a pdf.  Holding command to pop   a new tab is important.  Here's a handy link to download a pdf:   <a href="http://www.mmuair.com/docs/12500orLesspg1.pdf">http://www.mmuair.com/docs/12500orLesspg1.pdf</a>  2. Click on the pdf in the download shelf.  It will open in Preview or   something.  That's fine.  Close the pdf  or quit Preview  or just switch back   to Chromium or Google Chrome.  3. Press command-W repeatedly to close all of your open tabs.  (If you   followed the steps above  there will be at least two).      Expect: command-W closes all tabs.  Observe: command-W closes all tabs but the last remaining one.  &quot;Close   Tab&quot; in the File menu is grayed out.    3.0.198.1 official  4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23310">r23310</a> </pre>
