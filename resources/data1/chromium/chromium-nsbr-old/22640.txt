<title>Issue 22640 -   chromium -    Very long words (512KB) are wrapped incorrectly and have incorrect scrollbars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (windows)  4.0.207.0 (linux)          Firefox 3.x: OK    The attached file long-word.html consists of some explanatory text and then   a single line with 524288 characters of a followed by 1024 characters of B.      I would expect this to display as a single line on the browser and I would   expect the scrollbar to scroll to the end of that line.  Instead  I see two   lines  one all of 'a's  the second with a few more 'a's and then the 'B's.    The scrollbar also takes me far to the right of where characters show up.    Even more interesting and presumably related is the file long-word2.html   which (on linux at least) does not display any text at all if it is   generated as   perl -e 'print (&quot;a&quot; x 32768) + (print &quot;b&quot; x 32768);'  and displays a single 'b' if generated  perl -e 'print (&quot;a&quot; x 32768) + (print &quot;b&quot; x 32769);'    I'm attaching the former version  gzipped.    It's as if there's some power-of-two-sized buffer that's being overfilled.   </pre>
