<title>Issue 8683 -   chromium -    Windows SVG text that is both filled and stroked looks bad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   - Look at the attached test case with ToT windows chromium.      - The expectation is the text looks good. The reality is that it looks like   crap.    The reason this looks so awful is because the text is filled with GDI  but   the outline is stroked with skia. This is not an easy fix because webkit   calls draw text two separate times  rather than once with two fill modes. </pre>
