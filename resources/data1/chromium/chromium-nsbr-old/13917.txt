<title>Issue 13917 -   chromium -    enable morejs on linux perf bot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i'm pushing out cls for v8_benchmark  sunspider  .. on mac/linux  so we will now be building them    but there are extra args passed by the buildbots to make them run  and the trybots don't run them.    so someone needs to validate these on linux and then add them to build bots. </pre>
