<title>Issue 22861 -   chromium -    Updates tend to break the running Chrome instance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run Chrome  2. Wait for the developers to push a new version.  3. Don't restart Chrome (since you don't know they've pushed a new version)  4. Watch weird things go wrong  5. Restart  6. Watch weird things stop happening  until the next update.        Updates should leave the running instance intact  or at the very least warn   me that things will be oddly broken until I restart. I'm running Linux  so   I expect that I'll be able to leave programs running for days or weeks at a   time without restarting them.        Things are oddly broken until I restart  but there's no indication that I   ought to restart except the breakage. I've seen SSL certificates stop   working  tabs go blank  typing stop working in the address bar  etc.    <b>Please provide
