<title>Issue 15209 -   chromium -    valgrind/purify trybot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (I thought I had another bug filed on this  but couldn't find it.  huanr   asked me to file for the upcoming fixit)    It would be really cool if we could set up a valgrind and/or purify try   server.  For most engineers  the biggest headache with testing agaist   purify is that they need to rebuild the project in a custom way.  That adds   a minimum of 15-20 minutes for most people since they don't build this way   normally  and then add the instrumentation time  and it adds up.   Also    many people use it infrequently enough that they don't have it up to the   most recent patch level  or even installed at all (perhaps they upgraded   machines since the last time).     Here's how I was thinking it would work:  - it's trying to keep itself up to date with builds  compiling as people   check in  even if it's not processing try requests  - try requests must be done manually  it's not part of the default try   behavior  - ideally  you could specify a specific unit test to run   </pre>
