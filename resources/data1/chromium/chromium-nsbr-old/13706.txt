<title>Issue 13706 -   chromium -    Extension message connect could use an ID param - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An extension developer offered this idea  which I like.  Since we allow   content to open multiple ports to an extension  it'd be nice to have an ID   field to distinguish between ports.  Then you could have different types of   conversation channels.    Like:    xhrPort = extension.connect({id: &quot;xhr&quot;});    settingsPort = extension.connext({id: &quot;settings&quot;}); </pre>
