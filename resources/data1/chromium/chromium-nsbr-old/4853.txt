<title>Issue 4853 -   chromium -    tabs stick to my cursor + chrome is crashing + problems started today - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.25  URLs (if applicable) : All URLS        1. single click to select tab causes tab window to stick to cursor and move   all around the screen.  Double click seems to make it stick in place but   awkward to use multiple tabs.  2. Chrome is crashing frequently  haven't noticed a pattern  3. This just started happening (today?) so possibly due to software update?    I am running Windows Vista.     </pre>
