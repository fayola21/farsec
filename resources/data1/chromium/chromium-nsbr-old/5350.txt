<title>Issue 5350 -   chromium -    Bookmark Bubble - Name textfield shows end of name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.4.154.33  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/397f46048ec07701?hl=en      1. Add a bookmark for a page with a long title  2. Look at the textfield for Name. You see the end of the text.      I would expect to see the beginning of the page's name. Especially in the   case of the mentioned URL above  you'd only see &quot;Chromium-dev | Google   Groups&quot;.        I get confused. Then I figured out I was seeing only the end  and that I   had been unlucky.    This is a common problem on Windows  where the built-in function to select   all in a text field also scrolls the textfield to the end. Might be easy to   work around with two code lines: select from the last character  select to   first. </pre>
