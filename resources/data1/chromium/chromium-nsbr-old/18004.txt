<title>Issue 18004 -   chromium -    Progress spinner keeps spinning when viewing a video as a full tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enter any HTTP audio/video URL into the omnibox.    The progress spinner keeps spinning.  This probably relates to our   &quot;continuous download&quot; model  which is confusing Chrome who thinks we still   loading the page.    It's technically correct  but is a bit of polish :) </pre>
