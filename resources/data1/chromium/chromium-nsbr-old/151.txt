<title>Issue 151 -   chromium -    Lack of back/foward cache causes different history behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)             Safari 2: OK       Safari 3: OK      Firefox 2: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 6: OK           IE 7: OK         IE 8b1: OK      OPERA 9.5: OK      1. Use any current browser history manager that maintains state for an  entire browser session by storing information in a textarea.  2. Navigate away from the page.  3. Return to the page and find that Chrome has not persisted the values in  the textarea.      All current browsers persist entered form values for the entire browser  session. In the best case scenario it appears onDOMContentLoaded. Worst  case  onload.      Presumably because of Chrome destroying all site-related information upon  exit of the page  it destroys this piece of functionality commonly (ab)used  by developers of browser history managers. </pre>
