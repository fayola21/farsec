<title>Issue 5986 -   chromium -    Non-standard attributes bordercolorlight and bordercolordark are causing the border colors to be rendered incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The attached zip file contains three files.    -- One file contains the HTML code for example image pages.  -- An image file shows color rendering produced by either Windows Explorer   or Frontpage 2000.  -- Another image file shows color rendering by Chrome of the identical HTML   code.    I think you will agree that the difference in color rendering between the   two browsers non-trivial.    Incidently  Chrome also does not recognize HTML code for playing MIDI   music. (Some folks will applaud this &quot;feature&quot;.)       </pre>
