<title>Issue 6985 -   chromium -    Ctrl-k when in forced query mode should highlight the query text  not clear bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following sequence:    ctrl-k  foo  ctrl-k    ...should result in the text &quot;?foo&quot; with &quot;foo&quot; selected.  Currently it   results in &quot;?&quot;.    (Note  the &quot;?&quot; part depends on whether we eventually fix the separate bug   that instead of &quot;?&quot; we should display our nice search UI.) </pre>
