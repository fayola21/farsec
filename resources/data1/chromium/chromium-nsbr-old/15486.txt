<title>Issue 15486 -   chromium -    missing shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These are shortcuts that I go to use and then find they don't work (so I'm not   just whining about not matching Windows).    cmd+shift+t: undo close tab  cmd+h: show history  cmd+j: show downloads    I understand cmd+h probably won't work on the mac since that hides the   window  but another accelerator would be nice. </pre>
