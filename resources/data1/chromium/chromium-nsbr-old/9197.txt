<title>Issue 9197 -   chromium -    Change to scoped_variant_win.cc blocking official builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12081">r12081</a> introduced IsLeakableVarType which is not properly handled when   building as an OFFICIAL_BUILD.  As a result the official builds are failing   :    10&gt;.scoped_variant_win.cc(51) : error C3861: 'IsLeakableVarType':   identifier not found    It appears that &quot;DCHECK(!IsLeakableVarType(var_.vt))...&quot; should be   converted into a macro that does the right thing for official builds. </pre>
