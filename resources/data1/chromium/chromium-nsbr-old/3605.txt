<title>Issue 3605 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: on Vista (non aero)  resizing chrome frame from bottom right hand corner results in major refresh problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: on Vista (non aero)  resizing chrome frame from bottom right   hand corner results in major refresh problems    Tested:  0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 3625)    The screenshot was taken using Alt+PrtSc  so Windows thinks that the Chrome   frame is occupying the entire width and height of the screenshot.  Notice   how the desktop is showing through  etc. </pre>
