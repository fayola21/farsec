<title>Issue 22291 -   chromium -    Investigate benefits of a bfcache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't have a bfcache.  Safari  Firefox and Opera do.    There are several potential effects of having a bfcache:  * Making session history navigations faster  * Remembering form values in previous pages  * Using extra memory  * Causing web compat issues    Obviously  this isn't a slam dunk.  Darin has told me that we &quot;already load   so fast it wouldn't help much&quot;.  I'm suspicious of this since Firefox session   history navigations feel significantly faster to me.    I think it would be good to investigate this.  Perhaps there is a simple    hacky version we could get working quickly to see whether the benefits   might be worth a real implementation. </pre>
