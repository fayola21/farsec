<title>Issue 3365 -   chromium -    After updating Chromium  all my user data is inaccessible in the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I updated (from what I think is the original Google beta build that was   released when the product was announced) to 0.3.155.0 build 3281.        What is the expected result? My user data should still be accessible in   Chrome.          All my browser history  search engines  settings  saved passwords    bookmarks etc no longer show up in the browser.    It seems my User Data folder and files are intact but the browser doesn't   want to access them.  I can see all my old search engines and stuff in the   Web Data file  and my history files are still there.    Please provide
