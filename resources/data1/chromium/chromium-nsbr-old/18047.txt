<title>Issue 18047 -   chromium -    need extra click to select text in webkit when omnibox has focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.195.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=21222">r21222</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  window manager: ion3  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: as expected      1. Go to a website that contains some text.  2. Click in the omnibox to give it the focus.  3. Depress the left mouse button in webkit and drag over some text to try   to highlight it.      The website's text should be highlighted as you drag.      The text doesn't get highlighted until you let go of the mouse button and   press-and-drag again. </pre>
