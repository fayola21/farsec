What is pasted is any of:  * the desired text from Chrome  * nothing  * the application's previous clipboard contents  * earlier contents of the clipboard    I seem to get the desired text more frequently if I don't have to move to   the desired location in the other application first (i.e. if I was already   there).  In emacs I move using the usual keystroke commands; in gedit using   arrows.    The most bizarre case is when I get earlier contents of the clipboard.    E.g.
