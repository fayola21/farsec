<title>Issue 17951 -   chromium -    cmd-ctrl-d should show dictionary entry of currently highlighted word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1    OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Highlight a word  2. Hit cmd-ctrl-d        The dictionary definition of the currently highlighted word should show up    just as in every other app (e.g. safari  colloquy  ...).        Nothing.      I'm not sure if this will be fixed when cmd-a and friends work  hence a   separate bug. </pre>
