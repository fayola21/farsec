<title>Issue 14320 -   chromium -    [login.bankhapoalim.co.il]: Some - but not all - of the Hebrew text is reversed in the re-login page of www.bankhapoalim.co.il - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="https://login.bankhapoalim.co.il/cgi-bin/poalwwwc">https://login.bankhapoalim.co.il/cgi-bin/poalwwwc</a> Browser: Chrome 2.0.172.31 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5] Severity: Cosmetic problem What is wrong?    Some of the Hebrew labels of the re-log-in form are reversed (layed out   left-to-right). Most Hebrew text on the same page is perfectly fine! I can   not reproduce by simply going to the url given above. It happened when I   logged into the Bank Hapoalim web site as a registered user (sorry  I am   not giving my info :-)  and then did nothing for a long time while the   &quot;undefined&quot; alert was up (a separate bug). I then clicked Ok on the alert    and then got the broken screen in question when I attempted to perform an   operation.          What is the expected result?    All Hebrew should be right-to-left.          What steps will reproduce the problem?  I have not been able to reproduce it again  but here is what I did:  1. Go to <a href="http://www.bankhapoalim.co.il">http://www.bankhapoalim.co.il</a>  2. Log in as a registered user (don't know how to help you there)  3. Get the &quot;undefined&quot; alert but do not click on it for a long time (an   hour?)  4. Click Ok on the alert  then click on a link that will give a different   set of information.  5. The re-login page will appear    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  The auto-logout in IE7 and FF3 worked completely differently - I did not   get to the page in question at all. Perhaps it has to do with the   &quot;undefined&quot; alert.    Please provide any additional information below.       </pre>
