Hit 'a' key.  4. Hit Enter key.  5. Hit Space key.  7. Hit 'i' key.  -&gt; Now you have &quot;��_��_��ѕ�_��_��_��_&quot; in Omnibox. (U+3042  U+3000  U+3044)  The problem is there's a strange URL suggested in the list.    Repro on 0.4.154.25 on Windows Vista SP1 Ja and Windows XP SP2 En (System   and User locale is Ja).    This is not reproduced if you copy and paste the same string in Omnibox.   Full-width space is automatically converted to half-width space (U+0020).   </pre>
