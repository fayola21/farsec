<title>Issue 6820 -   chromium -    Tickmark on scrollbar moves/disappears while scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See also discussion &lt;b/1049065&gt;.    I created a reduced test case for this (attached). Search for the word   'play'  scroll down and notice the tickmark above the thumb which moves up   as you scroll down.    At the heart of the problem is a div with style &quot;overflow: scroll;&quot; (a   nested scrollbar) and while calculating the absolute position   (RenderBox::absolutePosition) for the bounding box WebKit determines that   hasOverFlowClip() for one RenderObject is true  which causes the scroll   offset to be subtracted from y. This causes boundingBox to appear too high   up and change y pos as you scroll up and down. </pre>
