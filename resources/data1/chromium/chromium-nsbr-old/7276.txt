<title>Issue 7276 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: youtube fails to load in incognito window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just got updated to 154.46. After the upgrade  youtube.com loads fine in   a normal window  but if I open an incognito window youtube.com fails to   load at all (I see the favicon  but that's it. rest of the screen is   white.) nsylvain can reproduce  and says it's also broken in .47. Mark   suggests this may be related to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=7669">r7669</a> 'waiting for cache' fix. This worked   fine in .43 </pre>
