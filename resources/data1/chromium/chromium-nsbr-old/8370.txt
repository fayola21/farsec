<title>Issue 8370 -   chromium -    app mode doesn't result in separate mac dock icons taskbar items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you launch from an application shortcut on Mac or Win7  the app shortcut   gets merged with the Chrome icon immediately. This means that you lose the   ability to swap between icons as well as the ability to have a nice launch   icon in the dock/taskbar which are very prominent launch points.    We need to build some kind of stub exe to support this feature properly on   those platforms. FWIW  the Pack and Apps teams are supportive of this   feature  partially for the sake of OEM deals where the apps may be   &quot;preinstalled.&quot;    This stub exe may also need to launch in a different browser profile. We'll   need a prototype to see how well that works (or whether it's confusing to   users to not share cookies and settings). </pre>
