<title>Issue 22701 -   chromium -    [Memory] excessive memory use when receiving a large XHR response - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When downloading a large file via XHR the memory usage explodes.  This   appears to happen only on Windows  not on Mac or Linux.  It might actually   be a WebKit bug (see stacktrace below)      1. Unzip the attached test file somewhere to get test.html and   10m_blob.txt. Open up test.html in Chromium.  2. Click the 'click to start' text  3. Observe the memory usage while the XHR response data is loaded in        Memory usage should not increase by more than ~20MB while the 10MB   response data is loaded.        Memory usage spikes to well over 1GB       </pre>
