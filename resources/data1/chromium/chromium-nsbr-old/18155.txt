<title>Issue 18155 -   chromium -    Hidden estimating time left during download in bottom bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Polish    My current version 3.0.193.2 but the problem occur in each.    WinXP SP3 Celeron 3GHz  512MB Ram  Geforce FX5500 256MB    I would cut out the string &quot;pozosta��_��_o minut/sekund&quot; (= left minutes/seconds)   or put it after the value  so that it would be visible. Eventually the width   of download button could be wider.       </pre>
