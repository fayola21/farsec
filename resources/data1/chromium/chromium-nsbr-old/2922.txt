<title>Issue 2922 -   chromium -    Windows common dialog boxes are not mirrored in right-to-left locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1123232&gt;    When the Hebrew version of Chrome displays a Windows Common Dialog (like  the &quot;Save As&quot; dialog)  the dialog does not use a right-to-left layout.    Repro steps:    Run &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot; and download a file. Note how the Save As dialog  is not mirrored.    </pre>
