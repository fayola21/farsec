<title>Issue 2010 -   chromium -    Feature: An option to disable the 'Expired Certificate&quot; warning for a specific site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When going to a website that its certificate has expired  there is a screen that   says the website is not secured and to continue to the website you have to   click on the link.    There should be an option (with a serious warning and confirmation when   using it) to disable that screen for specific sites or domains.    Internal sites within an organization sometimes use https with an expired   certificates and it is becoming an annoyance to be put through the same   annoying transition screen.      Thank you! </pre>
