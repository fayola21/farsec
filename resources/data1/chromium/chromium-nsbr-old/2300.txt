<title>Issue 2300 -   chromium -    Chrome does not remember text boxes after crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a tab crashes while something is written in a text box  it is possible   to get that back by pressing &quot;back&quot; and then &quot;forward&quot; to get back to the   same page and what was typed in the text box  but when you reload a crashed   tab  it disappears. I believe that reloading a crashed tab should have the   same effect as doing back/forward instead of the effect of refreshing the   page (which does wipe out the text box).    This also applies for when the browser crashes entirely. </pre>
