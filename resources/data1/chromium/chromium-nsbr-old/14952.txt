<title>Issue 14952 -   chromium -    We should generate extension API docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We already have the documentation signatures in a machine-readable format   (JSON Schema). We should factor the code out into static files and write code   to generate documentation.    Also related to this are the questions of where our docs should live and how   frequently they should be updated. It seems like it would be ideal if people   could see the various APIs as they exist on each branch  or on trunk.    So maybe this indicates that we need a doc viewer page that can be pointed   (via URL parameter) at any Chromium branch?    hmm. </pre>
