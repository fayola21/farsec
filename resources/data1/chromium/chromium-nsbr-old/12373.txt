<title>Issue 12373 -   chromium -    Console is treating calls to console.(group  dir  log) differently in case of multiple arguments. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome just got updated  and now the console is treating  my calls to console.group  console.dir  and console.log differently  than it did in 2.0.180.0. (I think it no longer tolerates multiple  arguments without a format string.)   </pre>
