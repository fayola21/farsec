<title>Issue 18565 -   chromium -    extension update manifest parse errors should not use ExtensionErrorReporter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now if you go to chrome://extensions   you may see some parse errors   from extensions auto-update. It's now really useful for users to see that   there  so I want to move these messages to LOG(WARN) instead.   </pre>
