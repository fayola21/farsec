<title>Issue 1533 -   chromium -    youku.com flash video does not play when it's embedded in a 3rd party web page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Youku.com is #1 youtube-like site in China.     ------------------------    1. go to <a href="http://www.oneava.cn/read.php?tid=49">http://www.oneava.cn/read.php?tid=49</a>  2. wait a a few second   3. press a large play button in the middle of 'flash' frame         Flash movie should be played. Instead  we get an error message in Chinese.         Here's the analysis (slightly paraphrased from the orignal emial report):    ----------------------  Here are the headers caught with chrome:    060.247.104.099.07961-059.175.133.025.00080: GET   /19678964764/020064010048425D28CABD00380F414E90E8FF-9EB6-4DCF-0858-  C5378F42C4EC.flv HTTP/1.1  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13  Referer: <a href="http://www.oneava.cn/read.php?tid=49">http://www.oneava.cn/read.php?tid=49</a>  Accept: */*  Accept-Language: zh-CN zh  Accept-Charset: gb18030 * utf-8  Accept-Encoding: gzip deflate bzip2  Host: 59.175.133.25  Connection: Keep-Alive    Here are IE's headers:    060.163.233.090.03560-059.175.133.025.00080: GET   /196f7764764/020064070047241199C96F0048CFA690E8D0F3-B2A8-7E99-061C-  C5114F6C4B05.flv?start=170 HTTP/1.1  Accept: */*  Accept-Language: zh-CN  Referer: <a href="http://static.youku.com/v1.0.0320/v/swf/qplayer.swf">http://static.youku.com/v1.0.0320/v/swf/qplayer.swf</a>  x-flash-version: 9 0 124 0  Accept-Encoding: gzip  deflate  User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)  Connection: Keep-Alive  Host: 59.175.133.25    Basically they need to check the referer to make sure the request comes   from the flash they created  instead of a download link. IE gives referer   as the url of flash swf  while chrome gives the url of the page  which   fails their check. It seems they do have the need to confirm referer. Is it   that we are doing it wrong?   </pre>
