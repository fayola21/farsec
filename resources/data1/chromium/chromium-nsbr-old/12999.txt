<title>Issue 12999 -   chromium -    Wrong process icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.183.0 (Developer Build 17289)  OS + version : Ubuntu Jaunty  window manager : Metacity  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): correct      1. Start chromium build  2. Look at process in gnome-system-monitor or gnome-do's docky      The blue chromium icon should be shown      The placeholder icon or -if available- the icon named &quot;chrome&quot; is shown      My guess would be that those apps (there may well be more than the two)  look for an icon matching the process name  which is &quot;chrome&quot;. Changing the  process name to &quot;chromium&quot; would help.  </pre>
