<title>Issue 19883 -   chromium -    Proxy settings precedence is not correct - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start &gt; Type inetcpl.cpl - Internet Properties window will be launched  2. Go to Connections tab &gt; LAN settings  3. Check the following  Automatically detect settings and Use a proxy server for your LAN  4. Enter some proxy that needs authentication in address and give the   appropriate port number    What is the expected output?   Automatically detect settings should take precedence over Proxy server   config    What do you see instead?  Proxy authentication dialog is seen    When I use Automatic configuration script and Use Proxy server for your LAN   options  Chrome behaves correctly by giving Automatic configuration script   precedence.    This is happening with Chromium 4.0.203.0 (Developer Build 23825) on Win7    XP and Vista work fine.       </pre>
