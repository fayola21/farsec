<title>Issue 19376 -   chromium -    There should be a startup test for gtk+ theme mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Miranda's been working on adding startup tests for complex themes.  We   should do the same and have one for gtk+ theme mode.  If nothing else  it'll   let us know how much it impacts startup.    It's probably pretty easy to piggy back off the existing work in   chrome/test/startup/feature_startup_test.cc. </pre>
