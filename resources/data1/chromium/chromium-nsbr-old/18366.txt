<title>Issue 18366 -   chromium -    about:version x navigates to about:blank instead of searching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.193.0  URLs (if applicable) : 'about:version x'  'about:memory 10'  'about:crash#'         Safari 4: Not reproducible    Firefox 3.5: OK      1. Enter an internal URI scheme followed by a space then additional character/word  or  2. Enter an illegal internal URI scheme      For #1  Supposed to do search on default TLD  For #2  Add a notification? In Firefox  a notification appeared showing illegal url      I think the page redirected to about:blank.    Just happen I wanted to search 'about:blank wiki' and the page goes blank.  Also  the behaviors may be generalized. </pre>
