<title>Issue 5566 -   chromium -    new tab button too close to minimize button when maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a lot of tabs  2. Maximize the window        The new tab button (nearly?) overlaps the minimize button on Vista (haven't   tested XP).  It makes it really hard to click the new tab button without   minimizing the window and the layout looks very crowed. </pre>
