<title>Issue 12346 -   chromium -    git.chromium.org occasionally has wrong authorship data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> git.chromium.org builds its git repo off an svnsync of the main repo.    Unfortunately  svn commits as synced by svnsync are not atomic(!) and so the   git mirror can grab from it in mid-sync  resulting in the wrong user info.    I'm not yet sure of the best fix. </pre>
