<title>Issue 12764 -   chromium -    Extensions auto-update needs to prevent accidentally re-installing an extension that was just uninstalled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The auto-updater needs to coordinate with the ExtensionsService to indicate   that it's doing an update install  not just a regular install. That way if   the extension isn't currently installed  it won't be re-installed.     </pre>
