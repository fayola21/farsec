<title>Issue 9921 -   chromium -    make test_shell faster - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At this point  the speed of webkit tests is almost entirely gated on the  speed at which test_shell runs the tests. A few things come to mind so we  can try to improve this.    1. We should spit out the avg time it takes to run each test on each  buildbot run and track this on a perf dashboard so that we can improve this  speed and track regressions. We already measure the time each test takes to  run. We just need to spit out the average (sum?  geometric mean?).    2. Do some simple profiling of test_shell to see if there's low-hanging  fruit. Note that startup/teardown time is not a huge factor here since we  reuse a handful of test_shell instances. It's a question of what happens  when we run each test.    3. Make debug builds faster. They'll always be slower  but they are  *really* a lot slower. There's probably a handful of debug logs or whatever  that we could cut that would considerably improve debug performance. It's  probably worth this. This would also have the nice side benefit of making  debug builds of Chromium more dogfoodable.    Those are just the first things that come to mind. There's probably other  things we could do to improve the perf here. </pre>
