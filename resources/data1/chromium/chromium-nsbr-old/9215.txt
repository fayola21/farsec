<title>Issue 9215 -   chromium -    Chrome needs one feature to appeal to the userbase that is still on dial-up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome desperately needs an option to turn off image loading when   browsing. This is the one thing keeping me from trying each build for more   than an hour. As someone that is *stuck with dial-up  I simply cannot   browse and wait for images to load. Please consider this request for   Chrome's next release. There are still a good many people out there that   have to live with dial-up because they live in rural areas. Thank you. </pre>
