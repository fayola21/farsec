<title>Issue 8957 -   chromium -    Consider using more green in EV SSL UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  we use a lot of yellow in our SSL UI even when the site has an   EV certificate.  EV's brand is all about green.  Maybe we should experiment   with more green?  Maybe I'll bust out Photoshop and make some mocks.  :) </pre>
