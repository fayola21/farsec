Go to www.google.com  2. Bring up the js debugger by CTRL+SHIFT+L  3. Close the debugger (as soon as it comes up)  4. Try to click on any link in google page      While <a title="Renderer hangs on closing javascript debugger" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5754"> issue 5754 </a> hangs the renderer when you close the debugger in the   middle of a debug session  in this issue  just simply closing the debugger   (even if you are not in the middle of a debug session) hangs the renderer.    This is especially bad when you bring up the debugger for constrained   windows. The parent window and the constrained window both hang.
