<title>Issue 4251 -   chromium -    Changing dropdown's selectedIndex within onchange handler fires another onchange - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was reported on chromium-discuss for the site:  <a href="http://chatbotgame.com/?cmd=chat_s">http://chatbotgame.com/?cmd=chat_s</a>    What happens on this site  is if you answer cancel in the confirmation dialog  and then blur the   dropdown (say by scrolling the page)  it will submit the form.    &lt;select name=&quot;filter&quot; onchange=&quot;if (this.selectedIndex == 0 || confirm('Turn safe spy off?  If you   are younger than 18  click Cancel.') ) document.safeSpyForm.submit(); else this.selectedIndex =   0;&quot;&gt;         &lt;option value=&quot;on&quot; selected=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;I'm 13+&lt;/option&gt;               &lt;option value=&quot;off&quot; &gt;I'm 18+&lt;/option&gt;            &lt;/select&gt;     The problem is in Chromium + Safari  if you change the selectedIndex from within the onchange   handler (notably while it still has focus)  then once you blur if the index has changed it fires   another onchange event.   </pre>
