<title>Issue 11625 -   chromium -    Need keyboard shortcuts for selecting tab 1  tab 2  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.175.0~svn20090418r14008-0ubuntu1~ucd1~hardy  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Alt-1  Alt-2  ... Alt-n for the nth   tab (where n &lt; 9); Alt-9 for the rightmost tab.    I believe the corresponding behavior exists in the Windows version of   Chrome  except using the Ctrl key? I don't know how I feel about the choice   of modifier  but I presume there's some good reason Firefox went with a   different one on each platform.   </pre>
