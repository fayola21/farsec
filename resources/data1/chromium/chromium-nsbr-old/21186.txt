<title>Issue 21186 -   chromium -    [DevTools] Scripts listing shows duplicate redirected entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.206.0 Safari/532.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js">http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js</a>  Other browsers tested: -    1. Add on an empty page any javascript file which is a 301 in a &lt;script&gt;   tag  for example <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js">http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js</a>  2. Hit Ctrl+Shift+J  click on &quot;Scripts&quot;  3. Unfold the Scripts listing      Only one JS file should appear.      Both <a href="http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js">http://db.mmo-champion.com/tt.js</a> and http://db.mmo-  champion.com/static/js/tooltip.js appear in the listing. Clicking on the   former yields an empty file.    This could use a better interface  for example a warning topbox (like   &quot;Would you like Chrome to save this password&quot;) saying the content actually   lives at <a href="http://example.com/foo.js">http://example.com/foo.js</a> and this file is a 301 or something   similar. At the moment  it's confusing if you don't know one is a redirect. </pre>
