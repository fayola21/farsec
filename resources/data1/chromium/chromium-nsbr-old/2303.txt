<title>Issue 2303 -   chromium -    test_shell should not depend on papyrus font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout tests are failing on a clean machine (without Office installed)   because the papyrus font is not installed.    We should not depend on it.    Tests failing:  LayoutTests/css1/font_properties/font_family.html  chrome/fonts/papyrus.html     </pre>
