<title>Issue 18617 -   chromium -    other bookmarks menu too small and too wide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.0~svn20090804r22377-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit  window manager : Gnome + Emerald (also metacity)    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): works as expected      1. Import Firefox Bookmarks (that's what i did) and move them to &quot;other   bookmarks&quot; with the bookmark manager      the menu should be as tall as possible to show as many bookmarks as   possible  and as wide as needed.      The Menu only shows 4 bookmarks but takes over the half of the width my   screen (1920x1080). There are the arrows that let me scroll up and down.  There are quite a bit bookmarks in this menu  lot of submenus.  See attached screen.   </pre>
