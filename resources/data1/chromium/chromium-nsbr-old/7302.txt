<title>Issue 7302 -   chromium -    the field from the prompt javascript dialog is not focused and fully selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. write a javascript that will show a &quot;prompt&quot;  2. write the code so that the edit field in the prompt window will not be   empty  3. in Chrome  the field does not show with the focus and fully selected as   it does in other browsers.         The expected result would be the prompt window with the edit field focused   and fully selected. The field is not focused  and when I gather the focus   with the mouse will not be selected.    What happens instead? See above        Please provide
