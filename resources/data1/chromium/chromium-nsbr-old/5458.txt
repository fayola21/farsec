<title>Issue 5458 -   chromium -    Firefox not shown in dropdown when importing settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to various user reports  in some cases users with Firefox   installed do not see it listed when trying to import settings (either   during first run or afterward).    According to one user I talked to this happened on two different machines   that had a &quot;standard install&quot; of Firefox 3.  The comments on <a href="http://www.thewwwblog.com/import-bookmarks-into-google-chrome-browser.html">http://www.thewwwblog.com/import-bookmarks-into-google-chrome-browser.html</a>   show other people claiming this same issue.    I can try to find out more info if there are particular questions we want   to ask someone experiencing this. </pre>
