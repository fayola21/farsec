<title>Issue 2038 -   chromium -    Unable to drag a tab into another Chrome window if the tab strip (tabs and blue area at the top) is covered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Start 2 Chrome windows; let's call them chr1 and chr2  2. Use chr1 window to completely cover the tab strip (tabs and blue area at   the top) of chr2 window.  3. Open an url in a tab in chr1  4. Try to drag the tab into chr2 window      When the dragged tab passes over any part of the chr2 window  it will pop   into the foreground.  --- OR ---  Use the Windows standard GUI method of dragging the tab over chr2 button in   the task bar  which should also pop it into the foreground.  Then you can drop the tab into the chr2 window.      Nothing.  There is no way to activate/focus the chr2 window to drop the tab   into it.    It seems the chr2 window will only get focus if your mouse passes over the   tab strip at the window top.  Since chr2's tab strip is entirely covered by   chr1  the covered window cannot get focus from tab drag-and-drop and you   are unable to drop the tab into it.   </pre>
