<title>Issue 7197 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data should refresh a page with populated login credentials. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dev: 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8889)    I could not able to find a bug for this  that's why I'm filing this.    -Login to Google internet email a/c.  -Save the login credentials (if they were not saved) using password manager.  -Sign out from the email a/c. --Notice you will get login credentials  populated on the sign out page as EXPECTED.  -Now perform &quot;clear browsing data &quot;  make sure you select clear passwords also.    Issue: The sign-out page(step3) with login credentials should be refreshed  after clear browsing data is finished  So that we don't see login  credentials on the sign out page.        </pre>
