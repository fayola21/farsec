<title>Issue 11864 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Double-click on frame passed through to content after maximizing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Set up a restored window such that  after maximizing  a position that's on   the frame of the restored window is on some clickable item in the content of   the maximized window.  Ad banners work well for this.  * Double-click the restored frame at this point.  * Note how the window maximizes _and_ clicks the item.  Instead this click   should be fully eaten.    Not sure who broke this.  Ben knows this code somewhat so he can find a good   owner. </pre>
