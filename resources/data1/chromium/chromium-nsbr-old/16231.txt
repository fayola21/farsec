<title>Issue 16231 -   chromium -    Browser::GetCurrentPageTitle has a misleading name and comment - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (just using the bug tracker as a little TODO list)      // Gets the title of the page in the selected tab.    std::wstring GetCurrentPageTitle() const;    However  it is in fact the *window* title. I was recently writing a browser  test involving that function  and got confused for a few minutes.    Maybe GetCurrentWindowTitle or just GetWindowTitle would be a better name?    If you don't like the &quot;rename the function&quot; idea  I think that at least the  comment should be changed.    What do you think? </pre>
