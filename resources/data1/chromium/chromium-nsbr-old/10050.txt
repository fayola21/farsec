<title>Issue 10050 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Browser/Tab can't be closed on launching javascript debugger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a webpage like youtube.com or login into your gmail  2. Bring up javascript debugger (page &gt; Developer &gt; Debug Javascript)  3. Try to close the tab    What is the expected output?   The tab closes     What do you see instead?  Tab doesn't close. Even the whole browser can't be closed. Only after   killing that particular process using task manager  we can either close the   tab or the browser.    *** This regressed in Google Chrome 0.3.154.6 (Official Build 3668) *** </pre>
