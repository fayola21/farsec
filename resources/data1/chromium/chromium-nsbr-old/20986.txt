<title>Issue 20986 -   chromium -    Support modifier clicks on Back/Forward menu items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this is a split from <a title="Support modifier clicks on UI elements" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6477"> Issue 6477 </a>    since you can Middle/Shift/Ctrl+Click most UI elements (Home/Back/Forward buttons  Bookmakrs...)  i think it makes sense to allow this for the Back/Forward menu items too    if possible  middle clicking should open the tab in the background without   closing the menu </pre>
