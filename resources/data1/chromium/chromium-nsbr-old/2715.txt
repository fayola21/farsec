<title>Issue 2715 -   chromium -    reload in context-menu?  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following is taken from google webmaster help group:    --------------------  As I webmaster the process usually goes  make changes  refresh the   page especially as any css changes need a proper refresh.  Other   browsers have reload / refresh on the right click menu and I miss it    having to go up to the toolbar is slower and annoying enough to switch   back to firefox.   ------------    I never used it and didn't even know FF and IE have &quot;reload/refresh&quot; in the   context menu  but some people seem to miss it.      </pre>
