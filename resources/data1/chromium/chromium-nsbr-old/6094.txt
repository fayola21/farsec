<title>Issue 6094 -   chromium -    Ignore vowels for Hebrew in find in page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b1179303&gt;      1) open chrome  Hebrew UI  2) open the test page:  <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~shoshannah/chrome/nikud.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~shoshannah/chrome/nikud.html</a>  3) CTRL+f  and try to search for a word that appears a lot in the page      Actual Result:  only the words without vowels are found    Expected result:  both should be found      this happens since we don't normalize the text for search  and search only   for the exact string. since in Hebrew the extract string depends on   grammar  most users would never actually enter the exact string.    The attached screenshot shows IE7's find in page- which defaults to   ignoring vowels.     </pre>
