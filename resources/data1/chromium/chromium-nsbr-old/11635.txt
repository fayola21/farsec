<title>Issue 11635 -   chromium -    Linux: status bubble needs improvement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we have a fairly primitive status bubble. It needs to    (a) look better  (b) go away when you can't see the main window (e.g. while switching desktops)  (c) limit itself to the width of the browser  (d) get out of the way when you try to mouse over it.    I was surprised there wasn't already a bug for this. If there was  but my  searches missed it  then whoops. </pre>
