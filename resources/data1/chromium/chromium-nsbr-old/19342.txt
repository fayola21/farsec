<title>Issue 19342 -   chromium -    Cache not cleared automatically. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I reported the odd appearance of two sites recently in chrome -    <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php">http://www.qwantz.com/index.php</a>    and    <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/</a>    The thing about these two sites in particular was that they each moved to a new stylesheet / updated their   old ones; at that point  the site appeared in the default styles with no apparent styles loading  a   problem which recurred for several weeks.    I have fixed the issues by clearing the cache by hand. The user should not have to do this; the relevant   bits of the cache should be refreshed automatically!    I attach the following item to help debug:     * A directory listing of the pre-clear cache  showing file sizes and dates modified.    I will keep a zip of all the user data in case it is useful (I won't attach it directly to a bug  as it   contains my entire history!) You will have to tell me exactly what files I can post safely or provide me   with an email address to send the data to if you need it. The entire User Data directory is 511 MB!    Thanks     Joe </pre>
