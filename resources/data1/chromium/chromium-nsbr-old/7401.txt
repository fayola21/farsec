<title>Issue 7401 -   chromium -    Autocomplete popup is not closed when the browser window is moved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a form  type something to bring up the autocomplete popup  2. While the autocomplete is showing  move the browser window    Expected:  The popup is closed.    Actual:  The popup stays open at its current location.    Note:  The expected behavior is Firefox's behavior.  IE keeps the popup open but moves it along with the browser window.  It is probably simpler to just close it. </pre>
