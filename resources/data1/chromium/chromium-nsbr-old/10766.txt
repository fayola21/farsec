<title>Issue 10766 -   chromium -    [linux] gtk fatal error when downloading a file with &amp;amp; in the title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try to download a file with &amp; in it.  I get the following gtk error:  Gtk: Failed to set text from markup due to error parsing markup: Error on  line 1: Character '��_��__' is not valid inside an entity name    It looks like in download_item_gtk.cc we use markup in the label.  We need  to escape markup characters before we display them.  It would be even  better to not use these markup methods since escaping is easy to forget about. </pre>
