<title>Issue 15843 -   chromium -    Modules Mac (valgrind) takes too long - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It currently takes ~80 minutes to cycle. This makes it very hard to stay on top   of valgrind errors. This builder has been red for over a day now despite   constant attention from sheriffs and committers.    Can we split this up into two or three builders? Is there another way we can   reduce how long it takes? </pre>
