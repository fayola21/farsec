<title>Issue 3341 -   chromium -    Unable to Backspace or Delete Characters In TextBox with Masked Edit Extender in ASP.NET - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     While working on an internal application for my company; I have a text box   control that is using the Masked Edit Extender from the Ajax Control   Toolkit that forces a user to enter in a formatted phone number. While   using chrome  I noticed that I could not use the delete key or the   backspace key to clear out the digits after I typed them in. In IE7 and FF3   I can hit backspace or delete to clear out digits and type something   different.  Here is my code block:    &lt;asp:TextBox ID=&quot;txtWorkPhone&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; MaxLength=&quot;12&quot;   Width=&quot;81&quot;&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;  &lt;cc1:MaskedEditExtender ID=&quot;mskWorkPhone&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;   ClearMaskOnLostFocus=&quot;false&quot; ClearTextOnInvalid=&quot;false&quot;   InputDirection=&quot;LeftToRight&quot; Mask=&quot;999-999-9999&quot; MaskType=&quot;Number&quot;   TargetControlID=&quot;txtWorkPhone&quot; AutoComplete=&quot;false&quot;&gt;  &lt;/cc1:MaskedEditExtender&gt;        You are only suppose to be able to enter numbers  which is true for chrome    however if you type in the wrong number  if you hit backspace or delete you   are not able to remove the character.        No response from Chrome  it just fails to delete or remove the characters.      Please provide
