<title>Issue 4291 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager: import/export bookmarks can produce multiple  nested &quot;Imported&quot; folders. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.16 (Official Build 5093)        1. Ctrl+Shift+B or menu to bring up Bookmark Manager.    2. Tools menu &gt; Export bookmarks.  3. Give a filename  e.g. bookmarks0.html  and Save.  4. Tools menu &gt; Import bookmarks  5. Select bookmarks0.html  and Open.    6. Tools menu &gt; Export bookmarks.  7. Give a different filename  e.g. bookmarks1.html  and Save.  8. Tools menu &gt; Import bookmarks.  9. Select bookmarks1.html  and Open.    For extra credit  export and import a couple more times.    Note that multiple  nested import folders have been created.  This might be  confusing and frightening to the user. See attached pictures.    IE 7 superimposes the new bookmarks over the old ones. Suggest that this  may be the way to go.   </pre>
