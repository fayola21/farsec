<title>Issue 21298 -   chromium -    Crashes due to bugs in tab bar / window re-embededding animation. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : both nightly and     OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;          Bare with me on this one... During my first hour of normal Chrome usage (wasn't testing at the time) I managed to see this. It's difficult to reproduce alas. I hope this helps.      1. Create a new window.  2. Create a second tab.  3. Drag the second tab out and while still dragging  move it randomly on the screen for a short period  making sure that you hit the &quot;tab re-embeds in tab bar&quot;  &quot;top of window   becomes transparent&quot;  and &quot;tabs move in order to make space for other tabs&quot; behaviors.         That the tabs end up in the expected place without exception.         Several different outcomes. I've attached a crash log (current nightly)  and a spindump (Chrome release).     The crashes followed a vertical and horizontal mispositioning of the tab inside the tab bar (though may just have been an incomplete animation).     On top of these spins and crashes  I've seen:        The dragged out new window remains at a very low opacity level (I've even seen 0 opacity  as in  the window is simply lost  but its possible to cmd-tab to it).        The tabs become mispositioned horizontally in the tab bar  extra space is placed around (between  or before the entire set of tabs). Sometimes the position appears to also relate   to the mouses movement after completion  but only for a short while.    Hope this helps in some way. </pre>
