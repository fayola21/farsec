<title>Issue 4758 -   chromium -    Need a UI test for plugin installer infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should have a UI test to make sure the plugin installer infobar is   operational  specifically because it's so hard to get this bit of UI to   come up organically.    The xml file of available plugins should have an entry for a dummy mime   type/download which would be used by the test case. </pre>
