<title>Issue 13699 -   chromium -    Initialize the password for the NSS databases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="Initialize NSS with databases" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12348"> issue 12348 </a>  we started to initialze NSS with databases.  But we aren't initializing the password for the NSS databases.  Some database operations  such as trusting a root CA cert   requires a password.  It is fine for the password to be an  empty string  which means no login is required.    I believe that we just need to do the following:      PK11Slot* slot = PK11_GetInternalKeySlot();    if (PK11_NeedUserInit(slot))      rv = PK11_InitPin(slot  NULL  &quot;&quot;);    PK11_FreeSlot(slot);    See the certutil SECU_ChangePW2 function as an example:    <a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?">http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?</a>  file=mozilla/security/nss/cmd/lib/secutil.c&amp;rev=1.98&amp;mark=440-444#411 </pre>
