<title>Issue 19061 -   chromium -    Local State / Preferences distinction is confusing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We keep some state in Local State and some in Preferences.  It's confusing   where we should put new prefs and there are lots of prefs that are probably   in the wrong file.    I think we should just merge these for now and when we actually get to the   point of needing separation (e.g.  stuff that gets synced to the cloud vs   stuff that shouldn't get synced to the cloud) we can re-split with the clear   goal in mind.   </pre>
