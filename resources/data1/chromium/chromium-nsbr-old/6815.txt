<title>Issue 6815 -   chromium -    Find box should contain gray text when empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Brian Rakowski filed this internally &lt;b/1094450&gt;:    When you invoke the find box  have gray text in the box that says  &quot;Find in   page&quot; until the user starts typing.    Peter Kasting replied:    But isn't the cursor already in the box by default?  Seems kind of weird to   have helper text when the box is focused and waiting for input  rather than   when it's blurred...    This might be tricky to pull off if we actually put the text into the edit    since we'd want to detect that this text is non-user text and thus we   should disallow keyboard/mouse selection of it  or in fact even cursoring   through it.  I guess we could try and paint a label over the top of the   edit  I don't know how easy that is.    Brian:    That's a reasonable concern  however  look at the login screen for windows  vista as a counter example. It's not confusing at all--the gray text  disappears as soon as you start typing. I can show you if you don't have  access to a vista machine.    Peter:    Yeah  I have Vista at home.  I noticed this when I started using it and   thought it looked glitchy (and still do)  but you're right that it wasn't   really confusing.  I guess that leaves us with worries about implementation   difficulties.         </pre>
