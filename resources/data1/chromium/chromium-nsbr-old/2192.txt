<title>Issue 2192 -   chromium -    A message box on one tab should not prevent the user from going to a different tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29  URLs (if applicable) : Any page that shows a message box           Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A    This can be considered more of enhancement than a bug. If all the tabs in   the chrome brower is a individual process  then a message box displayed in   one tab should not prevent the user from the going to a different tab.    Lets assume I am a webpage that wants to install some unwanted software   and keeps displaying a message box repeateadly untill I click &quot;Yes&quot; to the   install. Now when this message box is displayed  I cannot goto to any   other tab and entrire brower session is inaccessible.     So ideally  if each tab is a process  than a message box on one tab should   not prevent me from going to a different tab.    What say you all?? </pre>
