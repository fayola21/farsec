Logging on with my internet banking passwords etc.             When we login in that screen  we can do every bank operations from the   menu. The screen height &amp; width must be as attached picture (to see whole   menu)      There are two options:   1. The screen is not big enough (the whole menu can not be seen properly).

And  to stop that   you have ctr+alt+del   to shot it down from task manager.       Please provide
