<title>Issue 18505 -   chromium -    Padding around window buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.198.0 (Developer Build 22471)  OS + version : Linux      Compare chrome's window deco with popular metacity themes      There should be a bit more space between the buttons and the top as well as between the buttons  say 2px   from the top and 2-4px between buttons. This would simply make the top right corner look less cluttered. </pre>
