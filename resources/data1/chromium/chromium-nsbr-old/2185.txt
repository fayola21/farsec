<title>Issue 2185 -   chromium -    Replace atlcrack.h macros with version that uses gfx types. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should replace the atlcrack.h macros that crack to Windows/WTL types   like CPoint  CRect  CSize with ones that crack directly to our types   gfx::Point  gfx::Rect and gfx::Size. In the long run this will save us a   lot of conversions. </pre>
