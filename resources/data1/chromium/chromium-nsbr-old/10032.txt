<title>Issue 10032 -   chromium -    Unread chat in gmail makes page lose focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing a bug per pinkerton's request.  We should fix this one for dogfood.        1. Compose a mail in Gmail  2. Have a friend IM you while you're typing.      Unread chats shouldn't stop you from typing your email.    Actual:  Beeps. Everytime Gmail changes the page title to flash the unread status   the compose box loses focus.      This is similar to issues 9419 and 9420.  I suspect that changing the page  title is what's stealing focus away from the webpage.    I also see this in Rietveld: clicking on a next/previous link steals focus  away from the page.  I have to click in the contents area to make keyboard  shortcuts work again. </pre>
