<title>Issue 6911 -   chromium -    No Disk alert should be Chrome alert (?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1248880&gt;    Type a://blah  (I guess a: is universally treated as Floppy disk ? )      Eg: a:ca    This alert is windows native alert. This alert should be Chrome alert so  that It can be modal.    Bcoz  while this alert is up  user is allowed to navigate to any webpage  but the rendering of the page is hung until the alert is closed.    See the screenshot for &quot;alert&quot; </pre>
