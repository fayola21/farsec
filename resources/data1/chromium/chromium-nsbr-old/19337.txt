<title>Issue 19337 -   chromium -    combobox without dropdown doesn't fire onchange event - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.39  URLs (if applicable) : many  see below         Safari 4: fail    Firefox 3.x: fail           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. here's a good example  but plenty sites have comboboxes that act on the onchange event:  <a href="http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Divisions/Maestro/Electrics/Mini-V/">http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Divisions/Maestro/Electrics/Mini-V/</a>  2. click the combobox to open the drop-down (and give it keyboard focus)  3. click again to close the drop-down (alternatively use tab key to give focus to the drop-  down)  4. use up and down arrows to change the combobox selection        onchange should get fired by the up/down-arrow-key press changes        onchange doesn't get fired   also  if you use the mouse to open the drop-down and try to re-select the item that is   selected  no event gets fired    I've had a look around  <a title="No &quot;onchange&quot; event when autocompleting"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10879">issue 10879</a> may be related. Also since Safari has the same   behaviour  it may be a WebKit issue. </pre>
