<title>Issue 17877 -   chromium -    Browser freezes while displaying a pdf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0~svn20090727r21637-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : Compiz  URLs (if applicable) : http://www.selex-si-  uk.com/pdf/SELEX%20Systems%20Integration%20Ltd%20-%20Bristol.pdf  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Ok      Try the url specified above:  the tab just freezes (other pages in other tabs keep working) and you're   not able to close neither the tab nor the browser anymore.  Although this is a bug related to plugins and the splash screen warns about   that plug-ins are unstable  I believe that this specific bug might be   interesting to investigate for developers.    </pre>
