<title>Issue 7364 -   chromium -    lingering CPU usage in 2.0.159.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Over the last week or so  I've been noticing that my task manager is   regularly showing a low level CPU burn that's being attributed to Chrome.    The odd thing is that it appears to be a small amount from many processes   (2-9% each from 2-10 tabs).  If I reload the tabs that Chrome's task   manager attributes the load to  the CPU load from that tab goes away for a   time.   </pre>
