<title>Issue 4654 -   chromium -    leak in global cached plugin data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5610">r5610</a>  I made a change to the cached plugin list for chromium bridge   refactoring  and introduced a leak.  Some filters were added to test_shell_tests.exe_MLK.txt to work around the leak for now  but the leak   itself should be fixed. </pre>
