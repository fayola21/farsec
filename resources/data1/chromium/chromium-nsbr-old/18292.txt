<title>Issue 18292 -   chromium -    Consider moving alt error page support to the ResourceDispatcherHost layer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Consider moving error page support to the ResourceDispatcherHost layer    There are loads of problems with the way error pages / alternate 404 pages   load today.  It might just make a lot more sense for them to be loaded as   alternate data provided at the ResourceDispatcherHost layer (in the form of   a custom ResourceHandler) before we even send any data to WebKit.    Some bugs this would resolve:  1- We'd no longer have to implement subtle behavior to get the page_id   advancement correct.  See all the delicate code related to setting the   'replace' flag correctly in render_view.cc.  2- We'd no longer get multiple start/stop loading notifications for page   transitions involving error pages.  3- We'd avoid subtle buffering of response data for alternate 404 pages.  4- Alternate error pages for post responses would work properly.    Concerns:  1- This would mean that alternate error pages load with the security origin   of the failed page.  This may actually be a good thing. </pre>
