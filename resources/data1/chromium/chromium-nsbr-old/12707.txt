<title>Issue 12707 -   chromium -    Pages are initially rendered with a small default tab contents size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Open a link in the background in a new tab  using cmd-click.  2.  Switch to that tab.      Tab contents paint nicely.      Noticeable flicker as the tab contents first show up at a reduced size   then resize to fit the window.  See attached image.   </pre>
