<title>Issue 21753 -   chromium -    One tab stopped receiving keyboard events - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.1    Other browsers tested: none    Bug: Some kind of interaction between Windows keyboard events and Chrome.      * Root cause might be a bug in Windows Vista  * Not easily reproducible... which is kind of good.  * Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab to switch back and forth between two pages.   At one point it seemed that Windows decided the Ctrl-key was constantly   held down  i.e. one ctrl key-up event was lost. Hitting Ctrl and Alt and   Shift once each separately didn't resolve the problem.    (The page that suffered this blocking is a login-protected webpage   containing two INPUT type=text  in turn contained in some TABLE/DIV   structures.) </pre>
