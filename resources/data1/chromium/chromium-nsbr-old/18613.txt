<title>Issue 18613 -   chromium -    Can't dynamically change favicon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Here's a site that shows a script that lets you change the favicon via   javascript:    <a href="http://www.ajaxify.com/run/favicon/scroll/">http://www.ajaxify.com/run/favicon/scroll/</a>    It works by editing the DOM to replace the existing &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot;   href=&quot;icon.ico&quot;&gt; (or add it if it's not present) with a new href= parameter.   It works in Firefox  but not in Chrome. Tested in Windows and Linux. </pre>
