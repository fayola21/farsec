<title>Issue 15730 -   chromium -    outdated comment in test_expectations.txt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/tools/layout_tests/test_expect">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/tools/layout_tests/test_expect</a>  ations.txt?view=markup&amp;pathrev=19462 there are comments      // Chrome does not support WebArchives (just like Safari for Windows)   // although we might eventually want to on Mac.    Both lines of that comment are outdated:    * Safari 4 for Windows does write and read WebArchive format  * Chromium/Chrome support for the format is equally desirable on Windows.    Suggestion: refer to   ssue 10395: 3 Failing Layout Tests    <a href="http://www.diigo.com/06fj6">http://www.diigo.com/06fj6</a> for a highlighted view of the comments. </pre>
