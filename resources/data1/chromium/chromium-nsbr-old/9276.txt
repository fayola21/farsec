<title>Issue 9276 -   chromium -    When chrome is running  FTM download speeds are slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Log into MSDN in IE and download something big  e.g. MSVC8.    File Transfer Manager (FTM) pops up to handle download.    Download speeds are high - 430-440K/sec    Start Chrome.    Notice your download speeds in FTM drop to 120K/sec.    Quit Chrome.    Notice your FTM speeds climb back up to high again.    In fact  all download speeds seem to be in the toilet on the dev   channel. Running Windows 7. </pre>
