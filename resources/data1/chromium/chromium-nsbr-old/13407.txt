<title>Issue 13407 -   chromium -    HTML5 Server Sent Event - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please include HTML5 Server sent Event. I am wondering that google chrome should lead as   example for implementing the most of the HTML5 elements and functionalities. In Google IO    including CEO was telling that HTML5 would make web going but I am wondering chrome is still   playing catch up with Firefox and opera. </pre>
