<title>Issue 14033 -   chromium -    CSS text color with alpha make scrolling slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.1 (Official Build 18142)  URLs (if applicable) : (example) <a href="http://24ways.org/">http://24ways.org/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK (css alpha property is ignored)           IE 8: OK (css alpha property is ignored)      1. Browse to indicated url  2. Scroll  with either keyboard page up/down  key up/down or via mouse   wheel.  3. Notice lag.        Scrolling to be relatively smooth.      There is a long lag between the command and the result. During this time    cpu usage spikes.      Other info:  This appears to be a redrawing problem  as when the window size is smaller   (for example just a thin column)  the lag is much smaller.    Intrigued  I saved the page locally  and removed portions of the page until   the behaviour was no longer noticed. It appears to stem from the css line   color: rgba(228  229  235  .75);  The test-case is attached. Commenting out that line in the css makes the   page scroll much faster.    Thanks for a wonderful browser!   </pre>
