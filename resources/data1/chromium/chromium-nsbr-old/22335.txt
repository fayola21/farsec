<title>Issue 22335 -   chromium -    Chrome with  --enable-sync crashes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.2      Clicking a shortcut with the --enable-sync add-on.      Google chrome should open and synchronize with Google Docs.      A text box saying 'Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now?' appears.   Pressing the 'OK' button opens the same text box. 'Cancel' closes the text   box without launching Chrome.    I'm using windows 7 Ultimate RC (Build 7100).  Removing the  --enable-sync add-on solves the problem.  Chrome was working normally earlier today  so I suspect it has something to   do with the latest version upgrade.  After Chrome has been opened (I opened an Incognito window  and from there   a new regular window)  the shortcut works fine  but opens a window that   doesn't sync with Google Docs.    Thanks   Yuval. </pre>
