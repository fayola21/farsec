<title>Issue 12864 -   chromium -    GTK: don't animate more than one Info bar at a time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We can show more than one info bar at a time (try doing a first run of  chrome and then going to &quot;c&quot;)  but we shouldn't show more than one animate  at a time beacuse when one is closing while another is opening it looks  kinda ghetto. Windows waits for the one to close before the other one  opens  we should do the same. </pre>
