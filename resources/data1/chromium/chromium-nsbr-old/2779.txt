<title>Issue 2779 -   chromium -    Add a Hebrew spell checker to Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1285084&gt;    Currently  Chrome does not have a Hebrew spell checker because of an  inherent WebKit problem which causes the red lines under misspelled Hebrew  words to be positioned incorrectly (see &lt;b1252241&gt;).    Once the WebKit issue is fixed  the Hebrew spell checker should be added  back to the list of Chrome spell checkers.    </pre>
