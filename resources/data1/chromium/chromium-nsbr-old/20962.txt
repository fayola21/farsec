<title>Issue 20962 -   chromium -    Images on Flickr not clickable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.0    OS version               : 10.5.8  10.6.0  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine      1. Go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=kittens&amp;z=t">http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=kittens&amp;z=t</a>        The small thumbnails should be clickable.        They are not.    Works fine in Safari. Switching to &quot;medium&quot; thumbnails makes it work in   chrome too.    Oh  looks like it's broken on linux and windows too. Probably a webkit   regression. I'll file anyway  so that it doesn't get lost.    (#webkit says it's broken in a recent webkit build too. They point out that   clicking in the lowest 20% of the image works). </pre>
