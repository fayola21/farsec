<title>Issue 2754 -   chromium -    Apps/Open Browser Window should honor &quot;On Startup&quot; settings  If no browser window is opened (?). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Precondition:  -Make sure you setup some webpage(s) to open on Startup.    -Open a App window (Assuming you don't have a Chrome browser window opened)  -Select &quot;Open Browser Window&quot; from the drop-down list.    Expected:  The Browser window should be opened with &quot;On Startup&quot; settings  incase if   there is no browser window exists.    Result:  Browser window is open with [New Tab] always.    I know  we open a [New Tab] in existing Browser window. BUT  if there is   no Browser window opened  then we should honor the &quot;On Startup&quot; settings.     </pre>
