<title>Issue 609 -   chromium -    Firefox (cpu/core) affinity affects Chrome's playback (flash) performance. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. (Dual Core CPU) Firefox 3 and Chrome both opened.  2.  Loading some videos (flash) in Chrome...  3.  ...and then setting Firefox 3 in the Task manager to a single processor   (affinity) makes videos in Chrome unplayable...      Videos in Chrome should play the same or better (as there's a core that the   other browser isn't using at all)      Videos in Chrome become unwatchable... maybe other shared plugins may behave   the same.    Please provide
