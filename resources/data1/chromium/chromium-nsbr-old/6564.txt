<title>Issue 6564 -   chromium -    Google Chrome sends HTTP GET for CGI instead of HTTP POST (POST is reset)  values of CGI variables aren't passed to web server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43                     IE 7: OK        Here is the web page I'm using to test:    &lt;HTML&gt;      &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Your Name&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;      &lt;BODY&gt;      &lt;FORM action=/cgi-bin/hello method=post&gt;   &lt;P&gt;Your Name: &lt;INPUT name=Your_Name&gt;&lt;/P&gt;   &lt;P&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;cgi-bin/hello&quot;&gt;&lt;INPUT name=submit type=submit   value=Submit&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;INPUT name=B2 type=reset value=Reset&gt;&lt;/P&gt;   &lt;/FORM&gt;      &lt;/BODY&gt;   &lt;/HTML&gt;    It is a CGI form. Here are the steps I follow to test:    1. browse to the page (I have a server attached on the same link as my   Google Chrome browser which serves up the above page  it also implements   the server CGI processing)    2. enter your name in the &quot;Your Name&quot; field    3. click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button        I expect to see Google Chrome send the HTTP POST to my web server  which   then retrieves the value of the &quot;name&quot; variable from the posted form and   uses it to generate a response page that says &quot;Hello &lt;Your Name&gt;&quot; where   &quot;&lt;Your Name&gt;&quot; is replaced by whatever you entered in the form &quot;Your Name&quot;   field.        Google Chrome does send the valid HTTP POST  but then immediately follows   this with sending a TCP reset for that session  then Chrome does a HTTP GET   for /cgi-bin/hello (using a different TCP session) which of course doesn't   include the form variables and values since it is no longer a CGI request.   So  my web server cannot retrieve the value of the &quot;name&quot; variable from the   posted form.    You can see this behavior in the attached Wireshark packet capture   &quot;chromeBug.pcap&quot;  packet #5 is the valid HTTP POST for /cgi-bin/hello that   Google Chrome sends to my web server and you can see that Chrome   immediately sends a TCP reset after this HTTP POST  and then sends a HTTP   GET for /cgi-bin/hello (on a different TCP session  the TCP source port# is   different). </pre>
