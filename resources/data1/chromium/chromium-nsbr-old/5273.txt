<title>Issue 5273 -   chromium -    Search results item in left tree of bookmark manager is a little confusing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I've not searched for anything it's a bit confusing that when i click on   the search result item in the left list there's nothing in the view. Maybe   some default text saying &quot;Type some search terms&quot; or something to explain    or only show the results item when there are results. </pre>
