<title>Issue 17097 -   chromium -    Review CHECKED_RETURN defects reported by Coverity in Webkit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Review CHECKED_RETURN defects reported by Coverity in Webkit code base.    1. Go to Coverity Prevent web UI  following the instructions in   <a href="http://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChromeCoverity">http://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChromeCoverity</a>    2. Select the reports of latest run  then choose CHECKED_RETURN and review   only the defects in Webkit code base. Defects for Chromium and other third   party code are filed in separate bugs.     3. Update the classification and Severity fields as follows after reviewing   the defects:    - Classification = Bug  Action = Fix or Ignore: real bug. Fix it if in   chrome or webkit codebase. If the defect is in other third party code    evaluate its Severity and take actions accordingly. Either fix it or   ignore.    - Classification = Intentional  Action = Ignore: the code is correct and   the behavior is intended.    - Classification = False  Action = Fix: false positive  the code is   correct. However we can make suitable change to remove the defect.    - Classification = Uninspected  Action = Ignore: the defect is in out dated   source file and no longer exists  or the defect is in system files.    4. When fixing a serious defect  consider filing a separate bug report for   the defect. If you suspect the defect could be a security vulnerability    please have the security team review the defect before filing a bug report.   For trivial defects  you can just use this bug report. </pre>
