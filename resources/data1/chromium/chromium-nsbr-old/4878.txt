<title>Issue 4878 -   chromium -    Top of screen detached tab drop target interferes with tab drag &amp;amp; drop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Move a window with multiple tabs near the top of the screen.  2. Detach a tab  then try and drop it back in a location in the tabstrip   near the center of the screen.        Expected: Can easily drop into the tabstrip at that point.  Actual: Maximized drop target window appears instead  so I have to drop the   tab somewhere else in the tabstrip.    Suggested fix: The drop target window for the top of the screen should not   appear if the mouse pointer is over the tabstrip of a browser window. </pre>
