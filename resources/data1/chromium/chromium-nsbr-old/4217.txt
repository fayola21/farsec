<title>Issue 4217 -   chromium -    Paint Issues with Browser Window  if Taskbar autohide is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.3.154.12 (Official Build 4978)  I'm filing this as a separate bug  even though this behavior is covered by  the <a title="Paint issue with Browser window in maximized state." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3595"> issue 3595 </a> (not sure it is the same or different issue)  as it  reproduces even in XP/SP3 too.      [Same repro steps as <a title="Chrome windows hide autohide taskbars" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20"> issue 20 </a> (see my comments over there)]  -Launch Chorme browser window (with MagicBrowzr) 'n' maximize it.  -Right click on Taskbar and select properties.  -Check &quot;Auto-hide&quot; the taskbar to ON and apply changes  -Click on Chrome Button on Taskbar.  -Un-maximize and maximize the Chrome Browser window.    Browser window borders are not painted properly.    See the attached screenshot.   </pre>
