<title>Issue 940 -   chromium -    Duplicate recent bookmarks in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.151.0 (Developer Build 1698)             Safari 3: NA      Firefox 3: NA           IE 7: NA      1. Browse around for a while to a few sites and add a few bookmarks.  2. Open a new tab.  3. In the new tab  edit a bookmark (Always show bookmarks off  on might   also be affected but didn't test).  The change can be something simple like   a name change.  4. Recent bookmark entries should be duplicated.      Recent bookmark entries should not be affected by editing an existing   bookmark.      Duplicate (and sometimes old) entries appear in the Recent Bookmarks   column.   </pre>
