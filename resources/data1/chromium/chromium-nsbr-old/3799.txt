Open EUC-JP_bad.html (w/ broken char) or EUC-JP_JISX0212.html (w/ JIS X   0212 char). (attached)    ### PROBLEM ###  Chrome considers the pages as Shift_JIS encoded. Enabling Auto-detect   doesn't help.  Even the user-specified default encoding is ignored.

Repro on Chrome 0.3.154.8 on Windows XP SP2 En (System &amp; User locale = Ja).  Not repro on IE8 beta2 and Firefox 3.0.3.    c.f  This problem was reporeted as Japanese U2U:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-help-jp-report-a-">http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-help-jp-report-a-</a>  bug/msg/9f69b7d950f70cf7 </pre>
