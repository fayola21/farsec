<title>Issue 16232 -   chromium -    Reenable download shelf for themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It turns out a lot of themes are going to be 1MB  so we need to show progress. For now  we can just   use the download shelf.    Bonus points for not showing for small-size themes (if we know the size ahead of time)  and for   autohiding on apply if the shelf would otherwise be empty.    I haven't looked at the code yet  but pointers (paul?) would be appreciated. </pre>
