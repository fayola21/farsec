<title>Issue 21739 -   chromium -    Pause button stays when &lt;audio&gt; hits end - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner</a> and click &quot;play&quot;   on one of the media files (right hand side of screen). Notice that when the   file hits the end  the &quot;pause&quot; button stays a &quot;pause&quot; button rather than   turning into &quot;play&quot;. This seems kinda broken. (I would expect the slider to   return to the beginning and the button to turn to &quot;play&quot;). </pre>
