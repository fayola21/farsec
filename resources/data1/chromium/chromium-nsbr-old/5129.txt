<title>Issue 5129 -   chromium -    Cursor blinking at beginning of address if browser set to start with about:blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Set your startup page to about:blank (using any mechanism you wish) and   restart.  Note how the cursor is in the address bar and blinking  at the   beginning of the address.  If you hit Go  the address disappears entirely   (which I think is what we intended?). </pre>
