<title>Issue 10584 -   chromium -    SB Bloom filter false positive rate too high - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SB bloom filter false positive rate is too high. Something like 90 false   positive hits in the bloom filter for every 1 true positive. If this rolls   out to stable it will put a very high QPS on gethash service. This false   positive rate needs to drop ~10x.    Paul is already talking with Garrett and SB team  filing this mostly as   tracking bug for release planning purposes. </pre>
