<title>Issue 6773 -   chromium -    window.close() should only work if opened via script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example:  <a href="http://ponderer.org/tests/close-self.html">http://ponderer.org/tests/close-self.html</a>    If you open the above using middle click  in FF and IE  the window does not  close itself.  In Safari and Chrome  it does close itself.    WebKit allows window.close if the window was &quot;opened by DOM&quot; or if the page  has no other entries in history.  The second case (no other entries in  history) seems like an old behavior from an earlier spec.  Firefox and IE  don't handle the second case (try opening close-self.html in a new tab and  closing the window).  However  it seems pretty harmless to have that case  and is very hard for us to trigger in chrome because the new tab page  creates a history entry.    In addition to the &quot;no other entries in history&quot; case  the definition of  &quot;opened by DOM&quot; seems a little broken.  It treats links opened via middle  click as &quot;opened by DOM&quot;.  Firefox and IE do not.  Middle clicking on the  test case above should not close the window  but does in Safari and Chrome.    Both of the bugs (no other entries in history and middle click counting as  opened by DOM) are bugs in webcore and I think we should just file upstream  and get fixes from them or make patches upstream.  Neither seem to be a big  problem so I think we should just punt to future (and we get to stay more  compatible with safari). </pre>
