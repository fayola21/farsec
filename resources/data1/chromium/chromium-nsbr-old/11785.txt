<title>Issue 11785 -   chromium -    No way to disable tabs in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> No way to disable tabs in Chrome    I expect this is &quot;works as intended&quot;  but Glen should make that call  not I. :)    We had dinner with an IE to Chrome switcher last night.  His primary  complaint was that Chrome had no way to disable the default &quot;open in a new  tab&quot; behavior.  He said he always uses windows (so that he can see the full  title in the title bar  and use the task bar for switching between pages).    He said a very common setup for him is to open a bunch of news articles in  windows behind the current one and come back and read them later.    Chrome does not support the &quot;IE user used to using windows instead of tabs&quot;  use case particularly well.  But then again  maybe that's intentional. </pre>
