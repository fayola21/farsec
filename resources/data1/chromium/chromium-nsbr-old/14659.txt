<title>Issue 14659 -   chromium -    [Mac download shelf] No download items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the shelf uses popup buttons for the download items. There should   be a DownloadItem.xib file with a real download item (with progress report    status text  icon  etc)  a download_item_controller that manages the nib  and   download_item_mac should just be a dumb bridge that forward everything to   the controller. </pre>
