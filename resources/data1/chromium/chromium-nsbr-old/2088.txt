<title>Issue 2088 -   chromium -    Closing Browser dos not logoff user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't think it is a good idea that Chrome &quot;somehow&quot; remembers the login   credentials.   Is this related to not having &quot;Session only&quot; cookies?  I   don't see the option.     In any case  if a user closes the browser  Chrome should not (or at least   make it an option) remember the sign in state when it is restarted.  This   exposes a desktop security issue. </pre>
