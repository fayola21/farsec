<title>Issue 22136 -   chromium -    urls coming from other apps should raise an existing tab before reopening - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   0. Make chrome your default browser  1. send yourself <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> via aim  irc  etc.  2. click on the link within the other app  3. open a new tab and load <a href="http://dev.chromium.org">http://dev.chromium.org</a>  4. go back to the other app and click on the link again        Camino does this  and I really like it.  The second click on google.com in   the other app  does not open yet another tab  instead it causes the app to   raise and focus the tab already open on the requested url.  This is really   useful when the page loads slow and/or is a youtube video.  you don't   really need two full copies  going  you're just trying to get back to the thing   you already have open and don't want to go hunting for it. </pre>
