<title>Issue 8235 -   chromium -    Implement info bubble and bookmark bubble for GTK. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Info bubbles are the little guys you get when during first run  when you   add a bookmark (the bookmark bubble)  when you hover over an SSL lock icon    etc.    We need to implement this popup for Gtk.    This is probably not a P1 since the browser would be usable without it  but   it makes sense to implement this while I'm doing the location bar and   omnibox. </pre>
