<title>Issue 19222 -   chromium -    Make sure uninstalling Chrome for one user doesn't delete default browser entries for another user. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="When Google Chrome is default browser on two accounts on Vista  unable to use on second" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3641"> issue 3641 </a> that started all this.    Now users can set their individual Chrome installation as default but if   one user uninstalls Chrome  we delete all the default browser entries. </pre>
