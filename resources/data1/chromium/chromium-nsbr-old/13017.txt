<title>Issue 13017 -   chromium -    Window resizes beyond dock  unlike other applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STEPS TO REPRODUCE  1. Ensure your dock is visible and not auto-hiding. Make it have big icons   to make this easier to test.  2. Open a new window.  3. Position the window at the top left of the screen.  4. Drag the resizing widget to the bottom right of the screen.    EXPECTED RESULTS  It should stop growing vertically when it hits the dock. That is  at least  the   behaviour in Safari  when the window is at the top of the screen. (It isn't   the behaviour when it's not at the top of the screen.)    ACTUAL RESULTS  You can resize the window to fit the whole screen. </pre>
