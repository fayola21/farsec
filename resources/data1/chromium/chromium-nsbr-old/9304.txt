<title>Issue 9304 -   chromium -    Should distinguish Traditional Chinese Taiwan and Hongkong in accept-language selection list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a regression  happens on all Chrome channels and Chromium trunk   build.    Build: 2.0.172.0 (Developer Build 12458)     OS: Any    Other Browsers:        Safari4: N/A   Firefox3.0.7: OK            IE8: OK    Steps:  1. Launch Chrome  2. Go to &quot;Chromium Options -&gt; Minor Tweaks -&gt; Change font and language   settings -&gt; Languages&quot;  3. Click &quot;Add&quot; button  4. Observe     Result:  We have Chinese (Traditional Han)option in the &quot;Languages&quot; drop down list    but it is actually for Chinese Taiwan    Expected:  We need Traditional Chinese for both Taiwan and Hongkong    Notes:  1. I think a lot of websites have both Taiwan version and Hongkong version   (Such as facebook.com)  so we should distinguish them at our accept-  language selection list  2. As Jungshik mentioned in b/1174424  we are actually also missing es-Foo    fr-Foo  en-Foo and ar-Foo   3. We are also missing the native names for the languages which Chrome are   not localized to     </pre>
