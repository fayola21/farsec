<title>Issue 15908 -   chromium -    Sluggish scrolling on Facebook when zoomed in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Facebook (test with the page showing all your friends feed)  2. Scroll using the mouse and note how quickly the thumb follows your mouse  3. Zoom in once  4. Repeat steps 2-4 until full zoom is reached.    I tried this on two Thinkpad laptops and the results were very similar.    On zoom level 0 (no zoom) the scrolling is responsive.  On zoom level 1 the scrolling becomes choppy and it feels janky (scroll thumb   takes some time to find its right position).  From this point on  as you zoom in more the scrolling becomes *less* janky.    On one laptop  it felt normal again on zoom level 2 while on the other laptop   it was still janky on level 2 but felt normal on level 3.   </pre>
