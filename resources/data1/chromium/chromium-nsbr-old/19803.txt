<title>Issue 19803 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot; to context menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202  OS version               : 10.58  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): hitting the correct command key   will either open up a tool tip floating window with the definition of the   word or will open up the Dictionary.app and look up the word there.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): firefox doesn't support this  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: this feature is not yet implemented      1. open a web page  2. hit the key combination to look up a word  3. hover over the word  4. nothing happens :-(      Alternately  1. open a web page  2. select a word  3. right click  4. Option to look up the word not there!!! :-(      Look up the word in Dictionary.app or in a floating menu      Nothing    Really strange behavior:  All this DOES WORK but ONLY in the location bar (where it's totally   useless).   </pre>
