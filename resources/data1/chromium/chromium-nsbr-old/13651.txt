<title>Issue 13651 -   chromium -    Chrome dev chan  3.0.183.1  Vista SP1: 2 characters dropped from address bar when hitting enter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Not relevant      1. Entering a URL or search query in the address bar  2. Pressing enter      To reach the url  f.ex. www.foo.com or to search for the query  f.ex. foobar        Chrome drops the two last characters from the query  thus it becomes a search query   and I reach Google search page searching for the query &quot;www.foo.c&quot; or &quot;foob&quot;   respectively.    The issue occurs about 50% of the times a query is entered in the address bar. The   other 50%  it works as expected. </pre>
