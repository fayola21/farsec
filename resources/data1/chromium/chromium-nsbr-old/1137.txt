<title>Issue 1137 -   chromium -    Cannot import Opera bookmarks or generic bookmark html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  I can only import Firefox and Internet Explorer bookmarks    neither of which I use. The ability to import bookmarks straight from   Opera or from a generic html containing the bookmarks would be desirable    as Opera is capapble of exporting bookmarks to html. </pre>
