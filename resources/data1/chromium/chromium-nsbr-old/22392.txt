<title>Issue 22392 -   chromium -    Right clicking in text entry boxes auto-highlights word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Place the cursor in front of or within a string of characters  and right   click          There shouldn't be anything highlighted unless you drag the cursor or move   the cursor using the left/right arrow keys with the shift button pressed   across the characters to be highlighted.        The word just before or in which the cursor is in  is highlighted. This is   a major annoyance  because it makes it impossible to insert text into or   before a word by copy/cut and paste text into a text box without   overwriting the siring of characters the cursor is in. The only way to   avoid this is to insert space characters to separate the cursor from any   string of characters  paste the text  and then remove the space characters.   This is a major hassle in data entry to blogs  discussion forums etc.    <b>Please provide
