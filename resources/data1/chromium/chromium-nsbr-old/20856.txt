<title>Issue 20856 -   chromium -    Show multiple windows when dragging tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are times when you have a main window (maximized : window A) of chrome   open and you would like to drag a tab or two to a lesser window (one that is   not maximized  but is &quot;on top&quot; of A : window B).  However  when you try to   drag a tab from A to B  A takes focus and you can no longer see B and thus   complete the transfer.    Possible remedies would be to show all chrome windows (transparently?) or to   show the active windows (ex: if window A is maximized and window B is on top   of A but not maximized  then when dragging a tab from A to B  both are shown   even though A is maximized). </pre>
