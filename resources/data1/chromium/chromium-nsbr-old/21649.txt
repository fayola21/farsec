<title>Issue 21649 -   chromium -    tabs.captureVisibleTab is flakey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the test for captureVisibleTab in ExtensionApiTest.Tabs is currently   disabled.    It had failed in three ways:    1) The C++ side returned &quot;Internal error while trying to capture visible   region of the current tab&quot;    2) The capture of two different tab contents appeared to be identical.    3) The capture of the &quot;current&quot; window's visible tab appeared to be distinct   from an earlier capture of both windows.   </pre>
