<title>Issue 7967 -   chromium -    editing resources causes lots of stuff to compile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. edit an html file that is pulled into the build (like  chrome/browser/resources/about_credits.html)  2. recompile browser_resources.grd  3. build chrome_dll    In step 3  a bunch of files in browser.vcproj get rebuilt because  recompiling browser_resources.grd causes browser_resources.h to be regenerated.    Since only a resource changed  this shouldn't happen. </pre>
