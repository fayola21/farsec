<title>Issue 14369 -   chromium -    [www.epost.ca]: epost.ca displays &quot;not supported&quot; message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: www.epost.ca Browser: Chrome 3.0.187.1 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.187.1 Safari/531.0] What is wrong?      When I log into my account  it displays a message saying that &quot;Safari is   currently not supported&quot;.      What is the expected result?      ePost should identify Chrome correctly and no such warning message should   appear. I have not experienced any Chrome issues when looking into my   bills.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to www.epost.ca  2. Enter username &amp; password of your account  3. Click &quot;Sign In&quot;    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Works in Firefox.    Please provide any additional information below.    ePost is a popular website by Canada Post that delivers bills   electronically rather than through your regular mail.      </pre>
