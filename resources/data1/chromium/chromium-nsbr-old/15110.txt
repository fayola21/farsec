<title>Issue 15110 -   chromium -    back/forward button doesn't always paint active when the history menu is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> click on the back forward button and drag down quickly. The back/forward   menu will show but the button will paint normal (not depressed). Same for   right click. The only time it works is if you click and hold. </pre>
