<title>Issue 21912 -   chromium -    remove values from locale setting xtb files if they match the existing english value - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a script checked in for bulk edits to the locale settings   xtb files.  Possible operations:  - Add new value  - Edit all values for an existing ID    Probably should default to operating on all files but with a command line   flag to take locales. </pre>
