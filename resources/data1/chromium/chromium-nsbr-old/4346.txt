<title>Issue 4346 -   chromium -    The flash player plugin does not install when launched using Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome on a machine without Flash Player.  2. Navigate to a website which needs Flash like rediff.com  3. Attempt to install the plugin via the Install Plugin Infobar.    What is the expected output?   Expect to see Flash player install.    What do you see instead?  Nothing. If you look at TaskManager  we can see the   install_flash_player.exe running  but not doing anything.         </pre>
