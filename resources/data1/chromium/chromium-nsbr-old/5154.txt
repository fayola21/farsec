<title>Issue 5154 -   chromium -    Cannot see the entire &quot;Save or Cancel&quot; question when downloading a file (see attached image) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I am able to reproduce it  using a particular scenario. I don't know the   cause.  2. Have 3 or more URLs of files ready.   3. Use the wheel button in the mouse to open the URLs in a new tab  4. do step 3 for all URLs one after another without going to the newly   opened tabs after clicking each URL  5. Some tabs will show the entire &quot;save or cancel&quot;. other tabs  as if   interrupted by the other open tabs  will stop resizing the &quot;save or cancel&quot;   dialogue and only show half of it  and only showing a very small part of   the left side of the &quot;save&quot; button  and from this part to the right is not   visible. Cannot Cancel the download  since there is no button visible    While trying to have an image ready with the chromesetup.exe file I noticed   it only happens if the tabs operate in the background and once the first   url will show the dialogue  going to the next tabs will cause the resizing   defect      entire &quot;save or cancel&quot; dialogue will be resized according to the contents      dialogue gets cut (see attached image)      Please provide
