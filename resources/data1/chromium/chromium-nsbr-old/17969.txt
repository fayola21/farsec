<title>Issue 17969 -   chromium -    about:network should display the byte range for logged requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Adding Video since we're a big range request user.    about:network is pretty handy.  It can show us our requests being made in   real time!  Unfortunately there's no way to differentiate the requests since   they all show up as a URL.    It's a definite P3  but if it helps us debug and it's a quick change it might   be worth sneaking in. </pre>
