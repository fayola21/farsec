<title>Issue 3360 -   chromium -    additional tweaks to the about box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version: 0.3.154.2    A few additional tweaks are needed for the updated About box:    1. &quot;Google Chrome is made possible by the Google Chrome open source...&quot;   should read &quot;Google Chrome is made possible by the Chromium open source...&quot;    2. The second link in that sentence should be &quot;&lt;a&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;&quot;   Currently the word &quot;software&quot; isn't part of the link.    3. There shouldn't be a period at the end of &quot;Google Chrome Terms of   Service.&quot; Not a sentence    These need to be fixed before 154.x is promoted to the beta channel. </pre>
