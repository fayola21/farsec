<title>Issue 8273 -   chromium -    Clicking on top of &quot;x&quot; button of a Info bar/top-right corner of NTP  closes the browser window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10704)    This can be reproduced in two ways !!    -Have a info bar on a tab [including but not limited to Password bar.]  -Switch to full-screen mode.  -Click on just above the 'x' button of the info bar.    OR easily  #########  -Have NTP has keyboard focus.  -Switch to full-screen mode.  -Click on TOP-Right corner of the Screen.    The browser window closes.    I guess it is because the title bar is hidden in Full-Screen mode  that's  why clicking on top-right corner  closes the window (?).   In case  if it is working as intended  then I see inconsistent behavior  over here. As I mentioned  this behavior reproduces only with NTP or a tab  which has Info bar  BUT not with any other Webpages.     </pre>
