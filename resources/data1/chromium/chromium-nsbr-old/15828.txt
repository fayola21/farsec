<title>Issue 15828 -   chromium -    Full screen mode is inferior to Firefox's full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox has a blue bar across the top of the browser in full screen mode.   When the pointer is moved there  the address and tab bar appears. I would   greatly appreciate (and I'm sure a lot of people would too) if this feature   or something similar was added to enhance (or make) navigation possible and   full screen a feature to use. </pre>
