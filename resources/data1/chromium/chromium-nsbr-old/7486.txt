<title>Issue 7486 -   chromium -    Text area paint issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.48  URLs (if applicable) : See attached file            Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open attached file  2. type enough text to wrap to next line without mis spelling  3. See that the letters that are moved to the next line are not visible    Workaround is to mouse over or mouse out of the textarea    This issue is exactly the same as <a title="Paint bug while typing in textarea" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3656"> issue 3656 </a> but that was marked a   duplicate of 3811. The problem with 3811 is that it is marked as fixed  but   in my version it is not. After all this time (October  November  December    January  February) it ought to be fixed because it will frustrate users who   are not tech friendly. My opinion is that Chrome was supposed to work well   for those kind of people. </pre>
