<title>Issue 13426 -   chromium -    RTL: Deleting an RTL character in some cases also deletes the following space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.184.0 (Developer Build 17723)                         3.0.183.1         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    This is a long standing webkit bug  posted in July 2006  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10108">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10108</a>  with a non complete description.    Since it was up there for so long with no progress so it seems  i thought   maybe we should follow its status here too.      That old description is:  &quot;To reproduce this bug  open the attached test case and delete the Hebrew   letter _��_    either by selecting it or placing the caret after it (that is  to its left)   and pressing the delete key.    The space between the RTL run and the LTR run will be deleted.&quot;      This bug can occur involving an RTL and an LTR character like described in   that bug    ...but it can also occur with simple RTL text too  as long as the DIV is   multilined      See the attached test case describing both variations. </pre>
