<title>Issue 18078 -   chromium -    Chrome keeps showing &quot;Google Chrome did not shut down properly&quot; message  when quitting via dock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.1     OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Quits cleanly without message      1. I open Chrome  navigate to a web-site  then select quit by  right-clicking on Chrome's dock icon  and choosing Quit.      I don't expect a message saying &quot;Chrome didn't shut down correctly&quot;.      Chrome shows &quot;Google Chrome didn't shut down correctly&quot; message on next  startup  and will continue to do so if I quit via dock. To get rid of the  message  I have to close it  then select Quit from the menu-bar.    If I quit using the menu bar  I don't get the message. Also  I'm not sure  whether this error started when I removed Chrome using AppZapper  then  re-installed. </pre>
