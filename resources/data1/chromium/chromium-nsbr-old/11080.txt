<title>Issue 11080 -   chromium -    Linux: navigation / infobar jankiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the browser after it's crashed. You should see the restore session  infobar. If you navigate to another page  the infobar closes during the  navigation and you can see a grey area at the bottom of the render view  (because the backing store is only as big as the render view area minus the  infobar  and doesn't get updated during navigation). This looks pretty bad. </pre>
