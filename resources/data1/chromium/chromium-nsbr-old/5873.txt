<title>Issue 5873 -   chromium -    CRASH - Image Scroll Zoom In - DCHECK Failed RenderWidget::DidScrollRect chrome/renderer/render_widget.cc:546 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.155.0 (Developer Build 7349)  URLs (if applicable) : (any big image that scrollbars will appear)  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/60130main_image_feature_182_jwfull.jpg">http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/60130main_image_feature_182_jwfull.jpg</a>  Other browsers tested: OK      1. Visit an image url directly such as:  <a href="http://jext.free.fr/swingteam6.jpg">http://jext.free.fr/swingteam6.jpg</a>  2. You will see the image fit to the screen (lower resolution). Now click   on the image to see the real resolution  not the resized one.  3. Tab crashes.    NOTE: I enabled --enable-dcheck since pkasting recommended. And you might   have to click the image numerous times for it to crash. Or visit link  wait   3 sec  then click it to see the original size. It happens frequently and   this check is failing within render_widget.cc    // We only support scrolling along one axis at a time.  DCHECK((dx &amp;&amp; !dy) || (!dx &amp;&amp; dy));       </pre>
