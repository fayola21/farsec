<title>Issue 14078 -   chromium -    Chrome startup fails silently ( but not if you keep trying repeatedly). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.31                    1. Double click chrome shortcut to chrome.exe  2. It doesn't start  3. Clicking it repeatedly will open chrome  but only once.  4. Close the chrome window.  5. Click shortcut again.  6. It doesn't start  7. After 5 minz  not started.  8. Start clicking the shortcut again (in quicklaunhcbar) repeatedly and   keep clicking after the first chrome window opens.  9. This results in multiple chrome windows being opened until you stop   clicking.  10. There are multiple windows open  but not equal to the amount of clicks.    It looks like chrome startup is failing silently most of the time.    Is there a log to find which I could attach?    I think it started since installing RIA (for thwirl). Will try to temove it   and retry.     </pre>
