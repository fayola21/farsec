<title>Issue 18587 -   chromium -    Don't prompt to save for filetypes marked as auto-open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user selects &quot;prompt me where to save each file&quot;  we should still   ignore that for filetypes where the user has selected &quot;always open files of   this type&quot;  as that effectively means &quot;open/view instead of download&quot;.    Our current behavior prompts even though it's then going to auto-open  which   is annoying.
