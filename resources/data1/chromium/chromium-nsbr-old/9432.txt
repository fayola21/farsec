<title>Issue 9432 -   chromium -    Shouldn't be able to go back on first page load in a tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. open a new window  new tab page is loaded in tab  2. go to a url  say google.com  3. click back button    Expected results:    Well  for starters  back shouldn't be enabled. There's really nothing to go  back to. NTP isn't a destination that belongs in the session history. If we  really want to allow going back to NTP  then NTP should show up.    Actual results:    Goes back to a blank page  which I think is the lesser of all the possible  outcomes. </pre>
