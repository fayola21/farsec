<title>Issue 3573 -   chromium -    AutoUpdater for Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 0.3.155 (Build 3560)    Currently you need update Chromium manuell. In the About window Chromium   tells me it is up2date  but there is build 3600 available.     Please add an autoupdater or an half-autoupdater (chromium tells you there   is an updated and you can choose if you want to install it) too chromium     </pre>
