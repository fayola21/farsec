<title>Issue 17869 -   chromium -    Tab scrolling wraps around in GTK version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the Linux/GTK version of Chromium/Chrome  when scrolling the mouse wheel  over the tab bar  it will wrap around to the tab on the other side if you  scroll farther than the farthest tab to the right or left. The direction of  the scrolling is correct  but the wrap-around behavior is counter to the  behavior of other GTK applications. Most people who are used to GTK  applications feel they can &quot;hurl&quot; the mouse wheel to the bottom or top to  easily get to the farthest right or left tab.    To reproduce:  1. Open three or more tabs  2. Go to the farthest-right tab  3. Scroll the wheel down  and you are at the farthest-left tab now.     </pre>
