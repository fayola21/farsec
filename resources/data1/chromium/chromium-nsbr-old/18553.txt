<title>Issue 18553 -   chromium -    Navigating to page with plugin (including composing in Gmail) causes window to lose focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.198 (198.0)  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com  OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): window does not lose focus  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): window does not lose focus        1. Open Gmail inbox  2. Click &quot;Compose Mail&quot; (or hit 'c' on keyboard)      The compose mail screen should render (which it does) and the &quot;To&quot;   textarea should have focus (which it doesn't).        The &quot;To&quot; textarea does not have focus  but it seems to be because the   entire browser window does not have focus.  Clicking somewhere in the   page brings the browser focus back and the &quot;To&quot; textarea has the focus. </pre>
