<title>Issue 18509 -   chromium -    Automatically decompress and delete zip files on download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request for Chrome to handle zip files like Safari does -- download the file    decompress it  and then delete the zip file  leaving the contents of the zip file in the downloads   directory.    If this is not acceptable by default  maybe it can be configurable  but most of the time  the zip file is   just a container and you don't want to do anything but uncompress it. Put another way  we often   need zip files to work around the limitation of http that restricts you to downloading a single file at   once. So hide that from the user.    A further change is not just to put the content of the zip file in the downloads directory but to act   on it as if that file was downloaded without being embedded in a zip container. We need to decide   what to do if the zip file contains many files. </pre>
