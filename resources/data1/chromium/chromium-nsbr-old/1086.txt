<title>Issue 1086 -   chromium -    Limit Scope of Session Cookies (new tabs and windows) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Log in to a site/web application that uses a session cookie  2. Start a new tab or window and visit the same site/web application  3. The two web applications now interfere as they are being given the same   session cookie.        The two instances of the same web application should work independently and   session cookies should be deleted when a tab or window is closed.        If someone wants to log in more than once to a web application then they   can't. Also if someone fails to log out (but just closed the tab or   window)  someone else can become logged in by starting a new tab and   visiting the site: the session cookie is not destroyed when a tab or window   is closed and any tab or window can use it. Which is a privacy issue too.    Please provide
