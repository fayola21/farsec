<title>Issue 19323 -   chromium -    Investigate if HttpNetworkLayer::GetSession can do eager initialization - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a code review comment   &lt;<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/165430/diff/77/1067#newcode80&gt;:">http://codereview.chromium.org/165430/diff/77/1067#newcode80&gt;:</a>    &gt; This looks slightly odd to me.  It took me a second to realize you're  &gt; transferring ownership to HttpNetworkSession.  This seems necessary because  &gt; GetSession() instantiates HttpNetworkSession lazily.  Can we make it eager  &gt; instead of lazy?  Does that hurt startup or something?  It'd simply the code and  &gt; get rid of this memory transfer.  </pre>
