<title>Issue 13635 -   chromium -    Characters being omitted from end of omni-bar entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=17570">r17570</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu gHardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Metacity      Some things I type in the Omni-bar have characters omitted from the end   when I hit enter. I type fast  but not _that_ fast. One example that is   really consistent is &quot;approver&quot;  which is always stripped to &quot;approv&quot;   unless I wait a noticeable amount of time before pressing enter. Never   &quot;appro&quot;  never &quot;approve&quot;. It may just be because &quot;e&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are both on my   left hand.    If nobody else is seeing this  I can just retrain myself  but if it's   affecting others then it might be prudent to put in a delay or something. I   can definitely see that the &quot;er&quot; is going into the bar. I have had no such   problem in Firefox. </pre>
