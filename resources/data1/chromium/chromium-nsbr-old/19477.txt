<title>Issue 19477 -   chromium -    Would like to be able to play audio files at file:// URLs from extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using the audio tag to access file:// URLs is currently disallowed from   extensions  because it is also disallowed for normal web pages.    Some extensions have legitimate reasons to want to do this  though. Perhaps   it is something we should someday enable. </pre>
