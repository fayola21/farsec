<title>Issue 21609 -   chromium -    Chrome stopped working with 4.0.207.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0    OS version               : 10.6                                Browser worked fine up until a few hours ago.  Goes to web address but does  not display anything - blank browser screen.  I emptied the cache and  restarted  but still nothing.  I noticed chrome must have auto-updated to  4.0.207.0 this morning.  Chrome is unusable right now. </pre>
