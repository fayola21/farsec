<title>Issue 8988 -   chromium -    Keyboard focus is not transfered from flash to renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is broken long time back.  Reproduces on all channels.    -Play any embedded flash (for eg: from <a href="http://att.my.yahoo.com/">http://att.my.yahoo.com/</a>)  -Right click on flash and don't close the context menu  -[Left] Click on any empty area of the rendered page.    Expected: The page should gain keyboard access.    Result: The page does not  as a result  user can't execute any keyboard  shortcuts like Ctrl+t etc  but user can scroll the page.    Observation:  ############  In 0.3.154.8 (Official Build 3988)  the bug does not have repro steps but   we have a bug in that build: right-click context menu halts playing the  video and but sound is okey (continued.) I guess that fix regressed this bug ??     </pre>
