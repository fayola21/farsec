<title>Issue 18594 -   chromium -    Window loses activation on navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I do a search on Google and click a result link  the resulting navigation   causes the browser window to lose activation.    This does not always reproduce but happens often enough to be annoying. It   could be that the destination page has flash or something like that on it.    The window must be re-activated to continue use. Affects dogfood. </pre>
