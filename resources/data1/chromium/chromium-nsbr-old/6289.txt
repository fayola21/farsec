<title>Issue 6289 -   chromium -    Sirius.com: Embedded player does not function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Login to your Sirius account (I could Webex it for you)  2. Try to play any station on the embedded player  3. No output from player  4. I have attached a screen capture that also shows an incorrect rendering.      The media player should have audio output      While the page looks incorrect  the far bigger issue is that the media   player doesn't play.    Please provide
