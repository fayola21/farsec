<title>Issue 6889 -   chromium -    Support EV root CAs that have more than one EV policy OID. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In ev_root_ca_metadata.cc  the EVMetadata structure  is defined as follows:    // Raw metadata.  struct EVMetadata {    // The SHA-1 fingerprint of the root CA certificate  used as a unique    // identifier for a root CA certificate.    X509Certificate::Fingerprint fingerprint;      // The EV policy OID of the root CA.    // Note: a root CA may have multiple EV policies.  When that actually    // happens  we'll need to support that.    const char* policy_oid;  };    The policy_oid field allows only one EV policy OID  for each root CA.  We need to change it to support  EV root CAs that have more than one EV policy OID. </pre>
