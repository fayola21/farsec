<title>Issue 8094 -   chromium -    Page won't load pop-up window does not close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Windows XP had automatical system update and restarted itself. Google  chrome had several tabs open and was closed because of this automated restart.    When I started Chrome after the system restart  it gave the pop-up window  &quot;Page won't load&quot;. I have clicked both &quot;Cancel&quot; and &quot;Report bug&quot; several  times  but the window won't close.    I have both tried to enter URL and information to fields  and not entered.  No change.    I have killed the Chrome task from task manager and restarted it  no  change. The pop-up comes again.      Pop-up should go away after pressing Cancel.      Pop-up just comes back.    Please provide
