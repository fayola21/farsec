<title>Issue 4830 -   chromium -    [Alt+Shift+T]: Strange behavior with return key on Save As dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 154.25  I got this while using Chrome on Windows 7 OS  BUT of course  it reproduces  even in XP too.      1. Navigate to any webpage.  2. Alt+Shift+T on the browser window[to get keyboard access on toolbar]  3. Use arrow keys to go to menu: Page/Save Page as... and hit enter key to  select it.  4. Do tabbing to Save button on &quot;Save As&quot; dialog and hit return key.    What is the expected output?   The page should be saved  should show up in download shelf and also listed  in downloads page.      What do you see instead?  User is navigated to previous webpage and the page is not saved.    Not sure when it is broken  BUT works fine in 0.3.154.8(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=3988">r3988</a>). </pre>
