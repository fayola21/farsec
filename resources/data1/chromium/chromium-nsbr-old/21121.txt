<title>Issue 21121 -   chromium -    Collapse theme images into a single blob to load at startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To avoid doing disk seeks and opens  we should try to collapse the theme   images we need to load into a blob so it's a single contiguous disk operation   instead of many.  Note that the default theme is shipped as &quot;default.dll&quot; on   Windows so it gets this benefit for free.  Perhaps we should serve theme   downloads like this...
