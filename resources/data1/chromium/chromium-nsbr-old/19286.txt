<title>Issue 19286 -   chromium -    Verify SSL certificates ourselves in SSLClientSocketMac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the remaining work from <a title="Chromium not working on https sites with invalid certificates" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11983"> issue 11983 </a>.    SSLClientSocketMac is relying on SecureTransport to verify certificates. We   need to verify certificates ourselves so that we can check certificate   revocation (see <a title="[Mac] SSL: no interstitial warning message for revoked certificate " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13377"> issue 13377 </a>)  validate certificate policies (required for EV;   see <a title="Implement EV certificate verification for Mac." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10910"> issue 10910 </a>)  or get all the errors with a certificate (SecureTransport   reports only one error). </pre>
