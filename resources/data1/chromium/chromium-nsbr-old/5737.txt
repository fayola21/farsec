<title>Issue 5737 -   chromium -    RenderButton merge broke handful of layout tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Specifically:    LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/box-sizing/percentage-height.html = FAIL  LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/forms/001.html = FAIL  LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/forms/button-default-title.html = FAIL  LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/forms/control-clip.html = FAIL  LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-first-letter.html = FAIL  LINUX WIN : LayoutTests/fast/forms/select-baseline.html = FAIL    RenderButton::setupInnerStyle had:    if (true || ...)    the removal of true from the if block seems to have triggered the failures.    I suspect we should just rebaseline the tests  but I need to verify that   with Ojan  who originally had a TODO around removing this code. </pre>
