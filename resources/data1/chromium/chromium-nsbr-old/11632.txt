<title>Issue 11632 -   chromium -    [linux] Status bar renders when main window not on visible desktop. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.15057-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=15057">r15057</a>    When chrome loads a URL while I am on a different desktop (meta refresh    ajax load  etc)  the status bar still pops up as if the chrome window were   visible.    I believe that the status bar should not be shown if the window is not   mapped (in X11 terms). </pre>
