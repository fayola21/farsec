<title>Issue 8575 -   chromium -    Browser crash when renaming a bookmark (possibly anything involving EditFolderController) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1 From a fresh user data dir  add a bookmark Folder (I right-clicked on the   bookmarks bar and selected Add Folder)  and name it anything you like.    2 Then right click on that bookmark node and select Rename  and enter a new   name.    3 Close the browser.    Observe a browser crash in EditFolderController::ModelChanged (looks like   window_ has closed/been cleaned up but the EditFolderController has a   garbage pointer).     My hunch is this is due to <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/40192/patch/54/73">http://codereview.chromium.org/40192/patch/54/73</a>    I'm not sure what that change is about  but I'm thinking in this case the   crash occurs because we should have been deleted (and removed ourselves as   a BookmarkModel observer) before BookmarkModelBeingDeleted is fired; our   window_ is already closed. </pre>
