<title>Issue 16391 -   chromium -    Feature request: prevent two fast clicks on X tab button from closing previous tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested    Hi  I don't use mouse on my notebook  so sometimes to close a tab on Chrome  I do an unwanted action like two fast clicks on X button when closing a  tab. This action usually close the tab I wanted to close and the previous  one  that I wouldn't like to close.  Suggestion: If the user click two times on X tab button in a very short  period  I think Chrome could popup a window asking if the user really want  to close the previous tab too.    Obs: Please look the video uploaded to understand the reason of this  feature request     </pre>
