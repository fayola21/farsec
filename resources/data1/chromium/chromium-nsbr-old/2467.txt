<title>Issue 2467 -   chromium -    right click  view page info always grayed out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right clicking and choosing &quot;view page info&quot; is grayed out. This has the   net effect that there is no way to view the security status of a non-https   page. Right clicking and choosing &quot;view page info&quot; should bring up the same   dialog that you get when you click on the lock (if there were a lock   there). For HTTP pages  this would result in     :( no identity information  :( not encrypted  :) / :( have (not) visited before </pre>
