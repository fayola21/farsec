<title>Issue 8279 -   chromium -    image sprite rendering artefacts when using full page zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.166.1               IE 7: Doesn't support full page zoom       Safari 3: Doesn't support full page zoom      Firefox 3: FAIL        Opera 9: OK        The attached html creates two 16x16 DIVs and sets their background to the   center of the attached PNG with absolute positioning and using &quot;center&quot;   respectively. The PNG contains a red square with green border. At normal   zoom level only the red square is visible  but when zoomed in some pixels   from the surrounding green border appear.        The background image shouldn't contain green pixels.   </pre>
