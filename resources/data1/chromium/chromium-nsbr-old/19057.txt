<title>Issue 19057 -   chromium -    Middle click on custom frame lowers window but does not reassign focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Compare the way middle clicking the title bar works on kwin/metacity to on   the custom frame of Chrome. With Chrome  the window is lowered  but the   focus is not reassigned to the last-focused window (or  with focus-follows-  mouse  the window now under the mouse).
