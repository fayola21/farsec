<title>Issue 17427 -   chromium -    Incognito title of website in taskbar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :2.0.172.37        1. Chrome shows title in task bar of website even though in incognito mode.        When viewing websites in incognito mode one should be able to customize the   title of the window in the taskbar. So that instead of showing the website you   are in eg. Holiday in Italy. You should be able to set in preferences the title of   the window to always be a website you want it to show eg Reuters.    So in incognito mode  whilst you are actually at a website booking a surprise   holiday in Italy  the title of the window in the taskbar is actually showing   Reuters etc. So when you minimise the window you can't be found out  it will   show Reuters in the taskbar. </pre>
