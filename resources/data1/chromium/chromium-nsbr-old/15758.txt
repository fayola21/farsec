<title>Issue 15758 -   chromium -    Should track tab/browser shutdown time on perf dashboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  browser startup time is tracked on the buildbots  but tab/browser   shutdown time is not tracked.    If possible  we should track the browser shutdown time to watch for   regressions and push to improve the metric.  Per Darin  it would be nice to   measure shutdown when there are a lot of tabs loaded that have been swapped   out. </pre>
