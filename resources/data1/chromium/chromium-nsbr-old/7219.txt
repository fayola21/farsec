<title>Issue 7219 -   chromium -    CRichEditCtrl uses pointer instead of i-beam over selected text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b/1150337&gt;  Still reproduces in 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 8889)    Select the entire URL in Omnibox  mouse hover over the selected text.  Notice the mouse pointer is 'Normal Select' instead of 'Text Select'    Notice Mouse hover over un-selected text is always 'Text Select'    Note:  Mouse pointer is always 'Text select' in IE  FF  Safari  if text is  selected or un-selected.    Comments from mal  #################  This can sometimes be annoying. Firefox 3 gets this right: the cursor is  always an I-bar  and you can still drag the URL.    I think this might be the root cause  or possibly a dupe of bug 1067175: if  the cursor remained an I-bar over the selected text you would not get the  flicker described in that bug.   </pre>
