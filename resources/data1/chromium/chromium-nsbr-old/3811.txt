<title>Issue 3811 -   chromium -    First word after a line wrapping has its initial letters missing in Google's internal issue tracking database's text area. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using Google Chrome	0.3.154.6 (Official Build 3810).  I have only seen   this problem with the text field in Google's internal issue tracking   database.  I can't reproduce this problem with the text areas in the   Chromium issue tracking database or gmail.    To reproduce  edit an issue in Google's internal issue tracking database    and type a long line in the text area at the bottom of the page.  When the   line wraps  observe that the first letter(s) of the first word on the new   line are missing.  But if you do something to cause a redraw  those letters   will appear.    For example  if I type &quot;xxxx.....xxx&quot; to nearly fill up the line  and then   type &quot;abcd&quot;  the line wraps  and &quot;abcd&quot; gets moved to the second line  but   &quot;   d&quot; is shown:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     d    If I click the mouse in the text area to cause a redraw  &quot;abcd&quot; is shown   correctly:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  abcd    If I click the mouse after &quot;d&quot; and start the hit the Backspace button   several times  you will see some letters left behind on the second line   when the cursor moves to the end of the first line  for example    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ab  abc     </pre>
