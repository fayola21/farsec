<title>Issue 18850 -   chromium -    Login at wamu.com failing ever since 3.0.196.2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.197.11 (Official Build 22553)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.wamu.com">http://www.wamu.com</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Visit <a href="http://www.wamu.com">http://www.wamu.com</a>  2. Login with account.        Login succeeds.        Login fails.    Normally I wouldn't post a website problem here  but my tests show that   something specifically regarding the update since 3.0.196.2 has prevented   the login at wamu.com from succeeding.  Tests in Firefox and IE and Safari   all work.  Attempts in Chrome in versions prior to 3.0.196.2 worked fine.    As soon as 3.0.196.2 was introduced  providing successful credentials to   wamu.com all fail.  I admit that it's impossible to replicate the problem   without an existing wamu account  but hopefully there are some out there   who can reproduce this with their own accounts.  I would imagine that there   may be some Javascript changes which may have affected how some client-side   processing is handled before the form is submitted.  This is just a guess.    Otherwise  I do not have an easy way to test this without locking myself   out of my own account.    Any other wamu users experiencing this same problem only in Chrome after   3.0.196.2? </pre>
