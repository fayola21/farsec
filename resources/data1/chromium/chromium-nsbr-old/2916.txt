<title>Issue 2916 -   chromium -    use more specific accept-language header than just those in locale dlls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;b1192567&gt;    It would be nice if fr-CA users would send an accept-language header of  fr-CA fr-FR fr en-US en.  Currently  once you're using fr.dll  you end up  sending fr-FR fr en-US en.    We should probably prepend the machine's locale string to the  accept-language header if it doesn't match exactly.  This is a bit tricky  because fr-CA users should be able to not want this behavior (that is  it  should be possible to pick fr.dll and have it only send fr-FR).  One  possibility would be to only prepend if the user didn't explicitly pick a  language (no command line flag and no pref).  This has the downside of  being slightly confusing because there's no indication in the UI that this  is any different.   </pre>
