<title>Issue 14522 -   chromium -    [web.mac.com]: all media on page plays simultaneously instead of waiting to be manually started - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://web.mac.com/busbywilson/fabulous_boogie/Tracks.html">http://web.mac.com/busbywilson/fabulous_boogie/Tracks.html</a> Browser: Chrome 3.0.187.1 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.187.1 Safari/531.0] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?      When I go to this site  all of the audio files start playing at once on top   of each other and I have to manually stop them all to hear just one file.    It was such a bad experience I closed the whole page after 5 seconds.      What is the expected result?      Manually play one file at a time (this is what happens in FF3 with   QuickTime plugin).  Or  autostart one file.  Don't autostart all files!          What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://web.mac.com/busbywilson/fabulous_boogie/Tracks.html">http://web.mac.com/busbywilson/fabulous_boogie/Tracks.html</a> and let   the media autoplay (which was the default setting so far as I know)      Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    FF3    Please provide any additional information below.    Note that I initially did not have the quicktime plugin so it wouldn't play   on FF3 at all but did play in Chrome.  After getting the quicktime plugin    on FF3  the media of each song can be manually started.    On Chrome  they all start at once which is definitely not what I want.  Not   sure if the right thing will happen once now that the quicktime plugin is   installed (I can't restart my browser now to check)  but the default media   player needs to be fixed not to play multiple elements simultaneously to   make this page usable.    Screenshot shows the view upon loading the page and all the media is auto   playing.    Note that the main entry point to this site is   <a href="http://www.fabulousboogieboys.com/">http://www.fabulousboogieboys.com/</a> and not the link above. </pre>
