<title>Issue 3420 -   chromium -    WebView::MakeTextLarger/Smaller should do either full page zoom or text zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The layout test LayoutTests/fast/css/ignore-text-zoom.html calls eventSender.textZoomIn(). This is currently hooked up to our regular zoom   function which I just changed to do full page zoom.    textZoomIn() needs to actually just do text zoom and not full page zoom    regardless of what Chromium's default behavior is. This is not currently   supported by our glue layer.    The zoom functions in WebView should be renamed and changed so they can do   full page and text zoom optionally. </pre>
