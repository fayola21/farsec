<title>Issue 5826 -   chromium -    BSOD on vista triggered by Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: None      1. Boot up PC  (Windows Vista SP1  with ATI PCIe gfx)  2. Start Chrome and open 5-10 tabs  3. Use for ~1 hour (loading new pages  general browsing)        Continues browsing fine.      First  a chrome tab becomes &quot;slow&quot; - frequently it will freeze for 3-4   seconds before reacting.  During this time  CPU usage is low  however there   are many thousands of page faults per second for the main chrome browser   window process  although memory use by that tab is low.  The disk grinds   away so those page faults are coming from disk even though there is no   really significant memory pressure. (this machine has 1GB of ram  so it's a   bit tight  but chrome is usually the only running application)    Each time the freeze is for a longer period of time  until finally I get   &quot;page unresponsive&quot;  and prompted to kill the tab.  On choosing to kill the   tab  all/most tabs show the &quot;aw snap&quot; error  however clicking the refresh   button doesn't reload them - they stay stuck with &quot;waiting for cache&quot; in   the status bar.  Closing and re-opening chrome makes the tabs work again    but within just a few minutes the problems re-occur.    Often instead of just the tab freezing  the whole browser freezes  and   towards then end the whole system freezes (ie. caps lock lights don't work   and mouse doesn't move  so presumably interrupts aren't being processed)    If when the system is in this state it is left ~ 1 more minute  it reboots   with a stop error.  So far I have always seen one of two errors:  0x0000008e (KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M)  0x00000050 (PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON-PAGED_AREA)    unfortunately due to a bug in windows if two BSOD's happen in a row (with   no standard shutdown in between) it seems the event log doesn't get flushed   to disk properly so you loose the details of the first BSOD (it just shows   up as &quot;The description for Event ID 1001 from source Microsoft-Windows-WER-  SystemErrorReporting cannot be found. &quot;).    I've also got a full system memory dump I can upload if required.    I have tested that this does not occur with IE7  and also does not occur   when other programs are running  but not chrome.    This bug isn't fully re-producible.  It seems to occur fairly frequently on   this machine  (happened 3 times today)  but none of my other machines have   the same problem even with the same chrome version.    To eliminate other factors I ran a memory test  which came out clean.      As far as I can see there are two bugs:  something is causing chrome to require lots of pages which have been paged   out to disk  causing the tabs to freeze - seems like a memory leak    although none of the chrome processes have high memory use.    When the problem gets bad  it causes a BSOD  which no user-mode process   should be able to cause - I'm guessing that is a bug in a driver or   windows  but it's still only triggered by chrome. </pre>
