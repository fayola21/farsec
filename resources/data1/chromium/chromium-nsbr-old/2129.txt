<title>Issue 2129 -   chromium -    Url mouse-over tooltip slightly misplaced on multi-monitor configurations. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 0.2.149.29  Windows Vista SP1 (x86)  Two 1680x1050 screens side-by-side in multi-monitor configuration.    The URL tooltip that appears at the bottom-left when you mouse over a link   on a webpage is 1 pixel too far to the left when chrome is maximized on the   rightmost screen.    (Picture included  ignore gray line through the center  it is just to   illustrate where I cropped the image to make it non-huge) </pre>
