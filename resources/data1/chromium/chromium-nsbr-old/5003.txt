<title>Issue 5003 -   chromium -    copy/paste problem in google spreadsheets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So I don't lose track of this (from an email):    I have a spreadsheet where I am trying to copy and paste a cell with a   formula in it from one row to the next row down.  In chrome it puts the  value of the source cell two rows down as the value of the source cell (no   longer a formula).  In FF it copies the formula down one row and works as  expected.    --    It's not clear to me if this is a bug in Chromium or a bug in Spreadsheets.   </pre>
