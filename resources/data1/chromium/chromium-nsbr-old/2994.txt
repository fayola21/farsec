<title>Issue 2994 -   chromium -    Cookie view deletion is fragile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the current code  RemoveCookies will only work correctly if you call it   with indexes in reverse order  which the code does now.  This seems fragile   though  and should probably be moved to something better in the future.    Also  we call DoFilter() more than we have to  since we call it once for   each deletion when really we should just call it once after all deletions   are done. </pre>
