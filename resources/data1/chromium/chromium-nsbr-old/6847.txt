<title>Issue 6847 -   chromium -    Reduce the number of automatic refreshes we store in history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have 79 913 entries for buildbot in my visits table. I typically have the   two buildbot pages open all day and all night.    This is 55% of the visits table  or around 5MB on disk and memory while   running. We can do something where if the referrer is the same page  just   update the most recent visit with the new date. We should be sure to handle   redirects.    Most users won't be affected to the extent chrome-team members are. </pre>
