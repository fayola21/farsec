<title>Issue 7579 -   chromium -    Numbers and time formats on the history page for the Indian languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Perhaps  samples from <a href="http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/locexp">http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/locexp</a> are not  the latest.    We are using &quot;Short Time&quot; on history page  but for the newly added 8 Indian  languages  we are not consistent with ICU samples for some locales:    1. Some locales  ICU samples use locale specific numbers but we don't  2. Some locales  the 'Short Time' formats we are using don't match ICU       For issue 1:    Gujarati     OK  Kannada      OK  Malayalam    OK  Oriya        Fail  should use locale specific numbers  Telugu       OK  Bengali      Fail  should use locale specific numbers  Marathi      OK  Tamil        OK      For <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> issue 2 </a>:    Gujarati     We use am/pm  but ICU and windows samples use 24 hours format  Kannada      We use am/pm  but ICU and windows samples use 24 hours format  Malayalam    OK  Oriya        OK  Telugu       We use am/pm  but ICU and windows samples use 24 hours format  Bengali      ICU sample: ��__��_:��__��__��_ ��__�__��__��___��___��__��_��__��_ Chrome: 5:16 pm  Marathi      ICU sample: 17:51   Chrome: 5-51 pm                &gt;&gt;Noticed that the separator is also wrong  Tamil        We use am/pm  but ICU and windows samples use 24 hours format       </pre>
