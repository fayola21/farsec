<title>Issue 19146 -   chromium -    REQUEST: extensions to access chrome build number/version directly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.0 (Developer Build 23106)  URLs (if applicable) : about:version    I have made a quick extension that retrieves the latest build of chromium   from the buildbot. but I can't access the current build I am using  which I   would very much like to do.    So I feel that the retrieval of the Version/Build numbers of your chrome   should be integrated in so it can be directly accessed using Javscript. (Like   console.log(&quot;foobar&quot;) for example)   </pre>
