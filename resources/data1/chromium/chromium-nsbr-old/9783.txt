<title>Issue 9783 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Closed tabs not reloaded on restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.53      1. Set the startup behavior to &quot;restore last open tabs&quot;  2. Exit Chrome by closing the last tab  3. Restart Chrome      What I'd like to see is my homepage - if I've used the tab close button  it   means that I'm done with that tab.      The tab I explicitly closed reopens on restart.     </pre>
