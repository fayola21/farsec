<title>Issue 7794 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Invisible Flash videos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On b162  sometimes when I load a YouTube page the video will play (I'll get   audio)  but I see no video -- just an empty space in the page where I'd   expect the video.  If I reload  things work fine.  This has happened a half   dozen times today.    I don't have consistent repro steps.  I believe (but am not sure) that when   this happened to me before  I had just closed a YouTube tab and then almost   immediately opened a different one (by middle-clicking a link to a video   from another site).  So maybe there's some sort of teardown race? </pre>
