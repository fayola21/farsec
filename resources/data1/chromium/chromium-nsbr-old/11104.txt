<title>Issue 11104 -   chromium -    Chrome cut the URL after the first '&amp;' in HTML &lt;object&gt; - Element in the data atribute during dynamic reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.59           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK     Opera 9.64: OK      1. Create a Servlet that returns a HTML table which statistic data in the   response.  2. Create a JSF site wihich include an &lt;object&gt; element with an link to the   statistic servlet.   3. Include a button to refresh the &lt;object&gt; element with different link in   the data object.  4. loding an statistic element on loading the page  5. press the refreshbutton to update the statistic with another URL in the   &lt;object&gt; element data atribute.    I create a JSF site to display dynamic statistic tables in a HTML &lt;object&gt;   - Element. This elements can changed with parameters and must update the   statistic table with a changed URL in the data atribute ob the &lt;object&gt;   Element. All other browsers have no problems with this but the Google   Chrome browser cut the URL after the first '&amp;' character. The URL which   call the servlet is very short but it is sure that the Link is correct. but   the false URL is sending to the Servlet.  Here a Sample:  &lt;object data=&quot;http://x.x.x.x/StatisticServlet?para1=1&amp;para2=2&amp;para3=3    But the Servlet gets only the following link:    http://x.x.x.x/StatisticServlet?para1=1&amp;    The other patameters are lost.    But something is strage. If i press &quot;STRG + F5&quot; - the correct URL will be   send and the site shows the correct content. It must be a problem for   sending data with JSF Updates in the data atribute.     </pre>
