<title>Issue 6477 -   chromium -    Support modifier clicks on UI elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When clicking almost any piece of UI  we should support modifier keys.  For   example  if left-clicking the back button navigates the current tab back    middle-clicking it should open a new tab at that page.  Similarly for the   forward button  items in session history  reload button  and go button.  We   should plumb the click handlers on these through DispositionForAction() or   whatever the function is  rather than writing explicit middle-click   handlers or things like that  so that we consistently support ALL modifiers   (e.g. shift-click  alt-click  etc.). </pre>
