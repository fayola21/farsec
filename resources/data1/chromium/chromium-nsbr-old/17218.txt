<title>Issue 17218 -   chromium -    Shortcut Key Combination for Full Screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195  OS version               : 10.6      1.  Click on the View menu  2.  Look at shortcut combination for &quot;Full Screen&quot;      Command + Option (or Shift) + F      Command + F11.  No program on the Mac uses Command + a function key   as a shortcut.  While Firefox uses F11 for full screen  there is no reason to   copy this behavior for Chrome  since the exact same shortcut sequence   can't be used anyway (Expos��_��_ interference) and this defies conventions   established by other applications with a full screen option.  Furthermore   Command + F11 can't be typed with one hand.  A more natural   combination would be Command + Option + F (used for example in   iPhoto)  as this mimics behavior in other common applications on the Mac   OS. </pre>
