<title>Issue 13495 -   chromium -    &quot;Always on top&quot; with custom frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps:  1- Sometimes I'm on login gmail page  2- Before fill my login information I open a program like Google Earth or   Synaptic program on Linux  3- As this programs take some time to open I go to gmail page and fill my   login information. But before I complete it  appear the Google Earth screen   and stay on top of gmail page hiding the information I was typing.    Feature request:    I would like to see an option to Chrome not let programs stay on top of   Chrome window. Or at least when we are typing any information on Chrome   pages or address bar.    Obs: Maybe you could think that this feature is for window managers. But I   didn't see any that hide for example the Google Earth splash screen (look   the screenshot uploaded) </pre>
