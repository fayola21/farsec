We use &quot;Medium Date&quot; on the downloads page  but for Oriya locale  the date  format is not consistent with either ICU sample or windows sample.    Build: 2.0.160.1 (Developer Build 9392)    Steps:  1. Run Oriya Chrome  2. Download some file  3. Observe the date format on the downloads page    Result:  It shows 2009 2 12  no separator at all    Expected:  Use correct date format for Oriya     Notes:  For other Indian locales  the date formats are either consistent with  windows sample or ICU sample.         </pre>
