<title>Issue 7284 -   chromium -    Chrome source download issue from tarball. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download of chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9018">r9018</a>.tgz is restricted to less than 4 mb and the   unzip fails with bsdtar  7-zip and winzip. The tarball for chrome source is   messed up.          Based on <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code</a> I was   expecting that a large download would take place for chrome source.       however  the download ends after 3489KB.    Please provide
