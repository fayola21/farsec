<title>Issue 12760 -   chromium -    collect stats on first run dialog choices - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should collect stats (from users that opt in to stats collection) on how   users interact with the first run dialog. In particular  it would be good to   know what percentage of users click on the &quot;customize&quot; link and how many   toggle the &quot;default browser&quot; checkbox.    If they do visit the &quot;customize&quot; screen  do they end up importing bookmarks?   Setting shortcuts?   </pre>
