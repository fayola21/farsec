<title>Issue 15052 -   chromium -    repeated-firing-background-color failing in debug mode on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/transitions/repeated-firing-background-color.html    started failing in debug mode on mac after a V8 update.  It seems unrelated   and I cannot reproduce locally.  I will add it to the expected failures for   now and keep an eye on it. </pre>
