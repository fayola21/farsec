<title>Issue 12879 -   chromium -    Linux: render view context menu cursors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try this:    - right click on a link  - move your cursor over a blank part of the page  - hit escape (or click  but don't move the mouse)    What should happen:  - the link is no longer highlighted red  - the cursor changes to be appropriate to whatever is under it    What does happen:  - the link stays red  - the cursor is a hand    It seems that webkit doesn't know that the cursor has moved (after all  it  didn't get any mouse move events). We could fake a mouse move event when  the render view gains focus and the cursor is over the render view  but  this seems wrong  and from my testing with other browser and iGoogle eyes   that's not how they do it. </pre>
