<title>Issue 20391 -   chromium -    Impossiblity to access the main page after browser  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	2.0.172.43 (Build oficial )                         WebKit	530.5                         V8	1.1.10.15                         User Agent                              Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US)                              AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko)                              Chrome/2.0.172.43 Safari/530.5      There should be a button in the main bar in order to go back to the main   page when you have browsed far from it. Also note that opening a new tab   does not open the main page  but shows the most visited sites.      I had to create a bookmark to my main webpage in order to be able to return   to it as soon as I want. Unfortunately  the bookmarks bar occupies vertical   space that I only use for that link.   </pre>
