<title>Issue 2202 -   chromium -    Cannot paste into forms with right click without giving focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open any webpage with a textbox or form (single line  not textarea)  2. Copy some text from somewhere  3. Try to paste the text into the textbox or form with right clicking into   it.      When right clicked  the Paste (Ctrl+V) line should be enabled  so what's in   the clipboard can be pasted.      Paste option is seen as disabled. It becomes enabled only if: first  left   clicked inside the box  and then right clicked. This problem is not seen in   forms where there is a cursor blinking inside (e.g.  Google.com home page).
