<title>Issue 16459 -   chromium -    Make possible to restart crashed extensions from chrome://extensions/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a user closes the &quot;crashed extension&quot; infobar  it has later no way to  recover the crashed extension. chrome://extensions/ seems to be a place in  which extensions are manager  and I think we can add a &quot;restart&quot; button if  some extension has crashed. </pre>
