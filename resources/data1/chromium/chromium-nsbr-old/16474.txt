<title>Issue 16474 -   chromium -    Always use the native window border for app mode windows (including the web inspector) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.194.0 (Developer Build 20402)      1. start chromium with it's own build-in window deco  2. open the web inspector    I would expect the web inspector to have normal (native) window deco even if   the main browser window uses the custom deco. Other windows like options   also still use the native deco. I understand the the inspector window is   technically similar to the main browser window  however I don't see the   benefit of it not having native window deco.   </pre>
