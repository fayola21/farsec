<title>Issue 9075 -   chromium -    Pull-off tabs are too easy to pull off and rearrange - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.170.0    Immediately after I switched to the Dev channel earlier this week  I found   myself pulling off tabs when I meant to switch to them by clicking them.    IMHO  this is how it should work:    PULL OFF:  while mouse button is held after clicking a tab:   if there is vertical movement beyond the top and bottom of the tab greater   than 50% of the height of the tab:     if the mouse button is held for longer than two seconds AFTER they've   moved more than 50% of the height of the tab away       pull off tab     else keep tab in place   else keep tab in place    REARRANGE:  It seems to me that it currently works like this:    if a tab being dragged horizontally occludes &gt;= 50% of an adjacent tab:   swap the tabs    I propose this threshold be raised to &gt;= 75% of an adjacent tab. </pre>
