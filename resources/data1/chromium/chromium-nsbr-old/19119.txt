<title>Issue 19119 -   chromium -    Mac: cursor not updated correctly when switching from another application w/o mouse move - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 198.0 (Developer Build 22917)  OS version               : 10.5.7      1. Go to a web page  and put the mouse cursor over something where it'll   be something other than the normal pointer (e.g.  over text or over a link).  2. Switch to another app using Cmd-Tab (or using Spaces -- Ctrl-...).  3. Switch back using the same method (w/o moving the mouse).      The mouse cursor should be appropriate to whatever it's over (e.g.  pointy   hand or I-bar).      The mouse cursor is the standard arrow. </pre>
