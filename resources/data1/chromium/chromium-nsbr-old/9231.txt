<title>Issue 9231 -   chromium -    Implement restart-on-crash functionality on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  When the browser process crashes Chrome restarts itself and presents a &quot;Chrome has   crashed dialog box  do you want to restart Chrome?&quot;.    Do we want to provide a similar option on the Mac?    Should breakpad's reporter.app to provide an option to restart Chrome when it crashes?  If so    reporter would need to know whether it's handling a renderer or browser crash. </pre>
