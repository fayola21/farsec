<title>Issue 3150 -   chromium -    InspectorController ownership model should be the same in V8 and JSC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In V8 builds  InspectorController is RefCounted.  In JSC builds  it is held  by an OwnPtr.  This change was made in http://b/904340 to fix a crasher.   The different ownership models is very confusing (e.g.  see  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/6259/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/6259/show</a>) and can result in leaks.    We should revisit whether RefCounting is still necessary for V8 builds or  see if there's another work around for the crash.     </pre>
