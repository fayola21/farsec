<title>Issue 3697 -   chromium -    Adobe Reader integration is very slow/bogous when scrolling a PDF document - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2.149.30           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. open a PDF using the Adobe Acrobat Reader integration plugin  2. try scrolling it with the vertical scrollbar      Scrolling should be smooth  or should just take some fragments of seconds   to display the rest of the page      3. see how Chrome slows down dramatically  and stops responding when   scrolling the document.    Apparently the model of events assumed by Reader is not followed exactly    and this causes a deadlock between events and event returns. Who's bogous?   Adobe Reader or Chrome ?     </pre>
