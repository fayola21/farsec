<title>Issue 16100 -   chromium -    Zip file links work only if opened in a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.172.33  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://rrrola.wz.cz/downloads.html">http://rrrola.wz.cz/downloads.html</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Clicking on a picture linking to a zip file      Download window should open.      Download window doesn't open. But if opened in a new tab or if the address   of the file is written in the address bar  it works as expected.   </pre>
