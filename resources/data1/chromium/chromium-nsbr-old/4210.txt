<title>Issue 4210 -   chromium -    Report bug or broken website popped automatically making system unresponsive while launching Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tried to launch Chrome from shortcut and strangely &quot;Report bug or broken   website&quot; dialog popped up for New Tab along with Chrome. I could neither   send the report nor cancel it and also the dialogs kept popping and my   system was unresponsive. I had to finally kill the processes from Windows   Task Manager.    Google Chrome 0.3.154.12 (Official Build 4978)    Please see the screenshot     </pre>
