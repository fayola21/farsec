<title>Issue 3562 -   chromium -    Redraw issue/truncation with confirmation item on Download Bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 0.3.155.0 (Developer Build 3546)  URL:  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.3&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.3&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US</a>        Repro  -----  1. Download an .exe file in a tab (can use the above URL).  2. Resize the Chrome window  making it narrower  until the current download  confirmation item disappears.  3. Switch to another tab  then resize the window  widening it to its  original width.  4. Switch back to the tab with the downloads.    What is the expected output?     The download confirmation item should be properly redrawn on the Download Bar.    What do you see instead?    The download confirmation item is truncated.  When the Chrome  window is resized  it triggers a redraw  and the item is again displayed  properly.   </pre>
