<title>Issue 21080 -   chromium -    chromium doesn't honor locale fallbacks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0~svn20090903r25312dpkg -s chromium-browser&gt;  OS + version : Mandriva Linux Cooker  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit (using 32bit build)  window manager :GNOME        1.c            Chromium should honor locale fallbacks.    eg if the environmant variable LANGUAGE is set to &quot;br:fr_FR:fr&quot;  it should   fallback to french translation if breton doesn't exits.    Likewise if we have LANGUAGE=pt_PT:pt:pt_BR  it should try both brasilian   portuguese and portugal portuguese.    A lot of languages have such definition. For those  chromium currently   failed to display proper translations. It should split the LANGUAGE   environment variable on &quot;:&quot; and try every value until it founds out a   translation.        It fallback to english messages (aka C locale) instead of trying defined   fallback.    Using gettext would solve this problem automatically... </pre>
