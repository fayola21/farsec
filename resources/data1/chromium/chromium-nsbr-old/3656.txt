Navigate to this URL: http://b/editIssue?id=1442740  2. In the textarea for changing the bug  type &quot;xxx&quot; (see screenshot  step   1)  3. Click the beginning of the textarea and type &quot;yy&quot; to insert two   characters before the &quot;xxx&quot;.  (see screenshot  step 2)  4.

Note that now the &quot;yy&quot; has inserted before the &quot;xxx&quot;  showing   &quot;yyxxx&quot; as expected.  (see screenshot  step 3)     </pre>
