<title>Issue 11829 -   chromium -    Dragging newly created tab drags entire window along with it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a window with a single tab  2. Open a second tab  3. Drag second tab horizontally to the right so it doesn't break out into a  new window.    Expected:  Tab drags around  window stays stationary.    Actual:  Both tab and window drag  and the tab seems to move disproportionally to  the amount of horizontal movement of the mouse. It's t3h suck.    The weird thing that once you do it once  doing it again works fine. </pre>
