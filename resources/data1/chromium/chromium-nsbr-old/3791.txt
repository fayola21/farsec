<title>Issue 3791 -   chromium -    SavePageTest.* is crap - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The whole test set is flaky. Happens on slower machine in debug (often VMs but   not necessarily)    [ RUN      ] SavePageTest.SaveHTMLOnly  ....browserdownloadsave_page_uitest.cc:46: Failure  file_util::ContentsEqual(client_file  server_file_name) evaluates to false    where  client_file evaluates to C:DOCUME~1CHROME~1LOCALS~1Temp11467a.htm  server_file_name evaluates to C:bslavetry-win32-  8buildsrcchrometestdatasave_pagea.htm  [  FAILED  ] SavePageTest.SaveHTMLOnly    SavePageTest.SaveCompleteHTML and SavePageTest.NoSave are also known to be   flaky.    One idea:  If it is impossible to make this call synchronous (which it should be)  make the   test read the file on disk and loop until the content stops changing. There's a   win32 api to do that without looping. </pre>
