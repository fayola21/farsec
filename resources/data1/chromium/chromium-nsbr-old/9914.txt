<title>Issue 9914 -   chromium -    [linux] some keyboard accelerators lost - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Press ctrl+t 10 times really fast  You would expect to have 10 new tabs at this point  but often end up with  less than that.    This is probably because we're dropping some accelerators.  We first pass  accelerators to the current tab to handle the event.  If the tab doesn't  handle it  it sends back the event to the browser tab to handle.  There's a  bug in chrome/browser/tab_contents/web_contents_view_gtk.cc where if the  tab is no longer showing  we drop the event.    Windows just forwards the accelerator to whatever window is on top (which  may or may not be the window that previously owned the tab.  We should do  the same. </pre>
