<title>Issue 19215 -   chromium -    Google Spreadsheets  Gmail  etc. scrolling perf worse in WebKit than Gecko - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (1) Visit docs.google.com  (2) Create a new spreadsheet  (3) Hit the &quot;+&quot; button in the lower left and add 500 more rows  (4) Try to use the scrollbar on the right to scroll up and down.  Note   incredible sluggishness.  (5) Open same spreadsheet (or repeat same steps) in Firefox and notice   snappy performance.    Shrinking the window size doesn't ameliorate this problem  so it is not   (completely) an issue of not using optimized scrolling calls.    This occurs with any spreadsheet of even modest length.  It makes Google   Spreadsheets completely unusable for me.    CCing Darin in hopes he'll triage. </pre>
