<title>Issue 6429 -   chromium -    Chrome (WebKit) should handle window.location.reload() in a way that the user pressed the Reload button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://hacks.dlux.hu/testform.html">http://hacks.dlux.hu/testform.html</a>         firefox 3.0.5: OK  IE 6.0.2900.2180: OK      safari 3.2.1: FAIL      1. Load the form to the browser. This generates a GET request.  2. Write something to the text box and submit it. This generates a POST  request.  3. Try the &quot;Reload 1&quot; (windows.location.reload()) link. This should  generate a POST request  but in Chrome (and in Safari) it generates a GET  one. In FF and IE  it generates a POST request as expected.        window.location.reload() generates POST request.        Generates a GET request.    More info:    &quot;Reload 2&quot; link is there to compare the behaviour with history.go(0). You  can just safely ignore it. </pre>
