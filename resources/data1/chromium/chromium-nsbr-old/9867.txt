<title>Issue 9867 -   chromium -    Activating the previous/next buttons with the keyboard in the find bar should not change the focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open a page with some text  2. CTRL-F to bring the find bar  type &quot;e&quot; to have matches  3. Tab to focus the next button  press space    Expected:  The find highlight moves to the next &quot;e&quot;  the next button stays focused    Actual:  The find highlighting moves correctly but the focus is restored to the find   bar text-field    Notes:  In find_bar_view.cc  we are focus the find-bar text-field explicitly   everytime a button is pressed. We should augment the views::ButtonListener::ButtonPressed to also specify the origin (mouse   click or keyboard) so we could only restore the focus to the text-field on   clicks. May be we should pass the event to the callback? </pre>
