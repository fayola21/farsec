<title>Issue 4895 -   chromium -    Not excacly bug  but a question - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi.    I just wondered if you have plans in the future to put in a Google search-  bar in the &quot;New Tab&quot; function (ctrl+t). This is something I have missed for   some time. Now I have to go to other pages or write in the address before I   can search. Maybe I am just lazy  but I bet you can understand what I mean.    Just a question I hope you can answer.  Have a nice day!   </pre>
