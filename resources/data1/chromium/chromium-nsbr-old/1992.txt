<title>Issue 1992 -   chromium -    Regression: Chrome doesn't honor &quot;automatic configuration script&quot; settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome and go to Wrench menu &gt; Options &gt; Under the hood &gt; Change  Proxy Settings  2. In Internet options dialog  go to Connections tab &gt; LAN Settings and  check the option &quot;Use automatic configuration script&quot;  3. Give the location of the .pac file (Make sure that you use a proxy that  needs authentication)    What is the expected output?   Chrome should honor the rules set in the .pac file    What do you see instead?  Chrome doesn't seem to use the rules set in .pac file.       This works fine in 149.29. For 151.0_r1720  it doesn't ask for any  authentication. Looks like it's ignoring that option and is connecting  directly!!!      </pre>
