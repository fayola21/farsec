<title>Issue 3022 -   chromium -    Wrong icon &amp; behavior when about: page dragged from History or Bookmarks onto Desktop   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.2.153.1 (Official Build 2519)  OS: any    Preconditions:    1. Default browser set to Chrome.  2. Have an about: page in History or in Bookmarks .... (I used about:version).    Repro:  ---------  1. Drag about:version link from history or bookmarks  drop on the desktop.      What is the expected output?     The Chrome icon should be dropped on the desktop. When the icon is  double-clicked  the associated page should be opened in Chrome.      What do you see instead?    The IE icon is dropped on the desktop. Also  if the icon is double-clicked   IE (not Chrome) is opened.  This happens even if Chrome is the default browser.    Note also that ordinary (i.e.  not about:xxx) web pages dropped on the  desktop have the Chrome desktop icon  and open in Chrome when double-clicked.   </pre>
