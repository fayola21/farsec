<title>Issue 774 -   chromium -    Need option to automatically switch to new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27 (1583)  URLs (if applicable) : all         Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Currently  Ctrl+click opens link in a new tab but keeps the focus on the   currently open tab; and Ctrl+Shift+click opens link in a new tab and   switches focus to the new tab.  2. Need a configuration option for a user to select this behavior: whether   or not to automatically switch (focus) to the newly created tab.              The configuration option effectively allows a user to switch the default   actions for Ctrl+click and Ctrl+Shift+click  depending on which combination   he likes better to switch to a newly opened tab. </pre>
