<title>Issue 17133 -   chromium -    bookmark bar animation janky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open a lot of tabs for high-load websites  2. open bookmark bar or cause an infobar to pop up    What is the expected output?  smooth like butter    What do you see instead?  janktastic      probably resizing and re-rendering all the tabs in the background    I think this is what Ben was talking about when he said no animation would   be better than this animation. </pre>
