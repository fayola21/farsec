<title>Issue 6785 -   chromium -    Focus cycles within Find box with Shift-Tab (but not when Tab is used) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open Find box  Press Shift-Tab    Expected behavior is that the focus goes somewhere outside the Find box (it   does if you press Tab a couple of times).    I guess we should also look into why our unit tests aren't catching this...   (Jay said he thought he added a test that should have caught this)    Originally filed by Finnur in Buganizer 1312133 </pre>
