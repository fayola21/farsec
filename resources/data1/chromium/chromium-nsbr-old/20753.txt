<title>Issue 20753 -   chromium -    Permission increase UI should not display on app windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We show an infobar when an extension autoupdates and needs increased   privileges. We should not show this on app mode windows  though  since   toolstrips don't show in app modes. </pre>
