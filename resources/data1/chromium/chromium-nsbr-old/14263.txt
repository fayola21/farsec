When I log into my online banking everything I click causes an alert to pop   up. The only text in the alert is &quot;undefined&quot; with an OK button.           What is the expected result?  That I not get alerts            What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. go to the URL  2. sign in to your account  3. any option you click will work  but an alert keeps poping up    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  ie7 - yes ff3 - yes    Please provide any additional information below.  sorry I cannot provide a screenshot but   1) because of the alert I cannot printscreen (is this a chrome issue as   well?)  2) I'm not sure I want a printscreen of my bank account page...     </pre>
