Go to <a href="http://www.echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm">http://www.echoecho.com/jswindows03.htm</a>   2. Click on link &quot;Click Here To Go to Yahoo&quot;  3. On the title bar of the popup window  press mouse-right-button      We are supposed to show only options to move/resize/minimize/maximize  Task   Manager and Close  but all the options will be seen. Even click on the   Chromium icon with the mouse-left-button gives all the options which is   different from Chrome1.0    Is this intended?    Chromium 1.0.155.0 (Developer Build 7266)     </pre>
