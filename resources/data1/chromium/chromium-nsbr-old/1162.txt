<title>Issue 1162 -   chromium -    Cannot install  or read help page on new google browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : &lt;see about:version&gt;                  1. Open any version of IE in any service pack of XP (5 machines tested)  2. Attempt to open <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">http://code.google.com/chromium/</a>  3. With video tries to autostart  critical failure occurs (Note:   Micro$haft's browser is non-responsive and essentially dead  but the You-  Tube insert still functions to play the video...lol)    Additional note: PLEASE dumb down the installer  or provide a   redistributable of it. The online installer does not work on my   home/work/friends machines. NONE of us can even try your new browser   because you have overdone the installation process to the point that   MicroCrap fails before we can get it in.     I have clean Ghost images of Win-XP SP-1 1A 2 3 and the newer SP-3   Intregrated CD from M$  Even images that have all the   additional &quot;Criticals&quot; from M$ update site too.    NONE of them will let your browser install with out of the box default   settings  or open that webpage above without a crash.     Thank you in advance for a resolution.  :)    Attached:  Notepad of &quot;appcompat.txt&quot;  Sad.txt </pre>
