<title>Issue 6819 -   chromium -    Optimize the drawing of the tickmarks on the scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should look into optimizing the drawing of the tickmarks on the   scrollbar.    Instead of drawing the scrollbar and tickmarks from scratch every time  we   could - for example - draw the tickmarks into a mem DC and blit it to the   scrollbar as needed. This also helps limit the work when additional   tickmarks are found  since we don't have to scratch the mem-dc each time    we can just add the new tickmarks to it.    We currently have code to throttle the invalidation of the content area and   scrollbar  which can probably be removed as a result.    You'll probably notice this when you have tens of thousands of matches on   the page _and_ you scroll or even just hover over the scrollbar (you'll   notice Chrome is sometimes pegging the CPU while you hover over the   scrollbar).     </pre>
