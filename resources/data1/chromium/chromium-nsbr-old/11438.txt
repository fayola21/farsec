<title>Issue 11438 -   chromium -    Autoscroll diagonal regions are far bigger than horizontal/vertical regions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is related to <a title="Autoscroll shows cursors for directions not available to scroll"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11437">Issue 11437</a>      1. Begin an autoscroll  2. Move mouse vertically upward  3. Move mouse left to right      Notice that the vertical scrolling region is very small - the diagonal   regions are significantly larger. I believe that the reverse should be true -   it should be much easier to autoscroll horizontally or vertically than   diagonally. </pre>
