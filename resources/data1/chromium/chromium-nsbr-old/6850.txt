<title>Issue 6850 -   chromium -    Restore permanent text when switching away while input box is empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's a little weird  but other browsers distinguish between empty and   nonempty address bars when deciding whether to &quot;remember&quot; the user's typing   between tab switches.  Right now we always remember; if instead we reset to   the permanent text (and selected it) when the user switches away while the   box is empty  it would make it a tiny bit easier for people to get the URL   back if they wanted it. </pre>
