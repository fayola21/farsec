<title>Issue 22589 -   chromium -    desktop shortcut file must me executable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Desktop files created by chromium are displayed as a text files on the  desktop. When double clicked  a popup says it's an &quot;Untrusted application  launcher&quot;  and proposes to &quot;Launch Anyway&quot;  &quot;Mark as Trusted&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;.    (that's with Nautilus 2.27.92 on Ubuntu Karmic)    This happens to just be a chmod issue. 755 instead of 644 fixes it.  This also turns the text icon to the proper chromium icon.    Note that Nautilus creates its launchers with a &quot;#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open&quot;  shebang  which while not mandatory  would be good to have too. </pre>
