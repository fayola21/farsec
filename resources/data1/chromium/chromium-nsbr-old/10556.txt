<title>Issue 10556 -   chromium -    Report-a-bug dialog needs success confirmation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  when the user submits the report-a-bug dialog  there is no   visual confirmation that the report has been submitted successfully.  This   leads to some confusion  as some users think the submission failed; they   then re-submit the feedback several more times!    We should add some kind of visual indicator/thank you dialog that indicates   the report has been sent. </pre>
