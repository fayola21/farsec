<title>Issue 8218 -   chromium -    Create and use MoveTreeWorkItem class instead of CopyTreeWorkItem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should create a MoveTreeWorkItem class that moves the files instead of   copying it and replace some uses to copy_tree with move_tree. This will   save significant seconds out of our total install time especially during   two large operations - when we copy the whole version directory and when we   copy the uncompressed installer archive. </pre>
