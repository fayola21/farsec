<title>Issue 19469 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] Make bookmarks searchable from Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.6    In Windows Vista and Windows 7 you can search virtually all of your stuff   from the search bar in the Start Menu. This includes Internet Explorer's   Favorites. However  Google Chrome's bookmarks are not indexed  which is sad.    The IE favorites are actual files in a special Favorites folder. Chrome    AFAIK  uses a single file to hold all the bookmarks. I don't know what can be   indexed in Windows Search  but I guess this would need a bit of an   architectural change. </pre>
