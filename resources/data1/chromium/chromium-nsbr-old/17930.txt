<title>Issue 17930 -   chromium -    Task manager UI improvements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.196.0 (Developer Build 21889)  OS + version : Linux  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional) : not tested      1. open a few web pages; at least one with a long page title  2. open the task manager      The memory/cpu/network columns should always be visible      The window has a fixed size and adds scrollbar  pushing the interesting columns out of view.      Considerations:  - one of the memory/cpu/network columns is what the user most likely wants to see here  - the page title is not really important  it's only needed to identify the correct tab/process. in most cases the   first characters or even the favicon will be enough for this      To improve things I propose the following changes:    1) make the default dialog size a bit (~ 50%) wider  2) remove the horizontal scrollbar  3) make memory/cpu/network columns stick to the right side of the listview  4) shorten long page titles with ellipses so that they no longer push the following columns out of the view   5) keep the window resizable and show more of the page title as space becomes available   </pre>
