<title>Issue 21225 -   chromium -    Spellchecker doesn't re-check after changing language  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.207.0 (25595)  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Gnome      1. Set the spellcheck language to &quot;English&quot;  2. In a text entry field  type the following sentence: &quot;This is un ejemplo   of una sentence que contiene words in two idiomas.&quot;  3. Now change the language to &quot;Spanish&quot;.      When it is set to English it should flag the Spanish words as incorrect.    After changing the language to Spanish  it should immediately accept the   Spanish words as correct and flag the English words as wrong.        Nothing changes after switching the language  although if you re-select the   word or right click a few times sometimes it updates.   </pre>
