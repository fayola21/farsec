<title>Issue 7531 -   chromium -    [Feature request] Retain webpage contents after a crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Tab crashes  screen blanks  and you see a sad icon and a glib message.      When a sad tab occurs  it blanks out the contents of the window so you  can't see the text you were working on. At least when a regular application  crashes  you can usually still see what was on the screen  so if you're  desperate you can write it down by hand. It would be nice if there were a  &quot;Copy form text to clipboard&quot; button that would dump all the form text you  had entered before the crash into the clipboard to save you some headaches.   </pre>
