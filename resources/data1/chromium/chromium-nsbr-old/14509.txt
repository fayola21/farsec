<title>Issue 14509 -   chromium -    Task manager not staying in the same place. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189.0 (Officiell version 18569)  URLs (if applicable) : NO  Other browsers tested: NO      1. Opening task manager with Shift+Esc.  2. Closing task manager.  3. Repeat      To get the task manager appear in the exact same spot it just was in      It pops up an inch to the left or and inch higher up depending on where the   start menu is places. (1920x1200 25&quot; screen).    The reason for this seems to be me having my start menu on the left instead   of at the bottom  having it at the top or at the left makes the task   manager jump towards it as if it's a lonely little puppy seeking attention.    Having start menu on the bottom or to the right doesnt affect the location   task manager so it's probably an issue with counting pixels from top left   corner but I might be wrong..   </pre>
