<title>Issue 13999 -   chromium -    Full-screen mode interacts poorly with bookmark bar visibility - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.187.0 (Official Build 18043)  OS + version : ghardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit  window manager : ratpoison      1. Hit ctrl-b to make the bookmark bar appear  2. Hit f11 to go &quot;full screen&quot;      The bookmark bar should not be visible.      The bookmark bar is still visible.    Potentially also of interest  ctrl-b does NOT toggle bookmark bar   visibility in full-screen mode.  If the bar is visible before going full   screen it's visible in full screen  and if it's not visible before going   full screen it's not visible in full screen.  Ctrl-b toggle works fine when   not in full-screen. </pre>
