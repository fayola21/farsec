<title>Issue 1204 -   chromium -    Don't set cookies during initial TLD check - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The initial redirect check to get the right Google TLD shouldn't set   cookies.  We should expose a load flag on the URLRequest that causes no   cookies to be set  and implement that via changes to ctx-&gt;cookie_policy()-  &gt;CanSetCookie() in URLRequestHttpJob::NotifyHeadersComplete(). </pre>
