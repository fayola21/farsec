<title>Issue 16884 -   chromium -    Some locale_settings entries are also platform-dependent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  locale_settings vary only along a single 'axis' (UI language).   However  some of them need to be different depending on the platform. (e.g.   minimum font size)    Firefox's all.js file deals with that issue with #ifdef PLATFORM.We need to   take a different approach ('grid'/pack magic  perhaps).     </pre>
