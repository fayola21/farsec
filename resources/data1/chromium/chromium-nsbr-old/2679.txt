<title>Issue 2679 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't close properly  restore last opened tabs incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.152.1 (Official Build 2164)  Operating System: Windows XP (SP2)    Occasionally  I get an error message on the next startup that Chrome didn't   close properly  and that I would need to click &quot;Restore&quot; to restore my last   opened tabs. However  the restored tabs are not the correct tabs that were   opened last (the restored tabs seem to be from a previous session  not the   last one).    Another thing I noticed is that sometimes even after closing Chrome  a   single chrome.exe process can still be seen in the Task Manager. It appears   that Chrome itself occasionally doesn't close properly.    The above mentioned issue happens more commonly when the &quot;Restore the pages   that were open last&quot; option is selected on startup  though I also get the   same errors when Chrome is set to the default &quot;Open the Home page&quot; option. </pre>
