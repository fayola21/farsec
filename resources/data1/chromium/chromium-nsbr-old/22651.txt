<title>Issue 22651 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.move lets you move a tab into an app-mode window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open up a chrome window with some tabs  and at least one app-mode window.   From an extension  you can then use the chrome.tabs.move API to move a tab   from the regular window to the app-mode window. This should probably not be   allowed.     Here's a helpful little snippet to print out the window/tab state in the   debugger:    chrome.windows.getAll({&quot;populate&quot;:true}  function (wins) {for (var i in   wins) { var win = wins[i]; console.log(&quot;window &quot; + win.id); for(var j in   win.tabs) { var tab = win.tabs[j]; console.log(&quot;  tab &quot; + tab.id + &quot; &quot; +   tab.url); }}})     </pre>
