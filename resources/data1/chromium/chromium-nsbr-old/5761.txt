<title>Issue 5761 -   chromium -    Expand right mouse click menu on selected text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    When I'm in a webpage and I select (left click) some text and then   right click the selected text.. You already have to possibility to   search for the selected text in a new tab.... Now it would be great to   also be able to select a url  which does NOT have a hyperlink  and   open this url in a new tab       </pre>
