<title>Issue 18652 -   chromium -    The right arrow key behaves inconsistently in the address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22005">r22005</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu    These are 2 very similar bugs  so I report them as one.    If the entire contents of the address bar is selected and I press the right   arrow key  the cursor goes to the *second character* of the URL. It should   go to the end of the URL.    If only parts of the address bar is selected and I press the right arrow   key  the cursor goes to the end of the selection + 1. It should go to the   end of the selection + 0.      1. Go to some web page (whatever)  2a. Click into the address bar. The entire URL gets selected.  2b. Select part of the URL.  3. Press the right arrow key        a) The cursor should go to the end of the selected URL.  b) The cursor should go to the end of the selection.        a) The cursor goes to the second character of the URL.  b) The cursor goes to the end of the selection + 1. </pre>
