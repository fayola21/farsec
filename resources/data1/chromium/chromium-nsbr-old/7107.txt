<title>Issue 7107 -   chromium -    Scroll bar and/or client area not properly resized when changing monitor size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.43    I opened Chrome on my thinkpad  while it was in the docking station driving   a 30&quot; monitor at full 2.5k x 1.5k resolution.  The chrome window was tall    about 1400px.  I was viewing a page that required scrolling with a window   (a long single gmail message)    I undocked the thinkpad and the window shrunk to ~800 pixels high to fit on   the thinkpad's screen (1440x900).    The appearance is as if Chrome thinks it is still rendering in a 1400 px   high window  cropped to the actual 800px window.  I can't see the bottom of   the message no matter how I scroll (PgDn  scrollbar etc).  The lower arrow   on the vertical scroll is not visible.    (If I maximize and restore the window is displayed correctly.)     </pre>
