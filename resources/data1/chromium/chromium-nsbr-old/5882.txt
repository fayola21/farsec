<title>Issue 5882 -   chromium -    Incompatibility with ATI HYDRAVISION desktop manager maximise button  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install ATI HYDRAVISION(tm)(this is a multi monitor utility for ATI   graphics cards)  2. Launch Hydravision properties press 'Load Desktop Manager'and check HYDRAVISION max/restore buton  3. Start Google Chrome      A HYDRAVISION Max/restore button is added to the left of the   minimise/maximise/close buttons. This allows a window to be maximised to a   single monitor rather than across an extended desktop spanning 2 monitors.      Either no button is displayed or it is displayed in the same position as   the minimise button. clicking the maximise button does not extend the   window across two monitors.     Please provide
