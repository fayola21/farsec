<title>Issue 3979 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar link tag appears in wrong location. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chrome Version       : 0.3.155.0 Build 4382  URLs (if applicable) : Any Page with hypertext links.           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit any page with many hypertext links and tags.  2. Open new tab or more.  3. Close the new tab.  4. After closing  make sure to run mouse cursor over a Bookmarks bar link  and the tag for that link will appear in the current page. It usually shows  up when the cursor is over another link within the page.      Bookmarks bar link tags should only appear when mouse has been over link  for a certain amount of time or not at all. The tag should never appear  within the current page.      Tag appears in the wrong location. The tag for the Bookmarks bar link  simply does not go away. The only way to get rid of it is to place the  cursor over any Bookmarks bar link.    This is under a clean install of Windows Vista Ultimate x64 with all of the  latest updates. This issue never appeared under Google Chrome. </pre>
