<title>Issue 18533 -   chromium -    tcmalloc.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Debug only]    Roughly to support multiple dlls (base.dll  net.dll  etc):    - There must be one instance of heap allocators.  - There must be one crt instance -&gt; use msvcrtd.dll    So the best/easiest idea is to use msvcrtd.dll and have tcmalloc.dll. (Note that it   could be in base.dll  both are fine  I don't mind)    Actions:  #1 Fix prep_libc.sh to mutate msvcrtd.lib to achieve the same result it has with   libcmt.lib (but not msvcrtd.pdb since msvcrtd.lib is just an import library).    Note that this is slightly more complex since the .obj names are not in msvcrtd.lib   so I'm not sure the best way to implement this. We may just want to strip the   functions listed in override_functions.cc.    #2 Make tcmalloc a dll in debug only    #3 Use msvcrtd.dll instead of libcmtd.lib in debug only </pre>
