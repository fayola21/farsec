<title>Issue 10853 -   chromium -    Set quarantine data on downloaded files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> at browser/download/download_file.cc:140 we need to set the Apple  Quarantine data for the file being downloaded.    Camino does this here:    <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/camino/src/download/nsDownloadListener.mm#464">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/camino/src/download/nsDownloadListener.mm#464</a>    The code is way more complex than necessary because of the SDK issue  which  we don't have to worry about (we're always 10.5). </pre>
