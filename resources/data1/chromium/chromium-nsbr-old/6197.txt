<title>Issue 6197 -   chromium -    PasswordManager should not overwrite prefilled fields. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a site that prefills values on a password form (such as the   attached page).  2. Enter username/password  submit  and have the PasswordManager save.  3. Re-visit the login page. The prefilled value is overwritten.        Step 3 should instead show the prefilled value (provided by the page/site)   and only suggest the user-saved credentials by either inline autocomplete   (as the user manually types) or the username selection dropdown.         </pre>
