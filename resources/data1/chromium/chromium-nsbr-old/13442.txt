<title>Issue 13442 -   chromium -    omnibox ceases to display dropdown with suggestions after extended operation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.184 (184.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7        sort of iffy-steps... Sorry.    1.start chrome and use for a while (hours)  2. at some point  omnibox will cease providing the auto-complete   dropdown. In particular  attempting to use omnibox while the throbber is   showing for a slow DNS lookup in another tab seems to mostly reliably   trigger.      omnibox should always work.   </pre>
