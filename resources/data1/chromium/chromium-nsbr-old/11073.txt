<title>Issue 11073 -   chromium -    Accelerators framework does not work as expected with dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the FocusManager  the TabContents gets a first crack at processing key   down messages. This happens by just Defproc'ing the key down messages.  WebKit returns the ones it has not processed and at that point the browser   processes them for accelerators.  In the cases of a dialog  there is not page getting the messages  so they   are never coming back and accelerators do not work as expected.    The focus manager should when it processes accelerators  test whether the   focused element wants to take a first crack at key messages  and if it does   not  it should process them for accelerators right away.    When fixing this  please fix the accelerators in Task Manager  so they use   the View::AddAccelerator calls.   </pre>
