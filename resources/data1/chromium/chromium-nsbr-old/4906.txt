<title>Issue 4906 -   chromium -    italicized preformatted text is too tall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make two pre elements side by side (e.g. one is float: left  margin-top:   0)  2. Put line numbers in one  separated by either br elements or newlines   3. Put source code in the other one  and set its style to font-style:   italic        The line numbers in the left div should align with the lines in the right   div.          The italicized characters are slightly taller than the non-italicized ones   (about 10% taller)  so they don't line up.  They line up in all other   browsers  even lynx.  Especially lynx.
