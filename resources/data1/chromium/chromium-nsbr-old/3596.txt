IE 7: Not an issue  working fine      Problem:   This issue is similar to <a title="XML display is unformatted"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=434">Issue 434</a>. We(Quark) have Enterprise Product   (QuarkXPress Server) which is totally based on xml which in turns help to   create complete QuarkXPress documents on web.        1. Send a HTTP request to QuarkXPress Server to generate xml file of   complete QuarkXPress document via thin client i.e. Google Chrome.   2. Server returns the xml file to browser        XML should be displayed in formatted manner. PLease note: Our system   generates xml file having 60 000 characters and atleast 1000 xml elements.   So there should not be any performnce issue in loading xml file to browser   as well.   Performance issue can be observed in Mozilla browser.      Unformatted xml file is returned. User has to do view &quot;page source&quot; to see   the xml file.       </pre>
