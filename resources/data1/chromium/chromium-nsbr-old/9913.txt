<title>Issue 9913 -   chromium -    Code defect in base/logging.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Look at DECLARE_DCHECK_STROP_IMPL macro and notice that it defines  a declaration of certain functions: CheckstrcmptrueImpl   CheckstrcmpfalseImpl  Check_stricmptrueImpl  Check_stricmpfalseImpl.  2. Notice that the declarations are generated by calls to this macro  immediately below.  3. Notice that the comments above state that the _definitions_ of these  four functions are in logging.cc.  4. Notice that the definitions of these four functions actually don't seem  to be anywhere at all.        Finding the functions.        Can't find the functions anywhere.    <b>Please provide
