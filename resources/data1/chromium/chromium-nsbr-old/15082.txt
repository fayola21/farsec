Went to iPhone Tour and selected one to view. Message appears that QT  update is available  would I like to download. Clicked OK. Browser  completely froze.      What is the expected result?  QuickTime for Windows should have downloaded and the browser should not  have frozen. Or  the browser should have warned that the action wasn't  permitted...or something!      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to the Apple site  2. Click on Watch the Guided Tour  3. On this page (<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/guidedtour/">http://www.apple.com/iphone/guidedtour/</a>) click Watch it  (Large).    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?  Yes. Firefox 3.1.    Please provide any additional information below.  I tested on Windows XP only.     </pre>
