<title>Issue 15214 -   chromium -    NNTP: The chrome/chromium logo should be updated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the new new tab page the logo should be left aligned. The current image   for chromium has a lot of whitespace to the left of the icon. I reused the   image from the current new tab page where the logo is right aligned and   therefore it is not suitable for the new new tab page. </pre>
