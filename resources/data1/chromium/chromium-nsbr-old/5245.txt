<title>Issue 5245 -   chromium -    Ctrtl+Shift+J should bring up Inspector to foreground - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.33 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6493">r6493</a>)      1. Ctrl+Shift+J on a page to Inspector.  2. Set Keyboard focus to the tab.  3. Again hit Ctrl+Shift+J    What is the expected output?  Inspector should be brought to foreground.    What do you see instead?  The event is ignored.      We honor the similar behavior in case of Ctrl+Shift+L [to JavaScript Debugger)   </pre>
