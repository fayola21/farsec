<title>Issue 17112 -   chromium -    ppa.launchpad.net chromium-daily breaks with libsqlite3-0-ia32 installed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0~svn20090715r20727-0ubuntu1~ucd1~intrepid  OS + version : ubuntu intrepid  Linux 2.6.27-14-generic  CPU architecture : 64-bit  window manager : gnome      1. sudo aptitude install libsqlite3-0-ia32  2. sudo aptitude install chromium-browser  3. FAIL!    When doing it again in aptitude GUI  it tells me that ia32-libs-chromium* attempt   to overwrite libsqlite*.so*    Wouldn't it be better to just depend on libsqlite3-0-ia32 in this case?    On top of this  after I uninstall libsqlite3-0-ia32 and try again  it does the   install well  but there still appears error reports like:    /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64  Failed to load module: /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so  /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgiogconf.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64  Failed to load module: /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgiogconf.so    (thinking these should be separate from the actual issue  but I think they are   related to something if I'd bother to look around.) </pre>
