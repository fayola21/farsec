<title>Issue 9200 -   chromium -    Export bookmarks and settings to other browsers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0 (12281)  URLs (if applicable) : NA  Other browsers tested: NA    Right now there's the option to import settings and bookmarks from IE or   Firefox. It would be really nice to have an export feature as well  which   would allow to export the bookmarks to IE (in htm format) or export both the   settings and bookmarks to another installation of Chrome. </pre>
