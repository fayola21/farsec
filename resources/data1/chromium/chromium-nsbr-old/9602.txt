<title>Issue 9602 -   chromium -    Right Click Menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.171.0  URLs (if applicable) : ALL                  Perhaps this is a change in Chrome's functioning  otherwise it is a   regression...  When right-clicking on a  selection  there used to be a   different menu from when simply right-clicking on the page itself.  For   example  if I highlight the word &quot;chrome&quot;  I would have options such as   &quot;Search Google for Chrome&quot;  copy  etc.  However  now  I lose the selection   and get the standard right click of back  forward  reload  save as  print    view page source  view page info  and inspect elemtn. </pre>
