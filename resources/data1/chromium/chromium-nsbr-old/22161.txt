Close the window  3. Launch Chrome again        The window opens in the position it held when it was closed.        The window opens on the primary monitor  in roughly the position it held on   the secondary monitor accounting for differences in screen size.  If it was   maximized on the secondary when closed  it opens maximized on the primary.    If it was shifted to the left/right on the secondary it will open similarly   positioned on the primary.  When closed on the primary monitor the window   position is restored correctly.    <b>Please provide
