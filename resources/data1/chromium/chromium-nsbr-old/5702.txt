<title>Issue 5702 -   chromium -    Find-In bar fails alternatively on a frame for SINGLE occurrence of a word - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 1.0.154.40 (Official Build 7133)  I believe  we don't have a bug for this.    I'm filing this after talking to Finnur  to make sure we don't miss it or  we don't regress it in future.        1. Navigate to any webpage with frames (Google internet email a/c is fine)  2. Ctrl+F to find-in bar  3. Type a word  which has single occurrence on the page  in find-in box and  hit enter key.  4. The word is highlighted. So far it is fine.  6. Esc to cancel find-in bar.  5. Hit Ctrl+F again and hit enter key again [hoping you did not delete the  previous search word in the find-in bar].      What is the expected output?   The word should be highlighted.    What do you see instead?  Find-in bar fails alternatively.  This happens only for SINGLE WORD occurrences.    As spoken to Finnur  this does not reproduces in Trunk build: 1.0.155.0 (r  7219)           </pre>
