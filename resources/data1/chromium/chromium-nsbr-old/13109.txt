<title>Issue 13109 -   chromium -    Omnibox kills first few characters typed when opening a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium build 3.0.182.4      1. Open Chromium and navigate to a webpage.  2. Press Command-T and start typing 'http' as quickly as fast as you can.    Expected results:  Omnibox should contain the text 'http'.    Actual results:  The content of the Omnibox is cleared after half a second so you end up with   something like 'ttp' or just 'tp' if you type really fast. </pre>
