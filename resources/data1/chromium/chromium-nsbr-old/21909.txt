<title>Issue 21909 -   chromium -    tab and window APIs should support relative URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Let's say you're in chrome-extension://&lt;my-id&gt;/windows/main.html and then you   try to open &quot;preferences.html&quot; via the tabs or windows APIs.  The current   implementation will try to open chrome-extension://&lt;my-id&gt;/preferences.html   rather than chrome-extension://&lt;my-id&gt;/windows/preferences.html like you'd   expect.   </pre>
