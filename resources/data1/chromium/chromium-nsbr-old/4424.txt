<title>Issue 4424 -   chromium -    No visual indication of focus on input type=&quot;button&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : General issue  example attached           Safari 3: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK        Opera 9: OK      1. Set focus to a (default-styled) &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; element.      Appearance of button should change to indicate that it has focus.      No change in appearance. This makes keyboard navigation difficult.    Styling a button with the :focus pseudo-class does work  but this really  should be default behavior. (IE predictably fails to support :focus  so it  isn't widely used.)    Note: clicking on a button doesn't set focus  so use Tab or the script link  in the attached demo to set focus instead. This is a WebKit bug rather than  Chrome-specific; I've just raised it as  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22261">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22261</a>   </pre>
