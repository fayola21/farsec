<title>Issue 5492 -   chromium -    SVG text renders badly -- wrong placement  poor spacing/kerning. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.

Chrome (even latest update 1.0.154.36) renders the SVG like Firefox 2 used   to do -- badly placed text  bad text spacing (pitch or kerning).   Also    when the image is zoomed with scroll wheel and it grows beyond the browser   window edges  there is a vertical scroll bar to move around  but no   horizontal scroll bar  so image can't be completely examined at higher   zooms.  Firefox 3 does it right.    Please provide
