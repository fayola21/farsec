<title>Issue 18108 -   chromium -    ::GetParent(parent) != m_hWnd sometimes is true in plugin code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There used to be NOTREACHED() there  but it can be reached  and seems to be   an effect of some race condition.    chrome/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_win.cc        if (oop_plugins) {        if (parent == m_hWnd) {          // The plugin window is a direct child of this window  add an          // intermediate window that lives on this thread to speed up   scrolling.          // Note this only works with out of process plugins since we depend   on          // PluginProcessHost to destroy the intermediate HWNDs.          parent = ReparentWindow(window);          ::ShowWindow(window  SW_SHOW);  // Window was created hidden.        } else if (::GetParent(parent) != m_hWnd) {          // The renderer should only be trying to move windows that are   children          // of its render widget window.          NOTREACHED();  // &lt;--- can be reached sometimes          continue;        }          // We move the intermediate parent window which doesn't result in   cross-        // process synchronous Windows messages.        window = parent;      } </pre>
