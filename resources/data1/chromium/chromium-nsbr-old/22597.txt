<title>Issue 22597 -   chromium -    ProfileImpl::GetRequestContext() is recursive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ProfileImpl::GetRequestContext() calls  ChromeURLRequestContext::CreateOriginal calls  ChromeURLRequestContext::ChromeURLRequestContext calls  profile-&gt;GetAppCacheService() calls  ProfileImpl::GetRequestContext().    This means callers get *two* URLRequestContexts from the profile.  (The   second time through  the first hasn't completed yet  so it makes a new   one.)  One then leaks on exit.    I think there might be other Bad Things going on because different pieces   of the code have different ideas about which context to use.    Assigning to michaeln because of AppCache bits  not sure who to really   blame.   </pre>
