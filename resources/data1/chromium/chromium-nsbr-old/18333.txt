<title>Issue 18333 -   chromium -    Embedded bitmap font is primarily used for rendering Japanese texts instead of anti-aliased one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go page includes Japanese texts with font-size:medium or small  such as  <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;q=��_��_��_��__��_��__&amp;btnG=__��_��_��_��_&amp;lr=">http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;q=��_��_��_��__��_��__&amp;btnG=__��_��_��_��_&amp;lr=</a>      All texts are rendered with anti-aliased font as it is available  like  Firefox 3 on Linux does.      A page is unusually rendered: embedded bitmap font is used for normal  Japanese text  but anti-aliased font is used for bold Japanese text and  ASCII characters.  After I changed font size 2 levels bigger manually with shortcut  Control+PLUS  all texts are rendered with anti-aliased font.    Please provide
