<title>Issue 23070 -   chromium -    Need VS2003-compatible build of gcapi_lib.lib - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This one is for Rahul Kuchhal I believe -- please could you make a build of   the gcapi_lib.lib that can link successfully in VC2003? The build that is   generally available of this library is the one built in VC2008 which is not   backwards compatible.     thanks! </pre>
