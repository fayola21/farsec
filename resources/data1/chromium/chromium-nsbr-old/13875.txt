<title>Issue 13875 -   chromium -    Mouse cursor artifact - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Upgrade newest version      Good mouse pointers      I had problems with latest dev version. After that I have installed beta   version (2.0.172.31) which works fine. And now I noticed that my mouse   pointer was bad before and now it is right. For example my selection mouse   pointer have a dot line on the top and now with beta version it is right.   This artifact might have no link with dev version at all but installing   beta version removes that artifact.    <b>Please provide
