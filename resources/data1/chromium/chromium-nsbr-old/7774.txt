<title>Issue 7774 -   chromium -    &quot;Find in page&quot; should be more powerful -- should find terms in same *paragraph*  and allow logical OR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0    This is a feature request.    Want smarter &quot;Find in page&quot; than just string matching.  People often are  searching for a sentence or paragraph that contains an idea they have in  their head  for which they do not know a priori the exact string they're  looking for.    In Google tradition  Chrome &quot;Find in page&quot; should be the most powerful of  all browsers.  In the same way that Google Web Search find matches of all  terms anywhere in a document and takes you to that document  &quot;Find in page&quot;  should find matches of all terms anywhere in a *paragraph* and take you to  the first such paragraph.  Thus:    1) Entering:  foo  would highlight all occurrences of foo and jump to the first such occurrence.    2) Entering:  foo bar  would highlight all occurrences of foo and bar that appear in the same  paragraph and jump to the first such occurrence.  (It would either not  highlight  or would highlight in a lighter color  occurrences of foo and  bar that do not appear in the same paragraph.)    3) Entering:  &quot;foo bar&quot;  would highlight all occurrences of the string &quot;foo bar&quot; and jump to the  first such occurrence.    4) Entering:  foo OR bar  would highlight all occurrences of foo and bar throughout the document and  jump to the first such occurrence.    Likewise  combinations of the above would be allowed.      For example of paragraph search:    What steps will reproduce the new feature?  1. Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights</a>  2. Choose &quot;Find in Page&quot;  3. Type:     keep arms  4. Hit Enter  5. Chrome should highlight &quot;keep&quot; and &quot;arms&quot; in the three paragraphs that  contain &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; and jump to the first occurrence.      For example of logical OR search:    What steps will reproduce the new feature?  1. Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights</a>  2. Choose &quot;Find in Page&quot;  3. Type:     speech OR arms  4. Hit Enter  5. Chrome should highlight &quot;speech&quot; and &quot;arms&quot; in all places throughout the  document and jump to the first occurrence.   </pre>
