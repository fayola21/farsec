<title>Issue 3719 -   chromium -    Shared memory doesn't go away after crashes and contents can inadventantly get reused in subsequent runs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The POSIX Shared Memory APIs used by OSX &amp; Linux don't delete the  underlying region when the creating process crashes.    This can lead to a situation in which we can pick up the contents of Shared  Memory region orphaned by a crashed process.    Another problem with the current approach is that if we have multiple  copies of Chromium running simultaneously  they will share the same memory  regions.    One possible solution to this would be to generate a random number at  Chrome startup which would be communicated to child processes.  We could  then tag this number onto the names of Shared memory regions.  This would  both prevent collisions between running copies of Chromium and picking up  stale data from orphaned Shared Memory regions.    Another possible solution would be to use file based locking as these do go  away on process exit. </pre>
