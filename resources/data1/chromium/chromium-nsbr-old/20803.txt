<title>Issue 20803 -   chromium -    API listings should be alphabetical - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you look at   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/do">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/do</a>  cs/tabs.html  you'll see that the methods are listed in the order they're   declared in extension_api.json:    get  connect  getSelected  getAllInWindow  create  update  move  remove  detectLanguage  captureVisibleTab    Events are also in non-alpha order.    It would make more sense (and make individual methods/events easier to   find) if every API section had its items in alphabetical order. </pre>
