<title>Issue 7077 -   chromium -    Ability to downgrade a Chrome installation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user's installation is corrupted in a bad way  e.g. the version key   in registry exists but the file payload is gone  there is no easy way for   user to fix until a higher version of chrome available. All first   install/update will just silently exits.    If this is an update  this behavior is probably ok. But if this is a first   install  then the user is clueless on what happens.    Not sure what is the best way to do here. We could consider some UI message   if same or higher version is detected during first install. But in most   cases  if same or higher version does indeed exists  silent completion   might have better user experience.     Or we can have a force-install option somehow?       </pre>
