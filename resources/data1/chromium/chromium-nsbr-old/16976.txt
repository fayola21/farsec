<title>Issue 16976 -   chromium -    use the XDG_CACHE_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME standard user directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.0~svn20090715r20727  OS + version : Ubuntu Linux 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit    <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html">http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html</a>    Chromium currently already seems to use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory  variable from the freedesktop spec  such as ~/.config/chromium/.    However  I noticed that the browser cache (and other data that is not  configuration) is also stored in that same folder  (~/.config/chromium/Default/Cache  for example)  which goes against the  spirit of the XDG spec.    As this project's settings saving is still a young feature at the moment  I  guess now is the time to make sure that we get the user data directory  locations &quot;done right&quot; from the start. What I'm referring to is this  Freedesktop spec: <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/</a>  Especially: <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html">http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html</a>    I first heard about the xdg desktop dirs thing through this post  which  does a good job at explaining the issue/challenges that this spec  addresses:  <a href="http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?184-cleaning-user-preferences-keeping-user-data">http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?184-cleaning-user-preferences-keeping-user-data</a>    See also:  <a href="http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?207-modify-your-application-to-use-xdg-folders">http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?207-modify-your-application-to-use-xdg-folders</a>    So  for example  we could store files like this:  - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chromium/[some config files here]  - $XDG_DATA_HOME/chromium/[bookmarks  dictionaries  extensions  sessions?]  - $XDG_CACHE_HOME/chromium/[the browser cache and cookies here?]    Thanks! </pre>
