<title>Issue 16094 -   chromium -    Missing frame around list in task manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.193.0 (Developer Build 20016)  OS + version : Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Mutter  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): lists look fine      1. go to the task manager in a recent chromium build on linux      The list should have a border      No border around the list. This looks bad with some GTK themes. Compare   this to other GTK apps  they all seem to have a border.    I think adding the border would be trivial but it would improve the look of   the window quite a bit.    The screenshot shows chromium's task manager (left) and gnome's system   monitor (right). </pre>
