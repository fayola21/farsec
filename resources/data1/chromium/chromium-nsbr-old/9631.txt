<title>Issue 9631 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: PDF plugin reloads continuously until pdf completely downloads while viewing using fast web view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf">http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp3/cp-3-2.pdf</a>    What is the expected output?   To render the plugin without any issues    What do you see instead?  Looks like it reloads again and again until the pdf is completely   downloaded.   * Favicon flickers  * The Go button beside omnibox alters between Go and Stop  * If we open pages menu on the left  the pages flicker    Works fine with Chrome1.0 and FF3 but not with Chrome2.0_11427 and   Chromium_12968   </pre>
