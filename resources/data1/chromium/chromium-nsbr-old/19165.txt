<title>Issue 19165 -   chromium -    sort out the non standard locales in the grd files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The grd files have a few non standard locales ('no' instead of 'nb'  'es-419')?    Since we map these directly to language lproj directories  we need to handle   this fixup during the build.    We should probably also validate all the values against what the OS Language   list will cause cocoa to look for to make sure no other fixup is needed. </pre>
