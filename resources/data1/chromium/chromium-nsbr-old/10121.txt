<title>Issue 10121 -   chromium -    1 Failing Layout Tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests/directories are failing  but are not marked as WONTFIX in test_expectations.txt:   This test is timing sensitive and sometimes fails.  However  other tests  in the LayoutTests/animations/ directory are timing sensitive in the same  way.  Maybe this is just flaky because it's animating faster?  Doesn't need to block our next release.   DEFER : LayoutTests/animations/big-rotation.html = FAIL PASS  (Automatically generated from line 1086 to line 1092 of test_expectations.txt) </pre>
