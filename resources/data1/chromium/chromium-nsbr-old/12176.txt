<title>Issue 12176 -   chromium -    hung renderer dialog appearing while javascript alert is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The hung renderer dialog is appearing at times that it does not appear on windows.    For example  pausing the renderer process in a debugger does not cause the dialog to appear on   windows.  Also  javascript modal dialogs (e.g.  alert) should not cause the dialog to appear. </pre>
