<title>Issue 3912 -   chromium -    Unfork FrameLoader.cpp changes made to support the window.history object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our changes to FrameLoader.cpp make the query of the BackForwardList  asynchronous.  This is unnecessary for ports other than Chromium  so the  WebKit folks are (understandably) reluctant to take such a patch upstream.   It's best if we fix this on our side.    jabdelmalek came up with a clever idea  which I'm going to implement:  &quot;fake&quot; a HistoryItem with an URL like &quot;history://go/offset&quot; to indicate a  back/forward navigation to the given offset.  We can return the HistoryItem  synchronously  but handle the navigation ourselves asynchronously. </pre>
