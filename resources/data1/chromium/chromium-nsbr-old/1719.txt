<title>Issue 1719 -   chromium -    downloading files - finished vs unfinished files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.04.09.2008                i find it awkward downloading files  its hard to tell which ones are   downloading and which ones are finished. the actual file  i think  should   have &quot;downloading&quot; or something appended to the name so people like me who   download the stuff dont try to open the file as its downloading.    If your a person who uses a lot of tabs like i am you wont always notice   when files are finished downloading  and this can get confusing. I see it   as a simple fix.    </pre>
