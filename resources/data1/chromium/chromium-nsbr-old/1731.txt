<title>Issue 1731 -   chromium -    Page Rank information a la Google Toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29           Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK    One of the reasons I still have to open up FireFox is that there is no   PageRank information available in Google Chrome. Both FireFox and IE have   Google Toolbar that allows to view the page rank for the current URL.    Please incorporate the PR info into Google Chrome  I don't care much about   other features of the Google Toolbar  but PR is a must. </pre>
