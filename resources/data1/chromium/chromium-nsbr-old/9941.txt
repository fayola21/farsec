<title>Issue 9941 -   chromium -    webkit test failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LINUX DEBUG : LayoutTests/transitions/repeated-firing-background-color.html  = FAIL  WIN DEBUG : LayoutTests/svg/custom/missing-xlink.svg = FAIL    The two checkins that were submitted in this run are below. I would be  surprised if my checkin was the cause as I would expect any failures from  my checkin to be flaky.

I've run 9 debug runs on my dual core Windows box and  14 debug runs on my quad core Mac. These three were  the only tests that failed. I'm not sure what else  I can do other than to try enabling them for the bots.  Review URL: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/67021">http://codereview.chromium.org/67021</a> </pre>
