<title>Issue 9873 -   chromium -    Linux new tab open perf noticeably slower at larger browser window widths - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new browser window maximized.  2. Press ctrl-t repeatedly.        The number of tabs open should equal the number of times you press ctrl-t   but on average we're only opening around 50%.  There is also a noticeable  lag when the tabs are opening.    This can only be seen at larger window widths.  If you leave the browser  window at it's original size  tab opening speed is comparable to windows.   </pre>
