<title>Issue 10578 -   chromium -    [64-bit] Thobber spinning should be smooth for a app window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reproduces on Trunk(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=13742">r13742</a>)  but not on DEV:2.0.172.4 (Official Build   13471)     -Create a application shortcut for a webpage which takes longer time to   load and which has a favicon ( I guess any webpage an cnn.com is fine)  -Launch the application.    Notice the throbber spinning is not smooth. I mean to say  during the page   loading (throbber spinning time)  webpage logo appears few times.    Normally we don't show the webpage logo during page loading/as long as the   throbber is spinning.    Marking this as regression  as it works fine on DEV build.  No repro steps in XP.   </pre>
