<title>Issue 22140 -   chromium -    Allow compilation with system libevent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212 svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26343">r26343</a>  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): both    In the same style as commits 21663  22645 (and others)  a GYP flag to build  with system libevent would be nice.    The attached patch follows the style of the previous commits  adding  &quot;use_system_libevent&quot; flag. It works fine here (system libevent: 1.4.12) </pre>
