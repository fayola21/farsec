<title>Issue 2384 -   chromium -    request for tab focus being affected by mousewheel tilt button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : future builds    This is not a bug as much as a GUI request.      My mouse has a scroll-wheel.  The wheel can tilt left and right.      In Firefox  with multiple tabs open  I am able to click on a tab so that it   gains focus (visually a box-marquee around its title)  then I can navigate   to adjacent tabs by simply nudging the tilt-wheel left/right.  With any tab   selected  I can use the scroll-wheel to navigate up and down the page in   combination with this tilt behaviour.  This works so long as I do not click   anywhere inside the browser page  in which case the focus would become lost   from tab to page.    This is very useful and would be great to see in chromium.       </pre>
