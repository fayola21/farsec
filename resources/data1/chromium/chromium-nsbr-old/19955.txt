<title>Issue 19955 -   chromium -    linux: incorrect -a argument to &quot;exec&quot; in google-chrome wrapper script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome linux installs a wrapper script called google-chrome  which looks like:    #!/bin/sh  ...  exec -a &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$PROGDIR/chrome&quot; &quot;$@&quot;      This causes the script to fail with &quot;unknown argment: -a&quot; (or similar).    The problem is that /bin/sh on Linux typically (but not always) links to  Bash  and when Bash is run as 'sh' it runs in Bourne compatibility mode   but the Bourne shell apparently does not support the -a option. The quick  fix is to change the first line of the script to:    #!/bin/bash    the more questionable fix would be to remove the '-a &quot;$0&quot;' part.    Some Linuces link /bin/sh to the zsh or ash shells  but AFAIK those are all  special-purpose distros for embedded platforms (i.e. where Chrome won't run  anyway  so shell-level compatibility isn't so important).   </pre>
