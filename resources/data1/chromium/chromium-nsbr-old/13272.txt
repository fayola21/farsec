<title>Issue 13272 -   chromium -    Setting Custom User-Dir without Command Line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is more of an enhacement request ...    It would be nice if users can set a different user dir in the preferences   instead of a command-line. The problem with the command line is that  if   Chrome is your default browser  it won't recognize the custom user directory   without some registry hacking.      </pre>
