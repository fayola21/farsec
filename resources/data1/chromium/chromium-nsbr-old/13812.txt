<title>Issue 13812 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Various dialogs have pixel errors below titlebar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the opaque frame  hit ctrl-shift-b  or shift-esc  or open the options   window.  Note how below the titlebar there is a row of window-background and   then a row of titlebar-color.    This might be a regression from Glen's fix to draw the app mode titlebar   correctly?  Or perhaps he failed to apply a patch to one of the various frame   classes... </pre>
