In one swift motion  click on a tab and drag it downward quickly        The tab will detach from window        There's a very quick flash  and the tab escapes from your drag and becomes   a new window.

Something similar happens even if you only have one tab in the window --   drag it quickly  and it flashes  escapes your drag and becomes a new window   as well.    <b>Please provide
