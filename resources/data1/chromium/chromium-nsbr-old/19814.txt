<title>Issue 19814 -   chromium -    Many words suddently turned into search engine keywords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has been reported many times  but we've yet to be able to figure out a   reproduction scenario.    One report: &quot;I clicked on the New Applications-&gt;Internet-&gt;Google Chrome and   got this silly thing where starting to type an address with g meant search   google  and mondrian meant search mondrian for ondrian&quot;    In all cases  deleting the profile fixes it.  We need someone who is encountering this to do the following diagnostic   steps:    1) back up your profile (~/.config/google-chrome)  2) move it aside  verify the problem is fixed  3) restore it  verify the problem still exists  4) try deleting each of the following files from the profile until the   problem goes away:  Default/Preferences  Default/Web Data  anything else   you're suspicious of if those don't fix it    At that point  if you comment here  we can take a closer look at the bad   file. </pre>
