<title>Issue 18936 -   chromium -    chrome takes up full screen on dual monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I have two 24&quot; monitors turned on their side.  The main desktop toolbars   only show up on the left.  2. I was having lots of network issues after the weekend  so I tried   rebooting to see if it would fix the problem.  3. I think &quot;.config/google-chrome/Local State&quot; was saved with pixel   positions from my right monitor that does not have the toolbars.  When   chrome was restarted  it brought up a window on the monitor with toolbars    but the window size was too large and hid the toolbars and the chrome   navigation bar and other controls.        I expected Chrome to never take up all of the screen (unless I actually use   F11 to go into full screen mode).          It was very difficult to wrestle with this  especially since it hid my   toolbars that would let me bring up a terminal.    <b>Please provide
