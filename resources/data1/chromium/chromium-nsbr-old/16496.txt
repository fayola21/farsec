<title>Issue 16496 -   chromium -    windowed plugin z-order can be wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/2009/07/08/google-roommate/">http://thenextweb.com/2009/07/08/google-roommate/</a>    the plugin window hangs over the bar at the bottom of the page. I couldn't   tell from looking through the plugin bugs if this has the same root cause as   another bug (the new window on every scroll one maybe?) or is already on   your radar  if so  apologies.    (why does piman have no chromium acct?) </pre>
