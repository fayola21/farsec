<title>Issue 1960 -   chromium -    quickly jump with middle mouse button click on scroll bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.29 (1798)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/</a>           Safari 3: ?      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: FAIL      If I click on the scroll bar with the middle mouse button on an area   outside the bar handle  the bar handle should jump immediately to that   position. It works with FF and is probably something special to its GUI    but if not it is very handy when scrolling around on long websites.      Nothing     </pre>
