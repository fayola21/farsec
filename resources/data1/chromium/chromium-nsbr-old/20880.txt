<title>Issue 20880 -   chromium -    NTP: Add websites to &quot;most visited&quot; section more aggressively - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am not sure in what conditions exactly websites are supposed to be added   to the NTP most visited list but I noticed some weird behavior:      1. In a fresh profile copy&amp;paste the URL &quot;<a href="http://www.grc.com/intro.htm">http://www.grc.com/intro.htm</a>&quot; to   the omnibox and press Enter.  -check the NTP: nothing was added to it  2. Type &quot;grc.com&quot; i the omnibox and press Enter  -check the NTP: <a href="http://grc.com">http://grc.com</a> was added to it    Why wasn't &quot;<a href="http://www.grc.com/intro.htm">http://www.grc.com/intro.htm</a>&quot; added to the omnibox at the first attempt?    *my test was under windows  using 4.0.206.0 (Developer Build 25163) </pre>
