<title>Issue 17345 -   chromium -    Forward and Backward Button in Creating Application on Google Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am using Google Chrome 3 Beta version of the browser. I want google to add   a new feature i.e while creating application shortcut for any website. The   only problem user face is that  there is no button to go back or come forward   while browsing.If a user press any link and later wish to go back to previous   page he/she is allowed to do so using a button for moving forward and   backward. Though  there is no url writing box  which is obvious but what   about moving forward and backward button. Please introduce that button  in   the application shortcuts.       </pre>
