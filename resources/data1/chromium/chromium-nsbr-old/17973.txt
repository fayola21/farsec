<title>Issue 17973 -   chromium -    Contention between Save audio/video as... and browser cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Load up any decently-sized video from an HTTP source  2) Start the video and let it play for a couple seconds  3) Attempt to right-click &gt; Save video as...    From here I've witnessed many strange things  such as:    - Audio/Video playback issues (stuttering  etc.)    - Status bar displaying &quot;Waiting for cache...&quot; indefinitely    - Save As... dialog never appearing  or appearing minutes later    However... saving when the video has loaded but never played (i.e.    autoplay is off) seems to work fine.  file:// also works great.    I have a feeling the downloader is getting confused by us trying to play   the video at the same time. </pre>
