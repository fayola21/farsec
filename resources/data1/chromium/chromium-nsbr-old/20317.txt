<title>Issue 20317 -   chromium -    StripPort bookmarklet does not work on pages with errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a web site with a :port number  2. Click the StripPort bookmarklet:   javascript:window.location.href=window.location.href.replace(/(^http://.  *?)(:d+)/ %20'$1');  3. Nothing happens because window.location.href is the error page  not the   page you're on. Same problem whether or not &quot;Show suggestions for   navigation errors&quot; is selected (may have to be fixed for both situations)        The port number should be removed (switching to port 80/443) and the page   should be refreshed.      Nothing    <b>Please provide
