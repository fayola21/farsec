<title>Issue 21093 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar off-the-side button should immediately open menu (on mouse down) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have lots of bookmarks (or make the window narrow enough) and have the  bookmark bar displayed  so that the off-the-side (chevron) button is displayed.  2. Mouse down on the off-the-side button.      The menu should open right away. It should also probably be aligned with  the button in some way. (Compare the one in Safari.)      Nothing until mouse up. And the menu appears where the mouse pointer is.    (I've got a patch; will upload in a sec.) </pre>
