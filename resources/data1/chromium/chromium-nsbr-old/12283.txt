<title>Issue 12283 -   chromium -    Trackpad scrolling in maps only zooms in  not out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to maps.google.com  - using the laptop trackpad  two-finger scroll upwards with the cursor   over the map. This zooms in on the map at the cursor location.  - using the laptop trackpad  two-finger scroll downwards.    Expected:  - should zoom out  the opposite of the last step.    Actual:  - depending on how fast you scroll  it either zooms in or out  or in then   back out  or out then back in. It's a little crazy :-)    Works fine with a scroll wheel  it only doesn't work with the trackpad   scrolling. </pre>
