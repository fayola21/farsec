<title>Issue 21600 -   chromium -    Chrome installation broken after currently active chrome.dll gets deleted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am entirely not sure how this happened but one of users ended up with   these on his machine:    FILES  -----   Directory of %USERPROFILE%Local SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplication    09/04/2009  01:52 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .  09/04/2009  01:52 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..  08/28/2009  04:53 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          4.0.201.1  08/28/2009  04:54 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          4.0.202.0  09/04/2009  01:52 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          4.0.203.2  09/04/2009  01:52 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          4.0.206.1  08/19/2009  10:02 AM           920 560 chrome.exe  05/05/2009  11:48 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Dictionaries  04/29/2009  11:24 PM                 0 First Run  09/03/2009  08:59 PM           921 072 new_chrome.exe                 3 File(s)      1 841 632 bytes    201  202 and 203 directories are empty except couple of files (including   setp.exe) and 206 has all the files from installation (see attached file   for complete list).    REGISTRY  --------  [HKEY_CURRENT_USERsoftwaregoogleupdateClients{8A69D345-D564-463c-AFF1-  A69D9E530F96}]  &quot;name&quot;=&quot;Google Chrome&quot;  &quot;pv&quot;=&quot;4.0.206.1&quot;  &quot;opv&quot;=&quot;4.0.202.0&quot;  &quot;cmd&quot;=&quot;&quot;%USERPROFILE%Local SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplication4.0.206.1Installersetup.exe&quot; --  rename-chrome-exe&quot;    So the 'opv' key points to 202.0 but the corresponding DLL has already been   deleted.    Installer creates 'opv' if chrome.exe is in use. So for in-use-update it   would create this key and copy chrome.exe as new_chrome.exe. After the   update is done  for cleanup purpose installer would look for any old   version directories and try to delete them if corresponding chrome.dll is   not in use. Since installer could delete 202.0/chrome.dll looks like it was   not in use (even though opv=202.0) which doesn't make sense.    In any case I will make a fix to not remove version dir as long as opv key   is present.     </pre>
