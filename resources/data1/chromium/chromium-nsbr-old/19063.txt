<title>Issue 19063 -   chromium -    Can't install extension (again) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. (well u can't do this but) I downloaded first version from the website -   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gocalendar/">http://code.google.com/p/gocalendar/</a>)  2. I read at the forum (chromeplugins) that the author had update the   version  I then tried installing the extension again. It apparently did    but the extension did not change (it never installed but didnt tell me so).      A new version with nice new features.      Kept the old version thought installing the new one and being told that I   installed the new version.    <b>Please provide
