<title>Issue 9927 -   chromium -    URL Address disappear while loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.173.1  URLs (if applicable) : any    I haven't this problem with previous version.      1. Going to: www.google.com  2. While page is loaded  address bar is empty.      In the address bar there should be current address.      Address bar is empty.  It's very confused  especially when you changing existing page  you don't   know if you already pressed Enter or not.   </pre>
