<title>Issue 22403 -   chromium -    Flash stops working after a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a>  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): no problem  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): no problem  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. Load some video in youtube. Watch it  no problems there  2. Close the youtube tab.  3. Open a few more tabs and start browsing around. I can't pinpoint   exactly how long to browse  but the bug occurs after a moderate (&lt; 10   minutes) amount of browsing.  4. Try to load a video again in youtube      Video loads again in step 4 and plays.      You get the message: &quot;Hello  you either have JavaScript turned off or an old   version of Adobe's Flash Player. Get the latest Flash player.&quot; Youtube thinks   that I don't have Flash installed but I do.    I will try to pinpoint exactly what you have to do to get this to stop working   in step 3. </pre>
