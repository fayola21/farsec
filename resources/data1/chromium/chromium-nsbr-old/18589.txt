<title>Issue 18589 -   chromium -    No longer able to run Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : latest developer updated    OS version               : 10.5.7        I updated to the latest release. I applied one of the templates and closed everything normally   when I was done using.  A day later  Chrome doesn't open at all. I downloaded the latest version   and reinstalled but NOTHING. I can no longer run Chrome and I'm completely lost as to why.             </pre>
