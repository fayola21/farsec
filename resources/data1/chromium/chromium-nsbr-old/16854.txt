<title>Issue 16854 -   chromium -    Autofill popup flickers on password forms when deleting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit a page with a GAIA login that gets autofilled by the password manager.    Either highlight the last half of the username and press delete  or just put   the cursor before the block to be deleted and hold down delete.  When the   block is deleted  the autofill popup quickly opens and closes.  This   shouldn't happen.    This happens due to changes in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20585">r20585</a>.   </pre>
