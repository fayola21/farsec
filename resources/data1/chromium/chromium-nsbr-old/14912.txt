<title>Issue 14912 -   chromium -    Need to be able to repeatedly click in a single place and close multiple tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you fill up the tab strip with lots of tabs  you should be able to very  quickly click in one location w/out moving the mouse and close lots of  tabs. Currently you can't because at some point they will reflow to fill up  available space and the mouse will no longer be over the close box.    Win delays the resize until you stop clicking  *then* reflows to take up  available space.   </pre>
