<title>Issue 15075 -   chromium -    Open PDF file in new tab results in blank zombie tab that can't be killed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a PDF email attachment in a new tab  2. The tab stays at about:blank and the PDF file is downloaded and opened  in your PDF viewer (expected behavior  same as firefox)  3. Now  however  notice that you can't close the blank tab.  You also can't  close the window containing the tab  and you can't exit chrome.  Since  there is no task manager on chrome-linux yet  I don't know if that would  solve the problem.      The blank tab should be killable like any other tab.      The tab shuffles forth from the nameless depths  a roiling horror that none  dare look upon.  Er  it just stays there forever.    <b>Please provide
