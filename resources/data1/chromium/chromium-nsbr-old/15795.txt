<title>Issue 15795 -   chromium -    Caps lock warning icon in password field doesn't track caps lock state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a web page that has a password field  like <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">http://www.gmail.com/</a> .  2. ENGAGE THE CAPS LOCK  3. Focus the password field.  4. Disengage the caps lock.      Expected: Caps lock warning icon should appear and disappear tracking   caps lock state.  Observed: Caps lock warning icon is set once  when the field is focused    but does not track the caps lock state thereafter.  If the field is focused   with the caps lock on  the icon will be displayed regardless of the caps lock   state. If the field is focused with the caps lock off  the icon will not be   displayed even if the caps lock is turned on while the field remains   focused.      Thanks  I will.    3.0.190.0 </pre>
