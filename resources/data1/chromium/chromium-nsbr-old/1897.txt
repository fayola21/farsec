<title>Issue 1897 -   chromium -    EV SSL Certificate Indicator stops working sporadically. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  The problem appears to be sporadic as far as I can tell.  My coworkers have experienced this   on 4 different computers running Chrome.        What is the expected result? Verified Company name should appear in the right side of the URL   bar for all secure sites using an EV SSL Certificate.      What happens instead?  The company name begins to not display in the right side of the URL bar   even though a EV-secured site is loaded.  This problem can be temporarily resolved by restarting   the computer  or clearing the cache and restarting Chrome.       <b>Please provide
