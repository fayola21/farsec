<title>Issue 11006 -   chromium -    Plugin processes run amok InProcessBrowserTest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have this simple InProcessBrowserTest that loads a bunch of URLs   sequentially:    IN_PROC_BROWSER_TEST_F(MyTest  Main) {     FilePath path(FILE_PATH_LITERAL(&quot;C:chromedataurls.txt&quot;));    std::string content;    file_util::ReadFileToString(path  &amp;content);    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; lines;    SplitString(content  'n'  &amp;lines);      for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; lines.size(); ++i) {      ui_test_utils::NavigateToURL(browser()  GURL(lines[i]));    }  }    I run this test using --gtest_filter=MyTest.Main  The test is part of a project that contains other tests (e.g FooTest.*    BarTest.*)  but the gtest parameter above specifies that I only want to run   my test.    What I notice happening is that the first few URLs succeed and my gtest   output looks healthy (just shows that it is Running my test).  All of a   sudden  the output window shows gtest output for _other_ tests  namely   FooTest.* and BarTest.*!  This is catastrophic as soon as one of the other   tests tries to delete the test user data directory that is in use by my   first test.  Turns out this is due to other chrome.exe processes starting   up; namely  plugin processes.  Loading a page that causes a new process to   start for a plugin (i.e flash) results in that process trying to run the   full test suite in parallel.  Passing --single-process or --disable-plugins   alleviates the problem.      I'm not sure what the heck is going on at the moment besides that. </pre>
