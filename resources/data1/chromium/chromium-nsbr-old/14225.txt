<title>Issue 14225 -   chromium -    Other bookmarks button ought to depress when showing menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The solution will be the same as our solution for the page/app menus  where   we manually set activation. Same for the back/forward buttons.    Note: the page/app menus might be changing soon. The other bookmarks button   ought to match them  so if they change it might ought to change in the same   way. See <a title="Menus open upward with vertically stacked monitors (and get truncated at the boundary)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14184"> issue 14184 </a>. </pre>
