<title>Issue 16792 -   chromium -    keyboard shortcuts that don't work in linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.192.0 (Official Build 19969)    According to  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743</a>    * shift+scroll wheel should horizontally scroll the page  but it doesn't.  * ctrl+enter should add www. and .com to the beginning/end of the string in   the omnibox  * shift+F5 should be the same as ctrl+F5    It seemed silly to file separate bugs for each of these  but I can if that   would be better. </pre>
