<title>Issue 9020 -   chromium -    Blacklist 'customize links' IE favorite on bookmark import. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  when you install Chrome using the default options  we pick up a   bunch of favorites from IE - these include a bunch of 'configure this   browser' links. One of them  'customize links'  opens a page telling you   how to customize links in IE  but we import this and show it in our   bookmarks bar. We should blacklist this link because of its potential for   confusion  and how useless it is in Chrome (note that we will have to   verify that the link is the same for all Windows/IE distributions in all   languages).    Our importer previously didn't import links that had creation dates of the   system setup  but that failed for a range of systems (upgrades  etc). We   may wish to blacklist other 'setup' links  but the list of those is   significantly longer and more difficult with different language/OEM   distributions. </pre>
