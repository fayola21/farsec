<title>Issue 6987 -   chromium -    Clicking anywhere else should close the AutocompletePopup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While the AutocompletePopup is visible  clicking on menus  the title bar    the session history buttons  etc. should close it.    We should not change these menus/buttons to &quot;take focus&quot; to do this  as   that's not what Windows does and can cause other side effects.  Probably   should just close the popup.  This might (hopefully) let me get rid of the   hacks to close the popup when the user moves the window. </pre>
