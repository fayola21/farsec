<title>Issue 14234 -   chromium -    Chinese input doesn't run in Chromium on Mac. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.189           Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      Users should be able to input Chinese via Chinese input method on Mac.      It doesn't work.   It's hard to take a snapshot to describe this. After I enable the Chinese   Input Method on my iMac  and I type some words. It just shows like typing   English when I don't use Chinese input method.    </pre>
