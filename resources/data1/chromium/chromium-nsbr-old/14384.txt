Images partially hidden in some posts. Look at the two columns of photos   under the paragraph entitled Sample Photos. The right column only shows   a few pixels and their titles are truncated.      What is the expected result?      Image sample thumbnails should be entirely visible.    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/articles/olympus_e-p1_photos/">http://www.photographyblog.com/articles/olympus_e-p1_photos/</a>   </pre>
