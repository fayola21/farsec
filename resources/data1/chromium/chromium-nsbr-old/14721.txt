<title>Issue 14721 -   chromium -    crash at hunspell::NodeReader::FindWord - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off <a title="Crash - ~AffixMgr()" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8551"> issue 8551 </a>.    Quite a lot of crashes have been reported in hunspell::NodeReader::FindWord   (bdict_reader.cc:214)    http://crash/search?query=product:Chrome++hunspell::NodeReader::FindWord&amp;num=50    The actuall crash seems to happen when bdict_data_[node_offset_] is accessed in id_byte()   (inlined). There's a DCHECK for node_offset_ &lt; bdict_length_ before that. I guess in a   debug build  it'll be triggered.     The problem has been present since 1.0.x. In 1.0.x  apparently  id_byte() was not inlined   and the top frame is id_byte(). There may be a specific bdict file triggering this. Getting   a minidump and trying to debug should identify one(s) with the problem.     </pre>
