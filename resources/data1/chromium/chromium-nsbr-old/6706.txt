<title>Issue 6706 -   chromium -    Taskbar Not Surfacing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Set the Chrome window FULL size  2. Set Win XP Taskbar to the RIGHT side and Auto Hide  3. When the cursor is moved to the right border the Taskbar will not surface.   this does not happen to me with IE6 or FF3.  This had previously worked with prior Chrome versions.    Thanks                Please provide
