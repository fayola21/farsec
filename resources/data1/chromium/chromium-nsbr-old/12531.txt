<title>Issue 12531 -   chromium -    Detect Incompatible Theme DLLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With themes being supported  we should create a mechanism to detect and   report when an incompatible theme is being loaded.    Ideally  Chrome should fallback to the default theme after displaying a   dialog saying &quot;Error: Theme X cannot be loaded  check if a newer version is   available.&quot;   </pre>
