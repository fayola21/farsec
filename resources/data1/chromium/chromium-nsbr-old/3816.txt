<title>Issue 3816 -   chromium -    Should search with hindi search engine rediff.com. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set your sys locals to Hindi.  2. Install Google chrome on clean profile.  2. Try to search for a hindi word (eg:��__��_��_��_��_��__��_��__�___��__��_��__��_��_��_��_��__��_  ) with rediff.com      What is the expected output?

PS: If you go to directly to the page: rediff.com page  then search  works for fine. </pre>
