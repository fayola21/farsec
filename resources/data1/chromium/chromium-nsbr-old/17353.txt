<title>Issue 17353 -   chromium -    [BUG] Buttons  drop-down menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 195.0 (Developer Build 20864)    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OK      1. I expect you to figure that out  because I'm not a developer in any way.   I'm a Chrome user  who believes its the best browser out there :) There's a   lot you need to improve on Mac OS.       Buttons and Drop-down menus appear really choppy  I've tried all builds of   Chrome/Chromium on my 2 MacBooks  doesn't change whatsoever. Have a   look at the screenshots. The &quot;Google Search&quot; and the &quot;I'm Feeling Lucky&quot;   buttons have a glitch. Its the same with all other website for such buttons    and drop-down menus   </pre>
