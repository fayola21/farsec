<title>Issue 7212 -   chromium -    ynet.co.il: Video doesn't play - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Navigate to a page on ynet.co.il that has video  e.g.:  * <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0 7340 L-3662174 00.html">http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0 7340 L-3662174 00.html</a>  * Click on the green play button bellow the movie.    Expected results:  * Play button should turn into &quot;pause&quot; image and start playing video.    Actual results:  * Play button image stays the same and video doesn't start playing.    Other browsers:  IE7: OK  FF3: FAIL  Chrome: FAIL    The site uses Windows Media Player to display video.    (note: ynet urls seem to expire pretty quickly so if the above doesn't   work  just navigate to the main page and click on a link with video).       </pre>
