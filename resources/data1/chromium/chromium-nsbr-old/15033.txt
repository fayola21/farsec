<title>Issue 15033 -   chromium -    [www.bildkontakte.at]: Back button doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: www.bildkontakte.at Browser: Chrome 3.0.189.0 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.189.0 Safari/531.0] Severity: Certain site functionality doesn't work in Google Chrome What is wrong?      The back button doesn't work.      What is the expected result?      The back button should work.      What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Go to <a href="http://www.bildkontakte.at/">http://www.bildkontakte.at/</a>.  2. Click on one of the faces in the middle of the screen.  3. Click the back button... nothing happens.    If that didn't work  you may need to wait longer once you clicked on the   face. Just read the entire text before clicking back :)    Does it work properly in other browsers? Which did you test?    Safari 4: FAILS  Firefox 3: OK    Please provide any additional information below.     </pre>
