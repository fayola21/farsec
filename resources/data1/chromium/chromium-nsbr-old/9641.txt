<title>Issue 9641 -   chromium -    about:memory listed in &quot;Most visited&quot; sites without url  a preview and leading to an empty page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Perform a clean installation of chrome  2. Visit some pages so they start showing up in the &quot;Most visited&quot; tab  3. Visit about:memory often      I either expect about:memory not to show up in the &quot;Most visited&quot; tab or to   have a preview and a working url.      The about:memory page is listed in the &quot;Most visited&quot; tab. The entry has no   preview image. And clicking on the link results in a 'clear' tab with no   url and no link in the address bar.  Also note that the bookmarks bar is visible on the 'clear' tab but the   'Always show bookmarks bar' option is deactivated.    <b>Please provide
