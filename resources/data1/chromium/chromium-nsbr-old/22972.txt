<title>Issue 22972 -   chromium -    Chrome does not restore the default browser associations when uninstalled on Windows 7/Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install Chrome 3.0.195.21 on Windows 7  2. Set Chrome as the default browser. This would bring up the UAC prompt.      Allow the operation to go ahead.  3. Verify that Chrome is the default browser  i.e. by typing      www.google.com in Start-&gt;Run.  4. Now uninstall Chrome. Allow the UAC prompt to continue the operation.  5. Now type www.google.com in Start-&gt;Run. Observe that you get an Access      denied message.    Looks like we don't restore the associations of .htm/.html correctly.         </pre>
