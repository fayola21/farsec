<title>Issue 15657 -   chromium -    Can't drag text in web text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - go to a page with a text field  such as this one   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>)  - enter some text in the text field  click and drag    Expected:  - can drag text and drop it either within the text field  or to another app or   desktop    Actual:  - nothing happens  can't drag nothing.    Annoying and something that's dogfoody. Should we mark this as beta? </pre>
