<title>Issue 4001 -   chromium -    Chrome + Gmail Labs:Custom Label Colors makes &quot;save password&quot; popup disapear before user interaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a>            Firefox 3: OK    IE 8 (beta): OK      1. Enable Gmail Labs feature: &quot;Custom Label Colors&quot; (if not enabled)  2. Logout of your Gmail account  3. Remove the saved password for your account   3.5 Refresh the page  because Chrome  after the logout (step 2)  inserted the login   details from the account you just logged out off  in the login fields and if you click   login now it won't ask if you want to save it despite it not being in the &quot;password   store&quot; anymore (due to step 3) (another BUG?) (to prevent that swap step 2 and 3  aka   delete the login details before logging out)  4. Login again      A &quot;popup&quot; appears asking the user if he wants to save the login details he just entered    and awaits user interaction.      The &quot;popup&quot; appears and disappears without user interaction.   </pre>
