<title>Issue 22801 -   chromium -    Manifest not being properly created in Mac and Linux for PerfColdComplexTheme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Mac10.5%20Perf(2)/build">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Mac10.5%20Perf(2)/build</a>  s/530/steps/startup_test/logs/stdio  search for &quot;manifest&quot;.    I think the problem is in the way the directory and preferences file is being   created in UITest::RewritePreferencesFile (in ui_test.cc).  This all works   fine in Windows  so I fear that something is wrong in the way the directory   is being constructed in the #if_defined(OS_POSIX) line.    Elliot  do you know if anything has changed here on the linux side recently?       </pre>
