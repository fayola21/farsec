<title>Issue 19195 -   chromium -    Picking ��_��_��_Classic��_��_��_ in themes gallery doesn't use the blue theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. VIsit the Themes Gallery.    <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>  2. Look at the thumbnail preview for the ��_��_��_Classic��_��_��_ theme.  3. Click ��_��_��_Classic��_��_��_ and look at the larger preview.  4. Click ��_��_��_Apply this theme��_��_��_.      Expect: the previews should have looked like Mac Chrome  because I'm on   a Mac  and when this theme is applied  the native Mac Chrome look is   used.  Observe: the previews look like Windows Chrome  and it's kind of   disconcerting to someone who clicks Classic on the basis of it being pretty   and blue  to find that it doesn't change anything or changes the theme   back to gray.    4.0.202.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23217">r23217</a> </pre>
