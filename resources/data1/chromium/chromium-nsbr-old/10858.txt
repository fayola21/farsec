<title>Issue 10858 -   chromium -    [linux] Tabstrip repainting broken sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In xmonad  drag another window across chrome's tab strip. You will see  strange repainting issues that don't appear to repro in metacity.    My feeling is that it's a problem in chrome canvas. </pre>
