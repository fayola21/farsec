<title>Issue 3759 -   chromium -    Daylight savings time in australia - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a user  emailed to me:    &quot;I am having trouble with Google Chrome and Daylight Savings Time which  affects the timezone displayed in my Gmail (Australia).    It seems other users are having this issue too:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-help-troubleshooting/browse_thread/thread/aca9364cf13e1d4e">http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-help-troubleshooting/browse_thread/thread/aca9364cf13e1d4e</a>    When I type javascript:new%20Date().toString() in Google Chrome it shows  the time as 17:19 instead of 16:19.   Mon Oct 27 2008 17:19:13 GMT+1200 (Local Daylight Time)    Can you please ask the developers to look in to this? It is most frustrating.    It would be most appreciated.    Many Thanks&quot;     </pre>
