<title>Issue 4600 -   chromium -    It is hard  to get the context menu for cancelled files. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 0.4.154.23 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5672">r5672</a>)      1. Cancel a download  2. Ctrl+j to downloads page.  3. Keep mouse pointer on the &quot;canceled&quot; file name and right click to get  the context menu.    I guess the mouse pointer target is not correct for canceled ones. If you  keep mouse pointer on the file URL  then you will be displayed with context  menu.    Expected:  User is should be displayed with context menu.    I guess it is not regression as 149.30 also has the same behavior.     </pre>
