<title>Issue 21001 -   chromium -    AIM &quot;New User&quot; website not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.203.2 (Dev Channel)    Visit the following URL:  <a href="https://new.aol.com/productsweb/Controller.jpf?">https://new.aol.com/productsweb/Controller.jpf?</a>  promocode=825028&amp;ncid=txtlnkuswebr00000002    When the page loads  near the top you will see a radio button option labeled   &quot;Use an existing email address as a Screen Name&quot;. Click this radio button and   you will see an error page that says &quot;Tag Error&quot;. Sometimes you have to click   back and forth between the 2 radio options to get the effect.    This does not happen in Firefox 3.5. </pre>
