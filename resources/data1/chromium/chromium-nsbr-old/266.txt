<title>Issue 266 -   chromium -    Chrome uses Windows' proxy settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My Windows environment proxy settings are specific to work  and so I'd like   to be able to switch my proxy settings to a different setting in Chrome.    Right now  Chrome opens the network settings control panel when I click on   the Proxy Settings button in the Options menu. This is not optimal. </pre>
