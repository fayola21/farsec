<title>Issue 19010 -   chromium -    X11 PRIMARY set to autocompleted part of URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23015">r23015</a>  OS + version : Gentoo Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32    I found that when typing URLs into the omnibar  they are auto-completed as   expected  but the auto-completed part of the URL is set as the X11 PRIMARY   (middle-click paste buffer) which I would not expect to happen. On looking   at the source  the cause of this is 4 lines in   chrome/browser/autocomplete/autocomplete_edit_view_gtk.cc which   intentionally do exactly this:     // If any text has been selected  register it as the PRIMARY selection so   it    // can still be pasted via middle-click after the text view is cleared.    if (!selected_text_.empty() &amp;&amp; !selection_saved_) {      SavePrimarySelection(selected_text_);      selection_saved_ = true;    }    So this appears to be an intentional behaviour.    I understand that the X11 PRIMARY normally corresponds to the selected   text  and the autocompleted part of the URL is selected  but I hope I can   convince you that the more correct behaviour in this instance is to not set   the PRIMARY to the selected text.    The reason why this was a nuisance to me is because I regularly select some   text  load up a web page in the browser and then paste the text into the   web page. With this behaviour  the text I end up pasting into the web page   is not the text I selected  but the part of the URL of the web page I   loaded!    Furthermore  there is surely no use-case for pasting an arbitrary amount of   characters from the end of a given URL anywhere  so this behaviour seems   redundant.    I think that removing these lines would give a much more predictable and   expected user experience; I hope you agree! </pre>
