<title>Issue 8724 -   chromium -    Downloading sometimes gets stuck on Starting... and never completes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/download.html">http://www.wireshark.org/download.html</a>  2. Click Windows Installer  3. wait        You expect to see the download shelf appear and work.    Instead  I frequently see a download shelf item appear that just says   &quot;Starting...&quot; forever  but never makes any progress.  It just sits there   forever.  If I look in about:network  I see no URLRequestJob  so it looks   like things are somehow horked.         </pre>
