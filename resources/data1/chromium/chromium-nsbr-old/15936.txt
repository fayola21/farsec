<title>Issue 15936 -   chromium -    &quot;dock to main window&quot; the inspector is non-recoverable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.0.192 (192.0)    OS version               : 10.5.7  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x: Pressing the &quot;dock to main window&quot; (its name in   the tooltip) on the webinspector will embed it in the window that it   corresponds to.      1. right click on something in the page  2. the web inspector will appear  3. click the &quot;dock to main window&quot; button  4. the inspector vanishes and cannot be recovered      It should either refuse to dock or successfully dock.    At the moment  the inspector refuses to appear and this behaviour seems   to be persisted across restarts of the browser. I will attempt to recover by   changing the devtools.open_docked to false. </pre>
