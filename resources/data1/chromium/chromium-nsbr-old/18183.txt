<title>Issue 18183 -   chromium -    seek kills sound and subtitles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 3 Mac July29th version    1. when I jump to an offset  sound and subtitles disappear          seek should still have sound and subtitles (itext)      Reported by Silvia Pfeiffer.  We had a short term audio problem on seeks on PC as well  so I suspect this   is fixed in the next build.   </pre>
