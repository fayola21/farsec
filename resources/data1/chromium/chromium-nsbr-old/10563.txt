<title>Issue 10563 -   chromium -    PNG background not given alpha AntiAliasing when opacity style is set. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Set a PNG file (that makes use of alpha transparency) as the background-  image of a DIV element.   2. Give the DIV a background-color of something other than white  such as   black.  3. Notice the background color does properly fill in the alpha transparency   in the PNG including AntiaAliasing. This is correct.  4. Set the DIV's opacity style to something other than 1.0  5. Notice that while the background color is still filling in the alpha   transparency  it no longer uses AntiAliasing to do the job. This is not   correct.      The rendering engine should continue to use AntiAliasing on the alpha   transparency: meaning the background color should smoothly transition/fade   into the edge color of the PNG.      No AntiAliasing is used. Actually  more accurately  it defaults to white   AA; meaning the image is treated as though it is on top of a white   background. I tested that this is indeed irrelevant to the background color   used within the image editor. Chrome is defaulting to transition to white.    <b>Please provide
