<title>Issue 11581 -   chromium -    Windows DirectoryWatcher does not notify when a directory is created - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/109008">http://codereview.chromium.org/109008</a> uncovered a problem with Windows  DirectoryWatcher. You get no notifications on directory creation.    I think it's easily fixable (just adding a flag)  and desirable for  consistency (on Mac OS X you get a notification in that case). </pre>
