<title>Issue 3633 -   chromium -    Need to solve the tab-to-search-expiring bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After some time  Tab-to-search &quot;stops working&quot; for many sites. e.g.   wikipedia.org.    The problem is related to the fact that every time you use tab-to-search   for that site  the &quot;typed count&quot; (or other relevant metadata) for that URL   isn't bumped  so over time the more you use tab to search to access a site    the less likely it is to be triggered.    We need to fix this for OOB. </pre>
