<title>Issue 2612 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar tooltips fail to hide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Hover over bookmark bar item until tooltip appears.  2. Move mouse quickly to page content area.  3. Try again  it seems to be dependent on how fast you move the mouse.        Tooltips should hide when the mouse leaves the bookmark bar (or even   better  when it leaves the bookmark button) every time.        Occasionally (seemingly dependent on speed and possibly whether or not you   cross the tooltip itself) the tooltip will not hide even if focus is   changed to elements in the page and it will continue to obscure the page   contents until you move the mouse back to the bookmark bar.    This has to be the single most annoying UI bug in Chromium for me at this   point since it can happen accidentally after you search and move the mouse   down from the address bar to the page to scroll or click.  I find myself   frequently having to interrupt what I'm doing and move the mouse to the   bookmark bar to get rid of a stray tooltip.     The frequency with which I see it may be due to a habitual quirk of mine   but I doubt I'm the only one.  When I select the address bar to type a new   address or search term  I invariably move the mouse out of the address bar   before typing to avoid it obscuring letters with the mouse cursor --   typically down onto the bookmark bar which activates a bookmark tooltip.    This it a totally unconscious action when dealing with text entry in any   textbox in any application.    Please provide
