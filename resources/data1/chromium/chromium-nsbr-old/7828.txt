<title>Issue 7828 -   chromium -    scons build ignores changes to common/render_messages_internal.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=9947">r9947</a>    I can change that file and rebuild with hammer and nothing gets rebuilt  (except for the alwaysbuild v8 stuff).    The problem appears to be that render_message_internal is not included  under it's own name but as  #include MESSAGES_INTERNAL_FILE  via  #define MESSAGES_INTERNAL_FILE &quot;chrome/common/render_messages_internal.h&quot;    Thanks! </pre>
