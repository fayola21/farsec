<title>Issue 7176 -   chromium -    Make Chrome Installer delete installation directory if the version registry key is missing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lot of users are reporting various problems due to an old Chrome install   that didn't get cleaned up when user uninstalled Chrome   (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=165aae0f82009327&amp;hl=en&amp;fid=165aae0f8200932700045d03fff5d814). Since   uninstaller just goes ahead with the uninstall even if some files can not   be deleted due to being locked  we should handle this scenario during   install.    I think after we check for any existing Chrome version and find it missing   we should check and just delete the directory where we need to install   Chrome (if the directory exists).  </pre>
