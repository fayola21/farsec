<title>Issue 6419 -   chromium -    On demand update fails due to missing double quotes in registry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think one of our users (mflerackers) just discovered why we have had some unexplained &quot;error   3&quot; reported when trying to update Chrome on-demand through the About box. I have seen three   users (and one pending reply) report that the problem was fixed by adding double quotes in the   registry for this value...    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTCLSID{2F0E2680-9FF5-43C0-B76E-114A56E93598}LocalServer32    Is this something we can fix in our installer or do we need to take this up with the Google   Update team?
