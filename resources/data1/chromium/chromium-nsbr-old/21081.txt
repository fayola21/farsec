<title>Issue 21081 -   chromium -    Chome Mac locks up if I leave it running in the background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.203.4 on Mac OS X 10.5.8  Intel.      1. Launch Chrome  2. Browse  3. Close all windows  4. Leave Chrome running  5. Switch to a different app  6. Wait      Chrome will run in the background  using close to zero CPU and memory resources  and will be   responsive to menu clicks.      After some amount of time  I'm not sure how much  Chrome locks up. It starts using a lot of   CPU resources  its menus are unresponsive  and if I right-click on the dock icon  the menu says   &quot;unresponsive&quot; and suggests I force quit.    Would it help if I collected a &quot;sample&quot; using Activity Monitor when Chrome is in this state? </pre>
