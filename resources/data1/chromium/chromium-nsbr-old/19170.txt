<title>Issue 19170 -   chromium -    Windows Font Linking function is ignored by chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Set chrome's default font(Under the Hood|Web content) to a non-Japanese   font that has font linking enabled in Windows. I used Segoe UI.  2. Display webpages containing Japanese characters but do not specify a   font for the characters (for example  google search result)  3. Independently  all text input controls(textbox  textarea  etc.) have   similar defect(not using font linking). See below for further explanation.      The Japanese font specified in the font linking settings should be used to   render the webpage.      A Chinese font was used to render the Japanese Chinese characters(see below   for explanation) on the page  instead of the Japanese font.    <b>Please provide
