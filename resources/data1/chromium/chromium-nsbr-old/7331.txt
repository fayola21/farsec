<title>Issue 7331 -   chromium -    Expansion of remaining tabs takes a while when closing many tabs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open many tabs by using the '+' icon until size of each tab is reduced   from the default width (the more tabs you have the better you'll see the   problem)  2. Middle click on any tab (but not the right-most one) to close it.  3. Notice that tabs move over to the left and can take ~5 seconds to   expand.  4. Clicking '+' or closing the right-hand window speeds things along.        - Tabs smaller than the max-tab width expand as soon as space is available.      - Depending on user behaviour tab expansion can be delayed by upto 5   seconds.
