<title>Issue 10649 -   chromium -    .py files not handled as executables when downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   - Download a .py file;     What is the expected output?   - A dialog asking me if I want to download a potentially dangerous file    like that shown when you download an .exe file.    What do you see instead?  - The .py will be treated as any other non-executable file and start   downloading immediately. When you click on it in Chrome  it will be   executed (assuming you have python installed).    The same is probably true for other scripting languages  such as Perl    Ruby  etc... Maybe this applies to bash scripts on linux as well? </pre>
