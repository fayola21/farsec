<title>Issue 12587 -   chromium -    Consider using DirectDraw to manage the RenderWidgetHost's backingstore. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Consider using DirectDraw to manage the RenderWidgetHost's backingstore.    Since we only ever push bitmaps into this backingstore and push this   backingstore to the screen  this seems like a perfect candidate for using   DirectDraw.    This will give the OS the ability to manage our backingstores  storing them   in gpu memory if possible or in system memory if necessary.    If DirectDraw fails to initialize for some reason  then we can always   fallback to our existing code. </pre>
