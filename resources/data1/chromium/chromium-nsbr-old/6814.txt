<title>Issue 6814 -   chromium -    [omnibox] omnibox should auto-detect writing direction and act on that - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;see b/1170405&gt;    In other browsers  since the search box and the url box are separate    things are easy:  the search box is RTL by default while the URL box is LTR by default.    However  since we combine both together  we end up having either entering   URL's or searching being really awkward.  The way to solve it would be to auto-detect the directionality of the text   entered  and switched dynamically  similar to what is done in the   google.co.il query box.   </pre>
