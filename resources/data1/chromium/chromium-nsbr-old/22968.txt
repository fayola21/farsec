<title>Issue 22968 -   chromium -    Order of &quot;open in new window&quot; and &quot;open in new tab&quot; options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Right click menu option for opening new tab and opening new window   seems to be reversed as compared to other browsers. In Safari or FF (Mac)    you get &quot;open in new window&quot; as the first option  followed by &quot;open in new   tab&quot;. I have a trained muscle memory to right click and pick the second   item. I also use multiple browsers at once. It's a bit annoying to have to   keep tap of which browser I'm using when trying to open things up in new   tab or new window.                    <b>Please provide
