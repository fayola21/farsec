<title>Issue 15510 -   chromium -    Chrome steals focus from Quick Search Box in Google Desktop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.190.4 (Official Build 19293)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK  Chromium 2.0.160.0 (Developer Build 9042): OK      1. Open Chrome on a Windows XP machine where Google Desktop is installed.  2. With Chrome as the active window in the foreground  hit CTRL-CTRL        The Quick Search Box should appear for Google Desktop.        The Quick Search Box briefly appears  then quickly vanishes again.      Clicking the Quick Search Button on the taskbar next to the start menu or   double-clicking the icon in the systray works in displaying the Quick   Search Box in front of the Chrome window.  So  it is specifically the   keyboard shortcut of CTRL-CTRL which is causing the problem. It appears   that Chrome is quickly trying to steal focus  which results in the Quick   Search Box going away.    For reference  I am using Google Desktop 5.8.0811.04345-en-pb on a Windows   XP professional machine.  I have reproduced this problem on two different   machines with a similar configuration.     </pre>
