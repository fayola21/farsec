<title>Issue 1514 -   chromium -    Drag &amp; drop folder of urls into bookmark toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. On Windows Vista Ultimate x64  I have a folder containing only .url   files.  Go to this folder in Explorer and drag and drop it into Chrome's   Bookmark toolbar (Ctrl-B).  2. A link &quot;file:///C:/Users/...&quot; is created  clicking this link goes to the   folder in Chrome and shows the files (like explorer shows the files).      Chrome should realize that a folder is being dropped into the Bookmark   Toolbar and create a &quot;Bookmark Toolbar Folder&quot;.  The links inside the   folder should be added inside the imported &quot;bookmark toolbar folder&quot;    either they be files it doesn't understand (not imported) or .url browser   links (imported).      Instead it creates a link to that folder.  You can not &quot;expand&quot; the folder   from Chrome to see what is inside  you can only click the link and it will   open the folder contents in the main browser window.    Please provide
