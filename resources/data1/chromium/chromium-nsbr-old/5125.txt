<title>Issue 5125 -   chromium -    Chromium continuous builds need the build number in the directory and zipfile name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download a continuous build from: <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/</a>  2. They are all named &quot;chrome-win32.zip&quot; and unzip into a folder named &quot;chrome-win32&quot;    This is very annoying when trying to keep track of multiple builds  and saving copies of   previous builds for retesting.  I am already renaming the zip files to &quot;chrome-win32_nnnn.zip&quot;   with the build number and extracting into a similarly named directory to keep track of the   versions.    The continuous builds need to be created in a directory name that contains the build number   and zipped into a file with the build number  so this doesn't have to be done manually when   downloading. </pre>
