<title>Issue 1215 -   chromium -    crash during uninstall confirm should not prevent uninstall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27    A number of users are reporting crashes when they launch Google Chrome    preventing them from using the browser.  Unfortunately  during our install   process  we launch Google Chrome in order to confirm the uninstall.  Since   it crashes on startup  the confirmation fails and the uninstall fails    leaving them in a state where they can't run and can't uninstall.  We   should detect when the confirmation launch fails and go ahead with the   uninstall without a confirmation.     </pre>
