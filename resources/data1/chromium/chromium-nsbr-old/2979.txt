<title>Issue 2979 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Download bar paint issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download anyfile  2. Close the tab through which the file was downloaded    What is the expected output?   Downloads bar should be closed    What do you see instead?  Looks like it actually gets closed but it's not getting cleared on the   closing the tab. Resizing the browser will make it disappear.    This works fine with 149.30 but not with 153.1       </pre>
