<title>Issue 1568 -   chromium -    Mouse cursor doesn't change back to normal when mousing over the QuickTime Plug-in. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open &quot;<a href="http://www.americangirl.com/tips/test/quicktime.html">http://www.americangirl.com/tips/test/quicktime.html</a>&quot;  2. Run &quot;javascript:void(document.body.style.overflow=&quot;hidden&quot;);&quot; in address   bar to eliminate scrollbars if showing (or any other method).  3. Resize width of browser window until the right window border is over top   of the QuickTime plugin (see screenshot if this doesn't make sense)  4. Place cursor over right border until horizontal resize mouse cursor   shows.  5. Move cursor directly onto the QuickTime plug-in (there can't be any   extra space).  6. The cursor should stay as the horizontal resize cursor for as long as   your cursor remains in the QuickTime plug-in area.      Mouse cursor should change back to normal mouse pointer.      Mouse cursor stays as the horizontal resize cursor  or whatever cursor you   have immediately before you mouseover into a QuickTime plug-in.    Please provide
