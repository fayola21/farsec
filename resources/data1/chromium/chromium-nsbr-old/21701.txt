<title>Issue 21701 -   chromium -    Backspace in address bar during autocomplete doesn't work as expected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.206.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25285">r25285</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): i686  window manager : gnome metacity            1. Type the first letter of an address which auto completes  e.g. facebook  2. After one or two letters  hit backspace because you meant to type a   different letter  e.g if you hit 'f'  but meant to hit 'g' for gmail        Expect to delete the original letter you typed. e.g. if I hit 'f' by   accident and meant to hit 'g' I should only have to hit backspace once to   delete the 'f' before typing the 'g'.        The later part of the auto completion is deleted but not the letter you   typed. e.g. if you type 'f' it will delete the hilighted 'acebook.com'. And   then after typing the letter 'g' you really meant to type you end up with   'fg' in the address bar  so now you have to hit backspace twice to get back   to the beginning to start typing what you meant to type in the first place.    </pre>
