<title>Issue 18763 -   chromium -    If ISP hijacks DNS  every omnibox search brings up &quot;Did you mean&quot; infobar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1.  Get on an ISP that hijacks DNS  2.  Try a single-word search from the omnibox  3.  The &quot;Did you mean to go to http://[word]/? infobar appears every time.    Ideally  we'd be able to detect DNS hijacking and change what triggers this   infobar  although I don't know if that's possible. </pre>
