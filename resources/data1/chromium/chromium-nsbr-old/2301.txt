<title>Issue 2301 -   chromium -    Feature : Change background colour of image tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think it would be a good idea to be able to change the colour of the   background of an independent image tab (tab with just an image in it).    I find this would be especially useful when looking at transparent images   that are meant to be looked at on a dark background  it is not possible to   change the background so to be able to see that.    It could be displayed at the bottom of the page as a colour picker or   something  or just an option to change the background colour in the right   click menu. </pre>
