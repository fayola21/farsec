<title>Issue 3586 -   chromium -    Maximized window state not remembered in new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2.149.30 (2200)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a        Firefox 3: works as expected           IE 7: works as expected      1. Maximize your window  2. Press ctrl-n for a new window      New window has the same size as the old window  so it is maximized too.      New window is not maximized. It's not even the same size  it's the   'restore' size of the old window.    Notes:  Perhaps related to  but certainly not a duplicate of <a title="New window size problem with maximized windows." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=727"> issue 727 </a> (which is   about the windows you get from dragging tabs; maximizing these wouldn't   make a lot of sense).     </pre>
