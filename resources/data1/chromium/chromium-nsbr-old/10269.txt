<title>Issue 10269 -   chromium -    Home/End keys only work correctly in the last line of multilined RTL textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This issue was posted about AvitalRoyi's report under <a title="Using keyboard select RTL text: Highlight goes to opposite direction from FF&amp;IE" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8141"> Issue 8141 </a> comment 18  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8141#c18">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8141#c18</a>        Chrome Version       : 2.0.174.0  URLs: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    1. RTL the text area (using Ctrl+RightShift)  2. Type a word (even in an LTR language)  3. Use the Home/End keys... so far so good  4. Type another word in a new line below the first one  5. Use the Home/End keys in that line... so far so good  6. Use the Home/End keys in the first line - the Home key acts the same as   the End key      After deleting the second line (the one that behaves ;) ) it doesn't cause   the first one to function correctly.    After deleting the first line  the one that used to be second still   functions correctly. </pre>
