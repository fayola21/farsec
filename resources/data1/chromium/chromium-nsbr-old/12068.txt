<title>Issue 12068 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Paint issue with native checkboxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chromium 2.0.181.0 (Developer Build 16108)  2. On First Run Dialog  click customize settings  3. Now  uncheck the first option     What is the expected output?   The remaining check boxes should still be rendered     What do you see instead?  They disappear. Only hovering the mouse in that area  renders them again    This happened on Vista. Please see the screenshot   </pre>
