<title>Issue 2730 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't work with multiple desktops and terminal sessions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.30             Safari 3: FAIL      Firefox 3: FAIL           IE 7: OK      1. download and run Desktops.exe from Sysinternals:  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx</a>  ~ run Google Chrome on one desktop  ~ switch to another desktop and run Google Chrome  ~ Google Chrome will terminate on the first desktop  ~ run it again on the first desktop  ~ it will terminate on the second    During the same test:  ~ Internet Explorer 7 is OK;  ~ Safari 3 refused to start (silent);  ~ Firefox 3 refused to start  shows an error.    The tests were performed on Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 SP2.  A user account with Administrative rights was used.      2. A similar issue tested on a Windows 2003 Remote desktop for administration mode.  ~ An Administrator creates two remote desktop sessions on the same server or  ~ Two Administrators [A and B]  each creates a remote desktop session on the same server  ~ Starting Google Chrome on one terminal session [A] will terminate it on the other [B].    During the same test:  ~ Internet Explorer 7 is OK;  ~ Safari 3 is OK;  ~ Firefox 3 refused to start  shows an error.      3. javascript:alert(navigator.language); // always returns &quot;en-US&quot;  this causes web pages to display in English  instead of the user's prefered language that can be   configured under: Options  Fonts and Languages  Languages.  For example  configure windows (Control Panel  Regional and Language Options) and the Browser   with a Bulgarian locale and visit these web sites:  ~ <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">http://www.firefox.com/</a> -- this site supports many languages  ~ <a href="http://gfc.my.contact.bg/">http://gfc.my.contact.bg/</a> -- this site supports Bulgarian [bg] and English    During the same test:  ~ Internet Explorer 7 is OK: navigator.language=bg (depends on browser's configuration);  ~ Safari 3 FAIL: language=en-US (always);  ~ Firefox 3 FAIL: language=en-US (depend on about:config  general.useragent.locale  but   changing this setting will cause Firefox to stop working if restarted).        1. Allow Google Chrome to run on multiple desktops without restrictions;  2. Allow Google Chrome to run on multiple terminal sessions without restrictions;  3. Fix navigator.language to point to the user's prefered locale.      1. Starting on one desktop terminates the browser from another  2. Starting on one terminal session terminates the browser from another  3. navigator.language always returns &quot;en-US&quot;    Please watch the video clip that demonstrates issues 1 and 2. It should play in QuickTime;   MPlayer and others.    </pre>
