<title>Issue 5267 -   chromium -    Need some &quot;you've been updated&quot; indication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we push out a (major?) update  we need some way of telling people that   they've been updated (and perhaps what that update includes  e.g. new   features).    Firefox does this via a new tab saying &quot;You've been updated&quot;  I can't   remember what IE did when I went from 6-&gt;7  but I think the first tab I saw   had something. There are multiple ways to do this  we should just be   careful not to be annoying. </pre>
