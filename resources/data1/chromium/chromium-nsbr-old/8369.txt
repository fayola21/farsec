<title>Issue 8369 -   chromium -    Ctrl+G and F3 work  up/down arrows disabled when find-in-page reactivated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 2.0.168.0 (Developer Build 10885)        Precondition: have a page with multiple instances of a search string.    1. Open a web page.   2. Ctrl+F to bring up find-in-page.  3. Type in a search string.  4. Hit down-arrow to advance to next instance of string in page.  5. Esc to close find-in-page.  6. Ctrl+F to bring up find-in-page again.    What is the expected output?     Ctrl+G  F3  and up/down arrows should work.    What do you see instead?    Ctrl+G and F3 work  but up/down arrows are disabled.    For consistency  they should all be enabled.   </pre>
