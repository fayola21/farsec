<title>Issue 7839 -   chromium -    Optimize FTS queries to not use OFFSET so much - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our one and only FTS query is this:   SELECT url  title  time  offsets(pages)  body   FROM pages LEFT OUTER JOIN info ON pages.rowid = info.rowid   WHERE pages MATCH ? AND time &gt;= ? AND time &lt; ?   ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT ?&quot;    Scott says:     Great  I think that your join probably will traverse things in optimal  fashion.  Definitely should if time isn't indexed.    Note that offsets() may be expensive if you have a lot of matches  which are being discarded by the constraints on 'time'.  You could  perhaps rephrase things using subselects.  I think the breakpoint is  probably if it throws around half the results away.  [Of course  if  it's good enough  leave it alone.  offsets() is expensive in this way  due to an implementation decision  it only matters if you throw more  than half away due to a different implementation decision  so fts7 may  totally turn the situation on its head :-).]   </pre>
