<title>Issue 4977 -   chromium -    Error report window keeps popping up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make Chrome crash (or sometimes Chrome thinks it crashed when it didn't)  2. A window will appear saying &quot;Chrome has crashed  do you want to restart   it?&quot; or whatnot.  Clicking &quot;no&quot; will make an error report window pop up (it   doesn't matter whether or not I click send or don't send).  3. The &quot;Chrome has crashed  do you want to restart it?&quot; window STAYS THERE    and if I want  I can summon a horde of error report windows by clicking   &quot;no&quot; a lot.      When I click &quot;no&quot; in the window asking me if I want to restart chrome it   should disappear  and nothing should happen after that.      The window asking me if I want to restart chrome never leaves (unless I do   so) and clicking &quot;no&quot; will just make an error report window pop up.    Please provide
