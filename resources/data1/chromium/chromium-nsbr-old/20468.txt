<title>Issue 20468 -   chromium -    WindowsVista64Bitproblem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  Well i downloaded the beta version of google chrome and it didnt install   properly for my Windows Vista Home Premium 64 Bit Operating System. At the   end of the installation it popped up with an error that it wasnt compatible   with Windows 64 Bit. In the future I would like to see it compatible with   this and maybe even different operating systems. Currently im using chromium   and love it but just wanted to test out Chrome. I hope you can resolve this   issue in the near future.    </pre>
