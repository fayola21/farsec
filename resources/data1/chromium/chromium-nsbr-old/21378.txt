<title>Issue 21378 -   chromium -    Reenable NOTREACHED in Focus Manager GTK code (toolkitviews)  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because we are temporarily mix-matching some pure Gtk code and view codes   for the options window  some widgets cannot find any associated FocusManager   (which is expected  since the top window is not a WidgetGtk).  In order to allow this to work  some NOTREACHEDs have been commented out in:  NativeControlGtk::CallFocusIn() (native_control_gtk.cc)  FocusManager::GetFocusManagerForNativeView() (focus_manager_gtk.cc)    They should be reenabled when the option page has been fully ported to   views. </pre>
