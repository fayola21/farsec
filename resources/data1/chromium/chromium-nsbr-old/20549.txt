<title>Issue 20549 -   chromium -    PageUp in at top of multi-line text box scrolls page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.202.2 (Official Build 23795) on linux  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com          Firefox 3.x: OK        4.0.202.0 on mac: OK      1. go to gmail.com  2. reply to a message with a long thread  3. in the compose box  hit PageDown to page down a few times  4. hit PageUp a few times to go back to the top        Page up to the top of the text box  then stop.    (Hitting pageup repeatedly in a multiline text box should get me to the top   of the text box  not scroll the page.)          Page up the top of the text box  and then when it's at the top  the next   PageUp scrolls the window.    PageDown at the bottom behaves the same way. </pre>
