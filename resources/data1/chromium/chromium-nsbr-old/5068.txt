<title>Issue 5068 -   chromium -    Windows title bar elements showing through in Bookmark Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome: 0.4.154.31 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6264">r6264</a>)    Note: this doesn't seem to occur on trunk (I also tested on Chromium  0.5.155.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6246">r6246</a>)).  And it occurs regardless of whether the command-line  flag --magic_browzR or --use-old-frames is used.        1. Ctrl+Shift+B to open Bookmark Manager.  2. Cover up the Bookmark Manager window with another window. For some  reason  it seems to occur only when the other window is not a Chrome window.  3. Uncover the Bookmark Manager window.  4. Right-click on the title bar of the Bookmark Manager window.      What is the expected output?     Should see Bookmark Manager title bar painted correctly.    What do you see instead?    Windows title bar elements  such as Window Management buttons (Minimize   Restore  Close) are showing through.    See attached picture </pre>
