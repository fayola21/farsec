Right arrow to the wrench menu.  3. Down arrow to 'Clear browsing data...'. Hit Enter to activate.  4. Tab through the fields  using a tool like Inspect32 to track focus and view the exposed MSAA   information.        Issues:  1. No labels for form fields.The labels connected to the form fields are not programmatically   connected to the corresponding field. Expected behavior: get_accName for each form field will   return the label string.  2. MSAA focus cannot get to the checkboxes.     </pre>
