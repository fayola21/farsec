<title>Issue 4023 -   chromium -    Trying to install Plugins crashes Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to dr.dk or danskebank.dk without Flash or Java plugins installed   while behind a restrictive firewall  2. Try to download and install the plugin  3. Download and install fails.  Chrome crashes when the plugin fails to   install.    When trying to download plugins from behind a restrictive firewall (which   may be preventing their download at all)  Chrome crashes.    The expectation is that the user will download and install the plugin  and   Chrome does not crash if the plugin install fails.  If the install does   fail  the expectation is that Chrome will not crash.    Screenshots of the problem are attached. </pre>
