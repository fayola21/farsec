<title>Issue 633 -   chromium -    Refresh Button Missing From Context Menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27             Safari 3: N/A      Firefox 3: N/A           IE 7: N/A      1. Right click on a page.       What is the expected result? When right clicking on a page  I would expect   to have a option to 'Refresh' in the context menu.      What happens instead? There is no 'Refresh' option in the context menu. Not   sure if this is by design or not  but other browsers have always had this   option available.      </pre>
