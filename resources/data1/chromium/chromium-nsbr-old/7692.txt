<title>Issue 7692 -   chromium -    Closed windows should add their tabs to the recently-closed tab stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new window  2. Open sites in various tabs  3. Close the window      That Ctrl-Shift-T or the tab list on the blank page would recover the tabs   from the closed window.      I have to figure out what I had open (re-google  find all the useful search   results  try to remember the path I took on each).  Or use the history.    Please provide
