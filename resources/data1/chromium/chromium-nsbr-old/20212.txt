<title>Issue 20212 -   chromium -    Opera Style Tab Selection Menu Accessible with Right Click + Scroll Wheel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This Opera  feature allows lightning fast  easy navigation of tabs even   when the user has many of them.    I regularly have 50-100 tabs open per window and I've found that it's   simply impossible to work effectively with so many tabs without this   feature.    This menu appears when the user holds the right mouse button and moves the   scroll wheel.  It lists the full title of every tab in a simple list  one   column vertical list.  The user moves through the list using the mouse   scroll wheel.  When the right button is released the browser displays the   tab that was selected.      Tabs are ordered by the time the user last viewed their corresponding page.    As a result  the tab order constantly changes as the user navigates through   different tabs.  It may seem confusing but it's absolutely the most   important feature of this menu.  It facilitates quick access to the pages   that have been most recently used.    If there are more tabs than will fit in menu then it transitions from a   single vertical column into a multicolumn list where each column is &quot;older&quot;   than the one to the right.    This UI feature is unmatched IMHO.  I have been searching for a comparable   mechanism (for Firefox) and have found nothing that can compare.    The scroll wheel tab popup should be a common feature on all browsers just   like forward and back buttons.    Sorry this is entered as a defect.  There is no option for feature request   on this form. </pre>
