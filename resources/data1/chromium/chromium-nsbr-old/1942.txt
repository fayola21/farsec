<title>Issue 1942 -   chromium -    Location redirects not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Product Version      : 0.2.149.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">http://dwm.suckless.org</a>          Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Visit the above URL with Chrome        The website uses thttpd and an el cheapo redirect cgi script which looks   like this:    #!/bin/sh  echo &quot;301 Moved&quot;  echo &quot;Location: <a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm">http://www.suckless.org/dwm</a>&quot;  echo  echo &quot;Redirected to &lt;a   href='<a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm'&gt;http://www.suckless.org/dwm&lt;/a&gt;">http://www.suckless.org/dwm'&gt;http://www.suckless.org/dwm&lt;/a&gt;</a>&quot;    Hence  this script sends:    301 Moved  Location: &lt;new location&gt;    &lt;a href=...    to the browser  which usually leads to the result that the browser   initiates a GET request using the new location instead.     IMHO it shouldn't be related to missing r's in the line terminators  but   it might be an idea to debug the issue if 301's aren't handled correctly.    The script is an old technique which used to work in browsers long before   Google even existed. Maybe there are reasons why the chromium team decided   against it  in this case please let me know your reasons.        You get an error claiming &quot;This web page is not available.&quot;     </pre>
