<title>Issue 3489 -   chromium -    Sometimes can't switch to Chinese input mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3          Input method should work.      Sometimes input method in Chrome falls into an error state: when the focus   is in a Chrome edit box  I press Ctrl-Space or Ctrl-Shift  but only English   chars can be inputted. The Windows language bar in the Windows tool bar   correctly shows the input method state when I press Ctrl-Space or Ctrl-  Shift  but when the Google PinYin icon shows  the Google PinYin floating   bar doesn't show. Input method works well in other applications are good at   the time.    For now I know the following two ways to leave the error state:  1. Restart Chrome;  2. Switch to another language by clicking the language name icon in the   Windows language bar  and then switch back.    For now I don't know how to let Chrome enter the error state. I'll provide   additional information if I find. I'll also try other input methods other   than Google Pinyin. </pre>
