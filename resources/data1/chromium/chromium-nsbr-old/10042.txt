<title>Issue 10042 -   chromium -    Can't select &quot;Sending usage statistics  and Crash reports &quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk(r 13595)    User can't select the option &quot;Sending usage statistics and crash reports&quot; in   Chrome Options/Under the Hood tab.    -Select this option and restart Chromium.  Notice the option is disabled even after restart.    I guess it should be P0 ??   </pre>
