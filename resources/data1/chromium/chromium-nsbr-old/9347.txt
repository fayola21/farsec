<title>Issue 9347 -   chromium -    Browser unusable with assertions enabled due to SSL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I run with assertions enabled.    With Gmail open  I get a continuous stream of assertions for    SSLClientSocketWin::DoPayloadEncrypt: DCHECK(user_buf_len_ &gt; 0);    and Channel::ChannelImpl::ProcessConnection NOTREACHED(); on line 228 which   may or may not be related. </pre>
