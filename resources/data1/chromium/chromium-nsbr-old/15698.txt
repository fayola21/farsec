<title>Issue 15698 -   chromium -    Toggling &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature gets confused on KDE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.0 (19630)  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy 8.04.2  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A      1. Disable &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature  2. Enable &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature  3. Hold left ALT key and click to drag the window  4. Disable &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature  5. Enable &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature        The KDE window decorations should show if and only if the &quot;Use system title bar and   borders&quot; feature is enabled.        The window decorations start out showing  since the &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot;   feature is enabled by default. Turning the feature off makes them disappear correctly  and   enables the Windows-like decorations. However  re-enabling the feature does not make the   KDE decorations re-appear. Instead  the window is left without either KDE or Windows-like   decorations.    Holding ALT and clicking to drag the window makes the KDE decorations reappear  but this   only works the first time the &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; feature is toggled. If   disabled and re-enabled again  the window is permanently left without KDE decorations.   (Although disabling the feature does show the Windows-like decorations reliably.)    I am using the Plastik KDE theme. </pre>
