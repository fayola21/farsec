<title>Issue 6795 -   chromium -    Messed-up port handling in autocomplete parser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When ParseServerInfo() is given the string &quot;http://a:b it marks &quot;b&quot; as a   port.  Per brettw this is intentional; the parser validates nothing.    This comes up via the fixer upper which can hand GURL strings like this to   try and decode.  The effect on users is that some things that they type in   to the omnibox that aren't URLs get marked as URLs even though they can't   be opened.  Maybe SegmentURL() needs to be able to mark this sort of thing   as a failure?  Can I call CanonicalizeUrl() or do I want to allow some   invalid stuff through?  Not sure...   </pre>
