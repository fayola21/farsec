<title>Issue 8995 -   chromium -    Resume interrupted requests from partial cache entries using byte range requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should be able to resume an interrupted request for a large resource  by using a byte range request to append to the partial entry in our cache.  This scenario can happen when you click a link on a page while some  embedded images are still being received  and then you click the Back  button.    Note: this feature is not to be confused with the ability to resume an  interrupted large download in the download manager. </pre>
