<title>Issue 17828 -   chromium -    RenderProcessHost IDs shouldn't be PIDs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We track a number of things through the RenderProcessHost ID  and some of   these places expect the number to be valid for all time.    For example  for close requests  the RenderProcessHost ID is sent to the   renderer  and used to look up the correct ID of the RPH when it gets back   to the I/O thread of the browser. We detect that the process no longer   exists by whether there is a match. But the host OS could conceivably re-  use the same PID  meaning we would close a random tab.    There is also some ugly hack code in browser_render_process_host.cc to   generate fake IDs for when we're running in single-process mode.    Instead  we should use unique IDs like we do for RenderViewHosts  ones that   are not associated with the PID of the process. </pre>
