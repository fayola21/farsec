<title>Issue 5942 -   chromium -    news.walla.co.il: Hebrew text layed out mirrored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL: <a href="http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/93/1363831">http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/93/1363831</a>  Webkit bug: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22014">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22014</a>    Other Browsers:  IE6: OK  FF3: OK    Problem description:   In Chrome  the text of the main article body is displayed mirrored.    Discussion:    The underlying issue is that they are serving different versions of their  webpage for each browser. In this case saving the page source served to FF  &amp; IE and loading it into Chrome works fine.    When accessed from Safari and Opera they are outputting the problematic  text in visual order  both FF &amp; IE6 get the text in logical order wrapped  in a &lt;span dir=rtl&gt;.    My guess is that if a browser isn't identified by them as FF or IE they  assume that it can't display logical Hebrew and output the main article  text in visual order. </pre>
