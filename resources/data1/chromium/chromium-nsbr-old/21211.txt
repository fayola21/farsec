<title>Issue 21211 -   chromium -    Toolbar hottracking hot state is not correct for the initial traversal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit SHIFT+ALT+T to set keyboard focus to the toolbar.        Toolbar button should have a slight bevel (HOT button state)  same look when   hovered over with a mouse. Currently  there is no effect  but there is   effects when you goto the next state  by traversing it with the right/left   arrow keys.    Something is wrong with the initial focus for buttons. </pre>
