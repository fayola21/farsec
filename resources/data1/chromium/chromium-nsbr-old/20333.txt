<title>Issue 20333 -   chromium -    automatically highlight the words I used on my recent web search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request;    I wish that chrome would automatically highlight in the page the words I   used on my recent google search.    Today  I often find myself:    1. Googling &quot;kittens&quot;    2. for each of the result links:       2.1. click on link       2.2. Ctrl+F       2.3. type &quot;kittens&quot; again  Enter       2.4. scroll to the highlighted text       2.5. if I like the result then exit  else click &quot;back&quot;     Chrome could make this easier by automatically finding and highlighting   previously googled text:    1. Googling &quot;kittens&quot;    2. for each of the result links:        2.1. click on the link        2.2. scroll to the highlighted text        2.3. if I like the result then exit  else click &quot;back&quot;     This should applies to any search typed into one box  not just google.     Complications arise around sensing when the user stopped searching  and   how to handle multi-word searches and engine-specific formats.    </pre>
