<title>Issue 7606 -   chromium -    NTP focus gain painting flicker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Marking this pri 2 only because I don't know if there's a more general   issue here.    Open a new tab page.  Click in the page and hit tab; now the first   thumbnail should be selected.  Now click in the address bar.  Note the   focus ring doesn't disappear from the page.  Mouseover the page and notice   that it immediately repaints to show no focus rect. </pre>
