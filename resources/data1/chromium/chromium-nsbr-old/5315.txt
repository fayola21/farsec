<title>Issue 5315 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager starts search on third letter (as opposed to first) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. I open the Bookmark Manager  2. I search for one of my bookmarks:     For example  I have a bookmark &quot;Windows Development Tips&quot;  3. I type into the search box: w i n    As I type  these are the number of matches:    w  : 0 matches  wi : 0 matches  win: 1 match (my bookmark)    I expect it to find more than 0 matches and then drill down to this one   bookmark as I add more search letters. </pre>
