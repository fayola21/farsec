<title>Issue 412 -   chromium -    Crash of flash (or blank space) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Opening 2 youtube videos (happened also with one)  2. Fullscreen one of the videos  3. exit from fullscreen flash (and switching to tab with second video)      It shouldn't crash (or show blank place). It should be shown all the time.      Flash crashes or it shows blank place where flash app should be.   Additionally whole chrome (so not just a single tab) freezes for a couple   of seconds before showing crash error.    Please provide
