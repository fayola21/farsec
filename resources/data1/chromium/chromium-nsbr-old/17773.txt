<title>Issue 17773 -   chromium -    options dialog says chrome and chromium are both the default browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> on my home box (kubuntu 9.04/kde 4.2) both google-chrome 3.0.195.1 and a ToT   build of chromium claim to be my default browser. KDE's Default Applications   dialog reports that google-chrome is the actual default browser.    On a (perhaps) related note  google-chrome is the only one that freezes for   15 seconds when I open the options dialog  presumably grinding away on the   IsDefaultBrowser() call. But that is a different bug.    Would be nice to sort this out for beta but it's not really all that crucial   because most people won't have both chromium and chrome installed. </pre>
