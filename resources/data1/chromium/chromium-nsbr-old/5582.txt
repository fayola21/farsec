<title>Issue 5582 -   chromium -    Remove duplicate certs from 'tools/python/google/httpd_config' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We store duplicate certificates in 'net/data/ssl/certificates' and   'tools/python/google/httpd_config' for convenience.  Instead of duplicating   them  we should change the lighttpd config to get the .pem file(s) from the   former directory  allowing us to remove the duplicates from the latter. </pre>
