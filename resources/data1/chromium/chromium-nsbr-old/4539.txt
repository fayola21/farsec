<title>Issue 4539 -   chromium -    view-source makes a new request when a page is not cacheable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a page is not cacheable (e.g. if it's served with HTTP response as  shown below)  viewing the source of the page leads to a new http request.     ----------------------  HTTP/1.0 200 OK  Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/2.4.3  Date: Tue  18 Nov 2008 02:11:55 GMT  Content-type: text/html  Pragma: no-cache  Cache-Control: private  no-cache  must-revalidate  no-store  Last-Modified: Tue  18 Nov 2008 02:11:55GMT  --------------    Firefox and Safari do not make a new request even in that case.     According to Eric   view-source grabs the html source from the http cache  and pretty-prints it  but for the page NOT in http cache  it's 'forced to'  make a new request. If we  pull the content from renderer  we can avoid  extra load for view-source.     </pre>
