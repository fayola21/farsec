<title>Issue 7402 -   chromium -    Page not getting proper focus when using application mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.159.0  URLs (if applicable) : Any that require focus  Other browsers tested: Only applicable to Chromium/Chrome      1. Visit any site  especially one which should have keyboard shortcuts such   as Gmail.  (If testing Gmail  make sure keyboard shortcuts are turned on.)    2. Choose to Create application shortcuts to create a shortcut on the   desktop.    3. Double-click on the desktop icon and leave the mouse alone.    4. Once Gmail loads in the window  try hitting any key which should respond   with a keyboard shortcut in the web application.  (i.e.  in Gmail  try   hitting the forward-slash key which is supposed to set the focus in the   search box)        *** The keyboard shortcut should be recognized immediately.        *** It never works.  If  however  you click into the page somewhere OR you   hit tab once or twice  it starts working.  I presume there is some sort of   focus in the non-existent address bar  or the focus is on the window itself   and not in the page being displayed within the window.   </pre>
