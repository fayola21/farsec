<title>Issue 22351 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Streaming videos on gomtv.net abort midway through - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://www.gomtv.net/classics3/vod/990">http://www.gomtv.net/classics3/vod/990</a> .  When you visit the page    the streaming video will begin to load (but not autoplay).  Click   the &quot;fullscreen&quot; button in the lower right corner of the video player and   hover the seek bar so you can watch it fill.    The expected behavior is that the bar will fill continuously all the way   to the right.  What actually happens is that the bar fills most of the   way  but right about when it's under the final &quot;t&quot; in the   white &quot;gomtv.net&quot; message above it  it suddenly jumps to the end.  If you   now try to play the video  and seek to just before this point  then when   you reach it  the video will halt.  If you try to seek after it  the video   will reset.    This is either a regression in 4.0.211.2 or the site itself is broken   server-side  because this worked a few days ago.  I think this has to do   with the network data stream getting cut off  but I'm not sure how to   check.  Also not sure who owns this so I've CCed a few different people.    Note: This works fine in IE (although the fullscreen video playback there   is not as smooth as in Chrome). </pre>
