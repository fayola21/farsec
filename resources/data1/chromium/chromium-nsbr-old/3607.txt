<title>Issue 3607 -   chromium -    date.toLocaleString   toLocaleDateString and toLocaleTimeString are not locale-dependent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.3.154.3 (Official Build 3339)  URLs (if applicable) : see attached HTML           Chrome: FAIL       Safari 3: 50% pass         Opera 9: OK      Firefox 3: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Run the attached HTML test case  which basically runs:        new Date().toLocaleDateString()        new Date().toLocaleTimeString()      On Windows  output locale date and time strings formatted according to   Control Panel &gt; Regional and Language Options &gt; Regional Options      Chrome displays a 3-character string for day-of-week and displays 24-hour   format for the time.  At least  Safari gets the date display correct    although it also incorrectly displays 24-hour time.  (See attached   screenshot)     </pre>
