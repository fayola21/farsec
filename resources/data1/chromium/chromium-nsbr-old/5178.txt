<title>Issue 5178 -   chromium -    Regression: Inspected nodes no longer highlighted in the inspector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The inspector no longer is highlighting inspected nodes. This is something   that was a casualty of the recent big WebKit merge.    In the old code  ScrollView::paint used to call   ScrollView::ScrollViewPrivate::highlightInspectedNode to highlight using   Skia.    The new code doesn't have this function - hence  no highlight.    For inspiration  you might want to take a look at   WebFrameImpl::AddMarker(WebCore::Range* range)  which uses the DocumentMarker::TextMatch to highlight text.  </pre>
