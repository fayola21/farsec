<title>Issue 2242 -   chromium -    Accessibility UI tests should not use global FindWindow/EnumWindows etc functions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The accessibility UI test utils in accessibility_util.cc use global window   searching functions. This means these tests will be flaky when other Chrome   windows are open on the same computer. e.g. an engineer running the UI   tests may get unpredictable results because the UI test will connect to   his/her running _release_ build window instead of the test window!    The tests should use a function like EnumThreadWindows to enumerate only   the windows of the child process that was started. </pre>
