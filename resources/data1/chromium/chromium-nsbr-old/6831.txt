<title>Issue 6831 -   chromium -    Printer: Should print contents in Inspector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> --Navigate to any webpage.  --Bring up Inspector and click any where to turn into Chrome window.  --Click on Throbber and say Print from the Drop-down.    Notice: It only prints Top listed icons &quot;Elements&quot;  &quot;Resources&quot;    &quot;Databases&quot;. It won't print contents of the Inspector.    Note that Safari can't print the Web Inspector at all.    ---    Usability for the 3 persons in the world who would like that. It's more a   consistency issue. </pre>
