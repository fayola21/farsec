<title>Issue 3000 -   chromium -    Move AutoUnlock into conditional_variable_win - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> AutoUnlock was reported to be incorrect on Posix (I didn't verify).  Either   way  conditional_variable_win is the only user  and I feel it's not a great   interface that should be exposed or used in general parts of our codebase.    The cases in conditional_variable_win seems like they could easily just be   a manual Release() / Acquire().  If AutoUnlock is really helpful there    then we should move into just conditional_variable_win.    Although this isn't a huge priority  would be nice if someone could do this   soon  since there is an external contributor who pointed this out  and is   doing some work on our Lock code. </pre>
