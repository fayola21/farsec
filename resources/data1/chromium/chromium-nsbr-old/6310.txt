<title>Issue 6310 -   chromium -    Form autofill should support alternate input fields also !! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make sure you have checked the option &quot;Form autofill&quot; under Options/Minor  Tweaks tab.    -Navigate to any webpage with alternate input values.   [For eg: advance search at google.com page.]  -Enter three different values for &quot;one or more of these words:&quot; input boxes  and click on 'Advance Search' button  -Navigate to the same page again [step1].  -Set keyboard focus on &quot;one or more of these words:&quot; input boxes and hit  down arrow key.    Expected:   Should suggest the *autofill values.  Result:  Nothing happens.    FF3.x: Behaves as expected. I mean suggest values entered in these input boxes.  IE 7.x: Same as Chrome.  Safari 3.x: IT has different behavior.  It suggests the value entered in the last input box in all of the three  input boxes.  I guess we should support FF3.x behavior.   </pre>
