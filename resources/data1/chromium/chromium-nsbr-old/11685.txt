<title>Issue 11685 -   chromium -    Stop using std::string in browser_theme_provider - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We use global std::strings in browser theme provider  but can't just convert   them to char* because GCC (mac/linux) thinks they're unused (they're only   used by the extensions). There's probably a way to disable the warning  but   in the interests of tree-greening  I'm just reverting to std::string. </pre>
