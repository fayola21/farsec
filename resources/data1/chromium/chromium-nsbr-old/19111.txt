<title>Issue 19111 -   chromium -    HTML5 video elements should have a thin border by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.201.0 (dev build 23024)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/public/test-html5.html">http://jeff.ecchi.ca/public/test-html5.html</a>    This is purely polish  but we should have a subtle border around videos   (perhaps 1px solid black?). As you can see in the example page  videos that   have lots of white contents will not display well and appear to be floating in    mid-air.    I think this could be a good usability improvement  and webmasters could   perhaps override it with CSS if they don't want a border. </pre>
