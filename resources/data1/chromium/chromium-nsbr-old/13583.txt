<title>Issue 13583 -   chromium -    Some (Google Made) extensions not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.183.1    Other browsers tested: None                1. Download &quot;Subscribe in Google Reader&quot; from   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples</a>  (Also &quot;Page Rank for Chrome  but it is not Google Made   <a href="http://www.vasanth.in/software/page-rank-for-chrome/">http://www.vasanth.in/software/page-rank-for-chrome/</a>)  2. Check bottom of page (mouse over toolstrip  or blank area on tool strip   if other extensions installed)  3. See that &quot;Subscribe in Google Reader&quot; appears to be there  but   improperly displayed      See a &quot;Subscribe&quot; button      Nothing  except long title bar for extension on Mouseover    I also have 3 other extensions installed  but these don't appear to cause   the problem.   </pre>
