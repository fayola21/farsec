<title>Issue 18217 -   chromium -    Refactor IPCAudioSource to remove synchronous deletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because IPCAudioSource is used on the hardware thread of the   AudioOutputStream  but deleted on the IO thread of the browser in   AudioRenderHost  there is a race condition during error conditions  and   closing which can cause the browser to crash.    Windows skirts around this because the Stop() method on the WaveOut   implementation of the AudioOutputStream happens to be blocking.  However    that causes another issues...the IO thread can be blocked by closing the   device. </pre>
