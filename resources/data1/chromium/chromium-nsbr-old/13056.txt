<title>Issue 13056 -   chromium -    STYLE attributes multiplying when modified using JavaScript DOM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 2.0.180.0 (Build oficial 15835)  WebKit	530.9  V8	1.2.2.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)  AppleWebKit/530.9 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.180.0 Safari/530.9    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://validable5.appspot.com/chromestylefun.html">http://validable5.appspot.com/chromestylefun.html</a>            Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK        Make a JS function that changes the value of the border of an element. For  example:    document.getElementById(&quot;item&quot;).style.border=&quot;2px&quot;;    Make another function that changes the same value for the same element to a  different value  for example:    document.getElementById(&quot;item&quot;).style.border=&quot;0px&quot;;      Make a way to switch at will between the values (I used onMouseOver and  onMouseOut events)      Monitor the &quot;style&quot; variable for the element as you repeatedly switch the  style.      I was using &quot;style='cursor:default;'&quot; as the only style attribute. The  first time I monitored the variable  it was OK  as that was the only  information being shown (my monitor event triggers before the mouseout event).  The result was -&gt; style = &quot;cursor:default;&quot;        The second time I triggered a mouseover/out sequence  the variable was  style = &quot;cursor: default; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;  border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial;  border-color: initial; &quot;.    The third time it was style = &quot;cursor: default; border-style: initial;  border-color: initial; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;  border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-top-width: 0px;  border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px;  border-style: initial; border-color: initial; &quot;    The result keeps growing forever. It should not be hard to be able to make  a macro that crashes Chrome or at least take a lot of resources from the PC.    Looks like Chrome is not making any comparison between existing default  values  and just making a simple &quot;concat&quot; instead. In fact  the values that  show with the &quot;initial&quot; value  should never be shown  or at least flag them  somehow to be able to identify them easy.    I have uploaded a working example to my app-engine application  you can  check it here:    <a href="http://validable5.appspot.com/chromestylefun.html">http://validable5.appspot.com/chromestylefun.html</a>    Just hover over in/out of the &quot;hover over me!&quot; text on the first line to  start the show.    I hope this helps chrome to improve  it's a great navigator.  P.S: let's please leave my &quot;spaghetti code making skills&quot; aside :P </pre>
