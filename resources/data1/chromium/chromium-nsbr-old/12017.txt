<title>Issue 12017 -   chromium -    Histograms gathered from Renderer should all be gathered before continuing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you visit about:histograms  the system currently tries to get copies   from all renderers  but just does so with a fixed timer.  The system should  actually dispatch requests to all renderers  and then proceed when all of   them have responded.    This should be done for both about:histograms  and when gathering data for   UMA.      Sometimes  when there are many tabs  all data will not instantly be   gathered  and it may be necessary to visit about:histograms more than onec   to get a complete update.  In addition  when there are few histograms (or a   fast processor)  the page should return asap.    Raman Tenneti (na external contributor) has submitted a patch  and I'll   work to land it RSN.     </pre>
