<title>Issue 30645 -   chromium -    Windows 7 Taskbar Issue with Dev Version .266 (Build 33992) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Pin Google Chrome to Taskbar  2. Open Google Chrome with Taskbar icon      Up until this build  Chrome properly minimized to the icon from which it   was launched  and that icon was highlighted with a box when it was running.      A second Chrome icon pops up on the taskbar and is highlighted when Chrome   is running instead of the taskbar icon used to launch Chrome. Needless to   say  minimizing Chrome also minimizes it to this second icon instead of the   appropriate launch icon. </pre>
