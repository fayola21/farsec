<title>Issue 39672 -   chromium -    Unable to lock extensions icons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Add at least two extensions that are put in the extension bar.  2. Remove or deinstall one extension so that only one remain.  3. There is &quot;two&quot; lines so the extension is not locked.        Well  I use nearly no extensions. When I had one  there was no two lines so   that my extension was always locked.    Now  I add another extension and remove it  and my extension bar is no   longer locked  and I can't find any option to make it lock again. Have a   look at the screenshot : <a href="http://tof.canardpc.com/view/a3d9c02d-bf4f-4916-">http://tof.canardpc.com/view/a3d9c02d-bf4f-4916-</a>  a070-d90ea45324a2.jpg    I would like to be able to remove those two lines so that my extension icon   is locked  like this was the case when I had only one extension.          <b>Please provide
