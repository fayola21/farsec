<title>Issue 26400 -   chromium -    Center badges better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the badge is an odd number of pixels wide and the icon is an even number   (or vice versa)  the badge looks funny.    We should force the badge to be have the same odd/even-ness as the icon  by   adding 1px to its right extent when necessary.    This will make the padding around the text uneven  but it is harder to notice   since the text doesn't have as script of a line on the right side.    See attached mocks. </pre>
