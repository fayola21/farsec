<title>Issue 24010 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] Page with chrome meta tag could not be rendered by CF full mode when it is in local file system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Prerequisites:    Chrome Frame full-mode has been installed correctly    Chrome Frame Version:    4.0.208.0 (Developer Build 25978)    Steps:    1. Download the attached cf-activation-meta-tag.html to local.  2. Open it with IE    Issue:    Ideally the html file should be rendered by CF full mode since it has  chrome metag tag  but currently it is opened by IE yet.    We should support this  lets suppose following scenario:    User download a page (with chrome meta tag) which is rendered by CF full  mode and  that page can only be rendered properly by CF. Later when user  open that downloaded page with IE  if the page is rendered by IE  then user  could not see the content as he/she expected.   </pre>
