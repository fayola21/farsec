<title>Issue 38034 -   chromium -    GaiaAuth must die - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GaiaAuth is the libjingle version of our GaiaAuthenticator.  Given that we already authenticate with   Gaia ourselves before starting the notifier  we should be able to remove this  since it just gets   passed the auth token from our authenticator and uses that.    However  GaiaAuth sometimes does authenticate with gaia itself!  I have to track this down  but   basically I think this happens if the auth token is somehow bogus (loaded from disk  password   changed).    Also  talk_auth_task.* and auth_task.*  which uses GaiaAuth  is dead code  I'm pretty sure.    It's worth noting that we would have avoided messing with libjingle even further if we had removed   GaiaAuth earlier. </pre>
