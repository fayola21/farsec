<title>Issue 29584 -   chromium -    extension crashes mac at startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install this extension:  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pfhifmnkpieijjfdlmijncagohajdfmp">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pfhifmnkpieijjfdlmijncagohajdfmp</a>  and the browser will crash (unfortunately it will keep crashing at startup    which is another bug).    amanda looked at it and apparently the crash is in [BrowserFrameView   drawRect:] somewhere. </pre>
