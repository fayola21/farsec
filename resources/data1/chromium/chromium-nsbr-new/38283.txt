<title>Issue 38283 -   chromium -    Make multi-account password filling better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Go to a site where you have 2+ accounts  2.Login with each account and tell Chrome to save your password  3.Logout and go to the login page of the site    You're now presented with the login form filled with the most recent account you've logged into.    This bug actually covers a few issues:  1. verify that one of the accounts will always be filled by default on the login page.  some report   that it's empty at times.    2. verify that the account that's filled by default is the best one for the user.  right now it appears   to be the last one that was filled in for the site.  this will be the best behavior when you're trying   to login after your cookie expires  but the worst when trying to switch accounts.  can we do   anything better?    3. there are reports that after choosing a user name  sometimes the wrong one seems to be   submitted  we should check that there are no strange focus issues etc that would cause this to   happen.    4. finally  for brownie points  on clicking in the username field and giving it focus  rather than   force the user to start typing a username to display options  we should immediately show a   dropdown of all the usernames associated with the site.        </pre>
