<title>Issue 43787 -   chromium -    &quot;Recently closed&quot; from the History menu should re-open tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Close a tab  2. From the History menu  select the closed tab under &quot;Recently closed&quot;    What is the expected output?  The tab should re-open  with the navigation history intact  like choosing &quot;Re-open closed tab&quot;   from the File menu.    What do you see instead?  The current tab navigates to the last page that was open in the recently closed tab.    Re-opening the whole tab would be so much more useful  because it gives the user access to the   full history instead of just the last page  and lets the user directly open tabs closed before the last   one. </pre>
