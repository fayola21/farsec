<title>Issue 40754 -   chromium -    alt-tab between chrome windows on chrome OS puts focus on page menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create two browser windows on chrome os  2. alt-tab from one to the next  3. keyboard focus is now on the &quot;page&quot; menu      I expect  when I focus on a new window  if I begin hitting keys  that the   page -- or maybe the omnibox -- will get my keystrokes (I'm not sure what   the expected behavior is).  Instead  there's a dotted line around the   &quot;page&quot; icon menu  and arrow keys cause the menu to open and such.
