<title>Issue 23222 -   chromium -    Caches old CSS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)    Other browsers tested: None      1. Load a page referencing external CSS stylesheet  2. Close browser  3. Update the CSS  4. Open browser  navigate to page        Updated CSS should be used.        The old  cached CSS is used. Using reload button  updated CSS is used.   Close browser  re-open  old  cached CSS is again used.    Ran wireshark to examine the requests. It appears Chrome makes no effort   to even fetch the CSS files. The only extra requests it sent were for the   javascript files (which returned the 304 not modified http response). </pre>
