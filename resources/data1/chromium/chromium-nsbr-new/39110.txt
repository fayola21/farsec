<title>Issue 39110 -   chromium -    Incognito Window opens up automatically whenever browser crashed  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:  -----  Chrome OS: 0.6.37.0 (Developer build fe1c5b02)  Google chrome: 5.0.360.0 - Official build 42309        1. Login to Chrome OS  2. Open few web pages in 2/3 tabs  3. Crash the browser : about:inducebrowsercrashforrealz  4. Verify that it crashes and tries to open a new window        It should open up a normal window asking to restore the previously closed   window    Currently it directly opens up Incognito Window and it doesn't give option   to restore the previously closed tabs.    Consistently reproable. This doesnot happen on Chrome Linux build.       </pre>
