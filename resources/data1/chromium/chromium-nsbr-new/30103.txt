Create an Extension  3. Attempt to programmatically create/modify/remove a Browser Action.      That there would be an API that would allow one to create/modify/remove   existing Browser Actions for the calling extension.      Browser Actions must be hard-coded in the Extension manifest. They cannot   even be programmatically hidden. </pre>
