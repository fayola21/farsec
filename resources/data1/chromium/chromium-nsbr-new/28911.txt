<title>Issue 28911 -   chromium -    Password manager heuristics fail for sites that keep the login form around after signin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug affects any site where the login form used to sign in is actually   present (but hidden) on the landing page after signin.    e.g: Hulu.com  where the login form is present but hidden on almost every   page.    We don't prompt to save passwords on these sites because we treat re-  appearance of the same form as a failed attempt.  One way to improve our   heuristic would be to send more data about the form so we could detect a   visibility change  and deepen our &quot;did the same form show up?&quot; check so that   &quot;show up&quot; is more &quot;what the user sees&quot; vs &quot;what the HTML parser sees&quot;.     </pre>
