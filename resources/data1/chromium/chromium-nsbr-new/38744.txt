<title>Issue 38744 -   chromium -    Can Google Make a English to Marathi Translator?Is it available there? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi I have just seen a Hindi to English translation suggestion from Google   Chrome.  But I would like to see and use a Marathi to English and Vice versa   translator from Google.  If google can produce it for hindi language it will Easy for it to produce it   For Marathi since both share a common script.  I would strongly recommend Google Team to Create Such a Translator and if   possible typing in Marathi Devanagari in Google Mail Google Chrome (with FONT   support) for Chatting in MARATHI.(Marathi is spoken by over 90 Million   speakers and contents a rich literature which needs to be translated into   English and other languages )  Thank you for your support </pre>
