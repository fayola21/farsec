<title>Issue 31817 -   chromium -    Chrome won't close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Ubuntu 9.04)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Unknown.  I have used the browser for a long time  waited on   unresponsive pages  used application shortcuts concurrently...      The window should be closeable.  I'm gonna have to kill it in the system   monitor.      The computer (I guess the CPU) clicks likes it's trying to do something   when I push the X at top-right or right-click the window's panel (taskbar)   button and Close  but then it just stops clicking and leaves the window   open.   </pre>
