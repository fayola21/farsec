<title>Issue 40831 -   chromium -    export bookmarks - .html file type not pre-popuated in name field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev Ubuntu 8.04      1. Create few bookmarks and Go to Bookmarks manager  2. Click on Tools &gt; Export bookmarks    What is the expected output?   .html should be pre-populated in name field. Same as on windows where file   type is pre-populated. Or same behavior as on Firefox linux &quot;where   bookmarks.html&quot; is pre-populated in name field.    What do you see instead?  name field is empty. (May be user doesn't know that file needs to be saved   with .html extension)       </pre>
