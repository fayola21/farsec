<title>Issue 36574 -   chromium -    SpdySession::GetPushStream returns incorrect stream - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SpdySession::GetPushStream will return the last stream in the push stream  list  rather than NULL  if it doesn't find a stream with a matching path.  This causes the wrong stream to be attached to a request and the wrong  result body to be returned. The most obvious symptom is swapped images on  e.g. image search results pages.    I have a fix for this that I will send for review soon. </pre>
