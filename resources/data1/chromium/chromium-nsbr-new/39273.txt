<title>Issue 39273 -   chromium -    Single stepping at conditionals and into return statements broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The JavaScript debugger in Chrome skips over most conditionals and has   broken behavior when stepping on to the return statement for a function.    To reproduce the behavior:    1. Run the current Chromium continuous build with --enable-webgl --  no-sandbox. (I am testing on Mac OS X but that should be irrelevant.   Windows or Linux with a suitable graphics card should work fine.)  2. Visit   <a href="https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/dem">https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/dem</a>  os/webkit/Earth.html .  3. Open up the JavaScript debugger and set a breakpoint in utils3d.js  line   ~59 (&quot;var fragmentShader = loadShader(gl  fshader);&quot;). Reload the page.  4. Single step into &quot;loadShader&quot;. Note that the first line (&quot;var shaderScript =   ...&quot;) is stopped on. Note that the following conditional (&quot;if (!shaderScript)&quot;)   is not stopped on. This is the first bug. The behavior is extremely   confusing and unintuitive.  5. Single step through the function until the line &quot;var compiled = ...&quot;. Then   single step once more. The current line jumps back up to a return   statement at the top of the function rather than hitting the final return   statement in the function. This is broken.   </pre>
