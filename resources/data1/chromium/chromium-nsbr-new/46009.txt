<title>Issue 46009 -   chromium -    colspan=0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 5.0.375.38 (46659) Ubuntu            Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK    What steps will reproduce the problem  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&quot;0&quot; scope=&quot;colgroup&quot;&gt;'.$Header.'&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    With a colspan=&quot;0&quot; it means across the width of the table    Now  this parses correctly in IE and in FF  but not in Chromium  it also   passes the testing as per the 'badges' for compliance with   <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>            The table should extend accross        The table only extends to one column          I've re-written my code  but can set it up so you can see it in effect. I   have since seen that the use of 0 is not 'perfect' code  but is is accepted   under xhtml strict  so I'd guess it is in use for 0 meaning 'entire width'   This may go into &quot;won't fix&quot; as setting it to 999 stops the problem  it is   simply that 0 is the value that works with instances where there variable   numbers of columns for sites built 'live' from databases.
