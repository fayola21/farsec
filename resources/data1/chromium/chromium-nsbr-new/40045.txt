<title>Issue 40045 -   chromium -    Malware interstitial displays twice for same page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit <a href="http://robertpattinson.org">http://robertpattinson.org</a>  2. You will get a malware interstitial page containing the text &quot;The   website at robertpattinson.org contains elements from the site   cdpuvbhfzz.com  which appears to host malware&quot;  bypass it and continue.  3. You will get a second malware interstitial page containing the text   &quot;Malware <a href="http://cdpuvbhfzz.com/dl/adv598.php">http://cdpuvbhfzz.com/dl/adv598.php</a> Malware   <a href="http://cdpuvbhfzz.com/dl/adv598.php">http://cdpuvbhfzz.com/dl/adv598.php</a>&quot;    What is the expected output?  Only one malware interstitial page should be displayed.    What do you see instead?  Two interstitial pages are displayed sequentially. While there is probably   a technical reason for two interstitials (e.g. a redirect  subframe  etc)    it is very confusing to the user to display two interstitials. Is it   possible to detect whatever is going on and only show a single   interstitial? </pre>
