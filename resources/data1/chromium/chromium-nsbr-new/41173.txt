<title>Issue 41173 -   chromium -    Copy url to X copy buffer does not include protocol string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chromium	5.0.374.0 (Developer Build 44177) Ubuntu  WebKit	533.5  V8	2.2.1.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.5   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.374.0 Safari/533.5  Command Line	 /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser    Is this the most recent version: Yes  nightly  OS + version: Ubuntu Karmic 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Metacity    Behavior in Linux Firefox: N/A  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): N/A      1.

This behavior is not present when using the X copy buffer   (ie  simply selecting text with the mouse).    The url pasted from the X copy buffer is not recognized as an url by most   applications  including gmail.    Is it possible to duplicate the protocol prepending behavior when copying   to the X copy buffer? (I'm guessing this will be non trivial if not   impossible).  Alternatively  could an option be added to toggle display of   the protocol? </pre>
