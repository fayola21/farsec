<title>Issue 40782 -   chromium -    Unwanted drag in Google Reader after watching a Flash video in a feed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version                            : 5.0.370.0 (43578)  Flash Version                                 : 10.1.53.7  URLs (if applicable)                       : www.google.com/reader  OS version                                      : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 4.0.5                : works as expected  Behavior in Opera 10.50 Beta     : works as expected      1. Go to Google Reader  2. From any feed  select a news item that contains a Youtube (or any Flash) video.  3. Start playing the video (maybe it's enough to focus on the embedded object ).  4. Select any other feed from the list. Just click  no drag.      Feed is selected  everything switches to that feed.      Feed is now attached to the pointer as if I started a drag. Clicking will not release the feed. The page on the right is still with the Youtube video.    Workaround? Reload Google Reader page.    This has happened many times on different feeds and I am able to reproduce it every time. </pre>
