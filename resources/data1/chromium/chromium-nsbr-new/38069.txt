<title>Issue 38069 -   chromium -    Mac: Remove button never enabled in cookie tree - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Starting around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=41419">r41419</a> for mac  the remove button in the cookie tree in &quot;content settings&quot; -&gt;   &quot;show cookies and other browser data&quot; is never enabled  even when there is a selection in the tree.   There is a actually a test that verifies that the button is enabled appropriately   (FLAKY_RemoveButtonEnabled)  but it marked as flaky. </pre>
