<title>Issue 31842 -   chromium -    Typing in a URL and opening a bookmark in a pinned tab should have consistent behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Pin a tab  2. Type in a url in that tab  hit enter. It opens in a new tab (which I found   surprising beyond belief. I can see how that might make sense  but I'm not   a huge fan of this. Anyway:)  3. Go back to the pinned tab and click a bookmark.        I expected that the bookmark would open in a new tab as well. Instead  it   opens in the same tab.    This should be consistent with what happens when you type in a URL. That   probably means that clicking a bookmark in a pinned tab should open the   bookmark in a new tab. </pre>
