<title>Issue 38587 -   chromium -    Tabs show up as minimized tool windows on Win7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have a window open with some tabs  2. I think I pressed the minimize all button (the lower right button on the   Win7 taskbar)    What is the expected output?    The windows should not leave any traces    What do you see instead?    A bunch of tool window titlebars. See attachment.   </pre>
