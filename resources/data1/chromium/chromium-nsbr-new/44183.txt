Click &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; on the bookmarks toolbar  3. Go to &quot;Imported from Safari&quot; submenu  4. Scroll through the bookmarks      Scroll should be smooth and consider the momentum of the mouse as well  e.g. Magic Mouse that   works fine elsewhere (on page).

Chrome   does not respond to Esc nor receives any clicks.     <b>Please provide
