<title>Issue 26421 -   chromium -    Math in omnibox (via Google Calculator) fails when multiplying then dividing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type &quot;2*4/6&quot; (or something similar) into the omnibox.  2. Hit enter.        Expected output is to use Google (if it's set as the search provider) to   search for the string &quot;2*4/6&quot;  which of course gives you the Google   calculator result.    Instead  what happens is Chrome tries to navigate to the URL:   http://2%2A4/6 which obviously doesn't resolve.          Note that this only seems to happen when there's a multiplication followed   by a division (I'm assuming Chrome interprets the last division sign as the   slash in a URL).    2*4*6 works fine  2/4*6 works fine  2/4/6 works fine    But 2*4/6 results in attempting to navigate to the URL.    Since we know URLs never contain asterisks... can we make this case do the   actual search? The convenience added is tremendous since I use Google as a   calculator all the time. </pre>
