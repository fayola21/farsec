<title>Issue 28595 -   chromium -    SpdySessionPool should use domain+destination port rather than just domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FlipSession will use single socket  so FlipSessionPool shouldn't try to share   the same FlipSession on same domain but different destination port.    FlipSessionPool::Get takes a RequestInfo so it should be fairly   straightforward to use domain+host for this. </pre>
