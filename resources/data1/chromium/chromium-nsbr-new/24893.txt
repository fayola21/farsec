<title>Issue 24893 -   chromium -    Write design doc for fullscreen behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our fullscreen behavior is sometimes weird  sometimes inconsistent.  We should write up a design   doc detailing exactly what functionality we want to support.  Things to consider:    - Can we open new tabs? close tabs? switch tabs?  - We grey out a number of menu commands  but their keyboard shortcuts sometimes still work.  - What if we get a javascript alert that originates in a background (non-fullscreen) window?  - How should http auth sheets work?  Can we switch between fullscreen/nonfullscreen while they   are open?    Look to windows for inspiration. </pre>
