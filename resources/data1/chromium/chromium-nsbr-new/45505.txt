<title>Issue 45505 -   chromium -    Add Farsi support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a meta bug for whatever we need to do to support Farsi in Chrome. (If   it's not much  we can morph this into a simpler bug.)    If we can get this done for Mstone-6  even better.    I'm not sure when/if we'll have the OK to allow downloads in Iran  but we're   working on it. </pre>
