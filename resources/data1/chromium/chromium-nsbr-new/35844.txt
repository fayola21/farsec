<title>Issue 35844 -   chromium -    Cookie not accepted with Bonjour Host - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Build ufficiale 38810) dev             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Instal Wordpress on local machine  2. Try login at host like my-machine.local  3. Login Fail and WP ask me to enable cookies.      The site will store cookie to remember session.      Cookie are not stored and session fail.    I think the problem is in my-machine.local host  infact the same   wordpress installation work perfectly on remote server with   www.mydomain.com host.    I say wordpress  but the problem is also with any other site need cookies.   </pre>
