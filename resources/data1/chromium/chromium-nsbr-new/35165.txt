<title>Issue 35165 -   chromium -    Cookie prompting bug of awesomeness. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Turn on cookie prompting.  2. Visit a site that sets a cookie such that you see the prompt  3. Click the &quot;Manage cookie settings&quot; link to bring up the Content Settings   dialog.  4. Click the &quot;View Adobe Flash settings&quot; link        I'm not sure what is expected. Cookie dialogs are app modal (ick) which   means that it should not be possible to open a new browser window. Peter   saw an assert. Darin saw nothing. At any rate this seems like a vortex of   doom.    A temporary fix would be to show a message box when this link is clicked   when an app modal queue is active saying &quot;please close all modal dialog   boxes and try again&quot;. Sucks  but that's what we get for using app modal   dialogs. </pre>
