<title>Issue 32772 -   chromium -    cannot post a comment at blogs.ohmynews.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought I had filed this one a long while ago  but I didn't.     1. Go to <a href="http://blog.ohmynews.com/peoplepower/317037">http://blog.ohmynews.com/peoplepower/317037</a>  2. At the bottom of the post (below '��Е�_�ѕ�_��_ ��_��_��__��_��__��_��_��_��__��_')  fill out the form   (id  password  comment)  3. Press  'comment' button below the textarea for comment    What's expected: it's posted.    Actual: nothing happens.    It only works with IE. I'm pretty sure it's an evangelism issue  but   without a reduced test case  it's not certain.    </pre>
