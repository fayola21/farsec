<title>Issue 45016 -   chromium -    LayoutPluginTester.UnloadNoCrash needs to be ported to Mac and Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> layout_plugin_uitest.cc has not been compiled for Mac and Linux. I'm switching it to compile  but   have the test disabled  so that we at least get tracking of the fact that it hasn't been enabled.    At this point getting it working may be as easy as fixing the Windows-specific plugin path   construction as we've done in other plugin tests. </pre>
