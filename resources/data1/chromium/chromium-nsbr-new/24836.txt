<title>Issue 24836 -   chromium -    Official builds want to update on the com.google.Chrome.framework ID - the .framework part is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I messed this up in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28963">r28963</a>.  tweak_app_infoplist sets the KSProductID value to   the value of CFBundleIdentifier in the plist that it's working on.  I moved   KSProductID from the outer app's Info.plist into the framework's Info.plist.    The two have different bundle identifiers.    If we release something with this bug  it can cause users to fall off of the   auto-update train. </pre>
