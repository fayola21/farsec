<title>Issue 33004 -   chromium -    history: blackout event-horizon for location-bar search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    Overview:  When typing in a history query in the location bar  old websites are   forgotten.    Reproduction:  1) Visit a webpage  note its title/etc.  2) Attempt to search for it in the location bar -- it works!  3) Wait over 1 month  4) Attempt to search for it in the location bar -- it no longer exists    even if there are no hits.    If this is &quot;desired&quot; behavior  it should at least notify the user  e.g.   &quot;... see queries older than 1 month.&quot; as a result in the location-bar-  search. </pre>
