<title>Issue 43518 -   chromium -    Redirect loop in GMail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Trying to open the GMail leads to the redirect loop after entering   login/password and clicking login button. Chrome suggests to clear the   cookings  but cleaning all cookies doesn't help      GMail UI to load.        Redirect loop error message is displayed ( Error 310   (net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS): There were too many redirects. )      Firefox 3.6.3 works OK. Not sure if this is related to some recent GMail   changes. I am ising English GMail interface. </pre>
