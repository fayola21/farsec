<title>Issue 32818 -   chromium -    VisibleBrowserTest.WindowOpenClose failing on Mac UI Valgrind bot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac UI Valgrind bot is consistently red because this test fails.  I   assume that running under valgrind is making things too slow and the test is   timing out  but I'm not sure whether there's actually a real bug being   exposed here.    This test should either be disabled under Valgrind or fixed.  I don't have   the slightest idea whom to assign this to.  Can one of you guys triage? </pre>
