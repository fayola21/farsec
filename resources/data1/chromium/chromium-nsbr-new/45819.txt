<title>Issue 45819 -   chromium -    feature req: pre-load files from google ajax libs API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Ajax libraries CDN hosts a number of popular javascript libraries:   <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/</a>    Chrome could preload the assets available via the CDN to reduce HTTP requests on pages where   these assets are included. Ideally they're just requested lazily after install and cached in the   standard cache. Most of these versioned assets have an expires header of 1 year out already.    The net effect is fewer http requests for end users  speeding up page loading speeds. </pre>
