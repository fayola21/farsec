<title>Issue 28678 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Unable to resend form data when 'Confirm Form Resubmission' error page is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: Unable to resend form data when 'Confirm Form Resubmission' error page is   showing    Observed in:  4.0.255.0 (Developer Build 32739)  3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)    Steps:  1- Load a page with a HTML form that does a POST  2- Submit the form  3- Go back  4- Clear your cache  5- Go forward  6- Observe the 'Confirm Form Resubmission' error page  7- Hit reload  8- Hit OK  9- Notice that the browser sends a GET instead of a POST    From an initial investigation  it looks like this is a failure of render_view.cc to   not send the original request to WebKit when loading the error page.  As a result    when we reload  WebKit thinks it should just GET the URL that originally failed to   load.  So  we'll need a WebKit API change to support sending the failed request and   not just the failed URL.  We may also need some WebCore changes (not sure yet). </pre>
