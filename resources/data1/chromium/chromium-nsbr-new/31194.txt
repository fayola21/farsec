<title>Issue 31194 -   chromium -    Facebook e-mail and password not remembered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Store a password for Facebook by entering user details at   &quot;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>&quot; and selecting &quot;Save Password&quot; and drop-down bar  2. Clear cache  3. Revisit &quot;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>&quot;      E-mail and password will appear in &quot;E-mail&quot; and &quot;Password&quot; blanks without   any user interaction because Chromium should remember password      Nothing appears in those blanks. If first letter of e-mail is entered in   &quot;E-mail&quot; blank  a drop-down menu will suggest e-mail and will allow user to   log in which is still more efficient then logging in manually.    <b>Please provide
