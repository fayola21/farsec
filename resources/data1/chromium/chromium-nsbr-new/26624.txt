<title>Issue 26624 -   chromium -    Right parenthesis slightly bigger then the left in the Fullscreen exit bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chrome in --lang=he  2. Press F11  3. Notice that in the bubble (that appears at the top) the right parenthesis   around F11 is slightly bigger than the left.    See screenshot in:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17949#c6">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17949#c6</a>    I don't know enough about directionality in RTL strings to confirm if the   string is correct. Should be easy for someone who knows to verify this. </pre>
