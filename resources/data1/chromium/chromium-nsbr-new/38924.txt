<title>Issue 38924 -   chromium -    Refactor the infobar delegate class hierarchy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Whilst implementing the geolocation confirm infobar with link  it has become apparent there is a   lot of class-duplication across the various infobar (IB) delegates.  Given the buttons are optional on confirm IB:   - Alert IB and confirm IB both provide icon + message    - Confirm and link IB both provide simple message + link.  Some of these can be collapsed.    In addition  in the IB implementations: on windows alert &amp; confirm are near identical. On mac &amp;   linux alert and link are very similar.  Perhaps we could go as far as have a single infobar delegate that allow optional icon  message    link &amp; buttons. To do this we'd need to resolve the incompatible GetMessage() methods (on alert   IB delegate vs. link IB delegate)    geolocation confirm infobar review threads:   win <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1037006/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/1037006/show</a>   linux <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1081007/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/1081007/show</a>   mac <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1127001/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/1127001/show</a>    However. Any code redesign really needs to happen as a follow up to proposed UI redesign   (moving the buttons to be aligned next to the text) (bug link pending...)     </pre>
