<title>Issue 37965 -   chromium -    Handling long URLs in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use any of various applications that create a data: URL with a large PNG   image (<a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/harmony/">http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/harmony/</a>    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpk">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpk</a>  i)  2. Open the image  to save it or to view it      Expected: Fast  responsive Chrome that shows the image but maybe doesn't   let me view the entire contents of the omnibox without copying it out (or   even at all)    Actual: Chrome locks up (the whole thing  not just the tab) for some time   and the tab just has to be closed. For some smaller images  when actually   clicking on the URL in the omnibox and trying to copy/clear it  some weird   stuff sometimes happens (see screenshot) </pre>
