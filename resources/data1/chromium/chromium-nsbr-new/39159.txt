<title>Issue 39159 -   chromium -    Cannot print single page on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using Chrome 5.0.356.2 dev  and I cannot print a single page  on linux.    This bug applies also to cups pdf printer: I select print  then in the   &quot;Page&quot; area I enter &quot;1&quot;  in order to print only the first page  but then all   the document is printed! </pre>
