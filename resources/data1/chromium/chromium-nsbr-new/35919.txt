<title>Issue 35919 -   chromium -    Translate infobar showing after being closed on some pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1 - Navigate to a page in a foreign language that takes some time to load  entirely (ex: <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr">http://www.lemonde.fr</a>).  2 - When the translate infobar shows up  close it immediately (before the  page has finished loading).    Expected:  When the page finally finishes loading  no translate infobar is shown.    Actual:  When the page finally finishes loading  a translate infobar DOES show. </pre>
