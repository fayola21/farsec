<title>Issue 35756 -   chromium -    memory exhaustion using javascript protocol in iframe src without prompt to stop script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89  URLs (if applicable) : (Attached test file &quot;fff.html&quot; to reproduce issue).    Other browsers tested: FF 3.6  IE8.0.6  Opera 9  Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:             FF 3.6: Fail           IE 8.0.6: Fail           Opera 9: OK      What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Open the attached html file with Chrome  2. Open taskmanager (windows)      What is the expected result?    The memory use should stay stable. User should be prompted that script is  using too much memory or will run forever with prompt to stop script or  continue.      What happens instead?    Chrome's memory use keeps on growing till it crashes and &quot;aw snap&quot; page is  displayed. This only affects the tab which is currently open however the  other tabs are unresponsive until the process is closed and the &quot;aw snap&quot;  page is displayed.    Reproducible:    Always (if javascript is enabled)      Explanation:    100 iframes using javascript protocol in src parameter. Each iframe uses a  while (true) loop to call document.write() which writes an iframe which  also has src of javascript protocol. The same results can be achieved with  less iframes however the more iframes the faster a crash will occur.      Leak:    This process leaks in Google Chrome  IE8.0.6 and Firefox 3.6 and   eventually crashes.    The leak only occurs when using document.write() within while(true) loop in  javascript protocol. It may be possible to use other functions in place of  document.write() (untested).    The problem appears to be in the handling of the javascript protocol.      Additional Information (Firefox only):    The browser hangs even if &quot;warn me when web sites try to redirect or load  the page&quot;  under tools-&gt;options-&gt;advanced-&gt;general-&gt;accessibility is selected in  Mozilla Firefox.
