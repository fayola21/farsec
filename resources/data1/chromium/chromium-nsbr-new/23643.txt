<title>Issue 23643 -   chromium -    Need to add UMA stats for first-run bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently don't have any way to know if the first run bubble (with the   &quot;change search engine&quot; buttons) is useful  and how users are using it.    To improve the usability of this bubble  we need to add UMA metrics to   detect:     - whether the user clicked on the balloon at all (or did they just   click/focus somewhere else?)  - which of the buttons the user clicked on   </pre>
