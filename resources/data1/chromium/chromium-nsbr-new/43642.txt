<title>Issue 43642 -   chromium -    Version 6.0.399 crashes with plugins installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When i install this extension: ChromeBird or Forecastfox Weather he   crashes. I tried to remove all and then install again  but nothings   happens. If I run on incognito mode  he works very well. On my old version   6.0.397 everything works fine. If I only install ChromeBird  make a   configuration  when a I close the Chrome and open again he lost all that I   put (login  password). Again  on version 6.0.397 works fine.                    <b>Please provide
