<title>Issue 32485 -   chromium -    Extension Gallery: e-mail address change removes extensions from developer dashboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL : <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a>    A primary e-mail address change on your Google Account removes control over   your released extensions  you no longer see them in the developer   dashboard  but you can edit them. The fix would be to change your primary   e-mail address back to the one you used before.    The same goes for having the old primary e-mail as a secondary.    Steps:  1. Change your e-mail address in your Google Account settings.  2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/developer/dashboard">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/developer/dashboard</a> - All   extensions released will no longer be in the list.  3. Go to an extension you created  try to edit it  this will work.   </pre>
