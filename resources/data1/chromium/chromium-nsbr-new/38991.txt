<title>Issue 38991 -   chromium -    inline window.print() doesn't allow page to load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The attached reduced test case shows a problem that occurs on blockbuster.com   and only occurs for Chrome.    Notice that opening the page in Chrome brings up the print dialog but the   image never loads until the print dialog is dismissed.    In IE7  FF3.6  and Safari 4 (all on XP) the image loads in the background   even with the print dialog up.    Note: you may need to clear your cache to be sure the image doesn't load   before the script is executed. </pre>
