<title>Issue 37783 -   chromium -    NTP Bookmark Sync option does nothing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome	4.1.249.1030 (Official Build 40990)    OK on trunk; perhaps the change should be ported over to beta/stable.      --------------------------------------  1. Go to New Tab Page.  2. Click on Change Page Layout button in upper right-hand corner.  3. Select/deselect Bookmark Sync option from the dropdown.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  Should make Bookmark Sync option appear/disappear on page.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  No action.  I think the option has been taken out.  The dropdown menu   option should be taken out as well.   </pre>
