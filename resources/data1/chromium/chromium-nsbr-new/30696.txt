<title>Issue 30696 -   chromium -    animation for hovering over tabs in mac os lags far behind cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  if you move your mouse rapidly over the tab strip  the tab-light-  up-on-hover animation lags far behind the cursor.  If we just delay the onset   of the animation by ~100ms or so  we might be able to avoid the delayed   hover animation on very fast mouse movements.    </pre>
