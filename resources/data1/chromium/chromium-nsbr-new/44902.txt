<title>Issue 44902 -   chromium -    seatbelt-cache.db seem to be holding all our generated profiles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> /var/folders/*/*/-Caches-/seatbelt-cache.db seem to hold all the sandbox profiles we generate at   runtime as records in a database.  Not sure if this is really a problem or not  but we are seeing some   slowdowns on bots  so I'm going ahead and logging this now.  Might be worth some follow up with   the engineers at apple as it if this is a problem or not.    Since the bots generate random profile directories  and that seems to end up in the &quot;Enable full   access to given directory if needed&quot; part of the profile  you can see how these add up with time. </pre>
