<title>Issue 42008 -   chromium -    Thrashing and non-responsiveness under low memory conditions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.3 (Official Build 44229) dev  Operating system     : Linux (Ubuntu netbook Lynx)      1. Constrain memory  such as running on a netbook. Also turn off OS swap to   avoid confusing this problem with OS thrashing.  2. Open lots of tabs.  3. Browse.    This invokes the existing memory leak  but the leak is not directly the   issue here.        If memory can't be allocated  a tab process should just die  giving the   usual dead tab page.    The &quot;kill slow tab&quot; window should be responsive and should hang around for   a minimum time after being fully displayed so it can be used.         The disk chatters as the browser thrashes  obviously trying to do its own   swapping  this drags the whole OS to a crawl  such that it can become   impossible to quit the browser. The &quot;kill slow tab&quot; dialog tries valiantly   to pop up  but it's fighting for memory too  and the moment it gets any  it   decides it's no longer needed and vanishes  thus never becoming responsive.   </pre>
