<title>Issue 43838 -   chromium -    Search text hidden in &lt;input type=&quot;search&quot;&gt; fields proportional to length of label text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a page with a search input field preceded by some text       (Example: <a href="http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/search.html">http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/search.html</a> )  2. Type into the search box  3. Characters are hidden at first but start becoming visible partway into the box        All text entered into the search field should be visible        Version 5.0.396.0 on Linux and OS X exhibits this. I'd guess Windows too  and I'm pretty sure I   saw it in ToT earlier today. </pre>
