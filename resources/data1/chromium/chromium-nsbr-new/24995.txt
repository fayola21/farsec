<title>Issue 24995 -   chromium -    Duplicate bookmarks + disable/enable sync = bookmark explosion (NEED UNITTEST) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable bookmark sync on a client.  2. On the bookmark bar  create 2 or bookmarks with exactly the same title   and URL.  3. From the options panel  Disable sync.  4. Re-enable sync using the same account as before.    Expected result:  The number of duplicate bookmarks should not grow.    Actual result:  There is a third bookmark.  Each time you disable and re-enable sync  the   number of bookmarks roughly doubles ... nth step = 2^n + 1 bookmarks.    I suspect a bug in the merge and sync code. </pre>
