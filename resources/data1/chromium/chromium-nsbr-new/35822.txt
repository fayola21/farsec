<title>Issue 35822 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/plugins/netscape-browser-object-identity.html fails in Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test added in <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54783">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54783</a> fails in Chromium.   I'll disable the test during the next WebKit roll. Could someone familiar   with plugins in Chrome take a look at it? </pre>
