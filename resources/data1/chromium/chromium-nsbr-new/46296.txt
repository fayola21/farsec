<title>Issue 46296 -   chromium -    Citrix XenApp Client plugin does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had an in-person chat with someone who said their company cannot switch to Chrome because Citrix doesn't work. I looked into it and its indeed the case. I tested on WinXP FWIW.    According to [1]  &quot;The Citrix ICA Client installer detects Mozilla Firefox  but not other browsers. The plugin is automatically installed for Mozilla Firefox.&quot;    After installing the Citrix client from [2]  I tried using it in Chrome. Instead of launching a Citrix application  it downloads the .lca file instead  since the Citrix plugin does not show up in about:plugins. This works fine in Firefox on the same computer.
