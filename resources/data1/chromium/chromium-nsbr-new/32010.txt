<title>Issue 32010 -   chromium -    Mac: theme overlay images get stretched - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Switch to the Porsche theme.  2. Make the window really wide (on a big monitor).    I expect to see the silhouette of a Porsche. I do  but it looks like it's had a   run-in with a steamroller.    3. Make the window really narrow.    I expect to see either nothing  or perhaps the silhouette of a Porsche.   Instead  I see a VW.    The overlay image shouldn't be stretched -- just drawn and clipped  and   anchored to the left. </pre>
