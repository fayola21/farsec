<title>Issue 29238 -   chromium -    Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol is not properly supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol</a>  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Log into teapot.  2. Attempt to brew coffee.      When a server returns error 418  Google Chrome should naturally inform a   user they are trying to brew coffee with a teapot  and possibly do   something else interesting or entertaining.      Nothing. </pre>
