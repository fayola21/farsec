<title>Issue 33193 -   chromium -    Add commandline argument to open new Incognito window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello   it would be nice to have some option to open anonymous mode window without   using intermediate non-anonymous window. so i will be able to launch   anonymous window using special icon on my desktop even when regular chromium   is not running. if it's running  it should open new anonymous window and   exit with well known message: &quot;Created new window in existing browser   session.&quot;    eg. command can look like this:  chromium --anonymous      PS. you can add &quot;feature request&quot; group to issues </pre>
