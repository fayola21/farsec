<title>Issue 42505 -   chromium -    Hardware assisted video decoding for Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that Apple has enabled API's for hardware assisted video decoding  it make a lot of sense for   Chrome to support this. I could not find a request for this  so here it is.    It would be really cool if Chrome and HTML5 could give me hardware decoded video on YouTube   before Adobe managed to get it into Flash player. ;) </pre>
