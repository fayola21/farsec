<title>Issue 27727 -   chromium -    Download info (eg speed) are moving when title is too long. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	4.0.245.0 (Build officiel 31763)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.245.0 Safari/532.5      URLs (if applicable) : chrome://downloads/  OS version : Sorry for french version... (i add little text for you tu   understand if you don't speak french)  Vue d��_��_��_ensemble du logiciel syst��_��_me (system software preview) :      Version du syst��_��_me :	Mac OS X 10.5.6 (9G55)    Version du noyau (kernel) :	Darwin 9.5.0    Volume de d��_��_marrage(boot volume) :	Leopard    Mode de d��_��_marrage(Starting Mode) :	Normal    Nom de l��_��_��_ordinateur (computer's name) :	Tristan    Nom de l��_��_��_utilisateur (user's name):	Tristan ******* (Tristan)    Temps depuis le d��_��_marrage (time since start) :	43 minutes    Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): No  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): No  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested.      1.Download a file with a long name but not enough to take an entire line   with download speed.  2. Whent the download speed is XX ko/s it's on one line and when its   XX.Xko/s it takes two lines.      Don't know  maybe make the long names looking &quot;&lt;starting of the   name&gt;...&quot; so the download speed won't move.         The screen is too litle so when the download speed take a &quot; X&quot; it move to   the line underthe name.    Really miscellanelous but i say it ;)    PS: it's writtent &quot;dev preview&quot; but it's already the speediest browser. Both at   launch and when browsing. The only &quot;need&quot; would be plugins like in firefox   (particularly grease monkey  download helper and co.) </pre>
