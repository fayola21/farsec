<title>Issue 39323 -   chromium -    TabView themes confused by switch to/from fullscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install the android theme:   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeljdmeofcikjblcoehpmdnooimalbmj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeljdmeofcikjblcoehpmdnooimalbmj</a>   2. Go fullscreen and back.    Notice that the text in unselected tabs is black.  If you go down the line and select each tab   individually  that fixes their text to be light grey again  at least until the next fullscreen switch.    I assume we're somehow getting confused by the switch to a different window. </pre>
