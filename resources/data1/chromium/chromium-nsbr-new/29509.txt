<title>Issue 29509 -   chromium -    A note shouldn't be moved while holding the delete icon and moving the mouse pointer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/">http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/</a>  2. Create a note and have focus on the note  3. Click and hold the icon for deleting the note  4. Move the mouse pointer away from the delete icon    What is the expected output?   Only the mouse pointer should be moved    What do you see instead?  Note moves along with the mouse pointer and on releasing the mouse button    the note is deleted. So  once clicked on the delete icon  there's no way to   save the note from being deleted.   </pre>
