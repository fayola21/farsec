<title>Issue 44750 -   chromium -    Missing title in drag n' drop bookmars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev    When I drag the URL in the addressbar to my bookmark panel (under ddressbar)    then new bookmark is created  but completely without title. That means  if I   have there links to more parts on one webpage  I can't recognize each of   them  cause they've got the same favicon. Also this behaviour is unusable   with webpages without favicons. </pre>
