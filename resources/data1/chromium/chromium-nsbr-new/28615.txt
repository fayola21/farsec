<title>Issue 28615 -   chromium -    HTML dialogs should not show context menus except for text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the sync setup wizard (Wrench  &quot;Synchronize my bookmarks...&quot;)  2. Right-click on the HTML dialog.        It seems weird that you can open the HTML dialog in a new   tab/window/incognito window.  Perhaps these options should be hidden.    Also  incidentally  &quot;open as new incognito window&quot; opens a new window  but   it's not incognito. </pre>
