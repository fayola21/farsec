<title>Issue 23916 -   chromium -    WAV support for HTML5 audio and video - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/labs/html5drums/">http://www.randomthink.net/labs/html5drums/</a>    They use WAV files!!  Nooooo!!!!    Proper fix is the transcode all samples to {MP3 AAC}+{Ogg} and use   canPlayType().  Sounds like a lot of work but WAV support is a slippery   slope. </pre>
