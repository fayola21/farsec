<title>Issue 24061 -   chromium -    move sqlite/history out of browser process into its own utility process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Experiment with whether moving sqlite/history db access out of the browser   process and into its own utility process provides a stability win.    Specifically we seek fewer browser crashes due to memory corruption or   from-disk corrupted sqlite databases in an attempt to increase overall   perceived stability of the product.    For more details see thread at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/a52d8ab8703fd7ef.    Open questions:  - is &quot;gamma ray&quot; non-ECC-memory corruption perceptible in browser process   crashes?  - how widespread are sqlite corruption-related crashes among our userbase?  - what can we learn from other consumers of sqlite? (Firefox  ...)  - do we move all or just some sqlite accesses to a separate process?  - does a move increase jank/latency? (viz: perceptible slowdown for in-  memory URL database searches used for autocomplete)  - how do we measure change effects? (stability reports  A/B tests)  - does mitigation meet on cost/benefit?  - does this complement or compete with other work going on to stabilize   sqlite access (like sqlite checksums)? </pre>
