<title>Issue 43001 -   chromium -    Translator: Arrows in the languages dropdown list should activate on hover - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. use a screen resolution which can't contain the huge languages list in   the in the translate bar (i believe this is the most common case)  2. open some website that needs translation  for example   <a href="http://www.jambonetwork.com/blog/?p=13429">http://www.jambonetwork.com/blog/?p=13429</a>  3. open the languages list in the bar (thinking you know better what   language is showing ;) )  3. try to hover the down/up arrows in the menu  4. be surprised that you actually have to click on the arrows to scroll language by language  unlike the way it works in the bookmarks menu and in   Windows in general.      same thing goes for the &quot;This page has been translated from &lt;languages   list&gt; to &lt;languages list&gt;&quot; state of the bar </pre>
