<title>Issue 29868 -   chromium -    Chrome ignore $DISPLAY in environment - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)            Firefox 3.x: FAILs too  but in a different way.          1. Set up a machine with multiple displays.  2. Start Chrome on one display  3. On the other display  start Chrome.          Chrome should open on the display from which it is started.        A message is displayed  &quot;Created new window in existing browser session.&quot;  but this new window is on the wrong display.   </pre>
