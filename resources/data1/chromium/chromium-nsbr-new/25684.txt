<title>Issue 25684 -   chromium -    Frame flickers when dragging tabs in the tabstrip. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With some random Chromium build I picked up today (4.0.224.3 (Developer   Build 29898)):    Drag a tab left and right within the tabstrip without detaching. Note that the   dark gray frame changes its shading gradient when you start to move the tab   and then again when you move the tab past an adjacent tab causing it to   move out of the way.    Whenever a tab is attached the active dark gray appearance should be the   same. </pre>
