<title>Issue 23736 -   chromium -    reloading an unpacked extension changes its id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you reload an unpacked extension (loaded with --load-extension or from   chrome://extensions)  its id changes.    Instead of incrementing  it should be something static.  One idea Aaron   suggested was to make it a hash of the path.  The nice thing about this is   that it would even be static across browser restarts.    (I swear this was already filed  but I couldn't find it - perhaps it's a   dupe)   </pre>
