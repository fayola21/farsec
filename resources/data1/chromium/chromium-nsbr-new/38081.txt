<title>Issue 38081 -   chromium -    &lt;link rel=icon&gt; is not working in DOMUI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug is about allowing &lt;link rel=icon&gt; to work in DOMUI and extension   pages. Right now we special case handle the icons for DOMUI pages.    This is related to <a title="Favicons are not updated when the DOM changes the favicon"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9982">issue 9982</a> which is about allowing dynamic changes to the   favicon. </pre>
