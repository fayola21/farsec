<title>Issue 32636 -   chromium -    Implement unique item support for sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to implement unique item support for sync. We sometimes need to have   unique items that aren't created more than once  but we want to do it within   the client namespace. Currently we generate IDs on the server by using a   client CACHE_GUID and appending a local ID which steadily goes towards   negative infinity. If we use a CACHE_GUID which is the same across all   clients  then the items created with local IDs appended will also collide.    We need to provide an interface in the sync API so that we can provide   collidable sync entities that all share the same CACHE_GUID namespace. </pre>
