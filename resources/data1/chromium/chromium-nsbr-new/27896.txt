<title>Issue 27896 -   chromium -    GateKeeper is currently broken  fix it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary: GateKeeper is currently broken  fix it    GateKeeper has been taking on regressions for the past couple weeks.  I   believe the first set of regressions that have afflicted it (can't send mail   to right sheriffs  can't close tree  can't send mail it closed tree) have   been checked in.  See <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31849">r31849</a>  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31876">r31876</a>  and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31948">r31948</a>.    Remaining steps:  - update and restart master with latest code  - verify gatekeeper works locally (requires changes and a simple bad compile   patch if we can get to it)    votes_for_buildbot_test_harness++ </pre>
