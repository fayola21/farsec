<title>Issue 31000 -   chromium -    incorrect attempt to valide the cache on not-cached http request that supports partial content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.274.0 (Developer Build 34825)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://tinyvid.tv/file/1o5sb8mj5l7m.ogg">http://tinyvid.tv/file/1o5sb8mj5l7m.ogg</a>      1. Clear cache  2. Try to load URL        DCHECK(mode_ == READ_WRITE) fails in  http_cache_transaction.cc:BeginCacheValidation    I guess this is because the server allows for partial requests which  results into the cache being validated after the read  (DoPartialNetworkReadCompleted) and the file is not in the cache (mode_ ==  WRITE). </pre>
