<title>Issue 25671 -   chromium -    allow custom-build installations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27    We are considering to defining Chrome as a recommended browser for Windows   users in our enterprise  but there's one stopper for making it happen.    We need to make a custom installation package  with our own settings in   Options (i.e. home page  default search engine  turned off &quot;Suggestions for   navigational errors&quot; and turned off &quot;send usage stats and crash reports&quot;)-  -ideally with settings reset to above when a user &quot;Resets to defaults&quot; or   deletes the whole user profile.    I couldn't find any easy way to create such a custom installation package--  except compiling Chromium from sources. </pre>
