<title>Issue 42330 -   chromium -    Autofill profiles created on different systems for same user get out of sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome OS	0.7.40.1 (Official Build ab645f5f)  Google Chrome	5.0.382.0 (Official Build 44948)  Type of computer   :  Eee PC      1. On Eee PC  login to chrome os with user A (synced account).  2. Create an autofill profile 1.  3. Login with same user A on X200 and create autofill profile 2.  4. Log out from both systems and log in back with user A.      Expected :   - Since user A is a synced account  both autofill profiles 1 and 2 should   be visible on re-login.    Actual :  - On Eee PC  both profiles 1 and 2 are visible  but on X200 only profile 2   is visible.  - I created profiles on Eee PC  X200  X201 and Linux chrome. After   repeating repro steps 2-3 times  profiles got out of sync between Eee PC   and X200.   </pre>
