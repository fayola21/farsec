<title>Issue 27324 -   chromium -    HTTP Requests do not finish loading properly (blank page)  need to refresh page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is bug reported by croftjd  forked from <a title="some http requests take many seconds or minutes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16367"> issue 16367 </a> which pertains to   networking issues seen by developers in the Reston office.    From croftjd:  Since the latest Beta 4.0.223.16 was released I have experienced similar   problems. An   http request often takes a minute or more to appear. I have found that   refreshing the   non-existent blank page often fixes the problem and the page appears at   once. </pre>
