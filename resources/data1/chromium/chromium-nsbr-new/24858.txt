<title>Issue 24858 -   chromium -    Some more UI changes for Beta - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I know this is late in the game  but hoping we can squeeze these in:    From Brian Rakowski: &quot;It seems like we're all in agreement that we don't  need to show status for bookmarks sync there. Can we just remove that line  unless there is an error? I'm okay showing errors on the NTP with the red  background bar.    Why don't we indicate more status from the menu option in the Chrome menu?  When syncing is enabled  it could show &quot;Bookmarks synced...&quot; When not  enabled  &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot;. When there's an error  &quot;Bookmark sync  error...&quot;    Have we settled on a promo for bookmark sync yet? Something like  http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/76_sync/1/#smaller_promo_1.png?    I'll let the UI team chime in on the promo. </pre>
