<title>Issue 39580 -   chromium -    Warn before closing tabs with large amounts of edited text in a textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Officiell version 42199) unknown      1. Open a webpage with large textareas (for instance wikipedia)  2. Edit a lot of text  3. If you by mistake hits Ctrl-Q or Cmd-Q or clicks on the wrong red cloes   button (X) you will most probably loose all your work.      The browser should prevent me &quot;shooting my foot&quot; by mistake.      My perhaps hours' worth of typing/editing is lost.    Workarounds?  Some of this could be implemented as an extension  but I fail to remember   which one or how well it worked. It wasn't a very discoverable extension. </pre>
