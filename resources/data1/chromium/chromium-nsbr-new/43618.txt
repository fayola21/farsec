<title>Issue 43618 -   chromium -    chrome omnibox broken  and chrome cannot be killed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  Mac OS.        First I should note that I've filed a bug through the chome feedback menu  item  but I had more to add after that point so I'm also adding a bug here.   If there is some kind of stack dump associated with that kind of feedback   that's probably the most useful thing to figure out what's going wrong here...    I was running some javascript integration tests  with the javascript  debugger open  and the I stopped being able to reload the page to re-run my  tests.  The tests hit the HTML 5 database  in case that's important.    A few strange things have just happened.  The most alarming is that the  omnibox simly doesn't work  in that tab or any other tab.  Typing a URL and  pressing enter as well as attemping a search is also broken.  This is  something that I've definitely seen before  but very rarely (maybe once  every 3 months or more?)  Previous times I've seen this I think it just  went away though  so it might be a totally separate issue.    I also have one tab which cannot be closed with ctrl+W or &quot;x&quot; in the UI.   Happens in incognito mode as well.  I've never seen this part of the bug  before.    Apple+Q was able to kill the last of the tabs  but didn't kill chrome.  I  am now unable to start chrome.    At this point ps -x gives:  dhcp-172-31-54-132:~ craigwilkinson$ ps -x | grep Chrome  24156 ??        57:20.08 /Applications/Google  Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -psn_0_1204518  24189 ??       229:18.75 /Applications/Google  Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.342.9/Google Chrome  Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Helper --type=plugin  --plugin-path=/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flash Player.plugin --lang=en-US  --plugin-data-dir=/Users/craigwilkinson/Library/Application  Support/Google/Chrome/Default --channel=24156.0x18e5a410.1485148093  --enable-crash-reporter=490C26971C81514664E271192DB1081B  26371 ??         4:36.83 /Applications/Google  Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.342.9/Google Chrome  Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Helper --type=plugin  --plugin-path=/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/googletalkbrowserplugin.plugin  --lang=en-US --plugin-data-dir=/Users/craigwilkinson/Library/Application  Support/Google/Chrome/Default --channel=24156.0x1d8585b0.859663982  --enable-crash-reporter=490C26971C81514664E271192DB1081B  58852 ??         0:00.00 (Google Chrome He)  39223 ttys000    0:00.00 grep Chrome    after going kill ##### I am still not able to launch chrome.
