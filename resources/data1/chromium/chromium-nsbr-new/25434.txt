<title>Issue 25434 -   chromium -    Don't include hidden folders when zipping extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A couple of my friends have gotten bitten by this.  When we pack an   extension  we should avoid including hidden files/folders.  These can contain   sensitive data  such as PEM files (if your extension is an a version-  controlled directory) or random things from the OS.    It seems very unlikely that a user would actually want a hidden file/folder   included in the extension. </pre>
