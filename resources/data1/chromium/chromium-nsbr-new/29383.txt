<title>Issue 29383 -   chromium -    JS console eats keystrokes on Debug builds in --single-process mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run a debug build with --single-process. Bring up the JS console in the   inspector and try typing something that has an autocompletion like   &quot;document.body&quot; or (in a background page for an extension)   &quot;chrome.tabs.getAllInWindow&quot;. Notice that the autocomplete code eats some of   your keystrokes  so you end up with &quot;doument.body&quot; or &quot;crome.&quot;       </pre>
