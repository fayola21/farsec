<title>Issue 43919 -   chromium -    DCHECK in TCPClientSocketPoolTest.BackupSocketConnect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test BackupSocketConnect failed recently on the mac debug bot (and then passed in the next run):    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Mac10.5%20(dbg)/builds/4362">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Mac10.5%20(dbg)/builds/4362</a>    The crash was due to a NOTREACHED in CreateTCPClientSocket():        switch (type) {        ... [truncated] ...          default:          NOTREACHED();   &lt;========= CRASH          return new MockClientSocket();      }      The switch looks in order  so my expectation is |client_socket_index_| overran the end of the array and   hit garbage. </pre>
