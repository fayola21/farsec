<title>Issue 27356 -   chromium -    Pinned Gmail  Greader (maybe Ymail  Hotmail  etc.) should show unread count - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox has got a new feature provided by an addon. It's pinned tabs like   Chrome has.    However as you see on this screenshot   (<a href="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/17/2009/11/500x_app-tabs-1.jpg">http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/17/2009/11/500x_app-tabs-1.jpg</a>) the   Gmail icon also has a unread messages count.     Now this is what I would Chrome like to have by default. Chrome is a Google   browser  so why does it not implement Google services in a better way?     - Gmail unread count for pinned tabs  - Google Reader unread count for pinned tabs  - maybe third-party products like Yahoo Mail  Hotmail  etc.     </pre>
