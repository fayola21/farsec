<title>Issue 29892 -   chromium -    Drag and drop of partial text between fields doesn't work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a site with multiple fields.  [like <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en">http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en</a> ]  2. Enter some text in one field.  3. Select a subset of the text.  4. Drag the selection to another field and drop it.        Expect the subset text to appear in the other field and disappear from the original field.  Instead   nothing at all happens.  It works right if you select-all in the original field.  Safari allows   dragging partial text.    How does Windows work?  I can't convince Windows to drag-and-drop text between fields at all   (<a title="Cannot drag and drop between web fields." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29891"> Issue 29891 </a>).   </pre>
