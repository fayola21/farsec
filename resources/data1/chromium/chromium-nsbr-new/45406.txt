<title>Issue 45406 -   chromium -    chrome 5.0 does not allow frame breaking anymore: top.location.replace(self.location.href) not allowed if top != self - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome 5.0 does not allow frame breaking anymore.    frame breaking is currently the best defense against the &quot;click-jacking&quot;   vulnerability.    read: <a href="http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf">http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf</a>    but Chrome 5.0 does not allow a page to break out of a frame. e.g.            if (top != self) {              top.location.replace(self.location.href);          }    does not work anymore  probably because of a permission blocking.    other browsers (FF  IE) allow this type of frame breaking. </pre>
