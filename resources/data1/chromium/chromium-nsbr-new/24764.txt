<title>Issue 24764 -   chromium -    Quitting with a tab-modal sheet open rolls the sheet up after its window is gone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a tab-modal sheet.  HTTP Auth will do.  For example    <a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html">http://www.pagetutor.com/keeper/mystash/secretstuff.html</a>.  2. Quit.  Command-Q.      Expect: quit to look okay.  Observe: it looks weird.  The window closes and seems to take the sheet   with it  but just as quickly as it disappears  it comes back to life and then   rolls up into nothingness.    I see this in trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28882">r28882</a>.    Doing other things with the window  like closing it  minimizing it to the   dock  hiding the app  and even Expos��_��_ing it  don't cause such weird visual   things to happen to the sheet. </pre>
