<title>Issue 25157 -   chromium -    linux chrome needs flashblock-like behavior built in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : GNOME  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): i can turn flash off completely   or -- better -- i can use flashblock to disable by default but easily  enable on a case-by-case basis.    since flash started working in chrome  i've been a much less happy user   and i'm almost ready to go back to firefox. i can no longer surf the web  without being bombarded by crap  and was much happier without flash. in the  short term  i'd settle for a way to just turn off all flash  but ideally i  want something like firefox's flashblock that shows me where there would be  flash content  with some kind of &quot;play&quot; button for the rare occasions i  choose to be bombarded by crap. (i.e. youtube.)    i'd rather have no flash at all than have it on all the time. </pre>
