<title>Issue 24202 -   chromium -    Investigate DOM multiplier for static pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load the HTML5 spec ( <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/</a> )   and then take a look at the renderer memory footprint.  I get 155 MB +/- 20   MB.  The spec is extremely large  but it's nowhere near 155 MB of text.  The   question is  is the multiplier here for the overhead of actually constructing   the document/render trees acceptable?  Someone from the memory task force   should look at this  and in general perhaps find a way to express the &quot;memory   multiplier&quot; for a page (something web authors might want to know). </pre>
