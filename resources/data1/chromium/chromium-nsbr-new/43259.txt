<title>Issue 43259 -   chromium -    Change &quot;Open on startup&quot; table from URLs to titles? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The History  Bookmarks  and New Tab pages all display page titles instead of   URLs.  I think we should do this in the table of URLs to open on startup  in   the first page of the options.    This has two advantages besides consistency.  First  titles are more user-  friendly.  Second  in RTL contexts  the title is likely to be RTL  whereas   the URL is always LTR; if we lay out this table in RTL (see <a title="RTL: URL should be right aligned on the &quot;Open the following pages&quot; table" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7215"> bug 7215 </a>)  users   will see the beginning of a long title instead of the end of a long URL --   much more recognizable.    If you think this is a bad move  speak now or forever hold your peace. </pre>
