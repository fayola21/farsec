<title>Issue 28861 -   chromium -    &quot;Back&quot; button history is broken in gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11 (Official Build 32790)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>                Few clicks around gmail inbox make the back button go in loops. If I click   &quot;History&quot;  I see that there were three pages on gmail in History; but long   click on &quot;Back&quot; button shows these three pages repeated several times   (history shows only 1-2-3 pages  but back button shows 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3).    Clicking &quot;back&quot; cycles through 1-2-3 infinitely; every time I arrive to   &quot;1&quot;  &quot;Forward&quot; button becomes disabled (it shows probably that actually   &quot;back&quot; button jumped to the top of history). </pre>
