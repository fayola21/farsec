<title>Issue 27204 -   chromium -    Chrome.tabs.onUpdate receives incorrect updates when updating quickly after tab creation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Add a listener to tabs.onUpdated  2.Create a tab with url &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&quot;.  3.In the callback  update the tab with url &quot;about:blank&quot;.      It is expected that the onUpdated listener receives exactly 2 messages   about the about:blank tab  in addition to 0-2 messages about   <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>.  Instead  the onUpdated listener receives 3 events  first that undefined has   completed  then that about:blank is loading  and finally that undefined has   completed. I.e.  there is a completed message without a respective loading   message.      See the extension bg page. This bug may be related to 27188.   </pre>
