<title>Issue 35528 -   chromium -    No support for &quot;Magic TLD&quot; syntax in include_globs/exclude_globs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)    Many existing userscripts originally written for Greasemonkey use the so-  called &quot;magic TLD&quot; syntax to specify which sites a script should apply to.    <a href="http://wiki.greasespot.net/Magic_TLD">http://wiki.greasespot.net/Magic_TLD</a>    In order to be able to use existing scripts without modification  it might be   worth considering supporting this in Chromium as well. </pre>
