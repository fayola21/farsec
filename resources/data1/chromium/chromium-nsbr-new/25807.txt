<title>Issue 25807 -   chromium -    Windows jump around desktop when using spaces  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.8    OS version               : 10.5.8      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't tested  plus Windows doesn't   have Spaces as far as I know.      1. Open multiple windows on different desktops.  2. Try to move a window between desktops using Spaces.  3. The window will appear to have moved  but when you go to that   desktop  all windows have moved there.    This doesn't happen every time  but it happens frequently.        The windows I didn't move myself shouldn't change location or desktop.        The windows sometimes act like they are grouped together.   </pre>
