<title>Issue 41707 -   chromium -    System restarts  while opening 200+ bookmarks in New window and then closing it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing this for tracking purpose.    This has been happening quite for some time  so finally decided to file it   after talking with Eric Roman.    Reproduces with 4.1.249.1058 and DEV channel.    I have around 200+ bookmarks under Other bookmarks (imported from IE and   FF  my bookmarked pages   etc)  -Right click on other bookmarks and say 'open them in new window' from the   interstitial context menu.  -While page rendering starts in all the tabs  click on 'X' button (windows   management controls) to close the window.    Issue: My system mercilessly restarts some times.  Logging back to the   system after forcible restart  I will get 'your system has recovered from   serious error blah..blah'..and happened to grab the mini-dump file from   this -&gt; of course  I know it is of no use :(.  I can reproduce this issue once in 5 to 6 attempts.    The mini-dump file and other related files can be found @   http://go/crashDumps/Sysrestart.zip    I suspect it may be related to memory blowout ??!!.   </pre>
