<title>Issue 35037 -   chromium -    [GPU] OpenGL ES command decoder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Command buffer back-end targeting OpenGL ES rather than regular OpenGL.   Needed for OpenGL ES based Chrome OS platforms to support WebGL  Pepper 3D   and NaCl.    Potentially need to dynamically load the OpenGL shared library to avoid   runtime link errors.    Potentially need to extend / abandon glew if it doesn't support needed   OpenGL ES extensions. </pre>
