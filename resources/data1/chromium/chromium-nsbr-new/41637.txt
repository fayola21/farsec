<title>Issue 41637 -   chromium -    GGL back buffer should use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB on Mac OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Experience has shown that GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB is the texture target with the broadest   support for non-power-of-two textures on Mac OS X. For best compatibility  the GGL back buffer   should allocate a texture of this type for the backing store of the offscreen back buffer on Mac OS X.   </pre>
