<title>Issue 41943 -   chromium -    Request: Merge &quot;Reload&quot; and &quot;Go-Stop&quot; buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since the OmniBox has been going through some changes lately with the goal   of making it even more minimalistic and clean  here's my two cents.    The &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button was moved right next to the &quot;Go-Stop&quot; button   recently  however that place can get crowded with Page Actions from   extensions.     So how about merging the &quot;Go-Stop&quot; button and the &quot;Reload&quot; button  and   moving the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button over to where the &quot;Go-Stop&quot; button is.     The &quot;Go-Stop-Reload&quot; button would change according to what the user is   doing. In normal state  the button would be &quot;Reload&quot;  if a page is loading   it would be &quot;Stop&quot; and if the user is editing/writing the URL it would be   &quot;GO&quot;.    I've made a couple of mock ups on how this could be done. Both versions   have their pros and cons  but in my opinion Version 2 is the way to go.       </pre>
