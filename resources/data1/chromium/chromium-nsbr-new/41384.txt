<title>Issue 41384 -   chromium -    Make a dedicated notification for toggling incognitoness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now when you toggle incognito support for an extension  you can see   the browser action unload then reload. This is because we're just unloading   and reloading the extension.    It would be better to have a dedicated notification.    Another option would be to have a dedicated RELOAD notification that would   tell all parties that they should update themselves from the extension. This   might also be useful for other things in the future. </pre>
