<title>Issue 31048 -   chromium -    Modifying accelerator keys of chrome.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi list     ever since Chrome 4.0.201.1 (23222)  it's unable to use ResHacker to modify   chrome.dll's accelerator keys. I always want to remap keys:    F1 undo close tab  F2 left tab  F3 right tab  F4 close tab    But now if I modify F2 and F3 keys in new version 4.0.266.0 (33992) I can't   type q r and s in webpage text boxes.    What's wrong?    yeah I know some of you guys might suggest me using an extension    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mgjjeipcdnnjhgodgjpfkffcejoljij">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mgjjeipcdnnjhgodgjpfkffcejoljij</a>  f    But I can tell you this extension SUCKS. The defined hotkeys won't work for   default blank pages or pages that are not finished loading. And it's slow   to respond.    Please do respond  anything is appreciated. Thanks. </pre>
