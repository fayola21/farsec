<title>Issue 41370 -   chromium -    Only treat Silverlight instances as transparent if the background they set is actually transparent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The fix for <a title="Transparent backgrounds broken with Silverlight" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36691"> bug 36691 </a> caused all Silverlight instances with a background property to be treated as   transparent  even though lots of backgrounds are opaque. Netflix  for example  sets &quot;background&quot; to   &quot;#000000&quot;. This means we take the slow path unnecessarily in some cases. </pre>
