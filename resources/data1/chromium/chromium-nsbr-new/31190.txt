<title>Issue 31190 -   chromium -    feature request: navigate bookmarks shortcut - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : feature request    Request:  Currently I do not believe it is possible to easily navigate bookmarks with   the keyboard  e.g. to give focus to the bookmarks bar.    I would guess that the &quot;Chrome way&quot; might be to just try to remember the   name of the bookmark and search for it with ctrl-L? Unfortunately however    I believe this is at odds with the use case of &quot;I want to browse bookmarks&quot;   -- why would bookmark folders  or a bookmarks bar  even exist if url-bar   searching was sufficient?    And unfortunately  there is no way to easily give focus to the bookmark bar   folders. Even if there was such a shortcut  it is not easily discoverable   (usability of discovering features).    Perhaps the solution is to create a keybinding dialog in Chrome and add a   binding for &quot;focus bookmark bar&quot;? Or perhaps make it so that url-bar   searches can return bookmark folders  and selecting that bookmark folder   will trigger a UI action of clicking open the folder and giving focus to   the contextual menu. </pre>
