<title>Issue 46056 -   chromium -    Available disk space not checked when downloading a file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55      i have turned off low disk space notification in my XP and i have only 270MB space available in the drive   so when chrome has downloaded 270MB of file it goes freaky the file download stops but chrome shows that download speed is increasing(i have let it go to 2 GB/s before i stopped it) and so is downloaded file(in 100 of GB  original file was less than 1 GB).       Chrome should compare available disk space and file size and if disk space is less it should not download    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45310">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45310</a>   </pre>
