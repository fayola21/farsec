<title>Issue 37142 -   chromium -    Intermediate certs received along with generated client cert will not be saved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a server sends Chrome a newly-minted client cert in response to a &lt;keygen&gt; tag  and the   response includes some supporting intermediate certs in addition  Chrome will not parse or save   the intermediate certs.    In many cases this won't be a problem ��_��_��_ if the cert is only for use by the site that created it (as by   myopenid.com) then the only one verifying that cert will be the origin server  which presumably   already knows its own intermediate certs.    It could however be a problem if a cert authority is generating a general-purpose identification cert   that is meant to be used in email or by other websites. If there are intermediate certs that aren't   included in the OS's standard set  the client won't be able to send a full cert chain when it uses the   client cert. </pre>
