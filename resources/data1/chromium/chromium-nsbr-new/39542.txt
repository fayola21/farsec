<title>Issue 39542 -   chromium -    when asking about cookie acceptance chrome should ask once per page load for a given domain. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	5.0.342.7 (Developer Build 0)  WebKit	533.2  V8	2.1.2.7  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.7 Safari/533.2  Command Line	 /usr/lib64/chromium-browser/chrome    I love the ability to have the browser ask me if I want to accept a cookie.   However  chromium has an annoyance regarding this. Occasionally when   browsing to a page I don't frequent  I will choose block  but keep it on   ask me again later. The problem is that if the site sets multiple cookies    it will ask for each and every cookie (there can be dozens!).    It would be preferable  if the choice applied to all cookies from the same   domain during a given page load. That way it isn't necessary to choose   &quot;block+ask later&quot; for each and every one. </pre>
