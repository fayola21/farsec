<title>Issue 29411 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Close tabs to the left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25 (Official Build 33676)    There is a &quot;Close tabs to the right&quot; option in the right-click menu of a tab    but no &quot;Close tabs to the left&quot; option.  I checked the source code and could   find no reason why this should be the case (from a programming standpoint)    so I am requesting this feature. </pre>
