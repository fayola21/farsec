<title>Issue 37974 -   chromium -    Conditionalize creation of plugin TransportDIBs for Core Animation plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Under the CoreAnimation model  like with windowed plugins on other platforms  we don't need the   transport DIBs most of the time.    Eventually we'll want them in certain cases (page thumbnailing  printing  etc.)  but for now we can   turn them off completely in the CA case. </pre>
