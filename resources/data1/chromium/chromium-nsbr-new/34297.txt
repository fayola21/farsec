<title>Issue 34297 -   chromium -    Flash 10.0 crash under _pthread_start @+0x002e0121 or @+0x002dce21 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a top crasher for 307.2  0x01ca1e21	 [Flash Player	 + 0x002dce21]	  0x01cb68f1	 [Flash Player	 + 0x002f18f1]	  0x01a78b15	 [Flash Player	 + 0x000b3b15]	  0x01a78f68	 [Flash Player	 + 0x000b3f68]	  0x01a79361	 [Flash Player	 + 0x000b4361]	  0x01a7968c	 [Flash Player	 + 0x000b468c]	  0x01ca05fe	 [Flash Player	 + 0x002db5fe]	  0x9479d154	 [libSystem.B.dylib	 + 0x00032154]	_pthread_start  0x9479d011	 [libSystem.B.dylib	 + 0x00032011]	thread_start    It's been around at least back to the beta branch  but used to be much less common. It's unclear what's   caused it to be more common  but at this point (although it may be early to tell) it looks like it's happening   more.    Hopefully I can find out what version this is  and maybe get it symbolicated  to try to get an idea of   whether this is something we are causing  or just a Flash bug. </pre>
