<title>Issue 30516 -   chromium -    Extension match patterns should support view-source: - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30                      Content scripts don't load on view-source: pages. A pattern containing   view-source: is rejected when put into matches in the manifest.        Content scripts should run on view-source: pages. One use case: we have   an extension that creates a keyboard shortcut to toggle between a page   and its source.    From the mailing list..    Aaron Boodman:   &quot;This wasn't changed purposefully. OTOH  should http://*/* match  view-source:// ? That seems a bit unexpected. Maybe match patterns  should explicitly support the view-source:// pseudo protocol.&quot;    Adam Barth:  &quot;Yeah  I think that's the best approach.  The downside is that it makes  it harder to change the view-source features without breaking some  extensions.  The upside is that extensions can make view-source more  awesome.  :)&quot;   </pre>
