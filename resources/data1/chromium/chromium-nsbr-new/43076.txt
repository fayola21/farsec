<title>Issue 43076 -   chromium -    Make it really easy to restart-for-upgrade. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a new version of Chrome is available but not installed  the About   panel says so  and have an &quot;Update Now&quot; button.  Then I get a dialog   telling me to close Chrome and restart for this change to take effect  and   the space in the About panel changes to say that Chrome has been updated.    I propose that the &quot;Please close&quot; dialog be modified to have options for   &quot;Restart Chrome will all of my current tabs and windows in place&quot;  versus   &quot;Not right now  please&quot;.  This should match the option to do session   restore on startup (or the restore infobar on crash).  This improves the   world because many users may not know about the session-restore option  or   may not  want to use it more generally for other reasons.    [Honestly  I'd be fine with putting the &quot;Upgrade me now and restore&quot; button   right on the About panel.]    See also <a title="Update available notification" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27941"> Issue 27941 </a>  which tackles the more involved issue of somehow   informing a long-running user that an update is available.  I believe this   is a less contentious subset of that issue.   </pre>
