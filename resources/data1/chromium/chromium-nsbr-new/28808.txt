<title>Issue 28808 -   chromium -    fix flaky tests in ui_tests on linux/views build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I (oshima) made bulk update to change tests are are failing on   64bit/linux/view to FLAKY. They passes on 32 bit build (but fails at times)    so I believe they're in fact flaky. I haven't look into why they're flaky    and we should investigate why and fix if possible.    Note: I intentionally filed this in chromium tracker as this is the issue in   chromeos build of chrome  and there is an issue in linking chromium os issue   in CL. </pre>
