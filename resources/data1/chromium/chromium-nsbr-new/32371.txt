<title>Issue 32371 -   chromium -    windows name is not saved. Problem with php-smarty debuggin! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.298.0 (Developer Build 36221) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : any site that has $smarty-&gt;debbug on           Safari 4: linux    Firefox 3.x: Working nice           IE 7: linux           IE 8: linux      1. I'm working on site that has smarty debugger. Smarty puts following code   in it's html  &lt;code&gt;   if ( self.name == '' ) {         var title = 'Console';      }      else {         var title = 'Console_' + self.name;      }      _smarty_console =   window.open(&quot;&quot; title.value &quot;width=680 height=600 resizable scrollbars=yes&quot;);      _smarty_console.document.write('HTML CODE HEREn');      _smarty_console.document.close();  &lt;/code&gt;  2. The problem is  when you refresh the page  it opens new pop-up. So if   you are working on some site you will get 50 opened windows...      As in firefox  to keep refreshing one windows and not openning new one...   </pre>
