<title>Issue 42432 -   chromium -    Let 0 through MockRead/MockWrite - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MockRead/MockWrite in net/socket/socket_test_util do not pass 0 (NUL)  characters.  They use C strings  so trying to use these characters just  causes short IO.    This inhibits testing in <a title="Implement the FTP Extensions for IPv6 specified in RFC 2428." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35050"> bug 35050 </a>  EPSV  as one of the test cases needed that. </pre>
