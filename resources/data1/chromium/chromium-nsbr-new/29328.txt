<title>Issue 29328 -   chromium -    Menu Bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>             When I boot-up Chrome I don't see Menu Bar. Why? I need to be able to   access that at times. This issue certainly handicaps a body. What's the   problem? Why doesn't the Menu bar appear automatically? Is there a work-  around for this (as I view it) problem? Appreciate any help with this   matter.  Thank you.           <b>Please provide
