<title>Issue 45246 -   chromium -    [GPU] Initial frame of 3D is garbage or non-existent. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.405.0 (Developer Build 47357)  URLs (if applicable) : I used both the trusted and untrusted versions of the Tumbler example in   the NaCl SDK (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-">http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-</a>  sdk/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/examples/tumbler)  Other browsers tested: N/A (requires Pepper 3D)      1. Build the NaCl SDK tumbler example.  Both the trusted debug version and the untrusted   version exhibit the bug.  2. Launch a local HTTP server (the NaCl SDK has a simple on: src/examples/httpd.py)  3. Launch Chromium with --enable-nacl (if using the trusted version  launch with --enable-  nacl  --no-sandbox --internal-pepper).  4. visit http://localhost:5103/tumbler/tumbler.html    You will see garbage on the mac  and nothiing on Linux or Windows.  I would have expected to   see a magenta square (which is the front face of a cube).    I can see the cube rendered fine after I start dragging the mouse.   </pre>
