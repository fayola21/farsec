<title>Issue 24471 -   chromium -    Size browser action bubble dynamically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the browser action bubble has a dynamic width and a fixed height.   We want to change this so that we are dynamic in both directions. This is   important so that things like localization work smoothly.    Here is how we envision it working:    a) Bubbles will have a minimum width  maximum width  minimum height  and   maximum height that are some portion of the browser size.    b) We initially size a bubble to the minimum width and minimum height.    c) When the content finishes loading (onload)  we get the intrinsic   dimensions of the content from webcore (the scroll height and width) and   send them to the browser  which resizes the bubble  which in turn resizes   the content area.    d) We default the CSS to set body's overflow to hidden  so there will be no   scrollbars by default.    The sum total of this is that by default the bubble will be some   &quot;reasonable&quot; width. If the intrinsic size of the layout is wider or taller    the bubble will expand up to some maximum size.    There are multiple ways to affect the intrinsic dimensions (particularly   width) of an HTML document. You can:    * Have an image that is wide  * Use the &quot;nowrap&quot; CSS style on one or more elements that you don't want to   wrap  * Use the webkit box model which allows flexible-box style layouts in   HTML/CSS </pre>
