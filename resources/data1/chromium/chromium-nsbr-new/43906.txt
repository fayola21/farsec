<title>Issue 43906 -   chromium -    Failed client certificate download (i.e. with &lt;keygen&gt;) does not produce useful debugging information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta           Safari 4: Didn't test    Firefox 3.x: N/A (Cert works OK)           IE 7: Didn't test           IE 8: N/A (Doesn't seem to support my &lt;keygen&gt; page)      1. Use a site with the &lt;keygen&gt; tag  for example  to generate an (invalid)  client certificate. (although the problem probably occurs even without  using a &lt;keygen&gt; page to generate the cert.  A straight client cert  download will probably have the same problem)  2. If the certificate fails to load  you get the error 'The server returned  an invalid client certificate'  3. The error prompt has no useful information  and I can't find any useful  information anywhere else.      Some explanation about why Chrome doesn't like the certificate.      As far as I can tell  the certs I'm testing with are valid (and they work  with firefox)  so unless Chrome is willing to share what  precisely  its  problem is  I'm unable to fix it.  That's a problem. </pre>
