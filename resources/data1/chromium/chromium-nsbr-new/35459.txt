<title>Issue 35459 -   chromium -    Refactor AuthWatcher / GaiaAuthenticator / ServerConnectionManager stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Refactor the AuthWatcher / GaiaAuthenticator / ServerConnectionManager   stack. It is way too complicated for the purpose that it serves  and it could   probably be replaced with one or two classes that managed the state   internally with less complexity.    AuthWatcher currently uses its own thread  which is not really all that   useful. There's no real point having asynchronous authentication going on    and it just adds to the complexity. In reality it blocks the syncer and should   just execute serially with sync.    ServerConnectionManager and AuthWatcher's relationship is unclear and   leads to strange delegation of work.    GaiaAuthenticator is not so bad  but it is difficult to follow sometimes. It   should be cleaned up. </pre>
