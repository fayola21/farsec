<title>Issue 44780 -   chromium -    New Tab animation has alpha-blending glitch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When your tabstrip is heavily populated (i.e. tabs have been shrunk very   small)  the new New Tab animation looks glitchy.  After staring for a while    I think the biggest cause of this is that when the New Tab button reappears   before the tab stops animating  the square that contains that button is   alpha-blended with the animating tab  causing a noticeably-brighter chunk in   the side of the tab.    I caught a screenshot of this. </pre>
