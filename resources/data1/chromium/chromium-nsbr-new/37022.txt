<title>Issue 37022 -   chromium -    Little problem with a web page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://covers.nmstudio.pl/">http://covers.nmstudio.pl/</a>        Firefox 3.6: OK           IE 8: OK    When you access to that web page  if you do click in &quot;List Type = Auto-  Updating&quot; and close the little dialog  you can see five buttons about the   &quot;Skin&quot;. The problem is that if you leave the mouse cursor above those   buttons  you can't see well the previsualitation (just it appears and   disappears) and that's not happening with Firefox or Internet Explorer.    Thanks and really sorry for my bad english </pre>
