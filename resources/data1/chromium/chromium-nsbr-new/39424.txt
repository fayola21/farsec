<title>Issue 39424 -   chromium -    Need to add additional check in IsPortAllowedByDefault() in net_util.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since out main table of blocked ports resides in net_util.cc  it might be a  good idea to have most complete set of checks there.    Currently  the IsPortAllowedByDefault() does not filter out ports that are  &gt; 65535  however it takes an 'int' parameter so technically it can allow  access to ports with number &gt; 64K.    WebKit upstream recently added test and fix to disallow those numbers  (<a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/56489">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/56489</a>).   </pre>
