<title>Issue 43605 -   chromium -    Set up sync dialog should not be resizable (Windows and Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chromium and bring up the &quot;set up sync&quot; dialog  2. Try resizing the UI    What is the expected output?   UI should be of fixed size. There is no point resizing this  since the  content is pretty much fixed.    What do you see instead?  Windows: Dialog can be expanded and shrunk. (see screenshot)  Linux: Dialog can be expanded  but not shrunk.  Mac: Dialog is of fixed size. (as desired) </pre>
