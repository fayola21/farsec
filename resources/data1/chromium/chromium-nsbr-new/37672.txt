<title>Issue 37672 -   chromium -    Left-align the text of bookmark items within folders on the Mac. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apologies if this has already been discussed with the UI team.    Currently  the text for bookmark items within folders is centered (screenshot attached).    This is detrimental for readability (left-aligned text scans better) and IMO looks a bit strange with   the favicon always left-aligned.    I propose left-aligning the text within the bookmark items. </pre>
