<title>Issue 32053 -   chromium -    In docked mode on Mac  when clicking &amp; dragging mouse on tabs headers pane  cursor takes the 'drag' form - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open DevTools  switch into &quot;docked&quot; mode. Observe that mouse cursor has a   regular &quot;arrow&quot; form on tab headers pane and takes &quot;drag&quot; form on the border   between DevTools part of window and the page. That's OK.    Now click and drag mouse cursor on the headers pane. Observe that it takes   the &quot;drag&quot; form too  which is incorrect because it doesn't actually change   DevTools frame size. </pre>
