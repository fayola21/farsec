Click in WebKit and confirm that it has the focus by using the arrow   keys to scroll up and down.  2. Hit F12 to go to overview mode and F12 again to go back to active mode.  3. Hit the down arrow.      The page should scroll down  but instead  the cursor appears in at the   beginning of the omnibox  and further presses move down through the list of   omnibox autocompletions. </pre>
