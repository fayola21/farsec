Visit <a href="http://gochild2009.appspot.com/">http://gochild2009.appspot.com/</a> with IE8 and Vista.  2. Click on the board and move your mouse.       RadialGradient on the stones should follow the mouse movement.       This is working with Chrome and Firefox in WinXP. It is also working with   Firefox in Vista. It is NOT working with Chrome in Vista  the   RadialGradient will just stay in the middle of the stone.    </pre>
