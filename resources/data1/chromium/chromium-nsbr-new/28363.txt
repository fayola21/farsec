<title>Issue 28363 -   chromium -    Need to refactor common code from src/tools/{heapcheck valgrind wine_valgrind}/chrome_tests.py - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> tools/heapcheck/chrome_tests.py is a copy of  tools/valgrind/chrome_tests.py  which is a copy of  tools/purify/chrome_tests.py  so the three files share much code.  The common parts should be put into a separate module imported by these  three scripts. </pre>
