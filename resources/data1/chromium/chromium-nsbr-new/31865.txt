<title>Issue 31865 -   chromium -    Autocomplete popup remains in original location when browser window moved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.249.64 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35722">r35722</a>)  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)    This is exactly the same as <a title="Autocomplete popup is not closed when the browser window is moved" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7401"> issue 7401 </a>  but for Linux.  The issue was fixed   long ago under Windows.    Precondition:  -------------  Have some previous entries entered into the given form field.      --------------------------------------  1. Open a form; start typing something into the field to bring up the   autocomplete popup.  2. While the popup is showing  move the browser window.    Expected:  ---------  The popup should be closed.  That is the current behavior of Chrome under   Windows.    Actual:  -------  The popup remains at its original location while the browser window is   moved.   </pre>
