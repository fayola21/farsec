<title>Issue 31361 -   chromium -    Focus highlight on NTP weird on Mac/Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Right click an NTP entry  2. Click somewhere else in the page to cancel the menu popup  3. See that the blue border remains when you move your mouse elsewhere.  (The   blue border disappears on Windows)    Arv showed me why this happens: on Windows  cancelling the menu sends your   click through to the page.  That click then defocuses the element.  On   Mac/Linux  the menu eats the click so the NTP item still has focus (try   hitting tab to move focus onwards) while your mouse can still highlight other   things.    This click-not-going through behavior is consistent with other OS behaviors   (ie bring up a menu then click on something else on the screen  and the click   doesn't go through) so I don't think we should hack it for the page.    I'm not sure what the correct solution is. </pre>
