<title>Issue 32065 -   chromium -    Extension Gallery requiring review of extension when it shouldn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Note: I can't reproduce this again with another extension  but this is what I did:  1. Click Edit in the Developer Dashboard.  2. Change the description.  3. Click Update file (I might have chosen a file and tried to upload it and then aborted it)  4. Go back to previous page.  5. Click Publish button.   6. A message is shown that say my extension will be reviewed before published.      The extension should be published without review as it doesn't use either file://*/ permission or NPAPI plugins.      Extension is set in pending review state.    <b>Please provide
