<title>Issue 39215 -   chromium -    &quot;Remove from list&quot; confusing for unfinished downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the downloads page  in-progress or paused downloads have 3 links beneath   them:    Pause/resume  Remove from list  Cancel    It's unclear what &quot;Remove from list&quot; will do. Since &quot;Clear all&quot; doesn't   apply to these downloads  I actually expected it to do nothing. Instead it   cancels and removes the download. I propose that is either removed (and only   appears for finished/canceled downloads)  or is renamed to &quot;Cancel and   remove from list&quot;.    Perhaps &quot;Clear all&quot; should also be renamed to &quot;Clear all finished   downloads&quot;. </pre>
