<title>Issue 45484 -   chromium -    tabs instantly resizing once closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev                  When you start closing tabs in previous versions  the tabs don't resize   until you move the mouse away so it makes it easy to close multiple tabs   one after another.    Now as soon as you click the X the tabs resize instantly    Maybe this is the way it is supposed to be but i found the old way better.   </pre>
