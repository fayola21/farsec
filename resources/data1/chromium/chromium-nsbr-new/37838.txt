<title>Issue 37838 -   chromium -    ProcessSingletonLinuxTest is flaky on ChromiumOS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is currently our #3 flaky test. Sample:    [ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-rel-linux-  chromiumos/build/src/chrome/browser/chromeos/cros/mount_library.cc(63)] Cros Library has   not been loaded  /b/slave/chromium-rel-linux-  chromiumos/build/src/chrome/browser/process_singleton_linux_uitest.cc:99: Failure  Value of: GetTabCount()    Actual: 1  Expected: original_tab_count + 1  Which is: 2    Failed this way 27 time(s). First failure was on 2010-02-25  and last on 2010-03-05.    All the 60 failures from last three weeks are on ChromiumOS.  <a title="two tests in ProcessSingletonLinuxTest fail when no window manager exist on linux_view build" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30953"> issue 30953 </a> and <a title="build/try bots need to run window manager as well as Xvfb when running tests" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31010"> issue 31010 </a> look   similar  but both are closed. Is the process singleton relevant on ChromiumOS? I wonder if we can   just remove that file from the compile list on ChromiumOS. </pre>
