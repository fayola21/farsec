<title>Issue 26615 -   chromium -    Throbber is broken on Taskbar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT (r 30836)    Could be related to <a title="FRUI Imports hang forever on Trunk." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26614"> issue 26614 </a>  but still filing this  as we don't miss it.    -Make sure your Chromium windows are not grouped on Task bar.  (Otherwise just open a single browser window.)  -Navigate to any webpage (google home page is fine)    As shown in the screenshot  Notice the half circle light blue throbber  spinning is stuck on the task bar  even after the page is loaded.    PS: This works fine on TabStrip.    Can't find appropriate component to select  that's selected Feature-TabStrip.     </pre>
