<title>Issue 36832 -   chromium -    layout test result archiving is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It only seems to be working on the LInux release bot.     There's a few symptoms I've obvserved:  1. The layout test dashboard has 1 day stale data  2. The links to the layout test result zips on the waterfall 404  3. The archive step  looking at   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Webkit%20(dbg)(1)">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Webkit%20(dbg)(1)</a>  has gone from 2 minutes to   0.    But  looking at the stdio from the archive step  everything looks correct.     Did something change on the bots recently? I followed the Windows release bot back enough to see   when I could get to zip files. It looks like it broke around 07:42:40 AM yesterday and at   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/changes/10701">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/changes/10701</a>  which is clearly not the culprit.    Marking as a P0 since this breaks a bunch of tools that people use a lot (rebaseline  layout test   dashboard  etc). </pre>
