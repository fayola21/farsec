<title>Issue 39903 -   chromium -    r43025 caused startup perf regression for t-theme on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See summary.    A sample perf bot:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-</a>  10.5/startup/report.html?history=150&amp;rev=-1    The whole change:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=43025">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=43025</a>    The relevant file:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/locati">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/locati</a>  on_bar_view_mac.mm?<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1">r1</a>=43025&amp;<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2">r2</a>=43024    The critical bit here  I think  is that before  startup wouldn't display a   security image  but now we'll typically display a magnifying glass  so we   need to make at least one extra call to   ResourceBundle::GetSharedInstance().GetNSImageNamed().  The fact that the   non-themed perf didn't really move suggests to me that what's actually slow   is not getting the image itself but theme-related startup that wasn't   otherwise happening during &quot;startup&quot;.  Because the images in question here   aren't overridable by themes (I think; IDR_O2_{GLOBE SEARCH HISTORY MORE})    it seems like this should be avoidable (?).    CCing lots of various Mac- and theming-related people who might be able to   help give me more insight. </pre>
