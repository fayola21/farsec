<title>Issue 31981 -   chromium -    gaiaauth thread janks up UI thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The gaiaauth worker thread waits for a gaia server reply with a timeout of   300 seconds.  If the server isn't replying  then anything that tries to   stop/delete the worker thread will hang until timeout; particularly    stopping syncing  which causes UI jank.    Repro case (in OS X/Linux)    1. Log in to sync with <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/542003/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/542003/show</a>   patched   in (if not already checked in)  2. In another browser  change the password for the account used in step 1  3. Restart the first browser (with --log_level=0)  4. Look in the logs for &quot;gaiaauth&quot;; the first attempt should succeed   immediately  but the second should hang.  5. Go to preferences and click &quot;Stop Syncing&quot;.    The UI should respond right away.  Instead  it hangs until the gaiaauth   thread times out. </pre>
