<title>Issue 42107 -   chromium -    too hard to pin tabs  UI glitch  and doesn't stay pinned on browser restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Drag a tab to the left to try to pin it  2. Get frustrated as it pops out into a new window  3. Finally get it in the right place  release the mouse button  4. Get frustrated as the tab looks like it is unpinned even when it is   pinned  5. Click on neighboring tab to make the first one finally appear pinned.      I want to pin my tab.      it pops out into a new window  or stays unpinned- there is a very small   window of area where it will stay pinned.    AND - when I release the mouse button  it goes back to normal size even if   I successfully pinned it  making it very difficult to tell if I   successfully pinned it. Only when I click on a neighboring tab will it   appear pinned.    AND - it doesn't stay pinned when I restart my browser  so I have to go   through this dance every time I restart.    I'd really like the &quot;pin tab&quot; option back in the right-button menu. </pre>
