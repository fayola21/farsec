<title>Issue 31006 -   chromium -    Default theme from themes gallery is different from default theme reset in Preferences dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Mac  choosing &quot;Default theme&quot; from the theme gallery will now set your   theme to be a windows-y blue color.  If you choose &quot;reset to default theme&quot;   from the Preferences dialog  you will see the traditional Mac grey theme.  This   is new  and I'm guessing it has to do with erg's revision of the   BrowserThemeProvider.   </pre>
