<title>Issue 38887 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Update this extension&quot; to the BrowserAction and PageAction context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes a user KNOWS that an extension is ready for updating.  In these   cases  navigating to the extensions page  clicking developer tools  and   waiting for all the extensions to check for updates is cumbersome.  (In fact    sometimes it doesn't even work.)  It's much simpler for the user to simply   right click the BrowserAction or PageAction and click &quot;Update this extension&quot;   or &quot;Check for updates&quot;. </pre>
