<title>Issue 24496 -   chromium -    Hulu Lags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Opening an SNL clip on Hulu.  2. Having a few other tabs open  maybe a chat client (this just happened to   be the situation for me  I'm not sure if it's related or not)  3. Watching the Hulu clip.        The Hulu clip runs smoothly and the sound along with video move along.        While the sound continues  at seemingly random points (yet when reloading   the page the points are the same every time)  the video will lag and either   stop or become very choppy.  At this time the entire browser freezes  not   allowing you to switch tabs  close  click  anything.  The sound continues   to run  and eventually the video speeds through every fifth frame or so   until it catches up to the sound.    <b>Please provide
