<title>Issue 34932 -   chromium -    New tab never opens - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.249.78      1. Drag the tab to the Windows taskbar and release the mouse - the tab became   a  new Chrome's window.    expectation: New window is open and in focus.    The button of new window is depressed  so window must be opened and at focus.   But the old window remains open. And when you switch between two Chrome's   windows (by mouse or alt+tab)  the new window never opens untill you would   used Maximize command of context menu.   </pre>
