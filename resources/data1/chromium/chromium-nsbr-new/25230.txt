<title>Issue 25230 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't quit when pop-ups (opened by onExit event) are opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.223.4  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/">http://www.popuptest.com/</a>  2. Click on &quot;Multi-PopUp Test&quot;  3. In 'Manage pop-ups'  select always allow....  4. Quit Chrome using cmd + q.    Expected result:  4.1 Chrome quits.    Actual result:  4.2 Chrome opens two more pop-ups after it quits (I think onExit pop-ups).   Two new pop-ups don't quit even trying cmd + q second time. If we use cmd+w  to close individual popup window  then Chrome quits once all pop-ups  windows are closed using cmd + w.   </pre>
