<title>Issue 44938 -   chromium -    Flash: Save State - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Feature Request]  Flash should save state.    Use case:   + Play a YouTube video. Pause. Reboot. (Multiply by 10 videos.)   + Play a game. Walk away mid game (perhaps after hitting some checkpoint).   Machine turns off. Turn machine back on.   + Load a flash app  such as a photo editor. Load photo. Make changes.   Reboot (simulating system going idle  shutting off  getting turned back on).    In the cases above  you don't want to go back to original state  you want to   restore state. </pre>
