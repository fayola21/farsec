<title>Issue 40092 -   chromium -    Provide possibility to report broken page via one click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is more an enhancement then a bug but cannot we have (maybe in chromium   dev builds only) an action &quot;Report Broken Web Page&quot; which would collect all   the required information about the environment (browser version  extensions   etc.) and submit a bug?    My motivation is: right now  Gmail crashes for me and what should I do? Just   report it? Or should I try to disable any extension? Or all of them? Or   what?    Thanks for understanding.   </pre>
