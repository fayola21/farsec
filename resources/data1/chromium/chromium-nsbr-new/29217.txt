<title>Issue 29217 -   chromium -    Crash reporting is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome with Omaha  2. Overinstall Chrome4.0.249.23  3. Open a tab and navigate to about:crash    What is the expected output?   Renderer crash and a crash Id in eventvwr. Something like &quot;Crash uploaded.   Id=196bbde7b262ab1b..&quot;    What do you see instead?  Looks like crashes are not being uploaded. I see &quot;Crash not uploaded.   Error=0x8004fffe.&quot; </pre>
