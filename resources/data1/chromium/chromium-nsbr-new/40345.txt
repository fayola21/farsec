<title>Issue 40345 -   chromium -    Video scaling is too slow. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently ScaleYUVToRGB32 implements only nearest-neighbor scaling and because of that we use   Skia for video scaling (as of <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=43444">revision 43444</a>). Scaling and YUV-&gt;RGB conversion can and should be   done in one step. Implement bilinear scaling in ScaleYUVToRGB32 and use it for video. </pre>
