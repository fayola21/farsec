<title>Issue 35581 -   chromium -    Make ClickOnView more reliable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> sometimes it doesn't work quite as advertised---need to figure out why. This   causes code like this  from boookmark_bar_gtk_interactive_uitest.cc:      // This is kind of a hack. Calling this just once doesn't seem to send a   click    // event  but doing it twice works.    ui_test_utils::ClickOnView(browser()  VIEW_ID_OTHER_BOOKMARKS);    ui_test_utils::ClickOnView(browser()  VIEW_ID_OTHER_BOOKMARKS);   </pre>
