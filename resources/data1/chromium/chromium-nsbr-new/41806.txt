<title>Issue 41806 -   chromium -    Autocomplete shows &quot;(Unlabeled)&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.3  Is this the most recent version: No  OS + version: Gentoo Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Metacity / GNOME 2.26  URLs (if relevant): N/A      1. Double click on any empty text entry box        A drop down containing recent or common completions should appear  which   can be drilled down to more specific choices by typing.        Autocomplete drop-down will say &quot;(Unlabeled)&quot; and sometimes will continue   to say &quot;(Unlabeled)&quot; as text is entered even if there should be matches.    I can reproduce this here on this bug tracker using the search fields.   </pre>
