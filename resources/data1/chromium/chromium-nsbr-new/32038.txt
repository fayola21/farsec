<title>Issue 32038 -   chromium -    Ugly Extensions Icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The extensions icon for the extensions page (both the favicon and page icon)   look out of place. The favicon is jagged and has no highlight while the page   icon looks blurred. For sake of consistency  it would just look nicer if both   icons were changed to match the styles of the Downloads and History pages. </pre>
