<title>Issue 28039 -   chromium -    Crash on clicking a link in Sync Setup Wizard in OS X with no browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run with --enable-sync  2. Open a browser window  3. Open the sync setup wizard (wrench menu  'Sync my bookmarks...')  4. Close the browser window  5. Click on a link from the sync setup wizard        On Windows  closing the browser window closes the wizard  too.  We can   do that  but I think the sync setup wizard should behave like e.g. the   preferences dialog  which on OS X remains open even if the launching   browser window is closed.  We'll have to support browser-less html dialogs   anyway  since we want to be able to trigger the sync setup wizard from the   Chrome menu (even with no browsers open). </pre>
