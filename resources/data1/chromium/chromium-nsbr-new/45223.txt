<title>Issue 45223 -   chromium -    Download tray resizing window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55      Firefox 3.x:OK      1.Download more than one file in one session (ie. more than one file in the download bar)  2.Close tray  3.Window stays maximised rather than returning to original size before download tray opened.      When the download tray opens it maximises the chrome window.  If only one file has been   downloaded upon manually closing the tray the window resizes to its previous size.  This would   also be the expected result for &gt;1 download.      The window stays at its larger  resized size. </pre>
