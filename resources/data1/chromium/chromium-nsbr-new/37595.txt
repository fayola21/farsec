<title>Issue 37595 -   chromium -    Scrolling behavior when filling forms on long pages broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a long thread in GMail  2. Reply to a long mail (so reply text box is full &amp; has a scrollbar). Focus on   reply text box.  3. Try scrolling (pageup/pagedown or using the doublefinger   scroll/mousewheel)      I expect scrolling to only affect the reply text box  so scrolling should stop   when I reach the top  or the bottom. This is the behavior in all other   browsers.      When I reach the top or the bottom  the entire window starts scrolling  and   the reply text box gets scrolled offscreen.    Please provide
