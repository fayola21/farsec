<title>Issue 24566 -   chromium -    Repeatedly clicking on omnibox lock icon opens multiple dialog windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28108)  OS + version: Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture: 32-bit  Window manager: ion3    When I go to an HTTPS URL  a new transient dialog window is opened every   time I click on the lock icon at the right end of the omnibox.  I'm not sure   what Windows does  but we should presumably just use a single window and   raise/present it each time the lock is clicked. </pre>
