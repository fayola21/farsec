<title>Issue 41613 -   chromium -    perf overview is busted for startup tests (and waterfall display also) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/overview.html    Look at the startup graphs  note the legend under it.  It's actually showing the shutdown graphs (because they show up   first on the perf detail pages.  So looking at the overview actually has no view of startup perf.    Look at :  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?</a>  builder=XP%20Interactive%20Perf&amp;last_time=1270659330&amp;show_events=true    (you'll need to add the flag so that loads)    Between builds 4211 &amp; 4212 there was a master restart that spun in shutdown tests as part of the startup tests  from that   point in time  the waterfall and overview graphs seem to have shifted to showing shutdown instead of startup.    Seems sorta like there is a general bug here in that the waterfall and overview only shows the first set of data collected    and it's far to easy for changes/additions to test to completely break the current reporting due to this assumption. </pre>
