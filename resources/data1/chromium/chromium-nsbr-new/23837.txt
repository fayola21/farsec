<title>Issue 23837 -   chromium -    sandbox UtilityProcess on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to have a sandboxed  chrome autoupdate-resilient (eg zygoted) utility   process on Linux and MacOS in the same places we do on Windows. We used to   use a non-sandboxed  non-update resilient utility process for both of them    but this caused nasty problems like <a title="chrome creating junk directory tree in $HOME" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23327"> Issue 23327 </a> so it is disabled for now.     Doing this depends on <a title="All subprocess creation needs to go through zygote"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22703">Issue 22703</a> (linux) and <a title="Make pak files resilient against overwriting / updating." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8102"> Issue 8102 </a> (mac).    </pre>
