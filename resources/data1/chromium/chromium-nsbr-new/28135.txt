<title>Issue 28135 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar button highlight and font color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I installed the &quot;Chuck Anderson&quot; theme and found bookmarks in the bookmark   bar to be barely readable if highlighted. This is because the theme uses a   bright highlight color and does not change the font color. I mailed the   author and this is what he had to say:    &quot;There is nothing I can do about this  sorry. It's something you'd have    to email Google about - I've got no control at this point&quot;    It would be nice if this could be solved somehow. Either inside chrome or by   giving the artists more power. </pre>
