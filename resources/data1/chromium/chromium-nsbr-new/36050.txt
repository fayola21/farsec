<title>Issue 36050 -   chromium -    TCPClientSocketPool::TCPConnectJobFactory should have user-specified timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is related to <a href="http://crbug.com/26761">http://crbug.com/26761</a>    When running unit tests in a debugger  I've run into timeout issues with   TCPConnectJob which caused the test to fail.    Should be able to override the value for unit tests to never timeout.     </pre>
