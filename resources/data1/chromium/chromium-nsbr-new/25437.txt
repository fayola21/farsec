<title>Issue 25437 -   chromium -    Scroll events in Chrome bleeding into the next window behind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  4.0.222.5    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): No scroll events bled  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): No scroll events bled  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: No scroll events bled      1. Open Chrome and another program (I used a terminal window) and   position them such that their windows overlap (Chrome on top)  2. Ensure both Chrome and the other window have a vertical scrollbar  3. Scroll with the mouse over the area where the windows overlap (easier   to repro with a macbook touchpad  but also possible with quick  big scrolls   of a mouse wheel)      Only the chrome window should scroll        Some of the scroll events bleed to the other window and it scrolls as well.      This looks to me like a mac-specific issue  but I suppose it's possible we're   not handling all scroll events on other platforms as well  and it's not   evident because of differences in event handling based on window focus.   </pre>
