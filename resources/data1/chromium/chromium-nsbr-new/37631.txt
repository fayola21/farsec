<title>Issue 37631 -   chromium -    Manual (external) editing of persistent prefs should be detectable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some persistent prefs contain data relating to UMA statistics  and may be   inadvertently changed by manual editing of the prefs files.    The prefs file should include a checksum when written.  A checksum-mismatch   at pref-restoration time (startup?) should not invalidate the restored   prefs generically  but the logging system should be able to query the prefs   system to ask if manual editing was performed.    I'll file a second bug  blocked on this  to have the logging system use   this API to validate trustworthiness of items used to calculate user stats   for UMA.    Note: It is sufficient to have a single checksum for all of prefs  and this   is not a request for a checksum on a per-pref basis. </pre>
