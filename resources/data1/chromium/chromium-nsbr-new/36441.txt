<title>Issue 36441 -   chromium -    Autofill dialog needs UI love - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Preferences-&gt;Personal Stuff-&gt;Set up AutoFill��_��__ (what's up with that   InterCaps name anyway?)  2. Look at dialog        Maccy dialog.        Windowsy dialog. In order of importance / radicality:    1.) Save/Cancel need to be swapped. &quot;Ok&quot; goes on the right on OS X  2.) Having only the zoom button enabled does not apply with the hig. See   <a href="http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/C">http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/C</a>  onceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGWindows/XHIGWindows.html   &quot;Title Bar   Buttons&quot;.  3.) The dialog maybe shouldn't have save/cancel buttons (like the prefs   dialog)  4.) The dialog looks generally weird. </pre>
