<title>Issue 42517 -   chromium -    Mac: Switch tab shortcut cycles in reverse in Hebrew keyboard layout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open 3 tabs  switch to the first tab.  2. Activate a Hebrew Keyboard layout.  3. Press command-shift-]      Should cycle to next tab  instead cycles to previous tab.  This happens due to the mirroring of the [] characters   in the Hebrew keyboard layout.    Expected result: Keyboard shortcut should act the same as it does if any other layout is active  to see expected   behavior  try the above steps in Terminal.app .   </pre>
