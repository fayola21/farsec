<title>Issue 31567 -   chromium -    should remove &quot;LayoutTests/&quot; prefix from test_expectations and the JSON files output by run_webkit_tests.py - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that we no longer have any pending or chromium tests  we no longer   need the LayoutTests/ prefix on tests since that's the only place the tests   could be.    We should remove it from test_expectations and from the JSON files output by   run_webkit_tests.py. This makes it more consistent with upstream and   generally makes everything more readable. </pre>
