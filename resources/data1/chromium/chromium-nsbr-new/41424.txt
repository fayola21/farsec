<title>Issue 41424 -   chromium -    Pepper 3D content on Mac OS X is not opaque - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use Pepper 3D to render content with alpha values less than 1.        Expect that the output is opaque  overlaying any other content on the page.    Instead  the output is composited with the surrounding page  which is incorrect according to the   current semantics of the Pepper 3D API.   </pre>
