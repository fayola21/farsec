<title>Issue 46230 -   chromium -    Offer per-page translation configuration - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The translation bar in Chromium is great. What I would like to have is a per-page option. Many times Chromium translates Gmail because I receive an email in another language  but that is not needed  since the UI of Gmail remains in a language I can understand and Gmail translates the mail itself. What's worse is that translating Gmail breaks the UI  so I'd like to tell Chromium to never translate Gmail. </pre>
