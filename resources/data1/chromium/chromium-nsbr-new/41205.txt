<title>Issue 41205 -   chromium -    Visited state lost on many pages (reddit  etc) from WebKit r57292-57476 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> visited link color broke for complex selectors at WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=57292">r57292</a>. This made visited links paint with   the wrong color on pages (like reddit).  This was fixed in WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=57476">r57476</a>.    Filing a just to keep it on hand  I don't think we branched in this range. </pre>
