<title>Issue 28388 -   chromium -    Mac: command-arrow keys insert mystery charactes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0 (Mac)      1. In text entry box  type command-[arrow key] (where &quot;command&quot; is the   &quot;apple&quot;  &quot;��_��_��_&quot;  or &quot;��_��_��_&quot; key.    What is the expected result? Cursor should move to home or end of line or   text box. If shift is also depressed  intermediate text should be selected.    What happens instead? Cursor moves as expected  but additional character is   inserted after cursor moves: e.g.  &quot;��_��_��_&quot; is inserted for command-right. If shift is   depressed  intermediate text is deleted  presumably because the text is   selected  then the stray character replaces it. </pre>
