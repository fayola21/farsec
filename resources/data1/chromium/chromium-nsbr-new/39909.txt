<title>Issue 39909 -   chromium -    Replace native bookmark manager with HTML-based one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're replacing the native bookmark manager with one written in HTML.    You'll see it on trunk builds already.  Because this has a whole new set of   bugs  the old bugs are all obsolete and I'm going to dup them against this   bug.    This has been the plan for quite a while -- the native bookmark manager was   just a stopgap -- so no need to link me to <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html</a>   (besides  I just did it for you). </pre>
