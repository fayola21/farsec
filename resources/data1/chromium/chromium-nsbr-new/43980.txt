<title>Issue 43980 -   chromium -    Using html comments in inline style section of a page causes rendering issues. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;            Firefox 3.x: FAIL             IE 8: OK    Use of HTML comments in the inline &lt;style&gt; section seem to affect the   rendering of the page in Chrome (and FireFox).  In the included example    there are five styles defined and each one is assigned to a div as it's ID.    Just above the first style definition  there's an HTML comment (&lt;!-- --&gt;).    This comment causes the entire single definition to not render.  Removing   the comment works fine.    The comment in the style section can be moved above any of the five defined   styles and that particular one will no longer render so this can be   reproduced.    Use of /* */ comments also work as intended but I thought this issue may be   of interest since developers using inline styles (still handy despite   separate CSS files) might inadvertently use html comments throughout -   which should be legal as long as everything's on the same page.    </pre>
