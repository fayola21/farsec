<title>Issue 29994 -   chromium -    Unit tests crashing because of sync service - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I disabled a number of unit tests for chromeos builders as they're crashing.   They are crashing in profile_sync_service because profile()-  &gt;GetRequestContext() returns null for tests. I tried early returning if the   context is null  but that triggered a crash else where in sync. </pre>
