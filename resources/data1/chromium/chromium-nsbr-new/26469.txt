<title>Issue 26469 -   chromium -    The color of the folders (in the bookmarks bar) should match the main color theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: After the version 3.0.195.3 (when themes were supported)        Applying a new theme doesn't change the color of the folders in the   bookmarks bar.   I believe this is a bug only stylistic. Because if the folders aren't   longer just yellow  matching the theme applied  certainly the appearance of   Chrome will be benefited.    Certainly the engineer responsible for maintaining the appearance of Chrome   may have realized this &quot;inconsistency&quot;.     I just wanted to document this in an issue.         The color of the folders should match the main color theme.        Color of the folders is yellow.      NOTE: I had this idea for Chrome after to realize that the color of the   Gmail stars change with change of its themes.   The same should happen with the elements of the Google browser.    ---  In the image attached  for example  its color should be purple.   It would a visual sensation more enjoyable. </pre>
