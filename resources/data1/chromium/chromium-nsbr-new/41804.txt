<title>Issue 41804 -   chromium -    Keyboard input in &quot;to&quot; and &quot;subject&quot; fields doesn't work. - Gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a report I got from a friend that heads of an IT department of a company in Iceland.  They use Google Apps and Chrome.  He's running Chrome 5 on the beta channel  whereas the   rest are running stable.  Potentially this problem is limited to Icelandic.      1.  Open up Gmail and compose a new message.  2.  Try to enter something into the To and Subject fields.  3.  Profit.        Expected: To see what is typed.  Actual: Nothing happens (as in no input is received).    A workaround is to right click on the input fields and then start typing.  For some reason input   starts to work at that point.    Marking as Area-UI  but possibly this is a Webkit issue? </pre>
