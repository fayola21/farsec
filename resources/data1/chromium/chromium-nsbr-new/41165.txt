<title>Issue 41165 -   chromium -    size of input field is too large in crome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=try_dom_text_size">http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=try_dom_text_size</a>  Other browsers tested: firefox  ie                 1. define input text field with size 10          input with size 10      input with size 13    You can see it on w3schools.com (see link).  On my webpage (wich is dynamic so I can't give you the link) I have several  inputfields on one row who are calculated by the column name length.  These inputfields are in the middle column of a table with three columns  with all have fixed length.  Because the size of the inputfield gets larger ( 2 positions compared to  firefox and ie) the middle column gets bigger and is overstreching the  other two columns oltough all collumns have a fixed with.    Therefore I consider it as a serious problem.  I can make a recalculation based on chrome but I do not know if this issue  will be solved a futere version of the browser.   </pre>
