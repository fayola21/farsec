<title>Issue 42225 -   chromium -    Need a setting for tab key behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : all  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Open any site with any form field that's not given a tabindex attribute.  2. Hit the &quot;Tab&quot; key.  3. Pull out hair.      &quot;Tab&quot; should move the focus to the next form element  like a search field for instance. In most   other browsers  there is a setting to change this from the current behaviour (tab between links) to   tab between fields. Obviously a lot of people will be on the other side of this bug report saying it   should be kept as the default  but why not have a setting?       The focus moves inexplicably to the first link on the page  and unless I'm to use my mouse   (never!) I have to hit tab a bunch of times to get to the field I wanna fill in. This behaviour   becomes extra super annoying if I'm entering data into a form which has links between fields.     </pre>
