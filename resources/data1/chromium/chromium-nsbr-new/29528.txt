<title>Issue 29528 -   chromium -    tab rendering issue with Purisa system font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.22  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32 bit  window manager : Gnome        1. Change system font to Purisa  2. Write url in adress bar.  3. Hit enter to go to the site.      Normal behaviour...      When i enter the text in adress bar it looks like font is too big for it   and its scrolling up and down with every letter i enter. In addition to   this  when i hit enter to go to the site all tabs are disappearing for a   moment and then comes back. What can i do?     </pre>
