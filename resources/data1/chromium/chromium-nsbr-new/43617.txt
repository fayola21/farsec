<title>Issue 43617 -   chromium -    PerezHilton.com freezes with Flash enabled. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm sorry I can't nail it down with a smaller testcase  but if you walk back through the &quot;news&quot; pages   on <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com">http://www.perezhilton.com</a> you will eventually encounter content that freezes the renderer and   brings up the dialog to kill it.    It has to do with flash  because if i enable FlashBlock  it doesn't happen. Right now  page 2 is doing   it  but as more content is added  it'll drift farther back in time. Saving the html to disk (html only or   complete page) doesn't reproduce. Only if loaded from the server.    It is 100% reproducible on both my machine and my wife's. Happens in ToT Chromium and 375   branch. This is probably a regression from the prior beta  she never had a problem before. </pre>
