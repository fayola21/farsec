<title>Issue 39937 -   chromium -    Menu items in extension popups cannot be selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.366.0 (43142)  Is this the most recent version: Yes    As per the title. Instead the popup closes. This seems to be related to the   recent addition of popup inspection  because it does still work when inspect   mode is enabled.    Try to change the All Departments menu in this extension. It works with   up/down keys but not the cursor.    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jiannbmldmbdmkhkdknlaemanjcobdko">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jiannbmldmbdmkhkdknlaemanjcobdko</a>     </pre>
