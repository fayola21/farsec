<title>Issue 29838 -   chromium -    [Mac] The installed extensions won't sit nicely next to the address bar even after re-start - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Chromium for Mac 4.0.266&gt; - the version one week   before the number I listed here    OS version               : &lt;OS X 10 10.5.8&gt;      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: didn't test    So  I went crazy and installed ~30ish extensions ( mostly browser actions)    then I decided to try out with 1024 * 768 res.      The extensions start to overlap with my address bar.     Then I decided I have had enough being an AOL user  and changed back   1920  * 1200.  I thought it will change back so my extensions will sit nicely   next to my address bar.  But it didn't so I am stuck.         1.  install over 30+ extensions  2.  change res to smaller such as 1024  3.   error occurs  if you restart browser  doesn't fix the problem      extensions should sit next to my address bar        address bar and extension overlapping   </pre>
