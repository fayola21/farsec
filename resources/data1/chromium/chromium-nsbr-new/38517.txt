<title>Issue 38517 -   chromium -    Run Firefox layout tests to detect problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox is another open source project that has tests similar to our layout   tests. Some of these may trigger similar issues in our code as they do/did in   Firefox  as show by <a title="Memory error with malformed SVG" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38499"> issue 38499 </a>.    It would be great if we could automatically run all Firefox tests like we run   out layout tests  if only to see if they trigger any crashes in Chromium.     </pre>
