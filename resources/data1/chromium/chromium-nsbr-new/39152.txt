<title>Issue 39152 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't leave line selection mode once activated in XFCE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page with multiline text (e.g. do a Google search)  2. Do a multi-line select (drag mouse vertically in the empty space on the   right hand side)  3. Try clearing the selection by clicking in an empty area  or try to   select a few characters in an unselected paragraph.      The selection should a) be cleared and b) revert to character-selection   mode.      The selection seems to be stuck in multi-line selection mode. I can   sometimes leave it by wildly clicking around  but I couldn't find a   reliable way of doing it.    <b>Please provide
