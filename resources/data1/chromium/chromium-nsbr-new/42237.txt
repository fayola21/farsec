<title>Issue 42237 -   chromium -    Move Address/Credit card profile creation into sub-dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think the flow of creation of autofill profiles would be a lot simpler/less   fiddly if the &quot;address&quot; and &quot;credit card&quot; profile forms were sub dialogs.   Then there would be no ambiguity about whether the data is being saved  and   the main autofill settings dialog box would feel less cramped.    Proposed changes:    - Create two different sub dialog boxes  one for Create/Edit address  and one   for Create/Edit credit card  and move those forms into them.  - Have the Add Address/Credit card buttons on the main autofill settings   screen open these sub dialogs modally. </pre>
