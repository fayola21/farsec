Register *yahoo.com* in ChromeFrame registry  2. Launch IE6 with GCF installed  access www.yahoo.com        Yahoo home page should be rendered by GCF properly  but now it is blank or  just partially rendered.    We should fix this problem  because it is rendered successfully in IE8 with  GCF installed. </pre>
