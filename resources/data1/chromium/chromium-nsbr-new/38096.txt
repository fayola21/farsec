<title>Issue 38096 -   chromium -     'Setup Autofill' should keep on trigger until user responds to the bar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: Trunk 5.0.353.0 (Developer Build 41481)    With the current behavior  Setup Autofill info bar triggers only once PER  PROFILE that's it. NO matter the tab crashes/browser window crashes for  some reasons.    But I guess  we should keep on triggering the setup autofill info bar until  user responds to the bar ( by closing it with 'x' button/clicking on the  buttons [Setup/Nope] ). In this way  if the tab with setup autofill info  bar crashes or browser window crashes for some reasons  we can still alert  the user about this feature.   </pre>
