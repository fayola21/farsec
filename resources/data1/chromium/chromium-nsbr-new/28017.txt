<title>Issue 28017 -   chromium -    Feature request: &quot;go to the originating window&quot; for notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Forking off from internal security review bug 2161143; see that bug for  context]    It looks like it would decrease the odds of user confusion  and hence lower  the risk of phishing  if we provided a button labeled &quot;take me to that  window!&quot; that would bring the window that called createNotification() - if  that context is still present - to focus.    There is also a non-security usability angle to this - the current design  is forcing the user to hunt for the right window / tab (and he might have  several instances of GMail open). </pre>
