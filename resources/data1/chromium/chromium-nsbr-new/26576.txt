<title>Issue 26576 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame requires administrator rights to install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: all versions      <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=161796">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=161796</a>      1. Download and try to install CF  2. Admin rights are required to install      ===  We operate a JS-intensive web application  which is incompatible with  Internet Explorer mainly due to performance issues. Since it mainly targets  business users  we are stuck with IE6 at many customer sites.    ChromeFrame is a promising solution. However  the required administrative  rights are quite a blocker. We've tried several times. The IT departments  are blocking constantly.    We and our customers would expect ChromeFrame to install without admin rights.        ===  Admin rights are currently required. </pre>
