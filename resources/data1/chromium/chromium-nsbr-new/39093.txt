<title>Issue 39093 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Tabbed bookmark manager cannot change width of left-side folders frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.361.0 (Developer Build 42364) TRUNK  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://bookmarks      1. Use tabbed bookmark manager  2. Have some folders with long names        When there are folders with long names  the left-side folders frame   displays a horizontal scrollbar to see the long names.  However  it is not   possible to change and/or increase the width of that frame to see the long   names completely without the horizontal scrollbar.    This is a Regression.  Compare with the native bookmark manager where   changing the width of the folders frame was possible. </pre>
