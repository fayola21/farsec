<title>Issue 37563 -   chromium -    Various graphical bugs with de-emphasized render views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new de-emphasizing code produces interesting glitches.  These   screenshots came from a trunk build  running under Classic mode (didn't try   testing on Aero but I assume it's the same)  on my portrait monitor (which   contributes to the Cleartype AA being extra-visible  since the subpixels   aren't where Windows thinks they'll be).    Bug 1: Cleartype AA interacts badly with the filter.  I suspect this would   be less noticeable (but probably not entirely gone) on a non-rotated   monitor.  Looks like all the letters have some kind of edge detection   filter turned up.    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Bug 2 </a>: Grabbing the auth window and moving it around causes parts of it to   &quot;bleed&quot; into the background and not be erased properly.  This is reset when   you focus another application.  Flip between screenshots 1 and 2  and take   a look at things like the scrollbar thumb and form controls.  (Interesting   that the effect seems to occur on the scrollbar thumb but not the track.)    <a title="This is a test" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3"> Bug 3 </a>: Clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; leaves a visible hole in the grey filter for a   half second before the entire filter is removed.    <a title="Scrolling with some scroll mice (touchpad  etc.) scrolls down but not up" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4"> Bug 4 </a>: (No screenshot) Holding down &quot;enter&quot; in the dialog causes rapid   crazy flickering  with effects like the background page turning normal-  color while the constrained window disappears and leaves a grey splotch   behind.    I don't think we should ship stable with these kinds of flaws. </pre>
