<title>Issue 34074 -   chromium -    Chrome does not obey Keyboard and Mouse shortcuts for Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Obeys shortcuts  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Lacks corresponding command  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Go to System settings.  2. Go to Keyboard &amp; Mouse.  3. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts  4. Under Application Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; All Applications  add a new   shortcut. The shortcut command should be Paste and Match Style and the   combination should be Command-V.      In Safari  you can observer that this works by checking the edit menu and   see that Command-V is now assigned to Paste and Match Style. When   pasting text into GMail  the text's style will match the email body's. This   also works in other applications like Adium.      Although Chrome has the Paste and Match Style command in the edit   menu  Command-V is still assigned to Paste. </pre>
