<title>Issue 25767 -   chromium -    Hard to see how to delete cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My wife wanted to know how to delete cookies in chrome.  She looked at the wrench / Options / Under the Hood / Privacy menu   but didn't see the &quot;Show Cookies&quot; button (it's hard to see   and didn't trigger our &quot;aha  that's how you delete cookies&quot; sensors.)    If other people are also having trouble seeing this button   maybe it should be renamed or highlighted somehow?   </pre>
