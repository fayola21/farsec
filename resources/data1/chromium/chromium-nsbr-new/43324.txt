<title>Issue 43324 -   chromium -    Notifications often don't have a &quot;dismiss&quot; button visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When changing between dual monitors  projecting  and laptop screen only  I   often get mangled notifications. Sometimes the &quot;dismiss&quot; buttons appear   underneath the Win7 systray  and sometimes the notifications panel just   doesn't have any of the controls (see attachment).    When this happens  it's nearly impossible to get the mangled notification to   go away.     </pre>
