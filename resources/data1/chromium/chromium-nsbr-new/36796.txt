<title>Issue 36796 -   chromium -    Pen flicks on tablets being registered twice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2  (but has been an issue forever)  Windows version      : Win7 x64       1. On a tablet computer copy some text  2. Try to paste text anywhere in Chrome (e.g. in the address bar) by using   the corresponding windows-defined pen flick       - text should be pasted once      - text is pasted twice    Several users reported this issue here: <a href="http://goo.gl/DQ4C">http://goo.gl/DQ4C</a> (points to   <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  fid=62d5287cd4d147dd0004806c537c95a3&amp;hl=en )    It looks like this is related to <a title="Page forward  page backward  and scroll wheel commands being executed twice"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19672">issue 19672</a> which discusses e.g. page   forward issues. I'll test back at my tablet to see if that issue persists.    Not sure if this also happens in Vista or XP tablet.   </pre>
