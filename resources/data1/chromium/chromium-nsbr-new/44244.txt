<title>Issue 44244 -   chromium -    [Linux] Copy (Ctrl+C) entire/partial URL from Omnibox and pasting does not include http:// protocol - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : Ubuntu Linux Chrome 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47049) dev      1. Goto to any website like <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>  2. Select the entire URL or any part of the URL from the Omnibox and then   Copy (eg. Ctrl+C) or Cut (eg. Ctrl+X)  3. Goto another application and Paste       When pasting  the text also needs to include the http part.  And this must   work regardless of rich text or normal text.      The protocol is missing.    Is not the HTTPStripping copy/cut-and-paste functionality supposed to be:  As long as the selection includes the beginning of the URL and includes at   least the entire hostname  the http:// is included when copying/cutting and   subsequent pastes.  It does not matter if you select starting from the   beginning  anywhere in the middle  or the end. </pre>
