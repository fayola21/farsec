<title>Issue 37847 -   chromium -    NP tests seem to be fragile on 10.6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today the master got bounced  causing the Mac10.6 Tests bot to stop in the middle of   browser_tests.  When the next CL came in  we had two tests failing off and on.  I've seen this   same pattern happen before on the 10.6 test bots also  tests aren't always the same ones  but it's   always NPAPI tests.  Here are the two from today:    /b/slave/chromium-rel-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc:885: Failure  Value of: test_result    Actual: false  Expected: true  [  FAILED  ] NPAPITester.Arguments (5806 ms)    /b/slave/chromium-rel-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc:885: Failure  Value of: test_result    Actual: false  Expected: true  [  FAILED  ] NPAPITester.NPObjectProxy (5807 ms)    My guess is when things do get gunned down  something isn't cleaning up right under 10.6  so   we get into trouble going forward  so this could be a problem for Chrome also with crashes on   10.6.   </pre>
