<title>Issue 34038 -   chromium -    Display bug when typing in the text search bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 (__��_��__�ܕ�__��__��__��_____ _��__��__��__��____��__��_ 35555) stable  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/StuApp1/examsDP.do">http://www.shef.ac.uk/StuApp1/examsDP.do</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Open <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/StuApp1/examsDP.do">http://www.shef.ac.uk/StuApp1/examsDP.do</a>  2. Before the page is loaded completely open the search bar by pressing   Ctrl+F and type 'Symbolic Reasoning'  3. Wait for the page to load completely and press Enter        'Symbolic Reasoning' should be found and marked. The displayed total number   of occurrences should be 1. The number of the current match should be 1.        The number of the current match is 1 but the total number of occurrences is   0 which means that it is not refreshed properly after the page has loaded   completely. The screen is positioned so 'Symbolic Reasoning' is in visible   range after one or two presses of Enter but the match is not marked in the   text and on the slide bar.    There is a screenshot attached showing the problem. </pre>
