<title>Issue 30031 -   chromium -    Feat.req.: add an option to have Addons work in Incognito-mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some (hopefully few) extensions would be nice to have enabled in Incognito   mode  starting with those I've created myself.    Possible blockers:  * Are extensions staying inside the user profile  and Incognito anyway uses   its own profile?  * Does Incognito have its own tabs object?    * Where to fit UI to enable/disable that? Perhaps &quot;[x] Enable in Incognito   mode&quot; ? Maybe in a new Permission dialog per each extension  filed as <a title="Feature req: permission dialog to see (modify) permissions for an extension" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30030"> issue   30030 </a>  -- since anyway I'd need to know the active permissions of an   extension to make an informed decision whether it would compromise Incognito   or not. </pre>
