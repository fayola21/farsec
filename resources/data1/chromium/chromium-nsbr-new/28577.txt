<title>Issue 28577 -   chromium -    Remove theming from links / text in notifications on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Notifications on the NTP (such as &quot;Thumbnail removed.  Undo.&quot;) appear on a   butterbar  and should never be themed.  In themes such as &quot;Grass&quot;  text will   appear as white against the yellow bar  and therefore be unreadable.  Fix. </pre>
