<title>Issue 37761 -   chromium -    make cpu burning tabs more visible to the user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Calendar always burns about 5% of my CPU.    I currently have 3 random web pages in background tabs each toodleing along   at ~1% CPU.    The battery life on my MacBook and Chrome OS laptop are each less than 1 hr.    Can we monitor CPU usage by tabs and if they persistently eat CPU can we put   some kind of battery icon in tab to let users know that closing the tab will   save battery? The hover text can read  &quot;This site is pig and the developer   should fix it.&quot; It may be hard to allocate browser and plug-in process CPU to   tabs  but even without that this feature would be useful. </pre>
