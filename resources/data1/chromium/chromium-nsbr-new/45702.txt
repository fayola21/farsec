<title>Issue 45702 -   chromium -    Changes to dynamically-loaded local javascript files are not detected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta        Firefox 3.5.9: OK      1. Save the two attached files to the same folder on your computer  2. Open test.html as a local file (e.g. via file:///...)  notice that 'hi'   is displayed.  3. Change test.js to alert anything else.  4. Reload test.html      The new message should be displayed.      The original 'hi' is displayed instead. Changes to test.js are not picked   up.    Clearing the cache and opening the page in a new tab/window both solve the   issue. Appending a changing GET parameter string to the requested script   solves the problem too  but it's a workaround for what I think is a bug. is   there a reason chrome should /not/ detect changes to local files?    The workaround I'm using: in test.html  change     script.src='test.js';  to     script.src='test.js?time=' + (new Date()).getTime();   </pre>
