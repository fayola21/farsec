<title>Issue 35316 -   chromium -    Click to play plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193) dev    i like having some sites set to block plugins (flash) by default  when occasionally i do want to enable the flash content there are exactly   two options in the new omnibox menu: Continue blocking popups &amp; Always   allow plugins on [URL]    i am missing an &quot;Allow this time only&quot; option. (if it means reload the page   to do that then reload...)    just like you can still choose to open the blocked popups you should be   able to temporarily allow the plugins    i guess the same probably goes for blocking images </pre>
