<title>Issue 42363 -   chromium -    dropping a link onto a folder in the bookmarks bar should put it in the folder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Grab a link on a web page.  2. Drop it on a folder in the bookmarks bar.    I expect the link to get added to the folder. Instead it gets added to the top level of the bookmarks   bar.    I also expect links I drop into the bookmarks bar to go where I drop them. Instead  they always go   to the end. </pre>
