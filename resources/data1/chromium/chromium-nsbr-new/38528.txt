<title>Issue 38528 -   chromium -    Empty span incorrectly rendered as block element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta  WebKit Version       : 532.9  URLs (if applicable) : HTML file attached    OTHER BROWSERS TESTED:         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK        WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM?  Open the attached HTML document. (Tested on Mac OS X 10.5  Ubuntu)    WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT?  The form fields are organized in a table with two columns: one for the   label  and one for an input element and a span element. Normally this span   element would be used to display form validation errors.    The sample document has two of these tables. The one on top has a span with   no child nodes  the one on the bottom has one child  a text node. I would   expect the the vertical alignment of the two tables to be the same.    WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD?  The empty span element gets rendered as a block element and placed on a new   line  which increases the size of the table row and changes the vertical   alignment of the input field. The bottom span element is correctly rendered   as inline  and does not disturb the vertical alignment.   </pre>
