<title>Issue 24038 -   chromium -    Add a certificate blacklist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add a certificate blacklist and X509Certificate::Verify  should treat any blacklisted certificate as invalid.  The blacklist  is useful before those certificates are revoked or before system  crypto libraries are patched to disallow those certificates.    Initially the blacklist will contain the certificate published in  <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/fulldisc/full-disclosure/70363">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/fulldisc/full-disclosure/70363</a>    Note: Chromium's SSL interstitial page for the &quot;certificate invalid&quot;  error does not have a &quot;Proceed anyway&quot; button. We don't want to let  users click through to sites that use blacklisted certificates. </pre>
