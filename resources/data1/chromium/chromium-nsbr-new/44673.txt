<title>Issue 44673 -   chromium -    Real plugin test fails on XP Perf 2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We enabled plugin_tests on more bots  but PluginTest.Real is failing on XP   Perf 2. I logged into the bot and tried running the test manually. The   plugin loads but becomes unresponsive.    The differences between XP Perf 2 and XP Perf Dbg are:  1. Release vs. Debug  2. Real machine vs. virtual machine  3. nppl3260.dll 6.0.12.732 vs. 6.0.12.450  4. ???   </pre>
