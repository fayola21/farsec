<title>Issue 38691 -   chromium -    Mac: Client-cert picker shouldn't show certs the server won't accept - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The SSL server can send a list of DistinguishedNames of CAs it accepts certs from. When   SSLClientSocket generates the list of available client certs  it should filter it by that criterion so the   user doesn't see certs the server won't accept. </pre>
