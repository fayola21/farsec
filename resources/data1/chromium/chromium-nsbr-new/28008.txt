<title>Issue 28008 -   chromium -    Dragging a tab may cause browser window to close (browser crash) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.3.22.2 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=242">r242</a>)  Chrome: 4.0.245.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31763">r31763</a>)        1. Try to drag a tab.    What is the expected output?     Browser window should not close.    What do you see instead?    Browser window closes ... looks like browser crash.  It doesn't happen  every time  but fairly often.  May reproduce more easily if there is more  than 1 tab open in the browser window.   </pre>
