<title>Issue 36049 -   chromium -    Add defensive model safety parameter to WriteTransaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Any time we want to open a WriteTransaction from within the   sync engine (everything below syncapi)  we want to prevent modifications   of data types that aren't on a &quot;safe&quot; thread.  One way to do this is to   require passing (to the wtrans ctor) the current model safe group (or worker     or legal types  or something). This way  whenever a MutableEntry is   Initialized  we can compare the type of the entry with the legal types in   the WriteTransaction  and if they don't match  null-out the EntryKernel. </pre>
