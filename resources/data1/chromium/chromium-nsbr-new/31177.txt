<title>Issue 31177 -   chromium -    &quot;Full keyboard access&quot; setting not respected by Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac OS X allows users to choose between two options for how the tab key affects keyboard   focus:     1. The default  tab moves focus only between text boxes  ignoring other controls  2. Just like that on Windows and Linux  tab moves focus to the next control    Most browsers on OS X respect this setting  but allow it to be overridden. (In Safari with the   &quot;Press tab to highlight each item on a webpage&quot; preference  in Firefox with the hidden config   setting accessibility.tabfocus.)    Chrome currently ignores the setting and only allows behavior #2.      Chrome Version       : 4.0.282.0 (35277)  URLs (if applicable) : Many  eg: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=test">http://www.google.com/search?q=test</a>  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Tab key moves focus to search bar  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Tab key moves focus to search bar  unless config setting   acessibility.tabfocus is modified      1. Open System Preferences  go to Keyboard pref-pane  Keyboard Shortcuts tab. Ensure &quot;Full   keyboard access&quot; (at bottom of tab) is set to &quot;Text boxes and lists only&quot;.  2. Enter <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=test">http://www.google.com/search?q=test</a> in the omnibox and press return.  3. When the page loads  press the tab key.        Keyboard focus should move to the first text box.        Keyboard focus moves to the first link  as if &quot;Full Keyboard Access&quot; was set to &quot;All controls&quot; </pre>
