<title>Issue 26193 -   chromium -    Link-in-new-tab works strangely in some places - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.gosugamers.net/">http://www.gosugamers.net/</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE8        Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: FAIL - won't open new tab at all      1. Hover over one of the replay links and try quick-open a link in a new   tab by using the middle mouse button (or two buttons of laptop).      A new tab in the background  nothing else.        A new page is loaded in the background  but the active page also follows   that same link  effectively loading the page twice  in two tabs. </pre>
