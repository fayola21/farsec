<title>Issue 25317 -   chromium -    Help extensions authors make options pages with a consistent look - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We recently added support for extensions to declare an &quot;options_page&quot; in their manifest pointing to a page   bundled in their extension (<a title="Add an options_page to the manifest" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23801"> Issue 23801 </a>). This enables a &quot;options/preferences&quot; button in the   chrome://extensions UI which users can click to open a new tab with that page. The extension author can then   use localStorage  etc. to store various settings related to their extension.    We'd like to provide some facility to make it easy for extensions authors to create options pages with a   consistent look  perhaps matching the chrome://extensions page itself (mocks of that are attached to <a title="Implement final management UI" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12119"> Issue   12119 </a>). The most straightforward way to do this is probably to provide some css classes that are   automatically injected and available  similar to the &quot;toolstrip-button&quot; class we had for toolstrips. For   reference  that file was:    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/renderer/resources/extension_toolstrip.css?view=log">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/renderer/resources/extension_toolstrip.css?view=log</a>      Also  there was a thread of discussion on the chromium-extensions group about configuration/options:    <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/eea7f1b2175a54fa/5830ff8133b5904b">https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/eea7f1b2175a54fa/5830ff8133b5904b</a>       </pre>
