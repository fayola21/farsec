<title>Issue 42031 -   chromium -    Console : allow Search and Scroll Lock in console.log output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Create and run an extension that has a big loop with console.log(&quot;test&quot;)   message in the loop.  1. Open Developer-&gt;Javascript Console  2. The Scroll bar keeps moving to the bottom as the loops is executed.  3. Typing word 'test' in top-right Search box. Result nothing happens.        1) There are scripts with a lot of console.log() output messages. There   should be a scroll lock toggle to keep the console page/scroll fixed   instead of it getting focused to the last console.log output message. This   will be very helpful when debugging scripts that uses setInterval method   to execute script functions and print console.log every few seconds.    2) Ability to quickly Find / Search in console.log output would be very   useful too.        1) There is no scroll lock. Console scrolls down fast. We have to manually   scan  scroll up/down to find the log message we looking for.  2) Search box is there but it doesn't work on Console output. It works on   'Elements' tab though.    <b>Please provide
