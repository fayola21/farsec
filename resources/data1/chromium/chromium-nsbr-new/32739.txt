<title>Issue 32739 -   chromium -    Add temporary suppressions for CLD/valgrind errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To help get the CLD stuff in and understand the totality of the issues we're   working with with it  we should add suppressions for valgrind errors relating   to CLD usage. This will unblock Jay from completing the rest of the work   surrounding translate and allow the work fixing these errors to be   parallelized with the CLD maintainer. </pre>
