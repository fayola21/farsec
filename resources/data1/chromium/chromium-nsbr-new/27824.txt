<title>Issue 27824 -   chromium -    Backspace  arrow keys  etc. don't work as expected inside of text inputs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to google.com  2. Type 'A' in the search box  3. Try to delete that character.  You can't.    I reproduced this with a debug build based on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32056">r32056</a>.  I'm not sure what   caused the regression. </pre>
