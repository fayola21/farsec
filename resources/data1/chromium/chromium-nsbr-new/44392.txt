<title>Issue 44392 -   chromium -    After testing Linux WorkerPool on Mac  move to posix or delete ifdef. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For purposes of allowing a command-line switch to convert between Mac and Linux WorkerPool   implementations  I added a slight hack to worker_pool_linux.cc.  This bug is to track either shifting   that code into worker_pool_posix.cc (if we decide to convert Mac over)  or remove the ifdef. </pre>
