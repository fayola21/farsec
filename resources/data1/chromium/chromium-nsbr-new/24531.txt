<title>Issue 24531 -   chromium -    Using mousewheel/touchpad for vertical scrolling causes all windows under the pointer to scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.4 (28686)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Open a window to a page longer than the window size (ie  that needs a   scrollbar)  2. Open a second window to a similarly long page and place it partly over   the first (in z-axis)  3. Use a touchpad to scroll up and down over the unique parts of the first   window  the unique parts of the second window  and the overlapping parts   of the windows.      The scrolling behaviour should act only on the window closest to the user   in z-axis (or the window with focus... not sure which is saner)      Any window under the pointer scrolls.  Possibly all chromewindows are   capturing the scroll event  not the key window alone.    Constraints:  This only happens between chrome windows.  Scroll events are not leaking   between Chrome and other apps  in either direction. </pre>
