<title>Issue 28089 -   chromium -    Fire keypress() events for keys with cmd down that are not menu accelerators - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> That would make us match better what Safari does.    Even though keypress() should fire  no actual character should be inserted.   See <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/51095">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/51095</a> :-P </pre>
