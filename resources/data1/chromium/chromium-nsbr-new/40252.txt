<title>Issue 40252 -   chromium -    Disabled types not deleted from syncer database - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set up sync to sync bookmarks and prefs.  2. Then  using the configure-sync options UI  disable bookmark sync and hit   apply.  3. Wait a few seconds  then close the browser.  4. Open the sync database from the user profile.  5. Observe that your bookmarks are still stored on disk      This data should be erased.    ====    Proposed fix: we could implement a (non-modelchanging) SyncerCommand that   would delete any items having a disabled  (i.e. not in routing_info_)   ModelType or ServerModelType. </pre>
