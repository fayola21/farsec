<title>Issue 39214 -   chromium -    Recent versions of sync are misreporting extensions activity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the sync server  we're seeing some impossibly large (2 billion) and   impossibly small (less than 0) values being sent as counts in the   ChromiumExtensionsActivity reporting at commit time.  These indicate some   kind of client regression  probably due to syncV2 work. </pre>
