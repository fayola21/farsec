<title>Issue 31126 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Chromium resizes the window without warning or user action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. While using Chromium in a non-maximized window and being logged into   Gmail open a message containing the December 2009 issue of the The   Sightseer Newsletter from Google Earth.  2. Middle-click a link to get more information on a new feature in a new   tab  such as the high res facades in Google Earth (http://google-  latlong.blogspot.com/2009/11/building-blocks-3d-models-with-detailed.html)      The URI is opened in a new tab without resizing my Chromium window      The URI opens in a new tab but the Chromium window is suddenly larger than   the width I was using and much longer than the width I was using (in this   case the window now extends below the bottom of my screen). Attempting to   resize the window will not let me make the window shorter with the mouse    and using the movement keys (after using Alt-Spacebar &gt; Resize) will let me   make the screen short enough to see the bottom of the window but as soon as   I try to use the mouse the height of the window immediately returns to the   longer dimensions. I am only successful in resizing the window once I have   closed the new tab  and even then I can only resize the window with my   mouse.    <b>Please provide
