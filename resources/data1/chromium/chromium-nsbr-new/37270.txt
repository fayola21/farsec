<title>Issue 37270 -   chromium -    Infinite recursion crashes seem to confuse crash reporting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="Crash when mousing over bookmark menus in fullscreen mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37228"> Issue 37228 </a>.  That crash ended up being an infinite recursion  which might explain the empty   crash report.    Mark  I've split this off from the original bug.  Feel free to either confirm or close it if you don't   think it's a problem. </pre>
