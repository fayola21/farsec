<title>Issue 28957 -   chromium -    No icon for crx files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12      1. Download a theme        Icon in the download bar should look interesting; like a chrome theme or   extension.        It gets the default document icon that's used for unknown extensions.    This requires an icon and probably a change to the plist that adds crx as a   filetype that can be opened with chrome. </pre>
