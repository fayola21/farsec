Issue:  When I scroll to the bottom of the page  the next issue in the list is   navigated in page2 and It continuous indefinitely i.e again scroll-down   then next issue is rendered in the next page.    Pls see the video @   <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/chromeqa/crashDumps/InfinitePageRendering.avi">http://www.corp.google.com/chromeqa/crashDumps/InfinitePageRendering.avi</a>    I think this is caused by FastestChrome - Browse Faster (ver:2.2.4)   extension.   </pre>
