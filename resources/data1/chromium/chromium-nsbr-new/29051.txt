<title>Issue 29051 -   chromium -    Support build specific optflags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium should define a location where distribution specific optflags can  be set for the entire source tree (in a single  documented location).  Particularly nasty or special code can append specific optflags after the  &quot;user defined&quot; optflags for compilation of those files  but only as special  cases (and these cases should be well documented and/or bugs).    -O# optimization flags (and architecture specific optflags) should not be  set (or should be overriden) by the &quot;user defined&quot; optflags  if present.    Probably makes sense for this to live in src/build/common.gypi. </pre>
