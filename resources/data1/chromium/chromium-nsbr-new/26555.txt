<title>Issue 26555 -   chromium -    Mac audio unit tests take too long to run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> fbarchard@ noticed this originally.. the audio output tests don't normally   run on the builders due to lack of sound card.    The one exception would be Macs.  Turns out running audio output test under   valgrind/tsan is HORRENDOUSLY SLOW!    [----------] 6 tests from MacAudioTest  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.SineWaveAudio16MonoTest  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.SineWaveAudio16MonoTest (13 ms)  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamGetAndClose  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamGetAndClose (940256 ms)  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamOpenAndClose  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamOpenAndClose (3225 ms)  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPlay200HzTone44KssMono  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPlay200HzTone44KssMono (7905 ms)  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPlay200HzTone22KssMono  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPlay200HzTone22KssMono (3049 ms)  [ RUN      ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPendingBytes  [       OK ] MacAudioTest.PCMWaveStreamPendingBytes (1626 ms)  [----------] 6 tests from MacAudioTest (956152 ms total)    These tests aren't doing us much good running under valgrind.  By cutting   down the lengths of these tests we can get the Mac valgrind bots cycling   ~10-15 minutes faster.    Huge win!!! </pre>
