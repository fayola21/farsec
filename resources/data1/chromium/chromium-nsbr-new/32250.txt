<title>Issue 32250 -   chromium -    graphical glitch: blinking text insertion pipe (vertical-bar) leaves trail when using arrow keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30      1. Type a long email in gmail.  2. Eventually if you navigate using only using the arrow keys and shift-  arrowkeys  a graphical glitch will happen. Especially if you hold down the   left/right arrow keys so they &quot;repeat&quot;  possibly wrapping around to the   other side of the text box.  (it may or may not be necessary to have misspelled words underlined in red   by spellcheck)    Text that is normally like this:  This is an example.    Appears like this:  Thi|s i|s an ex|a|mp|le.|    The vertical bars | indicate positions where the text-cursor was before    but wasn't &quot;cleaned up&quot; and left a mess on the screen. This makes it   extremely hard to edit text  since one has no idea where the character-  insert cursor is.    Note that it is also possible to have the cursor on top of a &quot;phantom   cursor&quot;  in which case the cursor will blink on top of the phantom cursor   and invert it black-white-black-white. The graphical glitch seems to go   away when moving the cursor in certain directions  maybe highlighting  etc. </pre>
