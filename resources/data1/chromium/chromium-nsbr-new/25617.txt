<title>Issue 25617 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/text/line-breaks.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. build test_shell project  2. webkittoolslayout_testsrun_webkit_tests.bat --debug --full-results-  html LayoutTests/fast/text/line-breaks.html        On Vista  the test passes.  On XP  the test failes because of image difference.  LATIN SMALL LETTER M   WITH ACUTE' (U+1E3F) in the third blue box is rendered in a font different   from other characters.      This might be expected behavior.  If so  we should just rebaseline it.   </pre>
