<title>Issue 26235 -   chromium -    Mac: enable accelerated drawing in plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac NPAPI does not support a &quot;windowed&quot; mode analogous to Windows and Linux (where the   browser gives the plugin its own child window to draw in).  As a result  Mac plugins that want to do   accelerated drawing do so by retrieving a reference to the browser window and creating an   accelerated drawing surface as an overlay.  Unfortunately  Mac OS X does not permit cross-process   window references or overlays using public APIs  so this is a very hard problem to solve.    This is a tracking bug for a solution using IOSurface (10.6+) and/or private SPIs.  A GPU process   and Core Animation drawing model support may make this bug obsolete in the long term  but for   now it's an issue.    Blocks: 25068 (o3d support)   </pre>
