<title>Issue 34967 -   chromium -    Failed to load www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (34537)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/">http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/</a>      Firefox 3.7a2pre: OK    Konqueror 4.2.4: OK    Chromium Nightly Build: OK    1. Goto the URL provided above.  2. Wait.      Chrome should have loaded the page without too much efforts.      No response. Chrome began to eat memory SLOWLY (so Linux kernel didn't kill   it) but finally it got my machine responseless. The process won't die if I   clicked close on the tab or sent SIGTERM to it. Unless I sent SIGKILL it   was terminated.
