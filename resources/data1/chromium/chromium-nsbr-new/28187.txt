<title>Issue 28187 -   chromium -    Many MediaWiki installs broken in dev channel (unfixed WebKit bug) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796) (found on both   Linux and Windows)  URL : <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">http://wikileaks.org/</a> (and many  many others)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Untested  but okay in WebKit nightly build  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: N/A    See this bug and WebKit commit:    <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29792">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29792</a>  <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/48818">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/48818</a>    On <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">http://wikileaks.org/</a> -- and all other MediaWiki installs that use the   default skin  in a pretty wide version range -- the sidebar on the left is   pushed down a lot  due to some old broken MediaWiki browser sniffing that   caused problems when &lt;<a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47255">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/47255</a>&gt; was   committed.  On a WebKit nightly on Windows (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=51075">r51075</a>) from webkit.org  I see   no problem  but on the Chrome dev channel I still see the bug.  I just   received a complaint in #mediawiki from someone reporting they saw the   problem in the beta channel too.  I was told in #chromium that the revision   should already be in Chrome  and that I should file a bug. </pre>
