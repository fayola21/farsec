<title>Issue 31242 -   chromium -    DevTools: Property inspection is broken in the inspector's inspector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an inspector for an inspector for a page that contains elements   with the &quot;src&quot; or &quot;href&quot; attributes.  2. Set a breakpoint in ElementsTreeOutline.js on the first line of the   _nodeTitleInfo method.  3. Open the Elements panel in the debuggee inspector and expand the   elements with the &quot;src&quot; or &quot;href&quot; attributes.  4. Inspect the &quot;node&quot; parameter in the sidebar or with Ctrl-Shift-E.      The &quot;node&quot; parameter type is Object rather than a DOM type  its   node.ownerDocument is also an Object  and has no &quot;URL&quot; property (which is   present when you type &quot;document.URL&quot; in the console view).   </pre>
