<title>Issue 42426 -   chromium -    Zoom makes popup unclosable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.focus.de/digital/handy/aktuelle_modelle/tid-17653/handys-">http://www.focus.de/digital/handy/aktuelle_modelle/tid-17653/handys-</a>  des-monats-htc-legend-aluminium-android_aid_491916.html        Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Go to the webpage  2. Dismiss banner ads if they show up  3. Ensure you are on zoom level 100% (press Ctrl 0)  4. Click on the picture of the Android Phone  5. Admire the animation and notice the button &quot;Ausblenden&quot; at the right lower corner. This is   the button to close the popup. Close it.  6. Now increase the zoom level by pressing Ctrl +.  7. Click the picture again      The Ausblenden Button should still be visible.      The picture hides the &quot;Ausblenden&quot;-Button so it can not be dismissed.    Additional information:  Chrome on Mac has the same issue.    When zooming out  the picture gets extremely small  even when zooming in again afterwards.    This might be a bug in that page but I was under the impression that zooming should be   transparent to web sites and their scripts.      Thanks! Chrome rocks!   </pre>
