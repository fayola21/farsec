<title>Issue 44237 -   chromium -    Chrome window briefly flashes white when exposed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47050) dev  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  Window manager: ion3 (so  no compositing)  Behavior in Linux Firefox: doesn't flash  Behavior in Windows Chrome: doesn't flash      1. Open a page with a black background (e.g. the attached file) in Chrome.  2. Open a mostly-black non-Chrome window (e.g. an xterm  or a Firefox   instance displaying the same black page) on top of Chrome  so that most of   the Chrome window is covered.  3. Get your window manager to raise the Chrome window above the other   window.      The black page is immediately visible.      There's an ugly white flash over part of the Chrome window before the black   page is fully displayed.    I don't see this in Firefox 3.5.9 -- the page is black as soon as its   shown  with no flicker.  Other colors (I tried red and white) work fine in   Firefox too. </pre>
