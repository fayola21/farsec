<title>Issue 40259 -   chromium -    Refactor pref_service to be abstract - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  pref_service is designed to retrieve and save preferences to a text   file.    To be able to pull preferences from centrally-managed sources (group policy   settings  MCX files  remote JS files  etc.)  the pref_service should be abstracted   so that the underlying platform-specific implementation of centrally-managed   settings can live underneath.    It's possible to use a factory paradigm to generate a platform-specific   pref_service  and that platform-specific pref_service implementation would contain   logic about where and how to retrieve centrally-managed settings.    This abstraction must also include a new API to determine whether a preference is   centrally managed (and thus not changeable)  but I will file that separately. </pre>
