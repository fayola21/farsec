<title>Issue 31903 -   chromium -    Google Chrome adds extra &quot;expos��_��_ windows&quot; when showing all windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : OS X 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Launch Google Chrome  2. Load a page or two so that the bottom left &quot;Loading&quot; status text has   appeared (might be optional  not sure)  3. Expos��_��_ to show all windows      Windows should be lined up in a grid  with thumbnails representing each   window      Windows line up in a grid  but there is blank spaces as if they are occupied   by invisible windows. Hovering over a thin bar towards the bottom of the   gaps reveals the on-hover glow around what seems to be a rectangle with   0 height. When you expos��_��_ while Chrome is loading a page  you see that   it's actually the status bar  i.e. &quot;Waiting for www.google.com...&quot; This   explains one of the windows - there is another invisible window sort of   gap  but I'm not sure what's generating that.    In the attached screenshot  one can see that the bottom row of thumbnails   are arranged as if there are three windows. The right-most one is a valid   window  the left-most space is taken by the status bar  and the center one   is blank. This does not occur when Chrome isn't running.   </pre>
