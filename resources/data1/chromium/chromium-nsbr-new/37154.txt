<title>Issue 37154 -   chromium -    Model association needs exclusive access to sync db for a data type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The sync db must not be modified between the time where a data type starts   model association to the point where the model association is complete and   the change processor is started.  In order to prevent the syncer from   applying changes during this time  the data type should keep a   WriteTransaction open throughout this start up process.    This will require some refactoring as we need a way for   ProfileSyncService::ActivateDataType to be called from within the model   associator.   </pre>
