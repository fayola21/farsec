<title>Issue 33328 -   chromium -    [CF] The &quot;Dock to main window&quot; button of developer tool doesn't work in Chrome Frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Load a page with Chrome Frame  2. Inspect any element to launch the developer tool  3. Click on &quot;Dock to main window&quot; button        It should dock to current IE window  or this button should be disabled in  this case.    In fact  it is enabled  but clicking on it does nothing  or just change the  developer tool window from on location to other location.       </pre>
