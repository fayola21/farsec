<title>Issue 26212 -   chromium -    NTP view source is very slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a new tab with NTP on it  - view source from main menu or context menu    expected:  - tab appears quickly with NTP source    actual:  - takes a very very long time to finally get the source.     It's not this slow on linux or windows  so I'm not sure why Mac would be so   slow. cc'ing Mark as maybe his NTP resource loader thread changes might   somehow be getting tickled wrong. </pre>
