<title>Issue 36928 -   chromium -    Crash in WebPluginDelegateImpl::FireIdleEvent at GetNextEvent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5.0.355.0 is showing crashes with this stack:  0x0143b1a3	 [Google Chrome Framework	 - webplugin_delegate_impl_mac.mm:1052]	WebPluginDelegateImpl::FireIdleEvent()  0x0143b7b8	 [Google Chrome Framework	 - webplugin_delegate_impl_mac.mm:146]	(anonymous   namespace)::CarbonIdleEventSource::VisibilityGroup::SendIdleEvents()  ...  (sample: &lt;http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=c297ace8c6955da0&gt;    I had seen this in earlier versions and hoped it was a side effect of <a title="Crash in WebPluginDelegateImpl::FireIdleEvent trying to access instance() after idle event handling" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35856"> bug 35856 </a>  but apparently something else is going on. From the   branch source  that line is:       while (GetNextEvent(everyEvent  &amp;event)) {  but the crashes are all EXC_BAD_ACCESS / KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE @ 0x000000e8  which looks like trying to pull a member   variable out a NULL pointer  so I suspect we are either missing a frame or have skewed line information. </pre>
