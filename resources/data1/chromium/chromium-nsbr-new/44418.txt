<title>Issue 44418 -   chromium -    the &quot;New Tab&quot; page forces a minimum size for the browser window while other web pages do not. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.342.9 (Developer Build   43360)  Is this the most recent version: in my distro yes.  OS + version: Arch Linux 2.6.33.4  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Openbox  URLs (if relevant): &quot;New Tab&quot;  Behavior in Linux Firefox: N/A        1. Open a new browser window.  2. Note the window's min width is set to keep the whole page in view   without scrolling  3. Browse to google.com.  4. Note that you can now resize the window smaller than the webpage's   content.  5. Open a new tab  and the window will be forced to grow again.        The &quot;New Tab&quot; should allow the browser to keep its size  the same way as   other pages do  and just have scrollbars instead.        The Browser is forced to be 829x141 pixels (for my font sizes etc) when   &quot;New Tab&quot; becomes visible.   </pre>
