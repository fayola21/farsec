<title>Issue 33332 -   chromium -    [CF] http://vimeo.com: web pages get loaded for multiple times  in other words it sends multiple request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Make sure 5.0.306.0 (Official Build 37088) is installed  2. Access <a href="http://vimeo.com">http://vimeo.com</a> in IE 8          Page should be loaded by CF  but currently it first gets loaded by IE  then  quickly gets reloaded by CF.    This issue doesn't happen in Dev build 4.0.271.0 (Developer Build 34539)   so it is a regression  it is probably caused by the change on way to detect  meta tag.    This should be a release blocker since all <a href="http://vimeo.com">http://vimeo.com</a> pages have this  problem and vimeo is one of the biggest users of CF.         </pre>
