Click an element with the mouse's right button  2. Inspect element  3. The inspector doesn't seem to have all the page source and can't get to   the right element. Instead  it goes to the body element.    If I refresh the page while the inspector is open  it gets the whole source   and I can inspect an element on the page.    This has been going on for a week or so.     </pre>
