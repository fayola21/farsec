<title>Issue 30319 -   chromium -    Sub menus messed up. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33    URLs (if applicable) : www.DynamicWebApplication.com        Firefox 3.x: Ok    IE 7: Ok          1. Open www.DynamicWebApplication.com  2. Point to menu that has submenu (it doesn��_��_��_t work)  3. Click on the menu and you get submenu messed up- the more the length  then the more the mess up. You cannot tell which is which and just you see  a paragraph where it is difficult to choose one ��_��_��_ example you can try it  with IT corner.          The expected result should have it should work with pointing. If that is  not possible then the sub menus should be messed up to the level difficult  to select.            Pointing did not work and clicking mess up the sub menus and made it  difficult to select specific submenu.     </pre>
