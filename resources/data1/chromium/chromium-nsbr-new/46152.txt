<title>Issue 46152 -   chromium -    Need more Chromium Mac UI Valgrind slaves - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like Chromium/Mac UI Valgrind bots are taking almost 3 hrs in  average: <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/stats">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/stats</a>  which is twice more than other bots.    Is it possible to double their number?  Also  using a higher-end machines can help. </pre>
