<title>Issue 45681 -   chromium -    Delay initialization of history and safe browsing backend - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The tracing data of multi tab session restore shows disk contention during   browser start up. The disk access mostly comes from following parts:    1. UI thread / IO thread: page in the code of chrome.dll and its   dependencies.  2. UI thread: read &quot;Visited Links&quot;.  3. IO thread: access disk cache.  4. IO thread: load gears and permission.db.  5. History thread: read history data base.  6. Safe browsing: read bloom filter.    Currently we start history back end asynchronously during history service   init. We can have a notification when the browser main windows is ready and    start history back end after it. That way we can make sure history disk   access does not content with UI and IO thread.    We could do the same for safe browsing as well. </pre>
