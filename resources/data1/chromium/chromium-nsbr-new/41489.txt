<title>Issue 41489 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Copy URL from Omnibox and pasting into rich text does not include protocol string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Goto to any website like www.example.com  2. Select the entire URL from the Omnibox and then Copy (eg. Ctrl+C  right-click context menu  etc.)  3. Goto another application and Paste         If you paste rich text  you'll essentially be pasting the following:     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&gt;www.example.com&lt;/a&gt;  The text will be as it appeared in the Omnibox but the href will include the http.    If you paste plain text you'll get:     <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>    When pasting rich text  the text also needs to include the http part.    This happens at least for Windows Dev 5.0.375.3    Is this similar/same as <a title="Copy url to X copy buffer does not include protocol string" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41173"> Issue 41173 </a> which is for Linux only? </pre>
