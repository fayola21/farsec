<title>Issue 41643 -   chromium -    open a new tab when I using local file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 5.0.375.7 dev windows XP sp3&gt;                     IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK        when I using a local frame web  for example  many docs include a index.html file.   I click a link on the left  it always open a new tab not display in the right��__��_but If I use a http server   to contain these files and then open a url path  it performanced well.      by the way  the former version (e.g. 5.0.307.1) doesn't have this problem.     </pre>
