<title>Issue 34181 -   chromium -    Exceptions polish bugs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a couple of things we could do to the exceptions related dialogs to   make it more polished:    . Show an icon to the right indicating if the host is valid or not (similar   to the edit search engine dialog). As part of this we would want text along   the bottom indicating why the current value is invalid (empty  invalid host   name  there is already an exception with the specified host).  . When adding a new exception the host textfield should have so example text   grayed out.  . If there are no exceptions the table should indicate this some how (similar   to the bookmark manager). </pre>
