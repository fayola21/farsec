<title>Issue 41262 -   chromium -    ClientSocketPoolBase doesn't count stalled groups correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FindTopStalledGroup() only checks to see if a group has pending requests and   an available socket slot.  It does not check to see if the number of connect   jobs suffices for the number of pending requests.  In other words  the   current code thinks that if a group has 1 pending request and 1 ConnectJob    then the group is stalled.    This is causing is to start up more ConnectJobs than necessary. </pre>
