<title>Issue 29152 -   chromium -    Error message &quot;`CGAccessSessionSkipBytes' is obsolete&quot; in the Xcode Debugger Console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I debug Chromium on the Mac  I see the following error message  in the Xcode Debugger Console:    Tue Dec  1 17:58:51 &lt;hostname of my computer&gt; Chromium Helper[34404]   &lt;Error&gt;: The function `CGAccessSessionSkipBytes' is obsolete and will be   removed in an upcoming update. Unfortunately  this application  or a library   it uses  is using this obsolete function  and is thereby contributing to an   overall degradation of system performance. Please use   `CGAccessSessionSkipForward' instead.    I searched for &quot;CGAccessSessionSkipForward&quot; in our source tree but didn't  find it.  So we may not be able to do anything about this. </pre>
