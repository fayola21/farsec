<title>Issue 44422 -   chromium -    option-click does not respect &quot;Ask where to save each file before downloading&quot; preference - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.5.8      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ?      1. Select &quot;Preferences...&quot; from the Chrome menu  2. Make sure &quot;Ask where to save each file before downloading&quot; checkbox is   unchecked under &quot;Under the Hood&quot;  3. Option click on any link        Destination of link is saved to download folder.        After a pause  a &quot;Save As&quot; dialog box appears asking me where to save the   file.    Beyond the 'WTF' of not respecting the preference  I believe directly   downloading is much more useful and in keeping with the 'effortless instead   of having to go through lots of hoops' philosophy of Chrome.  Think about   how much it would suck if  when you command-click to open a tab  you had to   wait and then hit enter before clicking on the next link. It is so useful   being able to open 5 links in tabs easily (just by holding down command)   and I'd love to be able to do the same with the option key.    There are many situations where I want to save files instead of viewing   them. Usually when this happens  I want to save several of the links from   the page. If I was going to rename the file before saving it  the   additional click of using the context menu would be a small percentage   extra burden. But since I hardly ever want to rename files (just download   them to the download folder)  this means instead of holding down option and   click-click-click  I have to click  wait for dialog  enter  click  wait    enter  click  wait  enter.    If there was no filename  I'd be happy with a default filename or a dialog   -- I don't really care which since it in practice would be so rare as to be   irrelevant. </pre>
