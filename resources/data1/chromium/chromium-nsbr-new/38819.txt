<title>Issue 38819 -   chromium -    Clicking on links when search is active - jumps to top of the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2        1. Go to the 'history' page  2. Press Ctrl+F  and search for something that will move the scrollbar...  3. Click on any link      Well... Clicking the link!      The scrollbar immediately jumps to top of the page  and clicks another   unwanted link...    I'm not sure if this happens in any other page  but it sure happens in the   history page for quite some versions now  and its PRETTY anoyying...   </pre>
