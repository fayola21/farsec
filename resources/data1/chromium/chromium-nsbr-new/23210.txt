<title>Issue 23210 -   chromium -    Cannot open bookmark manager (Mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.1    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): option-cmd-B opens bookmark manager (Show   All Bookmarks)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): shift-cmd-B opens bookmark manager (Organize   Bookmarks...)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: shift-ctrl-B opens bookmark manager      1. shift-cmd-B toggles &quot;Always show bookmarks bar&quot; (shouldn't cmd-B do this?)  2. cmd-B apparently does nothing  3. Right-click a bookmark on the bookmark bar &amp; select &quot;Bookmark Manager&quot; from   context menu. Nothing happens.      Bookmark manager should open.      Nothing. </pre>
