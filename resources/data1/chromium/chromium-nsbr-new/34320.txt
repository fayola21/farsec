<title>Issue 34320 -   chromium -    Icon resolution too low (fuzzy) for Ubuntu Netbook Remix/Edition menu launcher - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're using /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/google-  chrome.png.  This is a 48x48 image.    The Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10/Karmic Koala launcher uses 64x64 icons.    Same deal in Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.04/Lucid Lynx (prerelease).    Scaling the 48x48 icon up to 64x64 looks a little fuzzy.    Compare this to Firefox' icon  which comes from   /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox-3.5.png  which is 128x128  and looks fine   when scaled down to 64x64.    We already ship /opt/google/chrome/product_logo_256.png at 256x256.    Perhaps we should use that.  If there's nothing else using   /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/google-chrome.png  we   should remove it  as it's just a copy of   /opt/google/chrome/product_logo_48.png.    This is similar to <a title="low resolution favicon in alt-tab"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6807">bug 6807</a> (and was mentioned in <a title="low resolution favicon in alt-tab"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6807">bug 6807</a> comment 4). </pre>
