<title>Issue 46004 -   chromium -    Reusable layout heuristic for fast click-close actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Views should provide a built-in mechanism that makes it easy to replicate the   TabStrip's behavior of not re-laying out until some condition is met (in that   case moving the mouse away from the TabStrip zone).    It should not be View specific - the other use case I am thinking of is for   the top level widgets used by the Notification balloons. </pre>
