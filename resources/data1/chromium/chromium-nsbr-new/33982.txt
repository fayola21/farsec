<title>Issue 33982 -   chromium -    cannot select items from dropdown menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev    OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Attempting to select an item from a dropdown menu (box with the   double-arrows at the end of it)      The item you select should be displayed in the box.      The first item in the dropdown list is displayed in the box instead  as it   was before you clicked on the box to select your item. My workaround has   been to make sure the dropdown &quot;box&quot; is selected (light blue outline)  then   I can navigate the contents of the dropdown list via the keyboard  i.e.  by   typing until my selection displays. Then I can tab the focus away from the   dropdown box and my selection sticks. </pre>
