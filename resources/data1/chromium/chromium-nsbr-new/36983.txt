<title>Issue 36983 -   chromium -    Go button is still &quot;X&quot; when cursor is overhead  even though page is fully loaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta      1. Keep your mouse cursor over the &quot;|&gt;&quot; arrow a.k.a go button next to the   URL  2. Type a website and press &quot;return&quot; or click the go button  3. Once the website has finished loading  the &quot;X&quot; button will not revert to   the go button until your cursor has moved off the button      The X sign should change to the arrow      The X is still there    --------------------------------    It's not a major issue  but I sometimes refresh a page using the go button    and without moving the mouse it doesn't work. Otherwise  I could just click   the usual refresh button. </pre>
