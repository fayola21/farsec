<title>Issue 31589 -   chromium -    tabs.create can't simulate the normal behavior - new tab positioning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43      1. Call chrome.tabs.create in your extension's background page.      A new tab is normally created by an existing tab (when opening a link in a new tab). Chrome   positions the new tabs wisely: starting with tabs A  B  C and then middle clicking two links   from tab B we'll get tabs A  B  b1  b2  C.    There is no way of simulating this with chrome.tabs.create        Using the &quot;index&quot; parameter will not help. If I set it to the position of tab B + 1 I'll get  A  B  b2  b1  C. If I don't use the &quot;index&quot; parameter I get A  B  C  b1  b2.      An additional parameter &quot;parentTab&quot; to chrome.tabs.create would maybe solve the problem. </pre>
