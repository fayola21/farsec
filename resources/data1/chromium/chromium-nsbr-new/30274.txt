<title>Issue 30274 -   chromium -    Regression: Occasional truncated page content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have reproduced this on both Mac and Windows  but I don't have consistent   steps.    Occasionally a page will be truncated.  This has happened to me with   standalone images  where the image itself is only partly displayed  and   with whole pages.  For example  just now while using this bug tracker I   went back several pages and then forward  and when I reached the most   recent session history entry  the bug was cut off after a few paragraphs of   text.    Refreshing fixes this problem.  This started to occur recently; I hadn't   seen it before maybe a week ago.  My Windows Chrome is 4.0.266.0.    I'm hoping one of you can think of some recent change that could   conceivably cause this. </pre>
