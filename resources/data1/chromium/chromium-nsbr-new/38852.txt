<title>Issue 38852 -   chromium -    Download bar is annoying  settings should allow hiding it for good - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click to download a file  2. A blue download bar intrudes at the bottom of the screen  eating useful   pixels  3. Download bar doesn't ever go away without explicit user intervention      I expect that no download bar shows up  unless the user is able to   enable/disable it from the browser settings. When using any other browser   I'm actually _not annoyed_ that I don't have some bar pop up whenever I   download something and then decrease the size of my usable screen forever   after.      The browser behavior  surfacing this download bar at the bottom  is as   annoying as the pop-up ads users had to put up with (and click to close   them)  before Google came up with the concept of user-friendly search text   ads.    <b>Please provide
