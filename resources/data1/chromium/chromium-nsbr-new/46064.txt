<title>Issue 46064 -   chromium -    DNS lookup fails sometimes on google.com/search  google.com/accounts  probably other sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)  URLs (if applicable) : google.com/search  google.com/accounts          Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      Enter search from address bar  i.e. type &quot;hello world&quot; and press Enter.      Google search results.      It writes &quot;Resolving host&quot; and then  <a href="http://www.google.ru/search?rlz=1C1SVEC_enCY373CY373&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hello+world">http://www.google.ru/search?rlz=1C1SVEC_enCY373CY373&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hello+world</a> might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.    Chrome showing 404 error page sometimes for google searches or for google accounts center  maybe for other sites as well.  Bug is unstable.  It looks like some timeout should pass before showing the error again.  Sometimes 5 minutes is enough.  But is more visible when you turned off DNS prefetching.    Refresh works.    It seems sometimes DNS request is lost. But google never tries to repeat resolving host  and sometimes forget about domains in DNS Prefetch table.     Second host resolve request should help as page refresh fixes the issue  and is usually quite fast.    I suggest the following &quot;multiple asynchronous DNS&quot; scheme:  first DNS request immediately  then  second DNS request after 2 seconds   (and continue to wait for the first one)  third DNS request after 5 seconds   fourth after 12 seconds.    General timeout set to 20 seconds.    I tried switching to Google's DNS 8.8.8.8  error persists.    Have this bug both in Chrome Stable and Beta channel.    It seems the problem is known and widespread:  <a href="http://www.tinyportal.net/index.php?topic=32198.0">http://www.tinyportal.net/index.php?topic=32198.0</a>    Please note:  &quot;I have tried to disable DNS pre-fetch too  which is commonly suggested  but that doesn't work.  I also tried emptying the browsing history - cache  downloads etc  but that didn't work.&quot; -- I tried to do this too  it doesn't help.
