<title>Issue 28942 -   chromium -    Feature request: tab icon for &quot;sound playing&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11 (Linux)      1. Enjoy that sound and media mostly work on Linux Chrome  2. Open lots of tabs  3. Regret that sound works on Linux as you can't figure out which advert   plays the sound    What is the desired result?    If Chrome can tell that sound is coming from a particular tab  it would be   really good to have an icon appear on the left of the tab handle  analogous   to the 'x' for close-tab  showing a speaker or sound-waves.  Even better if   you can click on the speaker to mute that tab.    This is part of making the browser work for the user  instead of against   the user.    I don't know enough to know how practical this is  with Chrome's   architecture  once plugins come into play.  But anything that can be done   would make this better.   </pre>
