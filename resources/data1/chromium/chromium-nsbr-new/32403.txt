<title>Issue 32403 -   chromium -    Locales don't seem to work properly under Linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Linux: 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) unstable (64   bit dev channel)           Chrome Version  : Windows Seven: 4.0.249.64 OK (beta channel)      1. Create a extension using locales.  2. Load the extension  3. Open the popup      It should retrieve a text translated in the locale defined in   manifest.json. I am using the chrome.i18n.getMessage method to do so.      It does work fine under Windows Seven (for full version see above) but it   does not work under the Linux version yet it's version is newer.   The locale does seem to work when viewing chrome://extensions/ where you   can view the description of the extension.   </pre>
