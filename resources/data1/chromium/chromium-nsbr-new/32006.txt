<title>Issue 32006 -   chromium -    Create way to set icon on chromiumos panel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a way for developers to set the icon on a panel title to indicate   status. This could be done by encoding it within the document title (hack) or   through a new chrome JS api. The later is preferred. </pre>
