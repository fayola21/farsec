<title>Issue 45233 -   chromium -    Scripts list is empty for the second tab with the same URL running in the same renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to a web page with linked script resources  2. Navigate to the same site in another tab and make sure they are rendered   by the same process (see about:memory).  3. Open devtools for the second tab    What is the expected output?  Secondary scripts are listed in the scripts panel.    What do you see instead?  Only main resource scripts are present.    This is a minor issue due to compilation cache being enabled in v8. Scripts   for the second tab are retrieved from the cache and hence have context ids   of the first page. That is the reason why they are filtered by the   inspector. </pre>
