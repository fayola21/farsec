<title>Issue 33420 -   chromium -    Implement GPU tag in test_expectations.txt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order to run layout tests that require GPU acceleration  we have to make   sure that the build bot supports them. Currently  our Win and Linux bots   don't.    We will have to set up a bit of infrastructure with the build slaves that   have a decent GPU.    In order to distinguish tests that require GPU acceleration  we should   implement a &quot;GPU&quot; tag  which is orthogonal to platform and to build type.   For instance:    <a title="a bug with my e-mail box hotmail" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34353"> BUG34353 </a> GPU : fast/canvas/webgl/fancy-test.html = PASS    The net effect of this tag is:    1) On GPU-delinquent machines  the test is skipped and not counted as   failure or pass.  2) On machines of able power  the test is run as usual.    For now  the GPU can be hard-coded to &quot;true&quot; for Mac bots  and &quot;false&quot;   otherwise. </pre>
