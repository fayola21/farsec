<title>Issue 40040 -   chromium -    DND tests in BookmarkBarViewTest are disabled for chromeos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DND tests are failing on chromeos.  There seems to be a couple of issues that are causing failure.    * Drag&amp;Drop operations are asynchronous.  * WidgetGtk calls MessageLoop::Run internally when handling drag &amp; drop   which make it difficult to sync up events from tests.  * The position to drop seems to be off on linux (but not 100% confirmed)     </pre>
