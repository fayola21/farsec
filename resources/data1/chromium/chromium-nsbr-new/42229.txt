<title>Issue 42229 -   chromium -    spdy sessions can double-remove from the session pool - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When GOAWAY frames are encountered  we remove from the session pool.  We also   remove from the session pool when we destruct the session.    This is bad  as the second removal could accidentally remove the wrong   session from the pool (if a new session had been opened).   </pre>
