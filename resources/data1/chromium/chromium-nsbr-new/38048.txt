<title>Issue 38048 -   chromium -    Make DidProcessCrash a bit more solid and accurate on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> bool DidProcessCrash(bool* child_exited  ProcessHandle handle) {    ...    if (exitcode == STILL_ACTIVE) {      // The process is likely not dead or it used 0x103 as exit code.      NOTREACHED();      return false;    }    ...  }    I just hit this NOTREACHED when debugging  and based on community advice on   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683189(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683189(VS.85).aspx</a> it should be possible to make   this check more accurate:    If this function places STILL_ACTIVE into lpExitCode  it can be ambiguous whether the process is   still running or terminated with exit code 259  as per the warning above. If you don't know by   other means whether the process has terminated  if STILL_ACTIVE is the exit code  call   WaitForSingleObject(hProcess  0). WaitForSingleObject will return immediately (because the   timeout is zero) WAIT_OBJECT_0 if the process has terminated and WAIT_TIMEOUT if it has not.   Process objects are &quot;signaled&quot; when the process has terminated. </pre>
