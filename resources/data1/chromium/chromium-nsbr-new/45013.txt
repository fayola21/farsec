<title>Issue 45013 -   chromium -    Sequences of IPA tone letters are rendered separately instead of being combined to represent a tone - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> How to reproduce:    1.Visit site   <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213%E9%9D%9E%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E4%B8%80">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213%E9%9D%9E%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E4%B8%80</a>  %E8%A6%A7  2.Search &quot;1-11-69&quot; and move inside this page.    What is the expected output?    The browser should display one composite character as defined in Japanese  Standard. ( for example JISX02130120100507n.png )    What do you see instead?    The browser seemed to display two separated characters  instead one  composite character.    Ref. Unicode 5.2 section 7.8 Modifier letters (p.224: Tone letters Figure   7-7) <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch07.pdf">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch07.pdf</a> (p. 27 in the   PDF).     Perhaps  these characters are not subject to complex script code path   although they have to. I'll try Safari on Mac/Windows.             </pre>
