<title>Issue 30340 -   chromium -    'Oh  fetch' doesn't translate well to Swedish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Swedish (sv_SE)      4.0.266.0      Windows XP      Page failure screen. &quot;Oh  fetch!&quot; i presume it says in English.  The Swedish translation (��_��_h  h��__mta!) has the meaning &quot;Oh  get&quot;  which   doesn't really make sense.   </pre>
