<title>Issue 33761 -   chromium -    incompatibility Problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: &lt;from cf:about:version&gt; 4.0.249       www.dox.bg (alot of  problems appear randomly in this website.)        You can see example video here: (compared whit IE and Firefox 3.5)    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_yspgX-BY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_yspgX-BY</a>      Sometimes you can not select which file to download because i can't click   on them.The other problem is that you can download only 1 file whit google   chrome  when you click on a second file after the first one is downloaded -   nothing happens.And it load directories very slow or not loading them at   all- you need to logout and login again.My guess is that flash isn't   working very well whit Chrome.   (inet speed : low speed wireless connection 56k)       1.Download 1 file  2.Try to download second one  3.Try to load diffrent directory      Download the second one    nothing:    I will remove the video from youtube as soon as you view it.I love google   chrome and all of the google software.Greetings from Bulgaria. </pre>
