<title>Issue 30494 -   chromium -    LNK1106 errors on windows official builders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This seems to be a somewhat frequent problem  linking webcore.lib with   whole program optimization on the windows official builders.    The error message is:    122&gt;C:bslavechrome-official-2buildsrcchromeReleaselibwebcore.lib :   fatal error LNK1106: invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0x644CF818    and it has occurred at least on the two most recent dev channel builds   (4.0.270.0  4.0.271.0). For the 271 build  which started on 12/15 at 3am    the host (cr-official5.mtv) had been rebooted at 2:30am in order to start   with a known environment as much as possible.    failed  4.0.270.0  started 12/14 @ 11:45a  http://chrome-  master.mtv.corp.google.com:8010/builders/chrome%20official%202/builds/615/s  teps/compile/logs/stdio    failed  4.0.271.0  started 12/15 @ 3a  http://chrome-  master.mtv.corp.google.com:8010/builders/chrome%20official%202/builds/619/s  teps/compile/logs/stdio    A similar bug was logged (and marked fixed) in   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23957">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23957</a>    It is very interesting that on the same build host cr-official5  the   4.0.249.42 build - built 12/14 at 7p - compiled successfully  and leads me   to believe there is a specific issue with the code as the builder was able   to complete successfully for a beta build (and failed on the two dev   channel builds). Unfortunately I do not know exactly when this failure   started happening as we have been dealing with multiple failures on the   windows official builders.    success  4.0.249.42  started 12/14 @ 7p  http://chrome-  master.mtv.corp.google.com:8010/builders/chrome%20official%202/builds/618     </pre>
