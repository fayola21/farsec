<title>Issue 36380 -   chromium -    Safe Browsing files disk usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071) on Windows Vista Home Basic SP2    Other browsers tested: N/A    I think that my Chrome profile folder takes too much disk space. After   closer inspection one of the largest files was &quot;Safe Browsing&quot; in   &quot;AppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser Data&quot; (about 80 MB). I've been using   Chrome for about a year.    I checked a more recent installation on my friend's computer (Windows XP   SP3) and the &quot;Safe Browsing&quot; file was not present (of course &quot;Safe Browsing   Bloom&quot; files were there).    Attached is a screenshot of my &quot;User Data&quot; folder. Please let me know if   you need more details. </pre>
