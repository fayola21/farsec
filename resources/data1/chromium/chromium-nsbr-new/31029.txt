Load the attached file in Chrome.  2. View source or load developer tools.      The self-closing tag &quot;&lt;script /&gt;&quot; should be recognized as closed or   expanded to &quot;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;.      &quot;&lt;script /&gt;&quot; is replaced by &quot;&lt;script /&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;  which produced a warning   and an error.    Warning:  XML self-closing tag syntax used on &lt;script&gt;.  The tag will be closed by   WebKit  but not all browsers do this.  Change to &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; instead   for best cross-browser compatibility.    Error:  Unmatched &lt;/script&gt; encountered.  Ignoring tag.    Please note this also happens if the script tag has any attributes. </pre>
