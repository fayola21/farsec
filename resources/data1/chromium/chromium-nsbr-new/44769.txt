<title>Issue 44769 -   chromium -    Automatic import of opensearch searchengines should be configurable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (Developer Build 46659) Debian      1. If I surf to a random website providing an opensearch document  chrome   adds that surf engine to it's collection right away.  2. Neither does it ask me  nor even notify me of this event.  3. I do not like it when websites can store persistent data on my PC   without my knowledge. (This may even be a security issue)      Automatically adding opensearch websites should be configurable. Also  a   &quot;search engine xy has been added&quot; notification would be nice.      Chrome just adds the search engine.   </pre>
