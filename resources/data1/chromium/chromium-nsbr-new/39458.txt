<title>Issue 39458 -   chromium -    scroll bar thumb is too faint on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta        1. Open up a page that is large enough to display a scroll bar.  2. The scroll bar thumb (aka handle) is almost the same color as the rest   of the scroll bar  so it is hard to grab it.      The scroll bar thumb should contrast with the scroll bar  and it should   also follow the UI theme in Gnome.
