<title>Issue 35805 -   chromium -    Each tab takes up 40MB of memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 4.0.249.43  Is this the most recent version: yes?  OS + version: Suse 11.2  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: Compiz  Behavior in Linux Firefox: worse      1. memory manager reports that almost all tabs use 40-50megabytes of   memory. this can be very bad with 40 tabs open    This might be due to the fact that I have set this computer not to page to   disk  but rather into memory. Nevertheless I would hope some form of   compression could be used  e.g. if Chrome is using some sort of canvas    then perhaps the canvas could be compressed based on the frequency of DOM   redraws  or it could be transparently compressed in memory (e.g. grouping   every 16x16 pixels  compressing  then hashing identical blocks). </pre>
