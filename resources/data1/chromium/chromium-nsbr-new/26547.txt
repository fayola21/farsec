<title>Issue 26547 -   chromium -    UMR in WebCore::AccessibilityRenderObject::children(); m_childrenDirty uninitialized in constructor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> LayoutTests/accessibility/aria-hidden.html  (and lots of other tests in that directory)  show the following valgrind warning:    Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)     at WebCore::AccessibilityRenderObject::children()  (AccessibilityRenderObject.cpp:2549)     by AccessibilityUIElement::GetChildAtIndex(unsigned int)  (accessibility_ui_element.cc:285)     ...   Uninitialised value was created by a heap allocation     at malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:195)     by WTF::fastMalloc(unsigned long) (FastMalloc.cpp:233)     by WTF::FastAllocBase::operator new(unsigned long) (FastAllocBase.h:96)     by WebCore::AccessibilityRenderObject::create(WebCore::RenderObject*)  (AccessibilityRenderObject.cpp:101)     ...    Looks like somebody forgot to initialize m_childrenDirty to false  in the constructor.  The following patch seems to make the  problem go away:    --- accessibility/AccessibilityRenderObject.cpp (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=50258">revision 50258</a>)  +++ accessibility/AccessibilityRenderObject.cpp (working copy)  @@ -84 6 +84 7 @@       : AccessibilityObject()         m_renderer(renderer)         m_ariaRole(UnknownRole)  +      m_childrenDirty(false)   {       updateAccessibilityRole();   #ifndef NDEBUG      Can a friendly Webkit committer check that and push it upstream  please? </pre>
