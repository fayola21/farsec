<title>Issue 33072 -   chromium -    Setting default serif font size overrides default sans-serif font size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Fonts and Encoding pref UI appears to let you set different sizes for   serif and sans-serif fonts  but in fact changing the size of one changes the   size of the other.    Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 dev      1. Open preferences  2. Select &quot;Under The Hood&quot;  3. Scroll down to Web Content  4. Press &quot;Font and Language Settings&quot;  5. Press the &quot;Change...&quot; button next to &quot;Serif font:&quot;  6. In the font panel  hoose a font size that's different from the current   value and also different from the current sans-serif font size (e.g. 18).  7. Note that in the sheet  the serif font size is now different than the sans-  serif size.  8. Press OK to close the sheet.  9. Press &quot;Font and Language Settings&quot; in the prefs window again.        The serif font size is the same as I set  and the sans-serif font size is   unchanged.      The sans-serif font size has changed to be equal to the serif font size (and   this shows up in web content  so it's the real setting.) </pre>
