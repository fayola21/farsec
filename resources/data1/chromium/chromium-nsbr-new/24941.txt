<title>Issue 24941 -   chromium -    Trackpad scroll events fall through to window behind Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Normal  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Normal  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested      1. Open a window in another application that will scroll vertically using the   two-finger gesture on the trackpad.  2. Place the Chrome window  also open to a page that will scroll vertically    in front of the other application window (keeping some of the window   visible so you can see if it scrolls)  3. With the mouse cursor over Chrome (within the bounds of the window   behind it)  scroll the Chrome window using the two-finger trackpad   gesture.      The Chrome window should scroll while the window behind it should not.      The Chrome window scrolls  with the window behind it scrolling much   more slowly (some small percentage of scroll events appear to &quot;fall   through&quot;). </pre>
