<title>Issue 35317 -   chromium -    Figure out why gtk_rc_get_style_by_paths doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Doing a gtk_rc_get_style_by_paths(...  &quot;class&quot;  G_TYPE_NONE) doesn't seem to   work like a synonym of gtk_rc_get_style(widget_of_class)  forcing us to   define the MetaFrames class.    I have no clue why this doesn't work. Figure out what's going wrong in the   chrome code or the gtk code. </pre>
