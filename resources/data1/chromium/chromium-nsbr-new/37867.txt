<title>Issue 37867 -   chromium -    Chromium Looks horrible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have my resolution set to 1600x1200 and the web page looks like it is being   interpolated up from some lower resolution.  I opened that same web page with   fire fox and made sure they were set at the same &quot;zoom&quot; and chromium looks wrenched.    Also why is so much space waisted at the top of the browser?  Also the   &quot;options&quot; are a bit difficult to navigate as there are VERY FEW!     </pre>
