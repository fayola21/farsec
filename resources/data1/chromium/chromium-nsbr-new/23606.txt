<title>Issue 23606 -   chromium -    Mac: right-click on back/forward and bookmarks-bar off-the-side buttons causes bad menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate a bit.  2. Right click on a back or forward button.      Nothing is expected  or maybe a sensible context menu. We get a messed up  menu instead  once even a crash.    I'm not sure if this is recent. I think it is  but I'm not sure. I'll look  into this. </pre>
