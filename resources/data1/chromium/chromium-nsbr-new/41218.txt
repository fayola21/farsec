<title>Issue 41218 -   chromium -    text drag from omnibox to bookmark bar loses scheme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> go to www.cnn.com  Note no longer http:// in omnibox  Now select text and drag to bookmark bar  Shows up as file://www.cnn.com    At drop time bookmark bar says &quot;no protocol assume file://&quot;.  Better would be for omnibox to add prefix back since we can't always guess what it should have   been. </pre>
