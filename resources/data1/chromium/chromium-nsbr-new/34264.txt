<title>Issue 34264 -   chromium -    Downloading chrome from official website with modified user-agent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Current  URL                  : <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">http://www.google.com/chrome/</a>          1. Change your User-Agent  2. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">http://www.google.com/chrome/</a>  3. And now I can only download Chrome for my OS    Some details:  When I'm using my ISP squid proxy my user-agent is &quot;Linux&quot;  so whenever I'm  using firefox/IE/Safari/Opera I'm visible as Linux user. Of course I can  download windows version of chrome from some other website  but it would be  great to download it from the official website. And with my &quot;Linux&quot; proxy I  can download only chrome for Linux  not for windows or not for any other  platform.   </pre>
