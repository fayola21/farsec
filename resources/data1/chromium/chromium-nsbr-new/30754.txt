<title>Issue 30754 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Public Usage and Resource Data for Extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think if an extension is going to use a lot of ram (or any system   resources) it should be up to the user to decide if they want to install   it. This would mean users knowing the average ram usage before installing   an extension.    How about allowing users to opt in to send usage data (like done with   errors) and find the average memory usage of each extension. (Making sure   it is opt in so that it does not annoy people wanting privacy). This   anonymised average could then be displayed on chrome.google.com/extensions   under a &quot;Advanced&quot; collapsible section for each extension.    This would also work for the following (if available in the browser):  - CPU usage  - How often each extension crashes  - Disk I/O  - Network / Internet usage (or how much bandwidth is saved in some cases)  - Affect on rendering speed  Etc    It could even be displayed using stars so that more people can understand   it.    Issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29919">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29919</a> raises an   example of an extension using a lot of memory. Although seems to have been   fixed  it can show how an extension with a good intent can cause problems. </pre>
