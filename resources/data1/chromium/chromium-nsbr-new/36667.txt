<title>Issue 36667 -   chromium -    file:// URLs are case-insensitive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 beta    OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Type (eg) file:///users/tom/Music/ into the omnibar (should be   /Users/tom/Music by default)  2. Hit enter  3. Try to type file:///Users/tom/Music/      For the omnibar to allow you to correct your capitalization mistake.      The omnibar will auto-complete to the incorrect address and refuses to let   the user change it. </pre>
