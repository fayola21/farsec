<title>Issue 38475 -   chromium -    IsDefaultSearchProvider and SetDefaultSearchProvider methods - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've noticed that users seem to have search engines set that they do not   actually prefer. It seems that the best signal we have that the default   search engine is not set to the preferred engine is that the user navigates   to another search engine. By exposing JS methods to the page  the page can   ask the user to make it the default.    IsDefaultSearchProvider   This method should be restricted to asking whether the current site is the   default for the sake of user privacy. In other words  it should pass the   same-origin check and return undefined if it does not.    SetDefaultSearchProvider  Again  this should be restricted to the current site. It should also   require a user gesture and show a confirmation prompt before resetting the   default. The biggest risk here is that this is spammed by random sites. If   this is an issue  one possible solution is to add a whitelist of all the   top search engines.   </pre>
