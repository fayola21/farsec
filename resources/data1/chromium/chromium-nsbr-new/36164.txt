<title>Issue 36164 -   chromium -    Crash during shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This happens on the 249 branch and appears to be because we haven't merged   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33109">r33109</a> into 249. The HostContentSettingsMap is using keys like 'foo.bar'    which without patch 33109 are treated as the path 'foo'  'bar' instead of   'foo.bar'. I attempted the merge but realized there are some patches required   in addition to 33109. I'm passing to Peter who did the patch in 33109 as he   should know what other patches need to be added to the mix. </pre>
