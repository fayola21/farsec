<title>Issue 33208 -   chromium -    browser window refuses to stay maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : newly installed today    Every browser window I open since DL today  refuses to stay maximized.    It's the same with Windows IE6    Except in Explorer  the quick fix is:  Close all BUT ONE window; right click taskbar &amp; select tile-horizontally    etc. etc.    Is the quick-fix the same in Chrome?   </pre>
