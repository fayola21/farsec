<title>Issue 44148 -   chromium -    URLs copied from the Omnibox paste with formatting instead of plain text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev                       IE 8:OK      1. Copy URL from Omnibox.  2. Paste into the body of an email reply in Outlook 2007.  3. With the cursor sitting at the end of the URL  type characters.      After typing characters the font style should remain as it was prior to   pasting the URL.  E.g. if you reply to an email in Outlook 2007 the default   behavior is for the text you enter to be blue.      When you paste a URL from Chrome and start entering more text the font   changes color to black. If you do the same thing with IE the email retains   the &quot;reply to&quot; font color of blue.  This happens in Word 2007 as well.   WordPad in Windows 7 is fine.   </pre>
