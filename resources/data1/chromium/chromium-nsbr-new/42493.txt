<title>Issue 42493 -   chromium -    Provide an option to always open a bookmark in incognito mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 (Official Build 45275) dev    It's a little feature request for the bookmark manager.    It would be nice to have a way to always open a bookmark (or more generally a url pattern) directly   in incognito mode.    I'm not sure if this is feasible with an extension.     </pre>
