<title>Issue 31983 -   chromium -    Retry failed proxies before giving up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium caches proxies which have failed in a &quot;bad proxy&quot; map for 5   minutes.    Now that we no longer fallback to DIRECT connections  this is a problem    since if you configured to use a single proxy server  and that server had a   temporary failure  it means you now need to wait 5 minutes before the proxy   will be even retried again  and in the meantime you will get   ERR_EMPTY_PROXY_LIST.    Chrome should always try all of the proxies it knows about before giving up    regardless of whether they are marked as bad. </pre>
