<title>Issue 44781 -   chromium -    Rounding errors in new tab-sizing code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are some subtle rounding problems in the new tab drawing code.    When there are a large number of tabs in the tabstrip  and the user closes   one  we leave all the tabs the same size until the user mouses out.  But   this has to be done very carefully.  In particular  we can't position the   tabs by giving each one (new total tab width / new number of tabs)  because   this will sometimes be slightly different than (old total tab width / old   number of tabs) due to rounding.    The old code went to some length to preserve the precise floating-point   width of the tabs for the entire time until the user moused out.  The new   code doesn't seem to  and as a result  occasionally when you're closing a   series of tabs  some of the existing tabs will shift by a pixel.  This   makes things feel kind of flaky.    Attached is a screenshot marking how the border between two tabs shifted by   a pixel when closing a tab. </pre>
