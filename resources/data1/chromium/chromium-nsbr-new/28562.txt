<title>Issue 28562 -   chromium -    Race when debugging alters WebSocket semantics - - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.252.0 (32473)      If you have js code like:              var ws=new WebSocket(location);            ws.onopen=myopenfunc;    then there is a &quot;race&quot; condition if the websocket  open handshake completes before the onopen function  is assigned.    Normally this is not an issue because the threading model  of javascript means that the new WebSocket and the assignment  to onopen are effectively atomic.    However  if you step through the above code with the  chromium debugger and pause after the new WebSocket   but before the onopen assignment  then the open handshake  completes while the browser is paused and the onopen function  is never called.            then this works when run normally even if the                     </pre>
