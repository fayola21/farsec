<title>Issue 40955 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes on startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I was using the browser as usual  then one day it suddenly gave up loading  web pages. Sometimes  a crash warning also appeared and Chrome shutted down.       I uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome  thinking this would make things better.      The browser keeps on having these loading issues  as if I had never  uninstalled and reinstalled it.    <b>Please provide
