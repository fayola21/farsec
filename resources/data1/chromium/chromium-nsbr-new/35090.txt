<title>Issue 35090 -   chromium -    Deseralizing &quot;too new&quot; history items will crash the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ReadHistoryItem in glue_serialize.cc does a version check to make sure the   serialized version isn't larger than the current one. If this fails  it will   return an empty WebHistoryItem.    However  when we're navigating to a history item and give WebCore an empty   one  it will crash on a NULL pointer exception. This is the root cause of   <a title="Renderer crash @WebCore::KURL::KURL(WebCore::ParsedURLStringTag WebCore::String const &amp;)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34688"> issue 34688 </a>.    We should make it so this doesn't happen. I'm guessing the correct fix is   for the calling code to recognize that ReadHistoryItem failed and just not   add the item (in the recursive case) or just give up trying to navigate in   the non-recursive case. </pre>
