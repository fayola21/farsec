<title>Issue 39853 -   chromium -    Chrome browser crashes when using &quot;Save As&quot; option on links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Search for &quot;Citrix Netscalar&quot; string in Address Bar   (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-">http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-</a>  8&amp;q=citrix+netscaler)  2. In the Results page  find any PDF link (In my case    www.fvc.com/fvc/fvcweb/Files/CitrixNetScaler_ds.pdf). Right Click on the   Result and Click &quot;Save As&quot;.  3. I've noticed this in many instances where I use the &quot;Save As&quot; feature   and the browser crashes.        The browser should never crash. It should just save the file and continue.        The file that I tried to download is actually saved to my disk. But the   browser crashes.  <b>Please provide
