<title>Issue 26426 -   chromium -    Cookie list scrolls unpredictably when cookies are removed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29916)  OS + version: Ubuntu Jaunty      1. Get a bunch of cookies.  2. Open the cookie dialog.  3. Select some cookies by clicking on a row and then holding shift and   clicking on a lower row.  4. Make sure the cookie list is scrolled down such that the first selected   cookie is offscreen (which'll be the case by default if you scrolled down   to select more than a screenful of cookies).  5. Click the &quot;Remove&quot; button to delete the selected cookies.      After the cookies are deleted  the cookie list should be scrolled to a   reasonable spot.  For example  if the list is like this:    [lots of cookies above]  cookie 1  2 &lt;- first selected cookie  3 &lt;- first onscreen cookie  4  5 &lt;- last selected cookie  6  7  8  9 &lt;- last onscreen cookie  10  [lots of cookies below]    and the button is pressed to delete cookies 2-5  scrolling the list such   that cookie 1 or cookie 6 is the first onscreen cookie  or keeping cookie   6's onscreen position constant and bringing cookie 1 and the other previous   cookies onscreen  would make sense to me.      The list is scrolled down in an unpredictable way.  In the example given   above  cookie 8 may become the first onscreen cookie.  I find this very   disorienting -- I don't know if it's GTK's default behavior (maybe it's   just keeping the scrolling percentage constant?) or if we're doing   something weird that triggers this. </pre>
