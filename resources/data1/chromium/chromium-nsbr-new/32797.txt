<title>Issue 32797 -   chromium -    Deadlock when calling NPN_GetProperty from plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : tested on official builds (4.0.249.43 (Official   Build 34537)) and local ones (4.0.303.0 (Developer Build 36024)    Plugin affected: Moonlight    When loading the Moonlight plugin on any page (i.e.  http://  silverlight.net/samples/sl2/silverlightchess/run/default.html)  it   deadlocks 99% of the time. It happens on several machines  32 and 64 bit    with debug and official builds. Occasionally it will load  normally when   attaching debuggers or if it's the first time it's loading after a reboot    it's extremely timing-sensitive. Traces for the plugin and renderer   processes are attached.    Let me know if you need more info  I can get you non-xpi debug builds of   moonlight if you need them. </pre>
