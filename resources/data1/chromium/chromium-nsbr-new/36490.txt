<title>Issue 36490 -   chromium -    N^2 notifications sent for host content settings changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry to dump this on you instead of just fixing  but my hands are kinda full   and you wrote this code.    When a content setting changes  we fire a notification that all TabContents   observe.  Then each fires a control message to the renderer process  which   enumerates over all render views.  This means each of the N render views get   notified N times.    Instead  we should either have the TabContents send a routed message to the   appropriate render view  or have the RenderViewHost be the observer and send   a control message that the renderer process farms out. </pre>
