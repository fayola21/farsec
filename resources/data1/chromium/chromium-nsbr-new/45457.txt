<title>Issue 45457 -   chromium -    Chrome Invokes Nvidia GPU on Macbook Pro 2010 when It shouldn't and KILLS battery.   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): GPU runs on integrated Intel GPU instead of Nvidia   unless major video usage  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Mostly the same as Safari but invokes Nvidia more often        1. Install and run Google Chrome on 2010 Macbook Pro   2. Graphics will automatically shift to Nvidia GPU when it shouldn't due to certain API calls      Chrome should only invoke Nvidia graphics GPU when needed.        Anytime Chrome is run after a restart or logon  the GPU will automatically shift to Nvidia.  This is   very far from the correct behavior.  After installing gfxCardStatus   (<a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/</a> )   this program tells which GPU is being used in real   time.  It also lists the programs which are forcing the MBP to be using the Nvidia graphics chip.  It   lists Google Chrome AND Google Chrome Helper as the reasons that the Nvidia chip is being   used.  Even if Chrome is closed  the Macbook Pro should switch back to the integrated Intel chip   but is prevented by Google Chrome Helper.  Google Chrome helper should in no way activate this   chip  and Chrome should only invoke it when needed (flash  video  etc).  Safari and Firefox handle   this issue much better and Chrome needs to work on this ASAP.  I have pretty much had to stop   using Chrome because it crushes my battery life.  While their might be issues on the Apple side    there are issues in Chrome (especially since Google Helper is keeping the Nvidia chip alive) but a   fix/work around is needed urgently!  Thanks!   </pre>
