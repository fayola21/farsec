<title>Issue 35775 -   chromium -    CONTENT_SETTING_DEFAULT being returned for session/localStorage and database - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Will try to investigate further  but I'm in the middle of looking into another   problem and I'm reliably hitting a DCHECK on the 3rd to last line of   dom_storage_area.cc.  It seems that CONTENT_SETTING_DEFAULT is being   returned by   GetContentSetting(&quot;file:///D:/src/chrome1/src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTes  ts/storage/domstorage/sessionstorage/window-open.html&quot;    CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_COOKIES)    You told me to file a bug if I ever saw CONTENT_SETTING_DEFAULT  so here I   am.  Will look into it more if I get a chance.    This may be a release blocker if it affects stuff other than local storage. </pre>
