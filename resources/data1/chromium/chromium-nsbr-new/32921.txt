<title>Issue 32921 -   chromium -    Opening a downloaded item won't bring it into focus unless the owner app is already opened. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Assuming you have PDF Viewer as your default viewer for PDF files  make sure   it is closed.    Click to download a PDF file. Wait until it is finished  then click on the   download item button to open the file.    Observe that it opens in the background but Chrome stays at the front.    It should open and take focus away from Chrome. </pre>
