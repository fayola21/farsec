<title>Issue 46165 -   chromium -    Make paint flush only support one pending flush at a time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently a plugin can Flush as much as they want and everything goes into a queue. Instead  only one Flush call should be allowed to be out-standing at a time to avoid plugins spamming us with Flushes.    This is easy to implement  but will require some rejiggering of the Device2D test  which relies on this ability to avoid having to wait for callbacks to continue on with another part of the test. </pre>
