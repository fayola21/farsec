<title>Issue 45493 -   chromium -    Undefined references to net::URLRequest in libnet_base - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> libnet_base contains net/base/https_worker.cc  which references  net::URLRequest. However  net::URLRequest lives in libnet  thus rendering  libnet_base unusable without libnet.    The symptom are link errors for the hresolv binary  which links against  libnet_base but not libnet. Curiously  the only plain ld produces undefined  references errors  but gold (incorrectly) succeeds in linking hresolv. </pre>
