<title>Issue 44359 -   chromium -    opening search box overwrites X11 primary selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (Developer Build 46659) Ubuntu      1. Load any page  2. Press ctrl-f and search for &quot;foo&quot;  3. Press escape to dismiss the search box  4. Press ctrl-f  5. Examine the X11 primary selection (e.g. try pasting with middle-click)      I expect the same selection handling that ctrl-l gives. That is  not to   trample the primary selection when loading the search box  even though the   text is selected.       The clipboard is set to &quot;foo&quot;.       Firefox does not overwrite the x11 primary selection when activating the   search dialog. </pre>
