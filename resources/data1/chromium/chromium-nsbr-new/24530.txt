<title>Issue 24530 -   chromium -    The address bar is working  but slightly misplaced - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In Windows 7  Open two or three tabs in Chrome (any URLs doesn't matter)  2. In the Non-maximized state  drag the window so that the top of the   chrome window border almost touches the screen top.  3. Double-click the top bar of the chrome window so as to maximize it.  4. Double-click the top bar of the chrome window again  so as to disable   maximization just done in the previous step.  5. Repeat steps 3-4 three times  6. As you do this more and more  you should see the address bar moving out   of place  usually upwards... It works  but is out of place. I have attached   two screen-shots of this issue to this bug report.      Maximizing etc.. shouldn't move the address bar position with respect to   the window at all.      The address bar moves up a little bit  with respect to the original   position of the address bar.    <b>Please provide
