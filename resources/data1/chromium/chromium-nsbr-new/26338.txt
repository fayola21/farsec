<title>Issue 26338 -   chromium -    Visiting twitpic hangs JS for entire browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.0 (Developer Build 30456) (installed from   chromium-bin-9999). Issue has occurred for at least the latest 1000 svn   revs.  OS + version : gentoo ~amd64  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : awesome  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://twitpic.com/nj6kt">http://twitpic.com/nj6kt</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works        1. Open some tabs to JavaScript-using sites (like gmail or facebook)  2. In another tab  visit any twitpic link      twitpic opens  browser continues running      TwitPic does not load. All open tabs that have JavaScript become non-  responsive and need to be killed. If they do die  the &quot;sad tab&quot; screen is   rendered incorrectly  as shown in the attachment.     Even after all tabs have been killed and the window has been unmapped    there are still non-zombie processes visible from ps.     % ps aux | grep chrome  1000     21345  4.9  1.7 536520 71320 tty1     SNl  11:38   0:05 ./chrome  1000     21346  0.0  0.1 198264  7364 tty1     SN   11:38   0:00 ./chrome  1000     21355  0.0  0.4 207416 19380 tty1     SN   11:38   0:00   /opt/chromium.org/chrome-linux/chrome --type=zygote    Running strace on 21345 yields    futex(0x7f78f75589e0  FUTEX_WAIT  21347  NULL    strace on 21346 yields    restart_syscall(&lt;... resuming interrupted call ...    strace on 21355 yields    Process 21355 attached - interrupt to quit                  recvmsg(3     If I run chromium again without affecting these processes  then it will   work (excluding TwitPic  of course). However  if I kill these processes and   run chromium completely fresh  then the browser will become nonresponsive   as soon as it hits the first JavaScript page.    I know this is sort of a rambling bugreport  but it's hard to get things   like a stack trace when the browser is exhibiting this sort of a failure   mode. Let me know if there's any more specific information that I can   provide.   </pre>
