<title>Issue 37927 -   chromium -    Mac: a way to turn Cmd-W into close window when multiple tabs are showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to popuptest.com.  2. Click on multi-popup test.  2.5. Wait for it to load.  3. Cmd-Q ...  4 ... which doesn't actually quit (it doesn't either on Linux; this may be intentional -- dunno).  5. Cmd-T.  6. Cmd-T for a second tab.  7. Look in the File menu.  8. Cmd-W to check that what's shown in the File menu is accurate  which is to say that it's the   wrong thing.
