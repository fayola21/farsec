<title>Issue 24028 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] IE's font setting doesn't work for page rendered by CF full mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Prerequisites:    Chrome Frame full-mode has been installed correctly    Chrome Frame Version:    4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)    Steps:    1. In IE  go to 'Internet Options' -&gt; 'General' tab -&gt; 'font' button   change the font of text to different font  2. Access a web page which has no special font style setting  in CF full  mode  e.g. cf:http://go/chromeframe/test-browser-setting.html    Issue:    Ideally  the page rendered by CF full mode should also use IE's font  setting  but now it isn't.    Happens in IE6  IE7 and IE8 </pre>
