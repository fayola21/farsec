<title>Issue 28379 -   chromium -    Navigating Back sends PageTransition::RELOAD - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This seems like a recent regression.      1. Use google.com to search for something  2. On the results page  press Ctrl+F  3. Press Back button to navigate back.    Now the Find box should go away. But it doesn't.    Looking at the code I listen for NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED and if PageTransition is   RELOAD I don't close the Find box. With the latest dev build of Chrome this   works fine (when I press Back  Find box goes away).     On tip-of-tree from yesterday (?) the Back sends PageTransition::RELOAD  so   the back navigate looks like a reload and the Find box isn't closed.    This isn't expected  is it? </pre>
