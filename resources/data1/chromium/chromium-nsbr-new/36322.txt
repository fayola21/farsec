<title>Issue 36322 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.sendRequest should talk to all frames in tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.89    I have the following code snippet in my pageAction initialization function:      chrome.tabs.getSelected(null  function(tab) {        chrome.tabs.sendRequest(            tab.id  {...}             function(response) {              ...            });      });    Chrome should send this request to each frame inside the tab. However  it   sends the request to only one of the frames. This is a bug. </pre>
