<title>Issue 40033 -   chromium -    Task manager eats CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open task manager  2. note CPU load of 7-10%    From a profile it looks like it's from getting memory usage  which we can't   avoid completely.  But it perhaps looks like we query for GetPrivateBytes   and then GetSharedBytes which each parse /proc/pid/smaps separately.  Maybe   those can be unified. </pre>
