<title>Issue 23789 -   chromium -    Consider using standard system frame for app shortcut windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Turning something into an &quot;app shortcut&quot; is supposed to effectively make it   into a system app.  Why do we use a custom frame on non-Aero instead of just   using the standard system frame?  I don't see any advantage to doing so.    Note that fixing <a title="Tint opaque frame to match system theme colors"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22334">bug 22334</a> would make this less noticeable. </pre>
