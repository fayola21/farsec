<title>Issue 38652 -   chromium -    Individual tabs freezing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) dev  OS: Ubuntu 9.10 - Karmic Koala  32-bit system  Window manager: metacity  URLs: several...  eg  seen it happening on wikipedia pages  Behavior in Linux Firefox: works fine  Behavior in Windows Chrome: no access to it    This is difficult to reproduce. I've bump into this occasionally  but   couldn't identify a 'recipe' to reproduce it.    What happens is that the tab i'm currently working on just freezes  I can't   scroll it or interact with any of the elements on it (links  forms  etc). I   can push the refresh button though (even if ctrl+r doesn't work)  but the   symptoms remain. To solve it I usually create a new tab and copy&amp;paste the   URL. This usually fixes it. </pre>
