<title>Issue 24601 -   chromium -    Move security related methods out of WebKit.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Move security related methods out of WebKit.h    This involves these functions:      registerURLSchemeAsLocal    registerURLSchemeAsNoAccess    whiteListAccessFromOrigin    resetOriginAccessWhiteLists    It may be good to just make these be static methods on WebSecurityOrigin    which resembles how some of them are treated internally within WebCore.  We   could also create a WebSecurityManager class for them to live on.    At least  I'm pretty sure that having them live in WebKit.h is a bad idea.    It is getting too cluttered in that file. </pre>
