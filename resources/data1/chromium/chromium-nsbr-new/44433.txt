<title>Issue 44433 -   chromium -    Windows: Indeterminate progress bar is rendered incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : latest             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. build chromium with ENABLE_PROGRESS_TAG=1  2. Open attached file  3. observe progress bar shown.      A progress bar should be rendered as attached file.      A progress bar should be rendered NOT as attached file.    This is because native_theme_win.cc:NativeTheme::PaintProgressBar()  uses PP_MOVEOVERLAY to draw indeterminate progress bar.  We need more sophisticated way to draw &quot;real&quot; bar.
