<title>Issue 29690 -   chromium -    Some HTML5 Ogg Vorbis not playing in browser widget - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.267.0 (Ubuntu build 34029)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://kryogenix.org/random/html5audio-">http://kryogenix.org/random/html5audio-</a>  chromium4.0.267.0-broken.html          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Visit the above URL  2. Click &quot;play&quot; on the browser html5 audio player widget        Audio plays.        Audio does not play.    This works in Firefox 3.5. I've tried changing the linked ogg's mimetype to   audio/ogg and it hasn't helped. Baffled.  I've also tested that &lt;audio&gt; works  which it does;   <a href="http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/n351/notes09/HTML5AudioDemo.html">http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/n351/notes09/HTML5AudioDemo.html</a> plays the   linked ogg successfully with the browser audio widget in the same browser.   </pre>
