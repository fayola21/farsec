<title>Issue 35741 -   chromium -    Chrome should close even if it has hung child processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev  URLs (if applicable) : (not applicable)  Other browsers tested: (not applicable)      1. Get into a situation where some Google Chrome Helper processes get   hanged (appear colored in red in Activity Monitor - the Mac OS X app)  2. Try quitting Chrome (Cmd+Q or using the menu item)      Chrome should quit.      Nothing happens  but I can still switch between tabs and navigate. Also  as   a side effect  using Cmd+W did not close only one tab  but closed the   entire window (with all tabs). Restoring the entire tab group is possible   using the &quot;home page&quot;. Creating a new tab with Cmd+T works.    Unfortunately  I can't be more precise. It somehow happened that some   processes got stuck and I couldn't close Chrome. Those processes were of   some tabs which weren't visible**. I killed them using the built-in Chrome   Task manager and I could finally close the entire application.    ** The 2 tabs were a Google Docs home page and a Google Spreadsheet; I   had a hard time using the spreadsheet because of a flaky wireless   connection - Chrome is not very friendly with Google Docs and bad   wireless and this might have caused the process hangs </pre>
