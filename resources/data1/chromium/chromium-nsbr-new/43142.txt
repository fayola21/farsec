<title>Issue 43142 -   chromium -    Use SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows by default. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="Use SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28744"> issue 28744 </a>  I added the --use-nss-for-ssl command-line  option to use NSS for SSL on Windows.    In M6 I'd like to make it the default.  I'll replace  --use-nss-for-ssl with a new command-line option --use-schannel  that uses SChannel for SSL.    One complication is that some Chrome Frame unit tests for  Firefox depend on XPCOM  which is linked with nspr4.dll.  So  I got multiply-defined symbols when linking those Chrome Frame  unit tests because I added a copy of NSPR to Chrome.  In  <a title="Use SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28744"> issue 28744 </a> I used a workaround for this problem for chrome.exe.  Unfortunately that workaround needs to be repeated for each .exe.    In the interest of time  I'm going to make this change to  chrome.exe and net_unittests.exe first.  Then I will figure  out a proper fix for the Chrome Frame linking problem. </pre>
