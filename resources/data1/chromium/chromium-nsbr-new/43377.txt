<title>Issue 43377 -   chromium -    HISTOGRAM macro should detect varying of name between calls. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The HISTOGRAM interface does not allow callers to change the name of the   histogram in one invocation to the next.  We should add a DCHECK to make it   harder to violate this contract.    Note that if this cotract is violated  then the gathered data will be bogus    but the user will not be harmed  so it seems reasonable to have only a DCHECK   and not a CHECK.  The hope is that SOME users will run under debug  and   isolate any violations that sneak into the codebase. </pre>
