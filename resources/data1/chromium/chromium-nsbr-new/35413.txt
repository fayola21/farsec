<title>Issue 35413 -   chromium -    Inconsistent bookmarks syncing when deleting large set of bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.322.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38504">r38504</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1. Have a large set of bookmarks (includes 4-5 steps of sub folder hierarchy  and many bookmarks) in Chrome running on machine A.  2. Sync bookmarks using any gmail account.  3. Sync another two machines B and C using same gmail account.       -&gt; We have now machine A  B and C synced with same gmail account and have same set of bookmarks.  4. Delete a bookmarks folder (which has large set of sub-folders) from BMB (right click and delete).  5. Immediately on machine B  create 2-3 bookmarks inside the same folder (which we deleted in the step 4). Deletion sync of folder which we deleted in step 4   will not happen immediately on machine B.  6. Perform step#5 2-3 times.  7. Verify bookmarks on machine B and C.    Result:  We are getting inconsistent results for above test:  - Folder gets recreated on machine A.    - Syncing failed on Machine A  B  C  so any changes on any machine  doesn't sync on another machine.    - We also got a crash and have filed a separate <a title="Chrome crash: std::deque&lt;BookmarkNode const*  std::allocator&lt;BookmarkNode const*&gt; &gt;::_M_reallocate_map(unsigned long  bo..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35412"> Issue 35412 </a> for that. </pre>
