<title>Issue 26490 -   chromium -    Pinned tabs should only spawn new tabs if domains differ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Typing in the omnibox of a pinned tab currently spawns a new tab. This is   unexpected for some common use cases like reloading the current page  or   fixing up parts of the url. We should relax this constraint such that we only   spawn if the domains differ. </pre>
