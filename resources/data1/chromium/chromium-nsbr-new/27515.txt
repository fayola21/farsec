<title>Issue 27515 -   chromium -    Change the cursor when links are known to open in a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0                  This is a feature request that would show the user if a web page link will   opened in a new tab or in the existing tab. The idea came after seeing a   reference to opening a new tab was given on a Google web page somewhere   (unfortunately I can't remember). There was an icon beside the link   indicating that it would be opened on a new tab.     I don't think changing the links on the web page is an option  but perhaps   the mouse icon could be altered slightly to show if the link is going open   in a new tab. For minimal effect  something like a + sign beside the main   cursor for a new tab and nothing for the existing tab.     I don't believe there is an option like this on other browsers but I think   it would be cool feature. </pre>
