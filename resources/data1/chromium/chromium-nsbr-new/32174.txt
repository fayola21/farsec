<title>Issue 32174 -   chromium -    Mojibake in history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Click and hold &quot;back&quot; or &quot;forward&quot; button to produce history dropdown.      Proper character rendering.      The shortcut key shown for the &quot;Show Full History&quot; option is preceded by   mojibake.    I am aware that this may be a local issue  but I am using Windows XP with   all the standard fonts and characters; I would imagine that such a system   should render the text correctly. </pre>
