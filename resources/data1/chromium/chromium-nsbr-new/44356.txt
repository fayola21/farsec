<title>Issue 44356 -   chromium -    After Chrome Uninstall - Firefox continues to find that it is not the default browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     The computer that I use runs 32-bit Windows XP SP3 fully current and  patched.  I do not know whether the steps that follow will reproduce the  problem on other Windows platforms.    1. If Internet Explorer 8 is not installed  install it.    2. If Firefox 3.6.x is not installed  then install it.     3. Run Firefox and use the menu bar: Tools &gt; Options &gt; General. In the  System Defaults section  enable &quot;Always check to see if Firefox is the  default browser on startup.&quot; and use the Check Now button.  If Firefox is  not the default browser  reply Yes to make it the default browser.    4. If Google Chrome is not installed  then install the version that was  available for download on May 1  2010.    5. Run Google Chrome.  It will probably ask whether to make it the default  browser if it is not made the default during installation.  Choose the  other option to &quot;don't ask again&quot; instead.  (Google Update  running as a  service  will always make Chrome the default browser each and every time  that Windows XP boots; your reply just stops Chrome from asking again.)    6: Uninstalling Google Chrome:    (a) Use the &quot;Uninstall Google Chrome&quot; shortcut on the Windows XP Start menu  -- it is in a subdirectory named &quot;Google Chrome&quot;  of course -- to uninstall  Chrome.  You won't find Google Chrome listed on Control Panel or Control  Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs after using the shortcut.    (b) Access the following link:    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=2cb2ade272facf04&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=2cb2ade272facf04&amp;hl=en</a>    Whether you use Option 1 to make I.E. the default browser or not is  probably irrelevant.      However  use Option 2 as described.  NOTE: in addition to the .html  .htm  and .shtml keys  you will need to make the same changes to the .xhtml and  .xshtml keys if they are present.  Also realize that Chrome is still  specified as the browser by the following keys:    HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareClasses.ftp  HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareClasses.http  HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareClasses.https    It is unclear as to the values which these keys should be changed to have.    7. Launch Firefox.  Firefox will display a dialog asking whether to make it  the default browser. Respond with Yes button.    8. Exit Firefox.    9. Reboot Windows XP.    10. Launch Firefox.  Firefox displays dialog asking whether to make it the  default browser. Respond with Yes button.    11. Exit Firefox.      12. Repeat Steps 9 - 11 as often as you want. :-)          That Firefox will become the default browser and remain the default browser  indefinitely -- at least when Firefox checks on startup and  if it is not   then the user chooses to make it the default browser.    Evidently  uninstalling Google Chrome makes Internet Explorer the default  browser  not Firefox  regardless of the lame excuse that the &quot;uninstaller&quot;  cannot identify the previous default browser.  If it cannot do that  then  it cannot do so because neither the Chrome installer nor Chrome itself have  been DESIGNED to create backup copies of registry keys before ALTERING  them  backups which the &quot;uninstaller&quot; could use to restore them.      The &quot;manual uninstall&quot; procedure  using remove.reg  does not change all of  the keys which it could change even without having a record of the previous  default browser available (see:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=111899">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=111899</a> ).          Firefox remains the default browser until it exits.  For example  if I  select a hyperlink in an e-mail message after Firefox is launched and set  as the default browser  then it will open a tab for that link.      However  the next time that it is launched  Firefox displays the same query  (if it is configured to check whether it is the default browser each time  that it launches).  Also  if I run the e-mail client without also launching  Firefox  and I select a link in an e-mail message  then Windows launches  Internet Explorer instead of Firefox.      THIS BEHAVIOR NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE GOOGLE CHROME WAS INSTALLED!!!      <b>Please provide
