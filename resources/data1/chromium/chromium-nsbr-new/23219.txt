<title>Issue 23219 -   chromium -    IME should be disabled in password box. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.219.3.0(27326)  URLs (if applicable) : any webpage with a password box  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Correct  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Correct  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Correct      1. Open a webpage with a password box (eg. gmail.com's login page)  2. Try to enable IME and input something with IME in the password box.        IME should not be enabled and used in a password box.      IME can be enabled and can input text in a password box.    Allowing IME in a password box should be considered as a serious security   issue. Think about if an IME records all input of a user and sends them to   a remote server  the user's password can easily be stolen in this way. </pre>
