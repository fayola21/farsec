<title>Issue 38218 -   chromium -    Form auto-fill Phone number should be displayed as xxx-xxx-xxxx  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.342.5    -Save an address in Auto profiles (especially the phone number area  code-number) using 'add an address'.  -Restart Google Chrome  -Check for the phone number.    Issue:  As shown in the screenshot  all the phone digits(including area code   appear in the last phone field). As a result of this  full phone number is  filled in the form as 1234567899-1234567899-1234567899  instead of  123-456-7899. It is really annoying.    Repros on Windows and Linux. Need to check on MAC. </pre>
