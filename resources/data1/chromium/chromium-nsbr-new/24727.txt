<title>Issue 24727 -   chromium -    Scrolling events in Chrome for Mac OS X fall through to other windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5 (28802)    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A    When using two-finger scroll in Chrome for Mac OS X  running under Snow   Leopard  the scroll events fall through the Chrome window into other   windows that are right below (z-order)  such as that scrolling in Chrome   also causes the other windows to scroll.      1. Open Chrome/Chromium on Mac OS X.  2. Open other window  like Firefox.  3. Make sure the Chrome/Chromium window partially covers the Firefox   window.  4. Move the mouse pointer to an area that lies (ignoring the z-order) into   the rectangle of both the Chrome window and the Firefox window.  5. Use two-finger scrolling and you will see the contents of both the   Chrome and Firefox windows scrolling at the same time  although the   contents of the Firefox window scroll slower. This seems to indicate the   Chrome window is leaking some of the scrolling events and they end up   being caught by the Firefox window.      Scrolling within the Chrome window should not cause other windows to   scroll too at the same time.      Scrolling within the Chrome window causes other windows to scroll   simultaneously  which is very annoying. </pre>
