<title>Issue 41989 -   chromium -    'Google Translate'-integration doesn't support the 'lang' attribute. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.3 (Developersbuild 44229) Ubuntu  URLs : If in need for a website to test  use   &lt;<a href="http://www.qense.nl/cat/blogposts/dutch-blogposts">http://www.qense.nl/cat/blogposts/dutch-blogposts</a>&gt;           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Go to a website that uses the 'lang' attribute to indicate the language   of a certain part of the website is 'X'  whereas the 'lang' attribute of   the &lt;html&gt; element says it's 'Y'.  2. Press the right mouse button in the area that is said to be in language   'X'  3. Notice that Chromium still offers to translate from language 'Y' to 'X'    even when the text actually is already 'X'.      Chromium should acknowledge that the language of that part of the website   is different from the language of the rest and behave accordingly. </pre>
