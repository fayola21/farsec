<title>Issue 24910 -   chromium -    Too many steps to add a new histogram to the dashboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For the Chrome code  it's really easy  just a one liner.  But the dashboard   needs 11 steps: http://wiki/Main/ChromeUserExperienceMetrics#Histograms   including getting a perforce checkout.    There's a lot of room for improvement here  not sure who'd be up for   improving this  but I figured creating a bug is the first step. </pre>
