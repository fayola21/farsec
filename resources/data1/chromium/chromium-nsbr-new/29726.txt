<title>Issue 29726 -   chromium -    middle click on new tab button should open a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25 (Official Build 33676)       Chrome Linux: OK   Chrome Windows: FAIL      1. copy something to the clipboard  2. middle click the new tab button      Open a new tab with the clipboard contents in the omnibar.      On windows nothing happens  it works on linux and i can't see i reason why   this shouldn't do the same on windows. (on linux its more useful with the   primary buffer  but i think it might make sense on windows too)   </pre>
