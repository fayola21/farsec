<title>Issue 42060 -   chromium -    Audio playback is missing the first few milliseconds on repeated replay - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull.ogg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull.ogg</a>  2. Click the &quot;Play&quot; button every time the file is done playing  3. Compare to how this sounds when hitting cmd-r        Both should sound the same. Instead  after step 2  the first ~0.1 seconds of the clip are missing    while 3 plays the whole clip.    I'm seeing this on OS X (5.0.375.9 dev)  I don't know if it happens on other platforms as well. </pre>
