<title>Issue 32417 -   chromium -    FlipFramer::CreateSynStream shouldn't have compression option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Compression should happen when the frame gets serialized out to the socket    as frames may not get written out in the same order that they are created   due to prioritization.    Currently this behavior does not happen (FlipSession::GetOrCreateStream sets   compression flag to false)  but I don't see a need for the argument at all -   and it seems like a trap waiting to be sprung. </pre>
