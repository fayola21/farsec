<title>Issue 24318 -   chromium -    Hide tips on new tab page after a reasonable amount of views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Offizieller Build 27713)    From <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/243f5a2fffd083ea :    [...] at least be clever and don't show these after a reasonable amount of   iterations  i.e. don't show the [theme] corner once a custom theme has been   installed  don't show the bookmarks sync note after being ignored half a   dozen times (it's still discoverable enough through both the Wrench menu   and(!) the Options dialog)  and don't show the same tip more than e.g. three   times. </pre>
