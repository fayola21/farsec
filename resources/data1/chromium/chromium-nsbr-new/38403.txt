<title>Issue 38403 -   chromium -    Mac Chrome does not respect some cocoa text KeyBindings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.0 (41819)    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Correctly uses KeyBindings  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a    Every other Mac application that uses a text control respects these keybindings. Some things do   seem to work (eg. ctrl+t transposes letters)  however I can't tell if that's because of Chrome has   some built in emacs-style key mapping or if its using the global system keybindings. The user   keybindings however  definitely aren't being respected.      1. Define some user keybindings in ~/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict eg:    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;  &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot;   &quot;<a href="http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd</a>&quot;&gt;  &lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;  &lt;dict&gt;  	&lt;key&gt;^u&lt;/key&gt;  	&lt;string&gt;capitalizeWord:&lt;/string&gt;  &lt;/dict&gt;  &lt;/plist&gt;    2. Try pressing ctrl+u in Chrome while in a textbox with some text typed      Word gets capitalised      Nothing happens   </pre>
