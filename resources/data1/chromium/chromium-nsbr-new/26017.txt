<title>Issue 26017 -   chromium -    Click events not fired on select elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Windows  v4.0.223.11           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Load the attached file.  2. Click on the top select box to open it.  3. Select an element in the list.      A 'click' should be printed when open the drop down list  AND another  'click' should be printed when selecting an element in the list.       It looks like Chrome only fires an event when opening the list.  I tried adding a click listener on the &lt;option&gt; element (second drop down)   but that does not work. </pre>
