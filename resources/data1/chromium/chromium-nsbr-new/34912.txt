<title>Issue 34912 -   chromium -    Content Settings dialog width should be larger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. On Windows XP  download   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/38320/chrome-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/38320/chrome-</a>  win32.zip  and then run chrome.exe.    2. Open Options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Content settings...    3. The [Adobe Flash Player settings manager...] link does not appear at the   bottom of the dialog.      I tried this on Windows Vista and I *do* see the link. I've tried on   multiple Windows XP laptops and I do *not* see the link.    See attached screenshots (one for XP  one for Vista).     </pre>
