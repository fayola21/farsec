<title>Issue 41785 -   chromium -    Mac: &quot;Create Application Shortcut...&quot; in main menu (under File)  but &quot;Create Application Shortcuts...&quot; (with 's') in Page menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'd just rather not know how this happened.    The fact that this should presumably be removed for Stable (since it's not yet implemented) will be   filed separately. </pre>
