<title>Issue 27760 -   chromium -    Files are overwritten silently from download-&gt;save dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.245.1 Safari/532.5           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Set the download directory option to ask for the path every time  2. Download a file with a filename that is already existant in the dir   about to be chosen  3. Choose the directory (means navigate to it  previous path must be   different)  4. Push &quot;Save&quot; button      I would expect the file name (eg. &quot;bla.zip&quot;) to be renamed to &quot;bla (1).zip&quot;   which is the standard behaviour of the save dialog when already in the   directory (not changed to it but already there)      The exisiting file gets overwritten by the downloaded one  silently.     </pre>
