<title>Issue 40077 -   chromium -    NaCl: Revisit mprotect call in sel_ldr_standard.c - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently 64-bit Windows makes a call to mprotect before loading the elf   image  to ensure that the memory is committed and writable before the image   is loaded.    32-bit Windows is currently pre-committing the entire address space. Instead   it should probably behave the same way as Win64. However  the first time we   coded this it caused test failures  so we hid the code behind an #ifdef Win64.    Revisit this code to see if we can use it for 32-bit as well. </pre>
