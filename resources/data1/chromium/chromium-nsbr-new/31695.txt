<title>Issue 31695 -   chromium -    git presubmit hooks do not properly detect the BUG= and TEST= portions of my CL descriptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Even when they are present  it complains:    ** Presubmit Messages **  Changelist should have a BUG= field. BUG=none is allowed.  Changelist should have a TEST= field. TEST=none is allowed.      It's because the presubmit check receives the last commit message instead of   the CL description IIRC.   </pre>
