<title>Issue 40263 -   chromium -    [Geolocation] &quot;Clear these settings for future visits&quot; in location tracking/blocking notification bubble seems not work  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently it seems the &quot;Clear these settings for future visits&quot; in location  tracking/blocking notification bubble seems not to take effect yet  when  clicking on it nothing is affected.    This link need to be more meaningful  like when it is in block bubble then  it should give user option to allow location tracking  and if it is in  tracking bubble then it should give user option to deny location tracking.  Refer to the options in image/javascript blocked notification bubble.   </pre>
