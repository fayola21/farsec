<title>Issue 39056 -   chromium -    Switch to using scrollRect:by: when scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we mark the entire view as dirty when we receive a scroll event.  We should try to use   scrollRect:by: instead of repainting.  This will involve a bit of extra plumbing because we cannot use   scrollRect:by: when the findbar is open.    A few notes on why this is important:    Testing on my 2006 mac mini (integrated graphics) showed that cpu usage dropped from 60% to   50% when scrolling a text file at 60fps in a 1024x768 window.  Faster machines with dedicated   video cards seem to do fine either way  but perf on slower machines seems to be suffering.    On the other hand  the machine was completely unable to maintain anything more than 40fps with   a larger (1600x1200) window.  I think fixing this bug is still a good idea  but there may be other   lower-hanging fruit to pick first. </pre>
