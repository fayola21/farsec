<title>Issue 40055 -   chromium -    We shouldn't duplicate history and downloads tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.366.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=43169">r43169</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Open the Chrome History (History &gt; Show Full History) and Downloads (Window &gt; Downloads)   pages.  2. Right click on the tab title of History and Downloads tab and choose &quot;Duplicate&quot;.    Expected:  Since we are supposed to have just one History and Downloads page per window  we shouldn't   allow Duplicates of these to be created.    Actual:  History and Downloads pages can be duplicated.    Note:  Happens on Windows too.   </pre>
