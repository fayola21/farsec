<title>Issue 27995 -   chromium -    Need sync menu item in main Chrome menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the sync menu item is in only the wrench menu  which isn't shown   by default on OS X (since the title bar menu pretty much obsoletes it).    According to Nicholas Jitkoff:    &gt; I would put it under the chrome menu with &quot;clear browsing data&quot; </pre>
