<title>Issue 30121 -   chromium -    Antifeature: Status bar scoots/jumps around - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)  URLs (if applicable) : Any  Other browsers tested: No other browsers have this antifeature    Chrome's status bar slides down when the mouse comes near it  then   jumps over to the right edge of the window.  When the download bar is   present  the status bar immediately jumps to the right without sliding.  As   if this were not sufficiently complex  different corners of the bar are   rounded or square in all four different states (1. SW corner attached to SW    2. NW corner attached to SW  3. sliding between states 1 and 2  4. SE corner   attached to SE).    On Mac OS 10.5.8  the status bar often becomes detached from the   window  floating below the window  over content  or above the top of the   window.    The current behavior is complicated  hard to get right  hard to test  and   hard to debug.  For the user  the sliding and jumping is distracting and   serves no useful purpose.    So -- don't waste any more time developing or debugging this antifeature.   Instead  remove the animation.  When the mouse pointer comes near    simply hide the status bar.   </pre>
