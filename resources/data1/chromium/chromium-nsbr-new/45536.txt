<title>Issue 45536 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes when selecting files for upload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.55  Is this the most recent version: I believe so  OS + version: Slackware64-13.1    Window manager: KDE-4.4.3  URLs (if relevant): <a href="http://docs.google.com">http://docs.google.com</a>  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Works just fine  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): No I don't have  access to that      1. I access my google docs account  2. I choose to upload a file  3. I double click a folder inside my home dir (ex: Downloads/);  4. I double click another folder (ex: docs/);      I should be able to navigate from one folder to another without any crashes.      the browser closes/crashes without any error message.    Bellow I add what I could get by means of using gdb+chrome:    gdb /opt/google/chrome/chrome  GNU gdb (GDB) 7.1  Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation  Inc.
