<title>Issue 45859 -   chromium -    Links in notification navigate notification - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The design doc (<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-</a>  documents/desktop-notifications/api-specification) for notifications says   that links should not navigate the notification itself.  Specifically  it   says &quot;The notification cannot be navigated.  The Location attribute of the   window object in the notification context should be readonly.  All links   should open in new  non-notification browsing contexts.&quot;    However  when I create a link in a notification  it navigaties the   notification window when I click on the link:    webkitNotifications.createNotification(''  'Testing'  escape('&lt;a   href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;')).show();    Seen on Windows Vista  Google Chrome 6.0.422.0 (Official Build 48573) dev </pre>
