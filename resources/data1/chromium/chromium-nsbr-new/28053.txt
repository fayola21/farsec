<title>Issue 28053 -   chromium -    Chromium takes 100% cpu when profile disc is out of space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 2.0.172.0 (12454)    When hard drive disk where the cache is located is full  chromium takes   100% of the cpu.      1. mount a Ramdisk (windows xp Pro SP3) to R: (just a few Mo ~ 5Mo)  2. Specify the ramdisk as the directory for profile  cache etc  using the   option : --user-data-dir=&quot;R:/&quot;  3: Surf a lot in order to the cache be full  and no left space exists (or   just some Ko) (mount a little ramdisk for this)    Chromium process is unstoppable  we have to kill the processus in task   manager) to close chromium (the chromium's windows disappear but the   process still exists)   </pre>
