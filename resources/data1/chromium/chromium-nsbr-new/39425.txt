There are aslo variosu 'validity' checks for port ranges in googleurl which  work during parsing/canonicalization  may interfere with port blocking and  may cause other bugs: <a href="http://crbug.com/39423">http://crbug.com/39423</a>    This may also affect websockets.    We need to remove duplication of checks.  </pre>
