<title>Issue 42283 -   chromium -    GCC 4.4 compiler upgrade request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome uses gcc 4.2  There are a several reasons for wanting to upgrade to 4.4 or later.    1. intrinsics bugs  a. using mmx intrinsics (because chrome does not enable sse2)  there is a  bug in movd intrinsic  which will generate an sse instruction.  This is  reported against 4.4 and a patch will come shortly.  b. using movq and doing twice as many instructions  the compiler only uses  2 mmx registers but stores temporary mmx values to the stack.  This is  fixed in 4.3    2. ffmpeg-mt (mar 18 2001 version) no longer works with gcc 4.2 native  (./configure &amp;&amp; make).  I've patched the configure.  4.4.0 builds  but has  runtime errors.  4.4.2 is known to work  and 4.4.1 seems to.  On Windows we'll need a compiler that can do 64 bit.    3. march=atom would help atom substantially.  And 4.4 does better in general.   </pre>
