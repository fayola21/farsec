<title>Issue 25557 -   chromium -    Make about:network work again. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now about:network is disabled.    I believe this it was disabled a while back during some refactor/porting effort.    The problems are:  (1) it is disabled for official builds for claim of being &quot;janky&quot;  (2) it is Windows-only.    It should be relatively simple to fix both of these problems by rewriting &quot;about:network&quot; as a web-app (HTML/Javascript/Ajax).    Here is how I envision it working:    (1) &quot;about:network&quot; loads a static HTML page. This page has the controls for starting/stopping the capture phase  and defines a DIV container   to print the capture info into.    (2) When you hit the &quot;capture&quot; button  the page kicks off an async XMLHttpRequest to &quot;about:network/capture_data&quot; (exact URL doesn't   matter). This request will stay open for the duration of the capture phase  and it will receive any new events as they happen.    (It is important to note that Javascript lets you be notified as new data is available in the responseText  not just on request completion)    (3) On the receiving C++ end  we register a custom URLRequestJob to handle &quot;about:network/capture_data&quot;.    This Job works adds an interceptor to the global URLRequestJobManager  and when it observers something interesting  serializes it to JSON   format (or whatever) and pumps it out over the connection so the web-app will see it.    (4) When data arrives on the AJAX request  the javascript is woken up (onReadyStateChanged) and it reads the new capture data  and appends   a sexy HTML visualization of it to the DOM.      This has the added benefit that the implementation of &quot;about:network&quot; can be moved from the chrome module to the net module. And a   subsequent iteration could then consolidate the &quot;about:net-internals&quot; and &quot;about:network&quot; pages into one uber page of awesomeness. </pre>
