<title>Issue 26901 -   chromium -    Installed extensions should not have the option to 'reload' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you 'reload' a normal installed extensions on the management page  it puts   it into development mode.    This is probably a bug  but bigger picture  it makes no sense to reload an   installed extension  so we should remove that link for those. </pre>
