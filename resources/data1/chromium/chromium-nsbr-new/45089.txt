<title>Issue 45089 -   chromium -    When loading page if cursor is over hyperlink it shows the 'pointer' instead of 'hand' icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works (4.0.5)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works (3.6.3)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works      1. Click on any hyperlink that makes the browser go to another page without moving the mouse  2. When the new pages loads the cursor  which was left unmoved  does not have the 'hand' icon      The expected result is the cursor to show the 'hand' icon when hovering a link       The cursor is left to the 'pointer' icon after loading the page    Good example:  Load: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/</a>  Click on &quot;Project Home&quot; and dont move the mouse. When new page loads the pointer will have   the 'pointer' icon. </pre>
