<title>Issue 24487 -   chromium -    Auto Form dropdown should close on scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28108)      1. Set focus on an input field which has auto-fill history.  2. Scroll the page such that the input field is out of the viewport. Make   sure that the input field maintains focus.  3. Press down arrow to activate Auto Fill history.      What happens instead? (Out-of-order  sorry...)    A mysterious ghost box full of words appears somewhere outside the Chrome   window. (See attached screenshot)        Reposition viewport such that the input field is in view. This is the   behavior of Firefox 3.5.   </pre>
