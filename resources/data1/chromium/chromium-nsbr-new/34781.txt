<title>Issue 34781 -   chromium -    Pop-up settings changed in bubble appear not to be saved (but really are) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193)  Implemented in Windows only at this point.      --------------------------------------    Preconditions:  --------------  Options &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Content Settings... &gt; Pop-ups: select &quot;Do not   allow any site to show pop-ups&quot;.    Repro:  ------  1. Go to <a href="http://www.andrewkantor.com/popupdemo/popuptest.html">http://www.andrewkantor.com/popupdemo/popuptest.html</a>  2. Click on the popup-blocker icon in the Omnibox.  3. Note that &quot;Continue blocking pop-ups&quot; is selected by default.  3. In the bubble  select &quot;Always allow popups from www.andrewkantor.com&quot;.  4. Close  reopen the bubble.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  &quot;Always allow popups from www.andrewkantor.com&quot; should still be selected.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  Selection has reverted to &quot;Continue blocking pop-ups&quot;.    Note: although the new setting does not appear to persist  the Pop-up   Exceptions dialog correctly shows an entry allowing popups from   www.andrewkantor.com.  So it appears to be a problem within the bubble   itself.     </pre>
