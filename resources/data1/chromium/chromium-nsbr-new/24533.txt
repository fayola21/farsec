<title>Issue 24533 -   chromium -    Fonts dialog doesn't save font &quot;style&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : chromium-bin-4.0.221.5_p27967  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit  window manager : Fluxbox  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: When changing font settings in firefox  it uses   the &quot;Book&quot; font style  which has more spaces and nice rendering.    Behavior in Chrome: No matter what I select in the font settings  it will   always use the &quot;Condensed&quot; font style (that's the first in the list)  but   it shows it uses the &quot;Book&quot; style in the settings (even if I select   Condensed).      1. Open firefox  set up the font settings to Dejavu Sans  size: 16.  2. Do the same in Chromium  check the difference.  3. Change the font style to Condensed in chromium  see that nothing has   changed.      Chromium should respect the font style settings.      It does not.    Screenshots attached.   </pre>
