<title>Issue 35935 -   chromium -    Page Action Icon Disappears on hashchange - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev                  I have a Google Chrome extension that runs on a highly dynamic page and the   hashcode changes frequently. Whenever  this happens the page action icon   disappears from the omnibar although the content script continues to run.    I would expect that the page action icon should remain in the omnibar until   a complete URL change or a page reload occurs.    Please Note: this was the behaviour until recently. Now the page action   icon disappears AND the content script is reprocessed.
