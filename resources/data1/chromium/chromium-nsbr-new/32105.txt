<title>Issue 32105 -   chromium -    tab overlap cue fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open at least 3 tabs in a single window  2. Select the right-most tab  3. Observe that the left-most tab is completely exposed  showing both   side of the tab.        Typically  tabs are overlapped on the right-hand side by the tab to their   right if they are not frontmost.      The left-most tab is completely exposed.    This is a problem because it carries the visual cue of being the tab in   focus  even when it's not.  The brightness cue is great  but useless if the   full-tab cue is the first thing looked at and the actual tab in front requires   looking to the right.    <b>Please provide
