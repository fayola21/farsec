<title>Issue 45324 -   chromium -    Centrally administered policy needs to update itself periodically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently policy settings are only examined and the appropriate preferences overridden only once at   Chrome startup. Policies should be refreshed at some interval so that the policies changes pushed   by administrators don't require a restart of Chrome to honor the new setting. </pre>
