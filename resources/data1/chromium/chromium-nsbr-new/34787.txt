<title>Issue 34787 -   chromium -    [CF] &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; doesn't render web pages with Chrome Frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install CF 5.0.317.0 (Official Build 38070)  2. Add &quot;*yahoo.com*&quot; to CF registry  3. Access yahoo.com in IE  page should be rendered with CF  4. Right click on a link and then Open link in new tab      The opened tab page should be rendered by CF since the page is within  *yahoo.com*  but now it is rendered by IE itself.    In this case  clicking the link directly or opening it in new window works  fine  only opening it in new tab has problem.    This is a regression bug  it doesn't happen in previous CF builds.       </pre>
