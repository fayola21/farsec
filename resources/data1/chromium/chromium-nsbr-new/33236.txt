<title>Issue 33236 -   chromium -    NativeViewHostGtk has to suppress focus in/out events while recreating fixed widget - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Re-creating fixed widget in NativeViewHostGtk emits focus events that we   don't want.  I'm going to submit a patch to block focus events in  CreateFixed method but this assumes that each widget has at most  one handler for focus-in/out-event. This should work for now as we don't  have such case. I'm filing a bug to keep track of this issue and in case  this regressed.   </pre>
