<title>Issue 42092 -   chromium -    No undo in Bookmarks manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac 5.0.342.9 beta    You cannot undo actions in the bookmark manager (command-Z doesn't do anything)  which makes   it difficult to recover bookmarks deleted by accident. The only way to do that is to restore the   backup file for the bookmarks  which might also bring back other changes. </pre>
