<title>Issue 34747 -   chromium -    Address bar autocomplete completely broken/inconsistent. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78  URLs (if applicable) : Multiple           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Start entering URL in address bar.  2. Fight with it to enter the correct URL.  3. End up on the wrong page often.    Example: I start typing in &quot;www.1sttech.com&quot;. After the first 5 characters   (upto the '1')  the address bar shows me the URL I want (www.1sttech.com).   BUT  within a second  the URL changes to &quot;www.1800flowers.com&quot;. I guess I   must've entered that in the past at some point - but it is completely   broken to show one URL  and then automagically change to another. This   often results in me seeing the right URL I want pop up (1sttech)  pressing   enter  but landing at the wrong page (1800flowers) because the address bar   automagically changed the URL on me between me seeing the first one and   pressing enter.    Another example: a common URL I type is my Linux hostname  followed by a   port number and then a short string (when testing various things). It   usually shows me the wrong URL for autocompletion (wrong port number)  one   that I haven't typed in for a long  long time. No worries - I continue   typing in the entire URL; but when I get past the original  unwanted URL    Chrome autocompletes with the right URL I want ... for half a second  then   the autocompletion disappears.    I guess there are two separate issues: wrong autocompletion (less severe)    and the disappearing/changing autocompletion (severely irritating to the   point of driving me back to Firefox).   </pre>
