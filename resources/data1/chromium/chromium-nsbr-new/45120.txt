<title>Issue 45120 -   chromium -    Text restored to wrong input when two have the same name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: (text not restored)      1. Type some text in the text field in the blue bar above  2. Make sure the &quot;search projects&quot; field in the top right is empty  3. Click on a link on the page  4. Navigate back      The text typed is restored to the place it was entered      The text is restored to the &quot;search projects&quot; field in the top right. I'm   guessing this is because they both have the attribute name=&quot;q&quot;. But this is   a perfectly valid occurrence on a page containing more than one form. </pre>
