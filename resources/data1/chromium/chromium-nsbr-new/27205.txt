<title>Issue 27205 -   chromium -    Ubuntu chrome window can be dragged through ubuntu menu  so that chrome menu is inaccessible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Place the pointer in the chrome title bar and begin dragging upwards.  2. The chrome window will stop moving when it hits the ubuntu menu bar at   the top of the screen.  3. Continue moving the pointer upwards. When the pointer hits the bottom of   the ubuntu menu bar  the chrome window jumps upward by the amount of   movement since the window bumped against the menu bar.  4. Continue moving the pointer upwards: the window will move up until the   pointer reaches the top of the screen.  5. If the process is started with the pointer close to the bottom of the   chrome chrome tab area  then it is possible to move the window high enough   so that the tab area is no longer accessible--so you can't move it back.        The expected result is that window shouldn't be able to move beyond the   bottom of the ubuntu menu bar.          If you move the pointer far enough vertically  you can move the window so   that the menu bar is no longer accessible.    <b>Please provide
