<title>Issue 38864 -   chromium -    Downloaded amount indicator shown in two different format when it's integer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version  : 4.1.249.1036 (41514)  Other browsers  : Other browser does not have such download page      1. Download any file larger than 2MB.  2. Watch the downloaded amount indicator in chrome://downloads/      Chrome seems to keep one digit after the decimal point when the downloaded   amount is not an integer (0.1MB  0.2MB  ..)  and it does not show the   fraction part when the downloaded amount is an integer (1MB  2MB).      However  my Chrome shows an integer with its fraction part and afterward   the integer without its fraction part. For example  it shows 0.9MB  1.0MB    1MB  1.1MB...    Screenshot  Sorry I was unable to get a screenshot for 18.0MB and 18MB  it was too   fast. However  I provide with 2 different format for integer. </pre>
