<title>Issue 37583 -   chromium -    Closing of tabs... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I often close all my tabs on accident  when I mean to close only the current   tab. I'm just so used to clicking the X in the upper right hand corner  it   seems impossible for me to break this habit.    In IE  if you do this while multiple tabs are open  it says  &quot;Are you sure   you want to close all tabs?&quot; Which I find really helpful. I can't figure out   a way to make Chrome do this. Is there a way? If not  then I would like to   suggest it!  Thanks. :) </pre>
