<title>Issue 46207 -   chromium -    [Accessibility] Contents in the Downloads tab is not read by screen reader. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Turn on NVDA.  2. Load Chrome.  3. Open downloads dialogue from Chrome menu.    What is the expected output?  As tab and arrow keys are used to navigate through the downloads dialogue  all of the content of the dialogue box should be read and the user should be able to activate any of the available options.    What do you see instead?  only see an edit box (no label)  &quot;search downloads&quot; button  and &quot;clear all&quot; link.      When using JAWS 11.0.1430  do not see anything. </pre>
