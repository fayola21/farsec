<title>Issue 35784 -   chromium -    It Works Crazy on change pictures in Tagged.com profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I find out this problem while using my profile on tagged.com   2. I am on my friend profile  on his/her photos page... I click a photo    make it bigger... and I want to see next one photo same bigger size... In   this case Tagged.com has 2 option : 1st Click Next (its link)  2nd Click on   picture which is big size... Chrome should show me Next Photo big size..   But it works only 2 or 3 times well... then Chrome getting crazy  instead   of go next picture  it goes previous picture  then click again  it goes   next and  in loop  sometimes 2 next 1 previous  or 2 previous 1 next etc...   it works crazy. You should test and see there... I use IE and Firefox still   for Tagged  coz they work good on it. Only Chrome getting crazy there... If   you can solve this problem  I would like to use Chrome...         If i click next link  should go next picture.. or if i click back link    should go previous previous...      It works crazy in loop  sometimes go previous  or go next... its not do   what i click....    <b>Please provide
