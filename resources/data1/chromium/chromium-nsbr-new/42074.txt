<title>Issue 42074 -   chromium -    Set wm_state to URGENT when there's new activity in app mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium in linux    When you are running chromium in app mode  and there's new activity in the   background (for example a new facebook message arrives  or a new mail in   gmail  or new message in gtalk) and you are not at the pc or with sounds   off  you can't know what happened in the background  because the window   state remains the same (the application does not flash/bling in the   taskbar).  To know if there was some activity in the background  you have to check   each application by clicking in every entry of the taskbar... which is   quite not productive :) It's much more useful using chromium as you can see   at least the title blinking.  Using desktop notifications could solve the issue if you are at the pc  but   it won't when you are away for few minutes.  Definitely setting the wm_state to URGENT will fix this issue (when the   title changes --&gt; URGENT  you could even add a small switch at the command   line chromium-browser --app --wm-urgent) </pre>
