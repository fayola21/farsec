<title>Issue 45750 -   chromium -    Browser action gripper should only appear when the mouse is nearby - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of the top chrome refresh... we should do the following to the   browser actions area:    - nix the separator between the browser actions and the single unified menu   button to the right  - hide the gripper until the mouse is in the vicinity of the browser actions   area. I was thinking we should support something in views where a view can be   notified if the mouse moves in/out of a buffer zone around itself. We would   then use that here and also in the tabstrip to trigger the resize animation    etc etc.    For this reason I am assigning to sky :D </pre>
