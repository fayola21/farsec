<title>Issue 35349 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Disabling and enabling visible browser action should not change the order/size of the container - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install some browser action extensions  resize the browser action  container to hide half of them   2. Move one browser action button to the first position of container  3. Repeat disabling/enabling this extension      As the extension disabled and enabled  the shown browser action buttons are  hided one by one  this should not happen since user doesn't want to hide them.    This is because currently chrome remember the original position of disabled  extension  so when that extension is enabled chrome tries to put it to its  original position  this occupy the others extensions position actually.       </pre>
