<title>Issue 31243 -   chromium -    Fatal errors print twice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes I see log messages where the message is printed twice.    E.g. here when I put invalid markup in a GtkLabel:    15335:15335:1637564051258:FATAL:chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc(229)] Gtk:   Failed to set text from markup due to error parsing markup: Error on line 1   char 38: '/' is not a valid character following the close element name   'span&lt;'; the allowed character is '&gt;'  [15335:15335:1637564051258:FATAL:chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc(229)] Gtk:   Failed to set text from markup due to error parsing markup: Error on line 1   char 38: '/' is not a valid character following the close element name   'span&lt;'; the allowed character is '&gt;'      I worry this means we somehow have two threads going  but maybe it's just a   logging glitch. </pre>
