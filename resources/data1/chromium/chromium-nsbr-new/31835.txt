<title>Issue 31835 -   chromium -    No way for system-level installs to switch channels - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Install a system-level stable channel install of Chrome.  2.  Try to install / switch / move to dev/beta channel.    There's no facility for changing channels in this case.  Could Omaha check if    the user is installed at system level before switching the channels? </pre>
