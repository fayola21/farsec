<title>Issue 43969 -   chromium -    Make password retrieval from the keychain lazy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we load a page with a login form on it  we immediately retrieve any relevant keychain entries   and convert them to PasswordForm structs. If Chromium isn't already authorized for those entries    that causes auth UI for each one  since we read the password during the conversion.    Combined with the way we handle &quot;imported&quot; passwords (not filling until the username is entered)    this makes for a weird initial-use experience: when you go to a site  you get prompted to access a   Keychain entry  but then nothing happens.      We could fix this by making the password field lazy on the Mac. It would take some doing though    since we'd have to manage Keychain ref lifetimes  enforce correct thread access if they aren't   thread-safe  etc. </pre>
