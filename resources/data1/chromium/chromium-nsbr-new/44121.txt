<title>Issue 44121 -   chromium -    NNTP: Recently closed tabs section doesn't scale to width after being shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://newtab/      1. Open the new tab page  2. If six recently closed tabs are listed  resize the window so that some are hidden  3. Click the &quot;Recently closed&quot; heading to hide the list  4. Click the &quot;Recently closed&quot; heading to show it again      The page looks the same as before      Recently closed tab entries aren't pruned off the list to fit the window width  and so the list   overflows. In particular  this renders the &quot;View full history&quot; link invisible. This is because   the list is re-rendered before is unhidden  and while hidden all list elements return an   offsetLeft of 0  so are deemed to fit even if they won't when unhidden. </pre>
