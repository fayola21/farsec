<title>Issue 38575 -   chromium -    Metabug for issues related to WorkerTest and Valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Several WorkerTest ui tests seem flaky / bad. Running WorkerTest under   Valgrind gets even worse results. Right now they're suppose to be disabled   completely on Mac Valgrind  but somehow a test or two slipped through  and   that causes bots to hang.    The list of bugs for WorkerTest and Valgrind is rather long. I don't really   want to spend the time to untangle them all  so instead I plan to give us a   clean slate by disabling all WorkerTest tests on Valgrind. Anyone that cares   about WorkerTest can look at them individually and enable them one at a   time. </pre>
