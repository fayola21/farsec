<title>Issue 34396 -   chromium -    SyncerThread needs to stop polling on auth failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we parse a ClientToServerResponse::AUTH_INVALID  the SyncerThread does   not realize that no forward progress can be made without user intervention   and it should cease polling altogether.  Instead  it will typically poll   using the shorter of the two intervals  one which defaults to 60 seconds.    This is pretty awful.    The vault_.connected_ bool is what we use for this state on startup  and we   should be using it here when an auth error occurs to denote that we need to   wait on a valid connection. </pre>
