<title>Issue 27239 -   chromium -    Multiple Proxy Authentication Dialogs interfere when multiple tabs request proxy authentication simultaneously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 4.0.202.0 (Developer Build 23435) Windows                      Test proxy is working:  1. Set-up Chromium to use a proxy that requires authentication  2. Open Chromium displaying the thumbnail site screen  3. Click on a thumbnail to open a site  4. Proxy password dialog pops up  5. Enter details  6. Page loads fine    Reproduce problem:  1. Open Chromium displaying the thumbnail site screen  2. Open one thumbnail in new tab  3. Before proxy password dialog appears open another site in current tab  4. There is a proxy dialog for each tab and they interfere with each   other  5. You are required to enter the username/password for each element on   the page    Expected behaviour:  If there is an existing proxy authentication dialog open  a second tab   should wait for that dialog to complete and use those credentials rather   than starting up a separate dialog. </pre>
