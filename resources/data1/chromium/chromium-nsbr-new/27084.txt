<title>Issue 27084 -   chromium -    The settings of extensions should be saved in a seperate file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    Currently the settings of an extension are saved in the file 'preferences'    together with the Chrome-settings. If there ever will be an extension that   has a bug and ruins it's preferences  so that Chrome will not be able to   start anymore with the 'damaged' preferences file  you'll have to delete the   preferences file  and so lose all your settings.    If the extension settings would be saved in a separate file ('extension-  preferences' for example) this cannot happen. If now something goes wrong the   user only loses it's extension settings  but not it's Chrome-settings. </pre>
