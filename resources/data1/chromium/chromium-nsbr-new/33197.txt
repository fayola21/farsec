<title>Issue 33197 -   chromium -    Remove dependency on Browser object for StatusAreaView - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since we want to reuse StatusAreaView for login manager and on login browser   is not loaded yet  StatusAreaView should work without initialized Browser   object as well as with it.    The most dependencies are about showing options dialog so the short-term   solution could be just to disable this functionality if Browser object is not   initialized. Long-term solution could be to make the corresponding options   dialogs (i.e. configuring IME) work without Browser object. </pre>
