<title>Issue 31912 -   chromium -    Right Click to Add Bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) :  Nothing &quot;broken&quot;  Something &quot;missing&quot;    Most browsers today allow you to right click to add a bookmark  or print  or a   variety of other tasks.  In particular  it is extremely convenient and a reflex at   this point to right click to add a bookmark.  How hard would it be to   implement this?    Thank you. </pre>
