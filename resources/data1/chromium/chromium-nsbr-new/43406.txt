<title>Issue 43406 -   chromium -    No easy way to change the homepage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try to change your homepage.       You can only change the homepage by either typing in the URL into the preference field  or  and only   on LINUX  you can enable the homepage button  and drag the current URL onto it. Not very easy to   discover.    We should have a &quot;Use current page&quot; button in the preferences to just get that URL and set it.  </pre>
