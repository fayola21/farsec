<title>Issue 34472 -   chromium -    Float rendering fails randomly  &lt;br&gt; ? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Official Build 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://barrystaes.nl/melodeon/">http://barrystaes.nl/melodeon/</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE  Opera  Firefox 3.5.5: OK           IE 8: OK    Opera 10.10: OK      1. Go to this page: <a href="http://barrystaes.nl/melodeon/">http://barrystaes.nl/melodeon/</a>  2. Refresh it at least 50 times by pressing enter on the location bar.  Stop when you (again) see the page rendered with a large whitespace.  3. Now open it in Firefox  see the difference. This is the bug.  4. Optional. Focus (click) the page in Chrome and hit F5. The bug disappears / reappears randomly.      Identical rendering.      Wrong rendering ..most of the time: screenshot attached.    Chrome imagines something (much like a &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt; element) where   not existing.    Refreshing the page (F5) yields RANDOM results (OK / FAIL)  except when   putting focus on the page by clicking on it. This could jeopardize   replication of the bug as it behaves unpredictable.    If i decrease the window width enough the bug ceases to appear. Height has   no influence.    Already appeared when this page was written in HTML4 days ago. Seems   unfixable without hacking HTML.    I saw this bug occur on more sites during their development. Seems like   handling  refreshing a the page often is necessary to reproduce it. I've   also used &quot;inspect element&quot; extensively during this occurrences.    I currently use Windows 7 64bit on a Intel Core 9. </pre>
