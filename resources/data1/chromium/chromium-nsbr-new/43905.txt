<title>Issue 43905 -   chromium -    Password field is not filled in is coming from Web Data not Login Data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.400.0 (46879)      1. Goto website where login is present and previously saved password    Password field is filled in along with username field. Only username field   is filled in. This appears to only happen on sites where the login data is   stored in the Web Data file. The Login Data file (which presumably contains   new stored passwords) appears to be saving the passwords fine.    When looking in the password manager  the Show Password presents a blank   password (i.e. appears to do nothing).    Thanks   </pre>
