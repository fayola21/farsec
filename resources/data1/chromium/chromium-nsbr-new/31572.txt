<title>Issue 31572 -   chromium -    In some themes text in the status bubble is harder to read on Mac than Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.290.0 (35494)    <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_earthy.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_earthy.html</a>      The combo of the white text with the black text-shadow on that background   color at the font-size of the Earthy theme is really hard to read.    P.S. I'm using the mac version of chrome  but I assume this isn't mac specific. </pre>
