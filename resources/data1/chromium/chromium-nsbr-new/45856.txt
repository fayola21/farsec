<title>Issue 45856 -   chromium -    Add policy for disabling specific plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have preferences for disabling specific plug-ins now (see chrome://plugins     which saves these in the Prefs file)    Since plug-ins are often an important element for administrators to lock   down  we should add a policy to disable specific plug-ins.    I don't know what this policy would look like  since each plugin could be   named differently.  Perhaps this policy should be named &quot;DisabledPlugins&quot; and   have a list of string values of the names of disabled plug-ins?   </pre>
