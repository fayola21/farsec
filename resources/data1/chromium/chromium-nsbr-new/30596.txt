<title>Issue 30596 -   chromium -    List of start-up pages in preferences renders incorrectly when scrolled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. Open preferences.  2. Add several URLs to the &quot;Open the following pages&quot; list.  3. Scroll the list up and down a few times.    What is the expected result? No rendering issues.      What happens instead? The last item in the list is rendered with lines   across it -- enough that you can't read it.  (See attached screenshot.)   </pre>
