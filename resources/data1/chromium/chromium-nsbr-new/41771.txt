<title>Issue 41771 -   chromium -    weird shadow/-webkit-box-reflect rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide38">http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide38</a>  Turn up &quot;text shadow&quot; slider to full.  Notice strange effect below &quot;g&quot;.    (If you turn up the &quot;box reflect&quot; slider  you'll notice that the strange   effect is actually the reflection's shadow not being truncated at the edge    and not being affected by the reflection's opacity).    In Safari  the reflected shadow is truncated at the top.  This is probably   the correct behaviour.  (We should check the spec  though.)   </pre>
