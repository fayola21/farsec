<title>Issue 41071 -   chromium -    Feature request: Chrome for Public Computers Sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Couldn't find a template for requests  so here:  How about an option  with Chrome's sync  to have a command line option to   place a button in the bar which allows one to login to their Google Account   and immediately sync for as long as the browser is open/not idle for a period   of time? Would include currently syncing options  and include Extension   preferences sync  which would allow a person to use a &quot;whitelist&quot; of   extensions preinstalled on the browser and keep their preferences with them. </pre>
