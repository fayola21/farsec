<title>Issue 40347 -   chromium -    how to edit bookmarks should be more discoverable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Having it behind right-click is annoying and not discoverable.     My intuition is that double-clicking on an item in the bookmark manager should make it editable.   One downside to that is that many people don't get the difference between double and single click.   So  in a sense  the current behavior of treating them the same is a good thing. </pre>
