<title>Issue 37525 -   chromium -    Content settings and Incognito mode do not work well together - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cookie prompt's &quot;remember&quot; feature doesn't play nicely with incognito mode    It doesn't make sense to default the cookie prompt to remember when you are browsing in   incognito mode.  Remembering such settings is leaving a local record of your incognito browsing    which defeats the point of incognito mode. </pre>
