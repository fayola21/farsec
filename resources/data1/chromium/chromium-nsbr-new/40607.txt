<title>Issue 40607 -   chromium -    Installation of dev channel fails on fresh install of Windows 7 box (no admin) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My Windows 7 image came with Chrome stable. I'm trying to install Chrome Dev. I   haven't uninstalled Stable (I can't actually at the moment  I don't have admin   rights)  but every time I try to install I get this error:     Installation failed. Please try again. Error code = 0x80040905      I tried rebooting and retried over and over. No change.    There is a 'show me help for this issue' link  which looks like it points to the wrong   help article:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?">http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?</a>  answer=170685&amp;hl=en&amp;errorcode=0x80040905&amp;extracode1=0x00000000&amp;extracode2=0&amp;app={8A69D  345-D564-463C-AFF1-  A69D9E530F96}&amp;guver=1.2.183.23&amp;ismachine=0&amp;os=6.1&amp;sp=&amp;iid={A383FDCB-A47D-E6D8-8B62-  CD6A2F1A6588}&amp;brand=&amp;source=gethelp       </pre>
