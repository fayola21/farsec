<title>Issue 26591 -   chromium -    IDS_OPTIONS_DISABLE_SERVICES has bad grammar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> IDS_OPTIONS_DISABLE_SERVICES is:    &quot;[product] may use web services to improve your browsing experience - you  may optionally disable these services.&quot;    The use of a hyphen is soooooooooooooo wrong here. This needs to be two  sentences. </pre>
