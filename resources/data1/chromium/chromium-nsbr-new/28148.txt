<title>Issue 28148 -   chromium -    document HTML sometimes not set correctly in DOM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0    As part of developing a chrome extension  I am trying to access the document   HTML from JavaScript  from &quot;document.documentElement.innerHTML&quot;.    Sometimes that does not return the entire page's HTML. Instead  I get a   portion of the HTML  typically an ad panel. Here is a sample page for which   we experience that problem: <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/25/kutano/">http://mashable.com/2009/08/25/kutano/</a>    This may be another symptom of the problem that causes <a title="document url not set correctly in DOM"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26513">issue 26513</a>  &quot;document   url not set correctly in DOM&quot;.   </pre>
