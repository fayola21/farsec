<title>Issue 39838 -   chromium -    &quot;Blocking JavaScript&quot; icon in Omnibox disappears on Chrome Extensions site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Build 42199)    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mihcahmgecmbnbcchbopgniflfhgnkf">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mihcahmgecmbnbcchbopgniflfhgnkf</a>  f#       Chrome 5 beta on Linux: OK      1. Block JavaScript (Options --&gt; Content --&gt; ...)  2. Go to a Chrome Extension URL (e. g. the one mentioned above)  3. Click on &quot;Install&quot;  4. The &quot;Blocking JavaScript&quot; icon in Omnibox will disappear (and   installation will not work  because it requires JavaScript)        The &quot;Blocking JavaScript&quot; icon in Omnibox should *not* disappear if a user   clicks &quot;Install&quot; on a Chrome Extension site to make sure  that she is still   able to allow JavaScript by clicking on this icon.         The &quot;Blocking JavaScript&quot; icon in Omnibox will disappear if a user clicks   &quot;Install&quot; on a Chrome Extension site when JavaScript is blocked. It is no   longer possible to allow JavaScript by clicking on this icon (because it is   gone).       In Chrome running on Linux the &quot;Blocking JavaScript&quot; icon in the Omnibox   does not dissappear in the repro mentioned above (what is the expected   result).  </pre>
