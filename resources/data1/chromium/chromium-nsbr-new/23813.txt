<title>Issue 23813 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.onUpdated lacks of some information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At the moment there is no way to detect when url is changed by user typing  it in Omnibox or by HTTP redirect or something. I see two possible solutions:   1. Add some extra field to chrome.tabs.onUpdated event which would describe  types of url change  2. new API like chrome.omnibox.onInput </pre>
