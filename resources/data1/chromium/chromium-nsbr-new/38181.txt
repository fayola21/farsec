<title>Issue 38181 -   chromium -    Back button screen rendering behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071) unknown  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?</a>  forumId=10001&amp;sid=1          Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=10001&amp;sid=1">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=10001&amp;sid=1</a>   and scroll down the page a bit  2. Click on a thread  3. Click the browser Back button      The browser will draw the screen as it was before the thread was clicked.    This is what FireFox and IE do.      The page is rendered with the view at the top of the page and once the page   is loaded the view &quot;snaps&quot; down to where you were.  It's very   distracting... almost uncomfortable.     </pre>
