<title>Issue 25013 -   chromium -    &quot;Synchronize my bookmarks&quot; menu text stale after first login  fresh browser profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start with a clean browser instance that doesn't have any bookmarks locally.  The account I was   using had two bookmarks stored in it initially.  2. Enable sync via the wrench menu.  Complete the wizard.   3. When the wizard finishes  reopen the wrench menu.    I expect the menu item to read &quot;Bookmarks synced...&quot;  but it still reads &quot;Synchronize my   bookmarks...&quot;.       </pre>
