<title>Issue 28499 -   chromium -    chrome browser process and flash process memory usage grows over time (memory leak) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0      1. Have tabs open with flash content.  2. Watch some videos on Hulu.      Some memory growth in hulu tab but not in others.      Memory growth in many tabs.    I wanted to add notes to an existing bug  but I can't seem to access it   anymore:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12120">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12120</a>    I've attached two screenshots of the chrome task manager.  &quot;before.png&quot;   shows the memory settings at an arbitrary time when chrome has been open   for a couple hours.  &quot;after.png&quot; shows the task manager after an additional   12 or so minutes.  I've highlighted in red the tabs that have some memory   increase.  Notice it is the vast majority of them.     </pre>
