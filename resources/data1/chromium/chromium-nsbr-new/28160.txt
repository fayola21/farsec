<title>Issue 28160 -   chromium -    Extension gallery should use Strict Transport Security (STS) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of <a title="Special extension install mode for gallery" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27431"> issue 27431 </a>  we're giving the extension gallery URL the ability to   silently install extensions.  We should be sure the extension gallery uses Strict   Transport Security so that none of its resources are loaded over HTTP.    Otherwise  a local network attacker might replace a resource (e.g.  a JS file)   and silently install extensions. </pre>
