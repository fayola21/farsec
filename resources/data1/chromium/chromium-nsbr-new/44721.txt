Visit URL to observe issue      In all other browsers (including chrome stable and beta) the black box is  rendered above the flash object  this is the desired behavior.      In the current dev channel version (6.0.401.1 dev) the black box which is a  simple div element is rendered below the flash object despite having a  higher z-index and being rendered on top of an iframe shim (a solution for IE)    This has worked in fine in previous versions and works well in all other  browsers including webkit nightly builds. </pre>
