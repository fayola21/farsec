<title>Issue 33656 -   chromium -    Recursive document.writes can cause stack exhaution which kills the renderer. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following code will cause the latest version of Chrome  (4.0.249.78  (36714)) to throw the &quot;Aww snap  something went wrong!&quot;  error.  I had  initially thought this meant the application just couldn't render the page   but recent comments on the Chromium blog indicate this can result from  memory corruption.  Please let me know if that turns out to be the case here.    This bug can be triggered in two ways  however I believe they are the same  deep down.    1. &lt;script&gt;document.write(document.all[0].innerHTML);&lt;/script&gt;  2. &lt;script&gt;document.write(document.all[0].outerHTML);&lt;/script&gt;    Tested on Windows XP Pro SP3 and Debian 5.0.3 (with chrome beta).    Thanks </pre>
