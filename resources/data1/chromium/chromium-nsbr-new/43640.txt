<title>Issue 43640 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Blank page load status bubble on uncommitted loads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Twice with the latest Dev build I've somehow managed to have an empty link   target bubble floating on my screen.  I'm not yet sure of steps to reproduce.    I can't remember who wrote/knows this code; has anyone touched it lately? </pre>
