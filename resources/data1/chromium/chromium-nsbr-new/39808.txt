<title>Issue 39808 -   chromium -    translate infobar should display error when translation fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The information below is copied and pasted from the windows bug  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38548">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38548</a>.  at the time i opened this bug  backend to use actual error code is not  completed yet (todo by jay  tracked at  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37778">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37778</a>)  but it can be  easily simulated for ui during debugging.    When translation fails  translate infobar should:  - cross-fade from blue to yellow  - display the appropriate error message  - display a &quot;Try again&quot; button  - keep the translate icon  - remove the Options menu    When &quot;Try again&quot; is clicked  translation should be triggered  and infobar   should:  - stay yellow  - display &quot;Translating...&quot; (replacing the error message)    If translation is successful  infobar should:  - cross-fade from yellow back to blue  - display the usual &quot;The page has been translated from...&quot;.    If  however  translation still fails  infobar should revert back to the   error mode with the appropriate error message and &quot;Try again&quot; button.    Animation of cross-fading between normal and error infobars is 500ms (per  cole and ben).     </pre>
