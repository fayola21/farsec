<title>Issue 38509 -   chromium -    Geolocation: arbitrate amongst multiple location providers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the LocationArbitrator class is hard coded to work with a single   location provider (the google network location provider)  in order to support GPS and OS specific location apis (CoreLocation  Geoclue   etc) it needs to get smarter  - allow dynamic add &amp; remove of providers (most likely via registering   provider factories)  - arbitrate amongst multiple providers based on accuracy and timeliness of   location reports. </pre>
