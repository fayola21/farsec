<title>Issue 44571 -   chromium -    suggest in omnibox should consider length of prefix in suggesting from history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta    I frequently use two sites:    <a href="http://WIKItravel.org/blah">http://WIKItravel.org/blah</a>    http://WIKI/ on intranet    For first  I always type &quot;W&quot; in omnibox and see Wikitravel suggested first    which is fine.  For second  I always type WIKI in omnibox -- and I always mean using 2nd   result (and I click only those in suggested list). However  Chrome keeps   listing Wikitravel on top of list for &quot;wiki&quot; prefix despite the fact that I   never click on Wikitravel when I type wiki.    In a nutshell  I wish Chrome keeps track of which suggestions I click *for   which prefixes*  not base merely on usage frequency of URLs in previous   history. </pre>
