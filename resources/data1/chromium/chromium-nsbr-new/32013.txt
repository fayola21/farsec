<title>Issue 32013 -   chromium -    Use string16 instead of wstring in bookmark related code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> All bookmark related code should use string16 instead of wstring. Here is the   plan I am going to execute on to do this in a non-disruptive way:    1. Change the internal data model to use string16.  2. Add string16 overloads for various methods that currently use wstring.  3. Change all the callsites incrementally to use string16 overloads.  4. Remove wstring methods. </pre>
