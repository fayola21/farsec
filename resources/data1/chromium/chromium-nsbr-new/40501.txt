<title>Issue 40501 -   chromium -    Chrome's internet cache has over 300mb of stuff from one day... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Attached are ccleaner (a free program with over 400 million downloads) pictures showing relevant settings   and results of a clean.  As shown in the photo  chrome has over 300mb of stuff in its internet cache from one day's usage..    Note: You can download ccleaner and check only the settings for chrome attached in the second picture   (deselect all others) and be amused at what chrome is storing on your computer after you run it..and this   is just one day of use by myself and another family member on a laptop on which chrome was installed this   morning.    As the attached picture shows  ccleaner cleans chrome's cookies  download history  internet cache    internet history  saved form info. and compact databases.    Another note: On my primary laptop  I've been using ccleaner for a good while now and it has showed   similar results but most times less than 100mb (still much...?) but I just got around to posting these   results.   </pre>
