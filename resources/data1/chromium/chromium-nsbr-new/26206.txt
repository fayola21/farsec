<title>Issue 26206 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't respect fontconfig's hinting flags. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.223.11  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.04.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : ion    Fonts are rendering differently on Chrome than in other gnome apps. I  primarly used gedit for my comparison.    To setup  I:  1) Set gedit to use the font Bitstream Vera Sans size 12 and pasted some text.  2) Created an html file which should generate the equivalent (see attached  test.html).    The output is attached as chrome_vs_gedit.png.    You'll notice that the Chrome rendering looks rather different with very  thin characters. Forefox renders test.html the same way gedit does. </pre>
