<title>Issue 34913 -   chromium -    Clicking on the icon of a popped-out browser or page action does not dismiss popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Install an extension with a browser or page action that displays a popup.  2. Click the extension's icon.  The popup displays  as expected.  3. Click the icon again.  Instead of disappearing (as expected)  the popup   replays the animation for appearing  and remains open.      The second click on the action icon should dismiss the popup.      It doesn't.  AFAICT  this is a recent regression.  The 26 Jan. nightly of   Chromium (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37179">r37179</a>) does not show the problem behavior.  Also  I am using   the Mac version of Chrome ��_��_��_ not sure if the bug is cross-platform or not.   </pre>
