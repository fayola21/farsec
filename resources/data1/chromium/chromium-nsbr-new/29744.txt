<title>Issue 29744 -   chromium -    Feature Request: show the link of extension installed (link of extension page hosted on Google) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/openbox          I think on chrome://extensions/ page should show the link of extensions   (being possible to open the extension page that is hosted on Google) so   users will have an easy access to extension page to read/post comments... </pre>
