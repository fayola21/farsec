<title>Issue 31427 -   chromium -    Use our own copy of libjpeg with internal-only symbol names for Google Chrome binaries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> People are running our binaries built against the system libjpeg6 on   systems with GTK built against libjpeg7.  This ends in tears (the symptom   is crashing when GTK starts loading jpegs in the file picker).  See <a title="Open file dialog segfaults when listing directories with images due to mixed libjpegs"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30288">issue   30288</a>.    Options:  1) Start building a new second set of packages for the four configurations   we currently support that rely on libjpeg7 instead.  This seems terrible    particularly since no users will understand how to install them  so I'm   gonna title this bug with the only other option I see:    2) Make our binaries go back to bundling libjpeg6  being careful that   there's no chance of getting these symbols mixed (I think visibility=hidden   should cover it  but maybe we have to mangle them).    I'd like to be convinced of some better third option.      ...hm  I just thought of one:  3) Add one more set of packages that are more heavily statically linked    for people who insist on running our binaries on systems we haven't tested   on.  However  this libjpeg6/7 thing is gonna start screwing us on at least   newer Debians so I don't think it'd really work. </pre>
