<title>Issue 43346 -   chromium -    Implement BrowserWindowCocoa::ShelfVisibilityChanged() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> BrowserWindowCocoa::ShelfVisibilityChanged() is not implemented. From   chrome/browser/cocoa/browser_window_cocoa.mm:      // Mac doesn't yet support showing the bookmark bar at a different size on    // the new tab page. When it does  this method should attempt to relayout the    // bookmark bar/extension shelf as their preferred height may have changed.    This is a virtual method that��_��_��_s part of BrowserWindow (chrome/browser/browser_window.h). It is   described as:      // Invoked when the visibility of the bookmark bar or extension shelf changes.    // NOTE: this is NOT sent when the user toggles the visibility of one of    // these shelves  but rather when the user transitions from a page that forces    // the shelves to be visibile to one that doesn't have them visible (or    // vice-versa).    // TODO(sky): see about routing visibility pref changing through here too.    virtual void ShelfVisibilityChanged() = 0; </pre>
