<title>Issue 34046 -   chromium -    Initial window state is wrong for plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Plugins are now getting window focus/unfocus events  but they don't know   the initial state; we just assume that it's focused. That means plugins   incorrectly think they have window focus if they are loaded in a background   window  up until the first time that window is brought forward. </pre>
