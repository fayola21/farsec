<title>Issue 33001 -   chromium -    Bookmark syncing - hit quota - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 dev                  I was messing with an extension last night that involved a great deal of   bookmark related operations. Unfortunately  at some point some loops caused   a lot of bookmarks to be created.     Since then  syncing is stopped. Though all sync dialogs in all Chrome   installations report syncing is done properly  nothing changes.    Checked out the Shared folder in Google docs  the changes are not   propagated there.    Is there some kind of ban that applies to this situation? If not  any idea   how to fix this?    Thanks.    ps: e-mail used for syncing &gt; phaistonian@gmail.com </pre>
