<title>Issue 30295 -   chromium -    [Mac] Status bubble makes phantom expose window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Open Chrome.  2. Mouse over a hyperlink.  (Notice status bubble appears.)  3. Stop mousing over a hyperlink.  (Notice status bubble disappears.)  4. Enter Expose        The Chrome window takes up one slot in the Expose layout.        Expose lays out your windows as if there is an extra &quot;phantom&quot; window.   Meaning if you have four windows  you'll get them arranged as if there were  five with an empty slot.  If you mouse around in the empty slot  you can  get it to highly a blue horizontal rectangle.  My theory is that this is  the ghost of the status bubble.  Oddly  if the status bubble is visible  when you enter Expose  you don't have this problem. </pre>
