<title>Issue 37296 -   chromium -    client side certificate don't work on OSX - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to a foaf+ssl Identity Provider. <a href="http://foaf.me/">http://foaf.me/</a> is one  but there  is an up to date list here:     <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf%2Bssl/IDP">http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf%2Bssl/IDP</a>  with another browser where the html5 keygen element works (Safari    Firefox  Opera (perhaps Chrome on Windows?))  2. create a certificate:     on foaf.me enter the form  save  this will get you to a new page with a   button that will create a certificate that contains your WebID. If you do this   in Safari then it will be added to the OSX keychain  which seems to be what   Chrome uses - (Safari has a sophisticated TLS client side certificate issue    so don't take it as an example - Opera for the moment is the best)   3.  if you are not using safari  you will need to copy the WebId enabled   certificate to the Chrome's keychain   4. Click on the login link  or on a number of others services listed here:     <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf%2Bssl/RelyingParties">http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf%2Bssl/RelyingParties</a>         The browser should ask you to choose a certificate  which it should then   send to the server.           We get an error page.    <b>Please provide
