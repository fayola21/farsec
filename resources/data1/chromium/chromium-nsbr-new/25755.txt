<title>Issue 25755 -   chromium -    Gmail automatically logging out Chrome users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> -Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  -OS: Ubuntu 9.04   -URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?</a>  service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;rm=false&amp;continue=<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/%3F">http://mail.google.com/mail/%3F</a>  ui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&amp;bsv=zpwhtygjntrz&amp;scc=1&amp;ltmpl=default&amp;ltmplcache=2&amp;hl=bg  -Other browsers tested: OK           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    -What steps will reproduce the problem?  1.When I try to enter in my gmail account in gives me some error. I'll   translate it  because I want this bug to be fixed.  2.Then I click on Ok button in the error window  and when I try to enter   again it gives me the same error.      -What is the expected result?  I expect from the Google Chrome to fix this issue as soon as they can. I   really love the web browser  because your browser is very fast and simple   and have all the plugins that I need.    -Translation of the error (see the attached file):  You logged out from your profle.    Maybe this happened automaticly if someone else is logged in form the same   browser in the same profile . To continue using this profile you will need   to log out. This is a security mesure that keep the confidencial of your   personal data.         </pre>
