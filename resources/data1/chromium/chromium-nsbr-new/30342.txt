<title>Issue 30342 -   chromium -    Can't find image 'newtab' for some mac tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open Xcode  build an &quot;All&quot; target (possibly on a non-clobbered build).  2. Try to launch browser_tests  chrome  etc.    [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.

I'd expect it to work. I'm going to clobber it  but I've seen it a few times    and it's annoying. Fortunately  bots seem to not have this problem.   Assigning so that there is an owner for this. Feel free to reassign  but   please don't leave the owner field blank. </pre>
