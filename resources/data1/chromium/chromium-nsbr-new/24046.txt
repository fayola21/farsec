<title>Issue 24046 -   chromium -    Linux: Hung tab? Last tab in window won't close  frequently leads to browser crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Occasionally I get into a state where I'm unable to close the last tab in a   browser window.  The contents of the tab disappear  leaving it blank  but   the tab (and as a result the window) itself won't go away.  Ctrl-W doesn't   work  neither does clicking the X on the tab.    If I try to interact with the tab or window for a little while I usually   trigger a browser crash.    Aside from crashing the browser  forcibly killing all chrome processes seems   to be the only way to get rid of the tab/window.    Let me know if there's anything I should look at when I get into this state. </pre>
