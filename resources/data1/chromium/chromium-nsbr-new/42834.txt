<title>Issue 42834 -   chromium -    &quot;open all bookmarks&quot; usability tweaks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Topic:  Bookmarks Toolbar &gt; right-click &gt; first 3 context menu items    Issue:  I'd consider myself to be an extremely strong proponent of &quot;if it's a   useful feature someone could use  and someone's willing to code it  it   should exist&quot;. I've never had feature bloat be a problem for me.    However today  I accidentally right-clicked the bookmarks toolbar  and   selected &quot;Open All Bookmarks&quot;. My computer slowed to a crawl for minutes.   And I only had about 20 bookmarks in my toolbar (as opposed to potentially   thousands that some people might have).    I personally use this feature fairly often  but only when right-clicking on   a folder.    I would thus propose (unless surveys or usability testing prove otherwise)   the following changes:  - &quot;Open All Bookmarks [in ...]&quot; and similar be removed from the context   menu of the Bookmark Toolbar (i.e. root folder)  but otherwise be kept if   you right-click in folders  - renaming it to &quot;Open *These* Bookmarks&quot;  - discoverability: adding a separator and a &quot;...&quot;/&quot;Action&quot; submenu item for   all bookmark folders (at the top of the submenu)  which opens the   contextual menu of the parent folder. (This would also be added to the root   folder / Bookmark Toolbar  right next to &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot;) </pre>
