<title>Issue 32377 -   chromium -    Re-enable chrome-extension URLs for command line parameters. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An extension developer noted in <a title="Provide UI feedback for invalid command line URLs" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32261"> issue 32261 </a> that he'd been using the --app   switch to launch his extension as a stand alone app. The new restrictions on   command line schemes prevent this. I'm going to look at this and see if it's   acceptable to re-enable the chrome-extension scheme (maybe just for for the -  -app switch). </pre>
