<title>Issue 33346 -   chromium -    Theme does not work correctly- latest mac version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;5.0.308.0 (37368)&gt;      Google theme (&quot;desktop&quot;) now appears colored differently  making it hard   to read tab names and bookmarks in bar.  This happened when I updated   to the latest version of mac Chromium today.  I am no code writer  so I   can't really diagnose this problem any further.  I tried reverting back to   default theme then downloading the Chrome theme again  but no change.    Still dark.  Theme worked just fine until today.  Thanks.                     </pre>
