<title>Issue 41662 -   chromium -    Next and Back buttons in Search box UI need to be reversed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6 dev Mac    OS version               :10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (Opposite)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (Opposite):      1. Find a webpage with lots of words.  2. Search for a common word such as &quot;The&quot; or &quot;As&quot;  3. Click the first &quot;Up&quot; button next to the search field        The first button next to the UI Search field should *always* proceed down the page. At the   moment  the behavior is clicking the button next to the search field does the opposite  and starts   from the last occurrence of a word  and proceeds up the page.    I believe that this behavior is completely unintuitive  I goes agains every search field I've used in   applications to date. A much better  and logical implementation would be instead of having an up   down button  in the order they are currently in  reverse them  so that the first button polls down   the page.   </pre>
