<title>Issue 25243 -   chromium -    handling of domain components with Digit One Full Stop need some changes  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TR 46 (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/index.html">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/index.html</a>) deals with 'Unicode   IDNA handling'.  The section 8.2 is about handling 'period'.  When U+2488   (One Fullstop) is a part of a single domain component/label (e.g. http://  ��_��_��_��__com.sld.tld)  we showed it as punycode ( <a href="http://xn--1.com-qqa.sld.tld">http://xn--1.com-qqa.sld.tld</a> )    but '.' (ASCII fullstop/period) is a part of the label making it look like it   has two components.     Once TR 46 goes out of the draft stage  we can revisit this and other issues.    </pre>
