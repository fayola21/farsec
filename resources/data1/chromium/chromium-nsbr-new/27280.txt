<title>Issue 27280 -   chromium -    &quot;zombie&quot; utility processes shown in task manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On 4.0.237.0 build of chrome which has been running for a little while  I   happened to open up the chrome task manager and noticed several entries with   Page title &quot;Utility:&quot; and 0K Memory / 0 CPU. I tried closing all but one of   my open tabs and looked at the windows process explorer and only saw two   chrome.exe processes running.     I wonder if we put an entry in the task manager when we create a utility   process but never remove it when the utility process goes away?   </pre>
