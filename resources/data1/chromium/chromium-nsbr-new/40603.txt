<title>Issue 40603 -   chromium -    The crash report from Mac is missing few lines. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.342.9 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=43360">r43360</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2    Venkat logged a crash but for this beta <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=40569  which points to the Windows Chrome crash report on the server.    We have the same crash on Chrome Mac  http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=a6206ba1036caa4c   but are missing the first couple of lines in the report whereas the windows Chrome crash has it.  When I generate a crash report myself I do get the missing lines.    Is this an issue with Breakpad in Chrome for Mac?   </pre>
