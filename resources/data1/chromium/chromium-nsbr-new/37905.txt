This bug is to track progress on   updating the compiler.    More information on the issue from ffmpeg-dev    [FFmpeg-devel] FATE failure on mingw gcc-4.2.4    Mar 8  2010 at 8:02 PM  M��_��_ns Rullg��_��_rd &lt;mans@mansr.com&gt; wrote:  The build failures on mingw with gcc 4.2.4 are caused by the recent  addition of -Werror=missing-prototypes triggering an error in  stdio.h.  For some reason  this gcc version isn't treating this as a  system header and suppressing warnings.    It might be possible to work around this by providing an explicit  --sysroot argument to ffmpeg's configure.  Could someone with an  affected system please try this?    This is affecting chromium  which uses:  gcc-sjlj.exe (GCC) 4.2.1-sjlj (mingw32-2)    c:msys1.0bin../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.2.1-  sjlj/../../../../include/inttypes.h:259: error: no previous prototype for   'imaxabs'  c:msys1.0bin../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.2.1-  sjlj/../../../../include/math.h:357: error: no previous prototype for   '__fpclassifyl'  c:msys1.0bin../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.2.1-  sjlj/../../../../include/stdio.h:372: error: no previous prototype for   'getc'   </pre>
