<title>Issue 35394 -   chromium -    Problems to reload the previous page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (36714)    Other browsers tested: Internet Explorer                   IE 8: Ok      1. Navigate by two or more pages  2. Type alt + left or click on previous page button of the browser      The previous page is reloaded with success.      Some previous pages aren't reloading correctly. It's happening mostly in   orkut navigation.  Instead the previous page  what comes to me is a page that I get access   many pages before the page that I expected.  Another bug is that the next page button  after used the previous page   button  doesn't appears like we can use it. On click  anything happen.  Any doubts  I'm available to talk about it.    Thanks to give us the oportunity of help to make the Google Chrome a better   browser. </pre>
