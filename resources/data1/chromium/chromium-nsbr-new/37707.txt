<title>Issue 37707 -   chromium -    chrome_exe should not link against libservice_runtime_x86_32_chrome.a on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome_exe has this dependency on the Mac (from chrome/chrome_exe.gypi):     35305 gregoryd@google.com             # This library provides the real implementation for   NaClSyscallSeg   35305 gregoryd@google.com             '../native_client/src/trusted/service_run  time/arch/x86_32/service_runtime_x86_32.gyp:service_runtime_x86_32_chrome'    This does not belong in chrome_exe on the Mac.  Nothing should be part of chrome_exe except for   the simple stub main() that jumps to ChromeMain() in chrome_dll.  Everything else should be in   chrome_dll.    I suspect that you want to put this dependency in chrome_dll and not chrome_exe. </pre>
