<title>Issue 38967 -   chromium -    Accelerated plugins (GPU  Core Animation) need to support layering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  accelerated plugins will draw above everything else on the page  rather than respecting   z-index  which we need to fix. (My understanding is that current versions of Safari has the same   issue  but ToT WebKit fixes it.)    Given that Safari currently has this bug  and Core Animation mode replaces a &quot;slap a GL context   onto a WindowRef&quot; mode in many plugins (which had the same limitation)  this may not be   important for a while  but we'll have to keep an eye on what plugin vendors do.    This is tied in with hardware compositing  so please add any blocking relationships that make sense. </pre>
