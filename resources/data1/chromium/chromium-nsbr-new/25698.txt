<title>Issue 25698 -   chromium -    &quot;View / Text encoding&quot; menu broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    OS version               :  10.5.8      1. Click on &quot;View&quot; drop-down menu  2. Hover over &quot;Text Encoding&quot; item  3. Click on the item.        The submenu with encoding types should open up. Clicking on the &quot;Text   Encoding&quot; item should have no effect  since it only opens a submenu.        It does not open a submenu. If you click on &quot;Text Encoding &quot; a checkmark   appears as if it were a toggle. There is no way to change the encoding.   </pre>
