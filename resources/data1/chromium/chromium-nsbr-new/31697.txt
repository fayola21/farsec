Clicking   any item in the menu should create a new tab and then use window.close to   close the browseraction window.)    2. Single click the icon  then click any of the items in the menu  or the   browser action icon  or the web page:  The browser action window disappears   correctly.    3. Double click the icon.          Double-clicking the browser action should only create one window and that   window show close like normal (when links are clicked  using window.close    clicking the browser action icon.)        Two windows pop up.  One of the two windows will never go away.   </pre>
