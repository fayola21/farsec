<title>Issue 40081 -   chromium -    confirmation popups are too big - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.4 dev        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Do a search in Gmail which has more than a screenful of results  2. Select: All  3. Click &quot;Select all conversations that match this search&quot;  4. Do an operation on them  e.g.  click the Delete button.      A reasonably sized confirmation popup appears. (see attachment)        A much larger pop-up which is mostly empty space appears. (see attachment)      This is just one example.  This happens at least for all popups in Gmail   and Google Calendar.    I've attached a jpeg of this popup and the same popup from Firefox (which   is what Chrome's looked like until a couple of days ago) for comparison.   </pre>
