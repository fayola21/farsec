<title>Issue 40038 -   chromium -    Support keyboard navigation for following selected hyperlinks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature Request for Chrome Version : 5.0.307.11 (0)    I will often use the keyboard to navigate webpages.  For example  I might go to   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list</a> and then notice that <a title="Malware learn more link: need more translations"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4488">issue #4488</a> looks   interesting  so I would type &quot;Ctrl-F&quot; then &quot;4488&quot;.  This then selects the link that I would   like to visit but now (as far as I can tell) I'm forced to use mouse to navigate to and   follow that link.  None of the keyboard shortcuts at   <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743</a> look relevant.    Desired behavior:    * Selection of all or part of a hyperlink with Ctrl-F (or mouse) allows the hyperlink to be   followed by using a keyboard shortcut such as &quot;Ctrl-Enter&quot;  &quot;Shift-Enter&quot;  etc.  * Selection of a paragraph of text containing only one link should allow that link to be   navigated to using the keyboard shortcut supported above  even if more text than the   hyperlink was selected (i.e. superset selection).    Other Browsers supporting similar behavior:    * Firefox-3.6 - By typing &quot;/textToFind&quot; I can navigate to a hyperlink  usually selecting   only a subset of that hyperlink's text  and then hit &quot;Enter&quot; to follow the link.  * Opera-10.10.4742 - Same as with Firefox.  * Opera-10.10.4742 - Alternative Method - Type &quot;Ctrl-F&quot; then &quot;textToFind&quot; followed by   &quot;Enter&quot;.  I can now hit &quot;Esc&quot; and &quot;Enter&quot; to follow the link that I selected with the find   command.   </pre>
