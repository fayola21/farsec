<title>Issue 38331 -   chromium -    gnome-open causes X window error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open a terminal  2. make that terminal the only window shown  3. use gnome-open to open a .pdf file that does not exist.            An error is shown as below:    $ gnome-open asdf123.pdf  $ The program 'google-chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.    (Details: serial 80 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()   function.)    <b>Please provide
