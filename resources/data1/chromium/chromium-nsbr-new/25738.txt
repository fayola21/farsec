<title>Issue 25738 -   chromium -    xdg-settings should detect when the requested .desktop file does not exist and fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently if xdg-settings is requested to set the default browser in GNOME   and the corresponding .desktop file does not exist  it does not exit with a   failure code. It should do that so that Chromium can display the &quot;could not   determine or set the default browser&quot; error message. </pre>
