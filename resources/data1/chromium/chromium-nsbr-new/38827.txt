<title>Issue 38827 -   chromium -    Not honoring changing file association - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta        Ubuntu/Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Change the file association of &quot;.pdf&quot; files to  say  acroread.  2. Launch Chrome and download some pdf file from somewhere.  3. Click &quot;Open&quot;.      Acroread is opened to view the file.      The old pdf viewer that was associated with .pdf files is opened.    I even tried restarting the machine  but it still opens the old viewer.   </pre>
