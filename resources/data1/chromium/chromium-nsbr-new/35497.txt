<title>Issue 35497 -   chromium -    (shift) + space is better not move a whole screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 (Official Build 36665)           Safari 4: fail    Firefox 3.x: fail           IE 7: fail           IE 8: fail      1. open any page with length around 3 times view port  2. press space as to scroll the page    When reading an article  it is a pain to read the whole screen before scrolling (conveniently with space) to proceed   further. Scrolling only half or 2/3 of the screen will make it easier for the eye to go back to the top.    Let page up - down do the full scrolling. </pre>
