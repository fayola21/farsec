<title>Issue 27074 -   chromium -    Browser crash: URLFetcher::Core::StartURLRequest() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I started seeing this browser crash around 237. Unfortunately  I cannot   reproduce it reliably  but this occurs enough number of times with   Chromebot to be of concern. This is the highest crasher with Chromebot   for 239  and occurs in the crash reports for 237 as well.
