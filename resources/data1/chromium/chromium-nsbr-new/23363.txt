<title>Issue 23363 -   chromium -    Browser actions: implement highlight on mouseover - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Erik says that cole says this is somehow harder than just using the same   highlight color we use for our built-in buttons. I don't see why though    other than the obvious color mismatch issues  but I don't think there's any   way around that. </pre>
