<title>Issue 27447 -   chromium -    DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES and valgrind don't play well together - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running manually under valgrind with --trace-children=yes  things go south   when I hit a plugin page  because the interpose library doesn't load because   @executable_path isn't what we want.    I tried copying valgrind into the bundle as a temporary workaround  and that   got me further  but then the plugin_main.cc assert that   DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is set failed; apparently it's not propagating all the   way through.    Looks like making a separate plugin helper that links the library directly   (assuming that works) is probably upgraded from &quot;might be nice&quot; to &quot;we   should do it&quot;. </pre>
