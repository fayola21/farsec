<title>Issue 23595 -   chromium -    Attaching a large directory causes browser hang with 100% cpu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Noticed on the linux dev channel with 4.0.213.1 but might be older.    I accidentally attached a directory by typing its name (without  trailing slash).  If the directory is large  the browser locks  up after a few seconds with 100% cpu.  It seems to close if you  click the go-away box  but a process is still burning 100% cpu  from then on.    The UI should open the directory rather than try to attach it.   </pre>
