<title>Issue 36639 -   chromium -    Use Chrome Frame as an ActiveX component (Delphi) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm trying to use Chrome Frame as an ActiveX component  but get a 'No such   interface supported' error.    This may be similar to <a title="Chrome Frame inside an SWT part using the ActiveX interface"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25448">issue 25448</a>.    Attached is Delphi code for a component wrapper created using the ChromeTab   type library. </pre>
