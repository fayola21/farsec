<title>Issue 41797 -   chromium -    Security Information dialogs (shown when the lock icon is clicked) not singletons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So clicking on it twice yields two dialogs  which is awesome. Click on it ten times in rapid succession   for extra fun.    On Mac  even after closing the first one  the next dialog shown will be offset from the first one that   was shown  so the location of these dialogs is never constant. Also (on Mac)  these dialogs can grow   in a &quot;live&quot; fashion  and they can grow off the bottom of the screen. </pre>
