<title>Issue 38469 -   chromium -    Extension should cache its icons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In various locations we have UI code that wants to display an extension icon.     People easily forget to not load them on the UI thread and doing things   correctly adds complexity to whatever code needs the icon.     We should have the extension class do this work  cache the icon and provide a   notification to the caller for when the icon has loaded. </pre>
