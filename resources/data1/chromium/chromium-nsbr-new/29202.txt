<title>Issue 29202 -   chromium -    Properly filter flash crash in reliability test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some crashes in ChromeBot happen in flash (NPSWF32)  and we don't have   symbols so the crash stacks look weird.    We need to properly filter the crash happening in known third party (mostly   flash) dlls.   </pre>
