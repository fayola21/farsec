<title>Issue 43707 -   chromium -    Security: Saved form data stored for HTTPS forms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Saved form data is stored for forms filled out over SSL. This means that   credit cards and other confidential information are saved and could be   accessed by a malicious individual.    The expected behavior is that form data should not be saved on secure sites   or that certain fields (credit card  CV2  PINs  etc.) should be checked and   not saved. It is nice to be able to use Saved form data to enter addresses   and the like (it would still be usable over SSL)  but there should be an   option to not save any new data on secure sites (which should be the default   behavior). </pre>
