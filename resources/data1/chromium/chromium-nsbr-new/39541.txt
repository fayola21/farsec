<title>Issue 39541 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Chrome has problems with Youtube videos (most noticeable with 720p and 1024p HD videos) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199): FAIL  Firefox: OK  IE8: OK  Opera: OK    1. Go to Youtube and buffer an HD video (preferably long length).  2. Play the video and click to different parts of the video randomly.    What should happen: Each and every time the video should play from where you clicked.    What happens instead: The video stops playing at certain parts of the video even though it is loaded (it is not paused).    This can happen with low-def videos but is most noticeable with high-def videos.  Works fine with other browsers  only started having this problem from 4.x.  This behaviour happens sometimes.    Side note: Someone really should fix that unknown issue in the about box - Google Chrome 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199)             (copied from my about box) </pre>
