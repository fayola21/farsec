<title>Issue 38294 -   chromium -    Garbage shown outside HTML if HTML is absolutely positioned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the attached abs-pos-html.html. (Any HTML document      where HTML element is absolutely positioned should do.)  2. Resize the browser a few times.  3. Observe the area outside of HTML  i.e.  outside the red box.      The page should be rendered cleanly.  Instead  the area outside the red box contains garbages   e.g.  gray lines and red dots. Please see the attached screenshot.    Firefox 3.6 and Opera 10.10  draws cleanly on OS X 10.5.8 and Vista SP1.  IE8 puts HTML at (0  0)  i.e.  ignores the position property.    Both Chrome 5.0.307.11 beta and Safari 4.0.4 fail.       </pre>
