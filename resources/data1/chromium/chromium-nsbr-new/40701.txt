<title>Issue 40701 -   chromium -    Pepper 2D devices should have the Browser create the TransportDIB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we make it in the renderer  but that requires us to run without   the sandbox.    We need to pipe this request through to the browser to run with the sandbox.   This requires some extra plumbing to get the message from the Pepper device   to the RenderProcessHost. On the browser side  these messages are different   than the existing paint ones  and I don't think the browser should be   keeping a reference to the bitmap  which it does for the regular   TransportDIBs for regular paints. </pre>
