<title>Issue 29750 -   chromium -    Mac: dragging text to tab strip should cause a search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Select some text somewhere and drag it to the tab strip. It should display the   indicator arrow  and search for the dragged text in the appropriate (possibly   new) tab.    (Yes  you can do this on Windows.)    CCing thakis because he's bound to notice eventually. :-) </pre>
