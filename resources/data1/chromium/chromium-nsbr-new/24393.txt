<title>Issue 24393 -   chromium -    port opened in content script closed unexpectedly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open debug tab for toolstrip  show console.  2. open google.com in one tab.     toolstrip console shows &quot;c1 saved&quot;. I waited 2 minutes and didn't see  &quot;c1 deleted&quot; msg.  3. open a new tab (you don't need to load any URL).     After a while (5-15 seconds)  I saw  &quot;c1 deleted&quot;. This seems caused by  GC. The code Aaron suggested (window.addEventListener('load'  dummy   false)) does not help.    See attached file for the extension.    BTW   though c1 matches http://*/* it is also run for view-source:http:...  when I hit &quot;^U&quot;. Should I create another bug for this?      port stays open.      port closed.    <b>Please provide
