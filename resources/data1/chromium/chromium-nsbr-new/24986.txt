<title>Issue 24986 -   chromium -    After a Mac OSX system failure (disconnected the power)  Chrome prompts me to import settings! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After a Mac OSX system failure (disconnected the power)  Chrome prompts   me to import settings!    This is really strange because I have been running Chrome for a while on this   Mac.  Now  suddenly out of the blue  it prompts me to import settings at   launch time.    It seems like we must have failed to write out some data file  and the old   version must not have been left behind.  Very odd.    System failures happen.  We should be more robust to such failures. </pre>
