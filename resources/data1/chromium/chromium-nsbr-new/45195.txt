<title>Issue 45195 -   chromium -    'update chromium' appears in the wrench menu after updating chromium to latest nightly build. it shouldn't.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.417.0 (Build 48357)    after updating to this version I have the 'update chromium' notification in   the wrench menu  even if the update had success (because of the version No in   about:version).     &quot;Old school is not cool... &quot;    even if I choose upgrade and restore nothing changed. I keep seeing this. And   BTW why that notification even appears in chromium? since it does not auto-  update is unlikely..   </pre>
