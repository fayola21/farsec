<title>Issue 46306 -   chromium -    gpu/pgl/command_buffer_pepper.cc out of sync with npapi/binding/npapi_extentions.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The change from int32 to in32_t in npapi_extentions.h made it incompatible with gpu_pgl/command/buffers.cc.   Since they are in the same repository  this causes an issue in that projects dependent on both can not use a revision number above where they deviated.      We should have a test to insure pieces provided by the Chrome repository  but not used by Chrome browser directly are still at least compiled during the Chrome build/test process to ensure they stay in sync Chrome.   </pre>
