<title>Issue 45698 -   chromium -    Staggered auto-enrollment for new sync datatypes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A proposed UI would allow users to opt into syncing all current and future sync datatypes; this is in   contrast with the current behavior  where we require users to explicitly reconfigure sync after they   are autoupdated with new sync options.    When this happens  to prevent a surge of upload activity immediately after a release  we'll want to be   able to divorce the auto-enrollment cycle from the browser auto-update cycle.  Effectively  this   means staggering the auto-enrollment until some later point in time.    There are a couple different potential approaches: one way would be to have the sync server simply   throttle commits per the existing mechanism and have the clients maybe track throttledness in a   per-datatype way (to allow  say  bookmarks to make forward progress while we wait for permission   to commit autofill).  Another approach is to throttle the first-time enable by some (hardcoded?)   random delay. </pre>
