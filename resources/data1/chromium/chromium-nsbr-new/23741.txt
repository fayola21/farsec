<title>Issue 23741 -   chromium -    context menu command naming inquiry  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.196.2    Noticed that two commands connected with &quot;copy link address&quot; action called   differently which may cause confuse.    &quot;Copy link address&quot; but &quot;Copy image URL&quot;    Why don't you call it &quot;Copy URL&quot; and &quot;Copy image URL&quot; ? </pre>
