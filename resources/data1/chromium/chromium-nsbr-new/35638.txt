<title>Issue 35638 -   chromium -    Pin tab function no longer available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown    No reproduction steps necessary. The problem is that the &quot;pin tab&quot; function   no longer appears in the contextual menu when right/control clicking a tab.   When I restarted Chrome after the latest update  the pinned tab from the   previous version became unresponsive. Closing that tab crashed the entire   browser.   </pre>
