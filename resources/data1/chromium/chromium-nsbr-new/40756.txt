<title>Issue 40756 -   chromium -    Toolbar traverse with Alt+shift+t is broken. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.370.0 (Official Build 43790)    -Hit Alt+Shift+t on browser window to get keyboard focus on toolbar.  -Use Right arrow button to go to Page menu.  -Use Down arrow button to expand the Page menu.  -While the list is expanded  use 'Right' arrow button to go to Wrench menu.    You can notice two issues here:  1) both page menu and wrench menu have focus status  2) Keyboard traverse is locked between page and wrench menus. You can't   traverse to home  refresh etc  buttons.       </pre>
