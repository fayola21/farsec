<title>Issue 36094 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Blocked Notification Icon] The Javascript blocked notification icon is still shown even the page has no content at all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Javascript&quot; and set &quot;Do not allow any site  to run Javascript&quot;  2. Access <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~mdu/test.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~mdu/test.html</a>      test.html is a html which has no content and of course no javascript   ideally there should be no javascript blocked notification icon shown in  omnibox since no Javscript is blocked  however now a Javascript  notification icon is still shown.    And in this case  all my extensions have been disabled  so there should  also not be any javascript injected to the page.    Issue is detected in Beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069)  it  also happens in latest trunk 5.0.331.0 (Developer Build 39220)       </pre>
