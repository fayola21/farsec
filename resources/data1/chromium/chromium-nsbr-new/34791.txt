<title>Issue 34791 -   chromium -    [CF] Neither IE's forward nor CF's forward work in vimeo and some other web sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have CF 5.0.317.0 (Official Build 38070) installed  2. Launch IE and access <a href="http://vimeo.com/">http://vimeo.com/</a>  3. Click on a link  4. Go back to previous page by using IE's Back button or CF's Back context  menu item      Now both IE's Forward button and CF's Forward context menu item should be  enabled  but now they are still disabled.    This issue also happens in web site whose domain is registered in CF registry.    Since vimeo.com is one of our biggest customer  Forward button doesn't work  could be a severe issue.     This issue could be a release blocker.       </pre>
