<title>Issue 36452 -   chromium -    Update checked in cygwin's version to 1.7.x - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/cygwin/">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/cygwin/</a>  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/cygwin_src/">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/cygwin_src/</a>    This build is really too old. We should update it to 1.7 and rebaseall the   dlls correctly before checking in to make sure it works on most environments.    With 1.7  it is not required to binary patch the executables since the   environment doesn't read the registry anymore  compared to 1.5. This should   make things simpler. </pre>
