<title>Issue 34039 -   chromium -    Only one tab loads on restart when all require HTTP authentication box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 beta (36714)  URLs                 : Local IIS server pages requiring popup login      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK    Steps:  1. Change On Startup option to Reopen the pages that were open last  2. Open 3 tabs to a local IIS server using AD or LDAP authentication  3. Log in to the pages  4. Close and reopen Chrome      Chrome should prompt for login  accept login and load all three tabs (or at  least pop up a login for each tab).      EITHER:  1. Chrome accepts login for the active tab and loads the page  but the  other two pages continue to appear as though they are loading indefinitely.  OR  2. Chrome does not prompt for login and all three tabs appear as though  they are loading indefinitely.    Screenshot attached.  Additional Info:  In the screenshot  the two rightmost tabs display blank white pages with  the animated loading indicator  and the leftmost page has loaded after  logging in.    To get around this bug  you must manually refresh the two rightmost tabs. </pre>
