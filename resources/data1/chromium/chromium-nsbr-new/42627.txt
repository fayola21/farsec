<title>Issue 42627 -   chromium -    The key event when pressing AltGr key sets altGraphlKey=false - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the attached HTML file with Safari Windows (or Chrome Windows)  and;  2. Press a right-alt (or altgraph) key.    Result:  The keydown event sets e.altGraphKey=false.    Expected Result:  e.altGraphKey=true.     It may be a good idea to add a member function   'PlatformKeyboardEvent::altGraphKey()' so the KeyboardEvent class can set its   m_altGraphKey value from a PlatformKeyboardEvent object? </pre>
