<title>Issue 42970 -   chromium -    file_util::PathExists always fails with 'access denied' in Windows renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Normally  this wouldn't matter  but it's exposed through the WebKit glue. I   think this is happening because the renderer runs at low-integrity  but I'm   not 100% sure.    This bug affects drag and drop of files into the browser. The renderer   process checks if the current drag operation could potentially trigger a   frame load by calling containsURL()  which checks for files in the drag.   During the checking  it calls ChromiumBridge::fileExists() which ends up   calling file_util::PathExists.    Right now  Windows works around this problem by populating WebDropData's   URL with file:// URLs on the browser side. However  this is ugly and to fix   crbug.com/42391  I had to add some ugly hacks to ClipboardChromium which   I'd like to get rid of if we can fix this bug. </pre>
