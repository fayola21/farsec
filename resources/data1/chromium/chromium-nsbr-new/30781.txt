<title>Issue 30781 -   chromium -    Allow rating of extensions directly in the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium needs the ability to rate extensions directly in the browser (to much more quickly   build up the database of ratings  so the user doesn't have to go back to the extensions website   and find the entry for the extension they already have installed).    Android does something like this  allowing you to rate extensions that you have installed.  The   thing that would make this even nicer than Android's implementation is having an entry to   rate extensions right in the right-click menu for an extension's button in the browser toolbar    as well as in the right-click menu for each extension in the Extensions window.    The Extensions window could also show the average rating for extensions that have been   downloaded from the official Google-created extensions site  and the right-click menu should   allow the user to visit the homepage for the extension.    Chromium should also notify the user if it is discovered that an installed extension is   malicious.  See also <a title="Extensions need source-based trust verification mechanism"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29719">Issue 29719</a> that talks about users voting specifically on the   trustworthiness of an extension based on viewing its source. </pre>
