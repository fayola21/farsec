<title>Issue 36959 -   chromium -    Rename button close buttons from &quot;close&quot; to &quot;done&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Several people said they feel they don't know what to do after hitting the bookmark star. They are   afraid of clicking &quot;close&quot; since that might imply data loss. Let's try if &quot;done&quot; works better; for   consistency also on the content blocked bubbles.    UI guys are supportive. </pre>
