<title>Issue 31633 -   chromium -    Unify handling of devtools  infobars  and eventual other per-tab views - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Devtools are handled in tab_contents_controller.mm  infobars somewhere   else.    The infobar approach has the advantage of being closer to what win / linux   do  but the devtools approach seems to cause less flicker when switching   tabs. (Also  win/linux don't have to fight their windowing system as much for   fullscreen functionality  and they don't do full tab drag-outs).    Either way  both should be handled the same way. </pre>
