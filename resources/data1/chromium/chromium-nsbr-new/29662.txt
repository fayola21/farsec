<title>Issue 29662 -   chromium -    Chromium should be more aware of wifi status - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Boot/un-suspend/start connect to a network  2. Before the wifi is connected  open Chrome  Expected: Tabs continue &quot;loading&quot; until the wifi is connected  Actual: All tabs show inaccurate error page    1. Disconnect from the network  2. Try to load a page  Expected: Error page says &quot;You are not connected to the internet. Connect and try again.&quot;  Actual: Error page suggests you check the spelling  or says the site might be down.      It's annoying to have to wait for the wifi to connect to open chrome unless you want to manually refresh   each page once it does connect.    This specifically affects chromium os on boot. </pre>
