<title>Issue 29074 -   chromium -    DevTools: Issues in the Resources panel wrt timing caused by long-executing JS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think there might be issues in the Resources panel wrt timing caused by   long-executing JS. This test page (<a href="http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/?">http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/?</a>  c0=hj1hfff2_1_f&amp;c1=hj2hfff1_2_f&amp;c2=bi3hfff2_0_f) contains script1 from   1.cuzillion.com and script2 from 2.cuzillion.com (in that order). These   scripts have long-executing loops. The Resources panel shows script2   downloading first  but really script1 is being downloaded first (I hope).   Script1 is supposed to take 2 seconds to download  but it appears to take 3   seconds. Firebug's Net Panel had similar issues because the network events   were being detected by JavaScript  but those listeners were blocked during   these long-executing scripts. </pre>
