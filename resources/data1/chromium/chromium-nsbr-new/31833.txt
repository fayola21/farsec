<title>Issue 31833 -   chromium -    font-weight CSS property ignored if using @font-face which doesn't specify a bold-face version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open <a href="http://gipf.bitvolution.com/how-it-works">http://gipf.bitvolution.com/how-it-works</a> in both Chrome and Firefox   (side by side).  2. Find the &quot;Ten Stages of the GIPF Process&quot; h3 element.  3. Notice it is bold in Firefox but not in Chrome.    Alternative way to reproduce:   1. Go to <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/GriffosFont">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/GriffosFont</a> and download the   @font-face Kit.   1. Once downloaded  open up demo.html in Chrome and in a text editor.   1. Add &lt;strong&gt; tags in some of the demo text in the text editor.   1. Notice how the text does not go bold when viewed in Chrome.        I expect the text to be displayed as bold. Even though the GriffosFont font   does not have a bold-face version  Gecko manages to use thickened strokes   to render a pseudo-bold  whereas in Chrome  whatever value I set the font-  weight  the text renders as normal  not bold.        font displayed as normal weight (instead of bold).    <b>Please provide
