<title>Issue 43332 -   chromium -    Chrome extensions update  but reload of bg page gets pre-update version of page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a Chrome Extension and install it in Chrome  2. Update your extension server-side  e.g. add a console.log() to the   background page  and increment the extensions' version number  3. Go to chrome://extensions/ and press &quot;Update extensions now&quot;      The extension should update and the background page should refresh and you   should be able to see the result of the added console.log() in the   inspector.      The background page refreshes  but it loads the old (pre-update) version of   the background page.  Issuing 'window.location.reload()' in the inspector   for the background page will cause it to actually update.    <b>Please provide
