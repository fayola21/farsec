<title>Issue 33137 -   chromium -    [Enhancement] Make Developer Tools show kind of object in console/watch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make Developer Tools show kind of object in console/watch.     It does this for built in types  for example type 'window' into the console  and it will show it as a DOMWindow.    What does not work:  test = function(){}  test.prototype.a=function(){}  b=new test()    It is a triangle with a blank type. Ideally it should say 'test' as the type.    Example from my version of firebug attached </pre>
