<title>Issue 43460 -   chromium -    Remove wstring instances from ProfileWriter and Importer code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm committing a largish patch to make import run out-of-process on the Mac.  This involves   several instances of wstring creation -- just because I'm calling functions that take / give me these   evil beasts  and changing this involves many a small but annoying change.  This TODO bug reminds   me to go through and make everything string16 after this patch has landed.   </pre>
