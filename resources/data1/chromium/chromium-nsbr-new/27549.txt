<title>Issue 27549 -   chromium -    We need a good way to display source code of samples in the docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you go to   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/getstarted.html#code">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/getstarted.html#code</a> and   click the _CSS and JavaScript code for hello_world_ link  you get a view-  source path that won't work in Opera or IE 6/7:    view-  source:<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/samples/hello_world/p">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/samples/hello_world/p</a>  opup.html    (view-source also doesn't work -- in chrome  at least -- if you're viewing   the page using file://.)    We need a good way to view source files that are under the docs directory.   Aaron's first thought was to use XHR to fetch the HTML  then plop it in a   PRE element. </pre>
