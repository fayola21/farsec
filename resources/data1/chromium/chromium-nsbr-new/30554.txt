<title>Issue 30554 -   chromium -    Make caller/callee explicit in UI in CPU profiler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The direction of call tree can only be understood looking at the current view   choice at the bottom of the window. A more obvious way of showing tree   direction is using appropriate icons or text indicating tree view direction.    As an example of a more intuitive UI  see YourKit CPU profiler snapshots   attached. </pre>
