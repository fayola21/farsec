<title>Issue 34254 -   chromium -    make processingUserGesture work with events in Isolated Worlds? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following commit for WebKit broke the chromium's build    <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54182">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54182</a>    As I was sheriffing  I fixed the build by following changes  but I didn't   understand the upstream change at all and I'm sure this fix is incorrect.    <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54195">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54195</a>  <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54196">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54196</a>    It seems the upstream change added a layout test but this test isn't   failing   even in chromium.     </pre>
