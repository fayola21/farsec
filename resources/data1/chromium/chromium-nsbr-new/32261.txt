<title>Issue 32261 -   chromium -    Provide UI feedback for invalid command line URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Provide user feedback when a URL passed via the command line is discarded for   being invalid or denied. Maybe an interstitial or something like   about:invalidurl and about:blockedurl.     (Blocking of risky URLs was fixed in issue 9862.)     </pre>
