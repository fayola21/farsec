<title>Issue 45676 -   chromium -    Disable Objective-C zombies before next beta ships. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome_browser_application_mac.mm has a call to ObjcEvilDoers::ZombieEnabled().  This should   flush out certain classes of use-after-free bugs.  I am going to enable it on the devchannel  but it   probably should not be enabled on the beta or stable channels. </pre>
