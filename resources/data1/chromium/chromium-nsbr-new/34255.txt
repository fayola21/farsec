<title>Issue 34255 -   chromium -    StopWatchingFileDescriptor failed in net::TCPClientSocketLibevent::Disconnect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>       I'm running chrome under gdb to debug another problem and as I      go to a web page I get the traceback below.        All I did was type in the web address in the url bar.        chrome did not try to load the page yet  the window is still green.    #2  0x0000000001609b43 in net::TCPClientSocketLibevent::Disconnect  (this=0x7fffe410b040)      at net/socket/tcp_client_socket_libevent.cc:224  224       DCHECK(ok);    p ok  $1 = false    225       ok = write_socket_watcher_.StopWatchingFileDescriptor();  226       DCHECK(ok);    Near as I can tell  the socket must be in an indeterminate state  or maybe  not yet initialized.  Which seems valid.    Looking at StopWatchingFileDescriptor() it calls event_del()  which will return non-zero if the event doesn't have a base (non init'd?)  or if the deletion fails.    tcp_client_socket_libevent.cc is littered with DCHECK(ok) calls after all  the StopWatchingFileDescriptor() calls.  Why?  What possible problem could  be discerned by cribbing about dead sockets ???  Ok  cribbing would be   progress  but full Stop?    <b>Please provide
