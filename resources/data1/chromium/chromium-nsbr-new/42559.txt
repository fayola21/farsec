<title>Issue 42559 -   chromium -    Too few options in &quot;Folder&quot; drop-down menu when adding a new bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta      1. Click the star icon next to the address bar to create a new bookmark.  2. Click the &quot;Folder&quot; drop down to get a list of folders that the bookmark   can be categorized with.  3. Look at the list of available folders in the drop-down menu.      All possible folders populate the drop down  making organization of new   bookmarks quick and easy.      A small list of the most recently used bookmarks folders populates the   drop-down.  This creates an inconsistent experience for users who regularly   make use of more than 6 or 7 folders for organizing bookmarks; they can   never guarantee what will and what won't be in the drop-down  and it makes   bookmark organization overly complicated.    Screenshot attached.   </pre>
