<title>Issue 43475 -   chromium -    &quot;Star&quot; bookmark UI stays around after switching tabs (Linux only) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. (internally) copy /home/ace/ui_runner.py and /ui_model.py to   /chrome/test/functional  2. run python ui_runner.py (performs a random-ish walk of some ui actions)        On linux  I expect you will see the &quot;star&quot; bookmark ui bubble stick around in   focus for a page long after the page is navigated away from  other tabs are   selected  etc.  This behavior does not reproduce on other platforms.   </pre>
