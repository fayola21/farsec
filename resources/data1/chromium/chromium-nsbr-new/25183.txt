<title>Issue 25183 -   chromium -    Event handling Inconsistency between chromium windows and other webkit ports - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a revival of pre-release bug 1119691.  WebPluginContainerImpl::handleMouseEvent() and WebPluginContainerImpl::handleKeyboardEvent()   invert the behavior of Apple's current PluginViewWin and PluginViewMac (though according to the   old bug  it matched Apple's code from a couple years ago).  Specifically  the Chromium version only   calls setDefaultHandled() if the event was not handled by the plugin.  Fixing Mac <a title="Keyboard input doesn't work in Flash" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19194"> bug 19194 </a>   required putting this logic back so that setDefaultHandled() is called if the plugin *did* handle the   event (matching Apple's current logic).  We should track down what's different  since the callers of   these methods are all in shared WebCore code.   </pre>
