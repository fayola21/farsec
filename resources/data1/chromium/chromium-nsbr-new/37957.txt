<title>Issue 37957 -   chromium -    Investigate solutions for Aero Peek flooding users with tab thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Show thumbnails for open tabs on Windows 7 superbar (Aero Peek)"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8036">Issue 8036</a> implemented the Aero Peek thumbnail option on the Windows 7   superbar. This isssue is a request to make the implemented feature a   configurable option.    As is  this feature shows all tabs including all browsers in the windows   superbar all as thumbnails. It makes it extremely difficult to differentiate   between tabs and browsers.    The attached file demonstrates what I am talking about. There are 6 browser   windows open  one of the browser window has 5 tabs. On the Windows superbar    each browser and tab is displayed equally and thus it is hard to tell which   one is a browser and which one is a tab. This can make navigating through   browsers and tabs somewhat inefficient for some of us. </pre>
