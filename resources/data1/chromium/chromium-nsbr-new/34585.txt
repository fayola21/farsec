<title>Issue 34585 -   chromium -    add a buildbot step to clean up /tmp/org.chromium.* files on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the past couple weeks I've had to clean up /tmp on linux slaves because   there were too many files in the directory.  Most of these directories are   empty  but it looks like some have a few files like a Cache directory.    It would be nice to find out what's making these directories and to clean   them up  but it probably wouldn't hurt to just add a buildbot step that   cleans it up on each run (since tests that crash will still leave the   directory around).   </pre>
