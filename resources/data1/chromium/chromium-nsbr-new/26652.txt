<title>Issue 26652 -   chromium -    Leaking extensions RPHs on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have the last pass extension installed  I run chrome in gdb  select Exit   from the wrench  I break on BrowserRPH destructor  and I only get hit once   (for the web page) instead of twice (for web page + for extension).    running on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30726">r30726</a>    Not tested on windows  or with other extensions. Assuming it's problematic   there as well until shown otherwise. </pre>
