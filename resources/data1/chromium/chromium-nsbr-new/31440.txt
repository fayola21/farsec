<title>Issue 31440 -   chromium -    Should be able to control inject location with insertCSS and executeScript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> CSS Injection is not efficient.   The CSS injection should be similar to the way the CSS is injected in   the manifest.json   Otherwise  we should at least be able to manipulate the content_script   in manifest.json dynamically.     An excellent example would be the two extensions available right now to   customize background colors.  1) custom colors  2) plainclothes    PlainClothes injects the CSS using the chrome.tabs.injectCSS function or by   running a script at &quot;document_start&quot; and create a &quot;style&quot; element and inject the   CSS like that.    Custom colors injects the CSS from the manifest.json. It is declared there.    What's the difference?    The one injected from the manifest.json is applied faster than the one injected by   the extension (no matter how it is injected).  You can notice a small &quot;flicker effect&quot; with plainClothes.    Thanks     </pre>
