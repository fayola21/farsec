<title>Issue 42094 -   chromium -    &quot;Recently Added&quot; in bookmark manager uses hard links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac 5.0.342.9 beta    I've deleted all of my bookmarks by accident by clearing the &quot;recently added&quot; list. Coupled with the   lack of undo functionality  it scared somewhat until I've learnt that there is a backup file.    It would make more sense to make those entries soft links  so that their removal does not carry over   to the actual bookmarks. </pre>
