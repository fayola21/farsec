<title>Issue 27021 -   chromium -    Feature request: Setting browser action properties for specified window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After playing a bit with the browser action  I'd like to see the following   (non-breaking) change to its API:    Ability to change browser action properties (icon  colors  text) for   specific window.    For now those can be changed either globally or for specific tab. It would   make sense to allow the change for specific window - browser actions on two   windows are &quot;physically&quot; two distinct UI objects.    (No similar change would make sense for page actions.)    Usecase:    I came up with this idea while working on porting TPGoogleReader   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tpgooglereader/">http://code.google.com/p/tpgooglereader/</a>) from toolstrip to browser   action. This extension treats one window as a special window (where it   opens tabs when new items appear in Google Reader). The change I propose   would make it simple to display a different browser action on the specified   window than on the others. </pre>
