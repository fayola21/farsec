<title>Issue 25354 -   chromium -    Need a fool-proof way of executing tasks on other threads without worrying about thread destruction order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has come up over and over  and just recently Evan fixed a top crasher in   Linux because of it.  I think we can do something smarter than the current   manual approach  as most of the time it's reactionary (i.e. crash happens  we   waste time debugging it  then we add extra code).    Another related task is having ThreadSafeRefCounted objects be automatically   deleted on the thread that they're created on  if they specify that this   behavior is needed.  Now we do this manually as well. </pre>
