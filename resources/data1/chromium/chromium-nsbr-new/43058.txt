Create New Post in HubFS &quot;General Discussions on F#&quot; Forum  2. Insert the following tags into your post:  [code language=&quot;F#&quot;]  [/code]  3. Copy some F# code and paste it in between the [code] tags mentioned in   Step#2.  4. Preview or Submit Post  5. Observe that Chrome unexpectedly strips out the indentation spaces of   the posted code making the code less readable.    This problem does not happen on Virtualized FireFox 3.5.9    [1] - Working FireFox 3.5.9 was running in a Virtualized Copy of OpenSuSE   11.2 with Win XP Pro SP3 as host.  Broken Chrome was running in dedicated   non-virtualized XP Pro SP3.  </pre>
