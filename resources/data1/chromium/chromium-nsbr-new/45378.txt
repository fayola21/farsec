<title>Issue 45378 -   chromium -    Security: non-https resources warning (red skull) 'sticky' in tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome Version: 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev    STR:  1. Visit an https website  e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>  2. Manually fetch in a resource that is not https  e.g. by running a bookmarklet that loads an   external script.  3. Note that at this point  the location bar correctly warns about non-https resources.  4. Reload the page (must stay in the same tab)  5. Note that the warning remains  even though all resources are now being served over https.    The warning persists even if you navigate away from the page  then later return to it (as long as   you return in the same tab).  Other tabs correctly note that the page is fine.   </pre>
