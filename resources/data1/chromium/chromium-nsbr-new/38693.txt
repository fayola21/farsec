Go to a site with images  like <a href="http://ffffound.com/">http://ffffound.com/</a>  2. Click and drag a picture on the website to your desktop.      The picture should be saved on your desktop.      The picture isn't saved on the desktop and the webpage freezes.    Refreshing the page doesn't fix the freezing. You have to open the page in   a different tab to &quot;un-freeze&quot; it. </pre>
