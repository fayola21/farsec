<title>Issue 37153 -   chromium -    Add lock to SyncBackendHost::ActivateDataType  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a lock around the body of SyncBackendHost::ActivateDataType   to prevent multiple threads from activating a data type at the same time.    This is currently unlikely to happen since this method is only invoked   during data type startup  which is mediated by the DataTypeManager -- and it ensures that only one data type is started at a time.   </pre>
