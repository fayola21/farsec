<title>Issue 42810 -   chromium -    Whole browser freezes/crawls for 10 sec if typing text while GV notification comes in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Google Chrome	5.0.375.9 (Official Build 44625) dev  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.9 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome    Extension URL:   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kcnhkahnjcbndmmehfkdnkjomaanaoo">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kcnhkahnjcbndmmehfkdnkjomaanaoo</a>  o    With the &quot;Google Voice (by Google)&quot; extension installed  if you are typing   into a rich-text field (e.g. writing an email in Gmail) when a GV SMS   notification comes in (i.e. when the &quot;ding&quot; noise is played and the GV   extension icon spins around a couple of times to indicate the new message)    the whole browser freezes -- characters typed are buffered but nothing   appears for about 10 seconds.  Meanwhile  the &quot;ding&quot; noise goes stoccato   and the spinning animation crawls at about 1/4 of the normal speed.    This only seems to happen if typing when the notification comes in.    Reproducibility: 100%.   </pre>
