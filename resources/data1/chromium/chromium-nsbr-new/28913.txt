<title>Issue 28913 -   chromium -    Segmentation Fault when loading HTTPS sites (bisected) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.259.0 (Developer Build 33231)  OS + version:  Gentoo ~x86  CPU architecture: 32-bit      I've lately been getting a ton of segmentation faults when using Chromium   to browse shopping sites.  The problem appears to be SSL-related.    I've created this demo page:  <a href="http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/ssl_sites.html">http://www.pmarks.net/posted_links/ssl_sites.html</a>    Go there  and middle-click all of the links to open them in separate tabs.    This segfaults my browser every single time  although the number of clicks   before crashing can vary.    I did some bisecting of the posted binaries  and determined:  &lt;= 32579 does not crash.  &gt;= 32583 crashes.    My best guess is that this change is at fault:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=32580">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=32580</a>   </pre>
