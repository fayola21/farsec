<title>Issue 30266 -   chromium -    Bookmark toolbar folders need to be clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. If you click on a folder in the Bookmark toolbar  you have to click again   to make that submenu of links go away and then click again to bring up   another folder's links. It does the same thing in Safari. I don't understand   why this is thought to be a good feature. Firefox allows you to click once   on a folder and move your mouse around to open up other folders. I think   this really needs to be looked at. I don't see much of any advantage to how   it's done now. I would rather use Chrome or Safari  but there just doesn't   seem to be the level of customization that you find in FF.                     <b>Please provide
