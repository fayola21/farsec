<title>Issue 25562 -   chromium -    Page actions with no icon crash Chrome when trying to enable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ben discovered that Nicolas' &quot;buildbot switcher extension&quot; now crashes   Chrome  since we've changed the API to use default_icon instead of icon  so   extensions that don't add one programmatically need to be updated.    We shouldn't crash  however  so I'm thinking of adding a check when we try to   enable to make sure we have at least one icon.     </pre>
