<title>Issue 32227 -   chromium -    Add Safe Browsing support for 3D APIs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Until graphics processors and drivers are completely robust  we will likely   need to use Safe Browsing as a first line of defense against programs using   3D APIs like WebGL to slow down or lock up a machine.    This will involve approximately:      - Detecting which web page was responsible for crashing the GPU process    - Logging this information in the Safe Browsing database    - Querying the database when WebGL is initialized to see if the current web   page is blocked   </pre>
