<title>Issue 43696 -   chromium -    Add flash-blocking settings to content settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The content settings should have a setting for flash similar to the one for   javascript. There should be an option to have flash enabled  or disabled with   an exception list. Extensions are limited in their capacity to block flash   before the page loads  having this option built in would be far more   efficient. Loading flash affects loading time and can present security risks.   Allowing flash to only be run on trusted sites would make the browser far   more secure. </pre>
