<title>Issue 44576 -   chromium -    New M6 Mac UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'd like us to move toward a more contrasty mac-style UI for M6. Image attached  and drawing   routines and colors can be described as needed. This may require:    Increasing height of tab views (to handle taller shadow)  Tweaking drawing of default gradients  Routines for drawing inner shadows in a bitmap. </pre>
