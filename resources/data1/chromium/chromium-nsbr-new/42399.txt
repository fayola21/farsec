<title>Issue 42399 -   chromium -    Hover over bookmarks activates window controls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta on OS X      1. Move the mouse from somewhere and cross the bookmarks bar (or hover over it)      Nothing should happen with the window controls  ie. no x . - should be blended in. This sounds   minor but is important as it distracts the eye (indicates that a page title close to it has changed    which for example indicates a chat message in Gmail).      The window controls are augmented (red yellow green) with x . -   </pre>
