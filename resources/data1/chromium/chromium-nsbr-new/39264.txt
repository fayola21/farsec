<title>Issue 39264 -   chromium -    Add build date and channel name to About Chrome version info - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; dialog shows the version number and the   channel as in: 5.0.356.2 dev    We should also include the platform (so that users paste this in to bug   reports) and the build date (so users have an idea if they are woefully out   of date).    It should look like 5.0.356.2 Windows dev (3/19/2010)   </pre>
