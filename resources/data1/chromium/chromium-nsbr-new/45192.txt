<title>Issue 45192 -   chromium -    Chrome crashed with BadWindow when invoking xsel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.38  OS + version: Ubuntu 10.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x64  Window manager: openbox    Ok I can't get this to reproduce 100% but here's the basic idea:    - Create an extremely large dom object (in my case a 2MB table)  - Go in devtools -&gt; copy as html  - Invoke xsel -o --clipboard    I managed to get 6-7 crashes this way  then it started working again.   Reporting in case someone else can reproduce. </pre>
