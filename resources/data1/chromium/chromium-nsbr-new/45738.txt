<title>Issue 45738 -   chromium -    Mac should use a hit test mask for all tabstrip elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now on Mac you can click on portions of the visible titlebar and   actually end up clicking on UI elements like the new tab button. This is a   usability issue with a full tabstrip since it reduces the area that's usable   for moving the window.    Each element overlapping the title bar (tabs  new tab button  etc) should   specify a non-rectangular hit test mask that can be used when determining if   a click was in the title bar or not. We do this on Windows and it works   wonderfully. </pre>
