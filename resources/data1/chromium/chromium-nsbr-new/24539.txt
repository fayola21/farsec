<title>Issue 24539 -   chromium -    Close/Minimize/Zoom too low in popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a popup window (pop out gmail chat  unblock a popup  etc)    expected:  - title bar looks like other apps    actual:  - traffic light is too low  almost at the bottom of the title bar.    We should only be adjusting the positioning for main windows  not popup   windows. I'll leave the referendum on the fact that we're moving them at all   out of this bug.    -&gt; dmac who I think was the one tinkering with this. </pre>
