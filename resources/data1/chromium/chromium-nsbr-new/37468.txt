<title>Issue 37468 -   chromium -    GRD changes not picked up by buildbots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I submitted the following CL  which included a change to   chrome/app/generated_resources.grd:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=40697">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=40697</a>    The first cycle on several of the Windows bots resulted in a handful of test   failures due to changed resources strings. After another cycle  most of the   bots corrected themselves.    If I remember right  at one point we had our dependencies set up to correctly   detect GRD changes  so this could be a regression. </pre>
