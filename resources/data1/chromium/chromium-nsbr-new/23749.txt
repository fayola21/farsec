<title>Issue 23749 -   chromium -    Only some bookmarks imported from Firefox 3.5.3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1    Running on Ubuntu 9.0.4 with current security updates. Many (most  I think)   of my bookmarks failed to be imported from Firefox 3.5.3 upon install of   Chrome. After I realized this  I tried to import them from the Bookmark   Manager  but this had no effect. Also  the file browser displayed from the   Bookmark Manager to select the bookmark file does not allow for browsing   hidden files  so you can't just pickup the bookmark file directly from   within the Firefox user data files.      1. I have a fairly large bookmark file  maybe a few hundred bookmarks.  2. Install Chrome 4.0.213.1.         Should import all bookmarks in the same hierarchical folder structure from   the source browser.        Missing bookmarks. Some are imported  many are not  at least on my system.    I hope you can fix this soon -- this is a show stopper for me :-( and I   would like to switch to Chrome.   </pre>
