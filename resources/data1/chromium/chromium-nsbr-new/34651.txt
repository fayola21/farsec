<title>Issue 34651 -   chromium -    Need configuration testing for chrome frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to run unit tests on different kinds of OS/IE/[Toolbar BHO]   combinations. The following are necessary:    1. Windows XP SP2 - IE6 Plain  2. Windows XP SP2 - IE6 - Google Toolbar  [McAfee/Norton/Sophos]  3. Windows Vista 32 bit - IE8 - [Google Toolbar  MSN Toolbar etc]  4. Windows Vista 64 bit - IE7 - [Pick toolbars  AV]  5. windows 7 64 bit - IE8 - [Pick toolbars  AV]    The test waterfall should be part of chrome frame waterfall. Ideally  it   should be triggered for each change to chrome/chromeframe. If that's   complicated  having it run in a continuous loop is OK too.   </pre>
