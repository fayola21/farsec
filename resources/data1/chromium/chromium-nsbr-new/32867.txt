<title>Issue 32867 -   chromium -    Button(min max close) highlighting bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Overlay one window slightly lower than the other so that the top right   (minimize maximize close)button on the background window is right on top of   the top right buttons on the foreground window.  2.Place your cursor over any of the background buttons and glide it over to    the buttons on the foreground window(there should be no space between the   top background buttons and the bottom foreground buttons). The top   background buttons will remain highlighted regardless of whether you are   now highlighting (with your cursor)the buttons on the bottom foreground   window.        Highlighting of buttons should only remain if your cursor is over them.      Highlighting remains on the previous window if you move the cursor directly   to another window's buttons.    <b>Please provide
