<title>Issue 36429 -   chromium -    The default setting of minimum font size may make layout of some pages broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Google U2U forum (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/chrome/thread?</a>  tid=48fc45e993c49d58&amp;hl=zh-CN)  some users complained that Google Chrome   does not support font which size is less than 12px  the layout of some   webpages are broken because of this issue.    Chrome uses WebKit and Webkit supports fonts which sizes are less than 12px   in webpage  actually WebKit uses the setting of minimum font size to   control the font layout  it means any font sizes which are less than the   minimum font size will be forced to increase to minimum font size.    By default  chrome sets the minimum font size as 1px for most UI locale    but for some special UI locale like Simp/Trad Chinese  Japanese  Korea and   Thai  Chrome uses 10px/12px as default minimum font size. That is why   Chrome does not display font which size is less than 12px in Chinese UI.    At now  Chrome does not provide UI to let users to change the setting of   minimum font size. (<a title="provide a way to set &quot;minimum font size&quot;"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7417">Bug 7417</a> is for this requirement) So for example  if   you want to see the font which size is less than 12px in Chinese Chrome UI    you have to manually add/modify the &quot;minimum_font_size&quot; property.    I understand the setting of minimum font size is used to make the browser   render the webpages better  but it also may break some pages in some cases.    One idea is Chrome show a infobar to users when finding the font size on   page is less than the setting of minimum font size  ask for users' opinion   to enable/disable/change the setting of minimum font size.   </pre>
