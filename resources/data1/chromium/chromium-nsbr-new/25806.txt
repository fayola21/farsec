<title>Issue 25806 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcut Cmd-[ opens a new tab with previous page  instead of going back in history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.226.0 (30043)  URLs (if applicable) : Any  OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Browse through several pages  so that there is stuff in history  2. Press cmd-[ to go back        Go back to previous history item.      The current page stays the same and a new tab is opened with the previous   page. Subsequent cmd-[ result in more tabs being open  always with the   first previous page. Current page stays the same. This happens only when   the keyboard shortcut is used. Clicking on arrows or selecting the   command from the menu works as expected. Similar behavior can be   observed with Cmd-]. Dev channel Chrome (4.0.223.11) works well.   </pre>
