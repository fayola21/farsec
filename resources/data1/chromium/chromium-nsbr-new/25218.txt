<title>Issue 25218 -   chromium -    Escape keypress should de-focus from all  not just some  text-entry UI. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    Chrome is inconsistent in the interpretation of 'Escape' when in a UI text-  entry field.    The 'find in page' field de-focuses when Escape is pressed (which is nice   and useful).    The 'location / search bar' does not. It just sits there.    I'm not sure where else this is an issue; but for a touch typer  this lack   of agreement is very frustrating. Please add 'Escape' binding to the   location bar. </pre>
