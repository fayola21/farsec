<title>Issue 31438 -   chromium -    Add getListeners() to Event object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>  getListeners()   Most of the time  we add more than one listener and it has a different   behavior.   It would be great to have function to retrieve listener and choose   wich one we would like to remove if there is more than one.   Example: chrome.tabs.onCreated.getListeners()     Thanks </pre>
