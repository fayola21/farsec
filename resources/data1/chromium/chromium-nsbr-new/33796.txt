<title>Issue 33796 -   chromium -    Chrome launching error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I currently run windows 7 ultimate with 2 accounts. One for myself and   another for my Dad.    My account uses english  and my dad's uses chinese. I realised that after I   installed Google Chrome onto my account and set it as the default browser    my Dad could no longer use &quot;links&quot; in other programs (like windows gadgets   for example) that create a popup windows that directs you to another   website.    Its not a security issue... but since I really like Google and love using   Chrome  I just wanted you guys to know =)    Oh and the error was fixed when I installed Google Chrome again on when I   logged in to my Dad's account.    Best Regards   Jack </pre>
