<title>Issue 34966 -   chromium -    Please provide UI to completely disable translate infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev    When opening www.lycos.fr with Google Chrome (English)  the translation   infobar appears. The only disabling options are specific to the language or   the site (right of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZGJKc.png">http://i.imgur.com/ZGJKc.png</a>). Please provide an option   to globally disable this infobox  either in the Options menu or in the   Chrome options dialog.    As a sidenote  why was this implemented in-browser rather than as an   extension? Extensions already have a UI for enabling/disabling them.    Suggest jcampan be added to this since he appears to have been working on   the code   (<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/translate/t">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/translate/t</a>  ranslate_manager.cc?view=log).   </pre>
