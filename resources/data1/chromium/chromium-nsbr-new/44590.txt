<title>Issue 44590 -   chromium -    Webgl on ubuntu only works if I use --in-process-webgl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page):6.0.410.0 (Developer Build 47680)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 10.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 Bit  Window manager: Gnome  URLs (if relevant): <a href="http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson02/index.html">http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson02/index.html</a>  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Crash         1. Visit the example URL with --enable-webgl  2. Page hangs and does nothing      What is the expected result:     using --in-process-webgl --enable-webgl the page loads rapidly and with no  issues.             I've used chrome with only --enable-webgl in the past (a few weeks ago)  with no issues. I can't determine if this is related to an update by Ubuntu  or some other issue.     I also installed the latest nvidia drivers from their website to see if  this was the cause of the issue. Running nvidia driver version: 195.36.24      I'm also porting an app from o3d to webgl and the o3d app works fine but  same issue trying to load the webgl version.        </pre>
