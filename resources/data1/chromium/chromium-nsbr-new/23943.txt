<title>Issue 23943 -   chromium -    [Feature Request][Omnibox] Add a button to change search engine and remain independent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.2 (Developer Build 27944)          A user should be able to switch the search engine in-line without having to   edit the settings or type the keyword for one every single time a search   warrants a different engine. This would require a button element  preferably   beside the &quot;Favourites&quot; one.    Many users do not like to have to type anything besides their search terms   or address  so requiring that they type out a keyword to search with a   different engine is not intuitive in this case.    What this can directly result in is an independent engine for each tab    since Chrome is inherently tab-oriented. In browsers such as Firefox    changing the search engine in one tab changes it globally.    On the other hand  in Opera  it works similar to this feature request.          A user needs to type the keyword of the non-default search engine to search   with it. Such a function should be usable upon application startup  but   without a button or obvious documentation it is not. </pre>
