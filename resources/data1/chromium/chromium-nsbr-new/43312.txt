<title>Issue 43312 -   chromium -    Selecting/Deleting bookmarks is un-intuitive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I watched my wife last night struggle with the new dom bookmark manager trying to delete a   bookmark. The problem stems from the fact that clicking means two different things  and there's no   way to know (without being told by someone who does know) what the difference is.    For instance  clicking anywhere on the title of the bookmark launches the bookmark instead of   selecting it. Clicking the url of the bookmark selects the bookmark  instead of launching it. This in   itself is already backwards and stumped my wife for about 10 minutes.    Next  once you do figure out how to get the row selected  there's no obvious indicator about how to   delete said bookmark. There's no delete button or anything in the UI except the very well-hidden   menus in the page. She finally figured out the delete key worked as well  but she hunted around   looking for something to click for a while. </pre>
