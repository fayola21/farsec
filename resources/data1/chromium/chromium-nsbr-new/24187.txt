<title>Issue 24187 -   chromium -    Multiple webkit_tests failures in Debug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (migrated from http://buganizer/issue?id=1058654    nsylvain on March 07 2008 10:32  (New)  Summary     Multiple webkit_tests failures in Debug  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; WebKit &gt; Layout  Reporter     nsylvain  CC     chrome-bugs  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Notes  These failures are NOT ignored. But I modified the layout tests script  locally on the debug machine to return Success even when there are errors.  Please look at the output of the webkit_tests step to see the failures.

The WebKit code for handling Windows clipboards  seems a bit rickety  and is not tested very well by the layout tests.  (Several other scenarios result in the same failure.)    LayoutTestseditingdeleting5144139-2.html is a failure in our font code.  The problem isn't in the layout test itself  it's in the CSS font-face  declarations at the top of the test. We assume that the number of  characters requested to be filled in a font glyph page is either equal to  the maximum (fixed) size of the page or twice that size. It seems that with  segmented fonts  it's possible to be passed a value less than the maximum  page size which triggers an assert in our GlyphPageTreeNodeWin.cpp. Note  that in Safari  the font is not marked as segmented for some reason.    LayoutTestsfastjsfunction-toString-object-literals.html is caused by a  bug in V8's version of strtod. It dies (calls exit()  in fact) on the value  &quot;1e-500&quot;. Got an email out to find out why.  dsiroker on April 28 2008 17:32  (Assigned)  Notes  Good stuff. For  LayoutTestseditingexecCommandcopy-without-selection.html  I would vote  to DEFER it for post-beta if our current behavior is the same as Safari 3.1  since our goal for beta is to be bug-for-bug compatible with Safari 3.1  jhaas on April 29 2008 10:53  (Assigned)  Notes  LayoutTestsfastcssfont-face-implicit-local-font.html and  LayoutTestsfastcssfont-face-unicode-range.html are caused by the same  font problem as LayoutTestseditingdeleting5144139-2.html. Being tracked  by http://b/issue?id=1007391    The strod problem responsible for  LayoutTestsfastjsfunction-toString-object-literals.html is a bogus  assertion. V8 will be removing it  which should clear up that problem.  eseidel on April 29 2008 14:38  (Assigned)  Notes  AFAICT  all of these failures are covered by other more-specific bugs.  I  suggest we close this one for less noise in Chrome Dashboard.  jhaas on April 30 2008 14:39  (Assigned)  Notes  Many of the failures fixed  all others covered in individual bugs.  jhaas on April 30 2008 14:43  (Fixed / Fixed)  laforge on October 28 2008 12:57  (Verified / Fixed)  Verifier     laforge  Notes  Cleanup operation  batch updating old 'FIXED' issues to 'VERIFIED' that  have not been modified since 9/2/08.
