<title>Issue 38118 -   chromium -    [GPU / Pepper] Support windowless Pepper 3D plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Switch over from GPU plugin model to new GPU process compositor model.  Papper 3D plugins will all be windowless  rendering into an offscreen FBO  shared with the compositor OpenGL context. Need to find a way to create an  offscreen PGL context in the plugin process that shares resources with a  GGL OpenGL context in the renderer process. </pre>
