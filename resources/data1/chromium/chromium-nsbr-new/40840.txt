<title>Issue 40840 -   chromium -    [Linux] Prevent inappropriate drag of location bar location icon. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The location icon at the left of the omnibox acts as a drag source when on a page.  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1594012">http://codereview.chromium.org/1594012</a> disabled clicking it for page-info or dragging when the   omnibox is being edited  because it would not correspond to the actual contents of the omnibox in   that case.  Evan identified a flaw in my gtk implementation:    &gt;this is insufficent to disallow drags. You'll need to use  &gt; gtk_drag_source_set/gtk_drag_source_unset when IsEditingOrEmpty() changes values    I'm nervous about accomplishing this.  I believe that the appropriate place to make this change is in LocationBarViewGtk::UpdateIcon()  which should be able to check IsEditingOrEmpty() and turn on   draggability as appropriate.    Leaving it to Evan to decide the mstone-5-ness. </pre>
