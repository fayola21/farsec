<title>Issue 30063 -   chromium -    DiscWare website does not operate properly when entering track data. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Login to the site.  2.Open a discware CD storage product.  3.Attempt to enter CD track information.      Window opens which allows me to click on track editing once in another   window I can enter track information.  Then &quot;update &amp; close&quot; the window.        When I go to the storage product it's not a standard looking window  just a   page that looks like a mostly blank web page with the necessary &quot;window&quot;   contents in the upper left corner of the page.  When I click on the phrase   to edit/view the track contents - nothing happens.    When attempting to make a screenshot everything worked properly THIS   TIME!  Must be an intermittent problem?    <b>Please provide
