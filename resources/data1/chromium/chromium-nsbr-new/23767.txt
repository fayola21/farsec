<title>Issue 23767 -   chromium -    Download Shelf is too tall; proposed redesign - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.24 (Official Build 27347)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org/">http://downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org/</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK        The download shelf is 44 pixels tall  10% more than the main navigation bar   and nearly twice as tall as Firefox's Download Statusbar extension.  This   is excessive considering Chrome's &quot;less UI  more website&quot; principle  and   the fact that vertical space is increasingly precious in this age of   widescreen and low-res netbooks.      1. See attached comparison/mockup.    The parts of my proposal are:  A) Shelf items as progress bars  B) Stat tooltips  C) Reduced height  enabled by above changes    (If this is too broad for one Issue  A and B can be split off.)    Justification:  A) The Shelf's circular-gauge progress icons seem to be the main reason   it's so tall  but they have no practical advantage over background progress   bars.  If anything  they're harder to read due to being small and   unfamiliar.    B) While the Shelf's current thickness does enable a row of download stats   under the filename  IMO the only stat you really need to see *constantly*   is time-remaining  which can share a line with the filename.  The rest   could be displayed by tooltip  as proposed. </pre>
