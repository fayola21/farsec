<title>Issue 33619 -   chromium -    [Chrome OS - Extensions] Chrome crashes when disable an extension from browser action UI button context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Login to chrome OS  2. Install some extensions which has browser action UI button  3. Right click on the UI button  click &quot;Disable&quot;        Chrome crashes and then relaunches with information like &quot;Google Chrome   didn't shut down correctly...&quot;    I think this could be a release blocker of Chrome OS.       </pre>
