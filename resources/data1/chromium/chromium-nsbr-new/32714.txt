<title>Issue 32714 -   chromium -    Link Doctor page emphasises things confusingly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunkk">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunkk</a>      The error page displayed offers suggestions and emphasises the part of the   URL that has been corrected in bold italics.      As well as suggesting src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk and bolding   &quot;trunk&quot; to indicate that this has been changed  it also offers   src.chromium.org  bolding &quot;org&quot; and src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/    bolding &quot;chrome&quot;.    This is confusing  because the first thing it brings to mind is that a typo   was made typing &quot;org&quot; or &quot;chrome&quot;  and that this suggestion fixes it.    Not sure if this bug belongs here since the page is hosted at   linkhelp.clients.google.com  but Chrome certainly seems to be its main   user... </pre>
