<title>Issue 26122 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame leaks automation proxies on exit. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a DLOG() in ProxyFactory::~ProxyFactory() that gets hit very   frequently on exiting IE.    This happens if a CF active document has been loaded  regardless of whether a   CF page is still present on exit.    Dump available on request.     </pre>
