<title>Issue 42457 -   chromium -    Poor performance when viewing a page with lots of animated GIFs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=571444&amp;page=112">http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=571444&amp;page=112</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Find a website/page that has lots of animated gifs (such as the above URL). Attached is a simple test case that may help.  2. Begin to click through each page  where more animated gifs start to appear.  3. You may also want to ctrl+click so that you can open 5 or more separate pages at the same time  4. You should notice that Chrome begins to make your hard disk grind a lot  and responsiveness of the tabs appears to slow down. If you are trying to   view other websites at this time those tabs may not immediately appear if you click on them.  5. After a short moment Chrome stops accessing the disk and everything returns to normal; all tabs are responsive  including those with the animated   gifs.    As far as I can tell  there is a short moment when the gifs first appear that Chrome is OK while it is still downloading the animation  when the   download of each animation has finished the disk grinds and the browser performance drops  then after a few moments performance is restored and disk   activity stops.      There should not be any intensive disk access while loading pages with lots of animated gifs; and the browser should not lose performance because its   loading pages with several animated gifs.      You should notice that Chrome begins to make your hard disk grind a lot  and responsiveness of the tabs appears to slow down. If you are trying to   view other websites at this time those tabs may not immediately appear if you click on them.    Please see the attached test case that may assist with debugging. Click 'Open another page' several times in the test case so that Chrome is having   to work harder. </pre>
