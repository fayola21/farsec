<title>Issue 37497 -   chromium -    Lots of chrome_frame.diff files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: Unistalled    In C:windowstemp directory I have 17 folders called chrome_xxxx where   xxxx is a number from 1406 to 30340. All of them are from March 1st to   March 4th. Earch folder has a unique file called chrome_patch.diff of   44.355 KB.     I supossed it was related to Google Chrome Frame (wich I'd dissabled in IE   7)  so I uninstalled GCF  but the folders (736 MB) are still there.       </pre>
