<title>Issue 43502 -   chromium -    delete only bookmark from &quot;off the side&quot; menu and menu gets orphaned! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add enough bookmarks so &quot;off the side&quot; menu just barely appears.  Open menu  right click on mark  and Delete.  Expect: chevron button to go away (and menu to go away).  Get instead: menu gets orphaned and stays open forever!    Unlike other bookmark folders  deleting an item in the &quot;off the side&quot; menu can cause the &quot;parent   folder&quot; to go away.   </pre>
