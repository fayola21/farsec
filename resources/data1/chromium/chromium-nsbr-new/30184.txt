<title>Issue 30184 -   chromium -    Extensions &quot;reset&quot; after browsing data is cleared - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Install an extension that requires user information/settings (eg.   Forecastfox Weather  SmoothScroll).  2. Edit a setting in the extension.  3. Clear all browsing data.  4. Restart Chrome.      The settings for the extension are saved.      The extension settings are not saved. The browser treats the extension as   if it was just installed and pops up it's setting page in a new tab (if one   is provided).    It seems that all extension data is removed when browsing data is cleared.   A problem with LocalData Storage?    NOTE: The only exception is LastPass. If you tell LastPass to remember the   username  it is remembered.   </pre>
