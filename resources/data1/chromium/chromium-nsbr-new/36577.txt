<title>Issue 36577 -   chromium -    Exceptions logged from worker context don't appear in the JS console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load a worker script that contains only this line:    setTimeout(function() { gronk; }  100);    Expected result:    &quot;Uncaught ReferenceError: gronk is undefined&quot; written to the JS console    Actual result:    Nothing written to the JS console    This makes it *really* hard to debug worker scripts. This works just fine in   Safari. </pre>
