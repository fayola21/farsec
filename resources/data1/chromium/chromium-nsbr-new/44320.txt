<title>Issue 44320 -   chromium -    Browser memory leak in 6.0.401.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a tab or two on this page [<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-</a>  us/library/bb774982(VS.85).aspx] (other msdn API description pages work   just as well).  2. Look at the browser's private byte count climb for the stars in taskman.              The leak seems to be proportional to the number of aggravating pages that   are open  and is bad enough that eventually my browser process runs out of   VM space within 24 hours. I've clocked the leak at something like 300K/sec   with a few tabs open.  I usually have two browsers running in separate profiles going at the same   time  and they tend to both be afflicted.   </pre>
