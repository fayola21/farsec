<title>Issue 44849 -   chromium -    Chromium opens too many simultaneous connections - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.412.0 (Developer Build 47859)         Firefox 3.x: Works OK               1. Check the number of established connections using netstat  2. Type a URL in Chromium and press ENTER  3. Again check the number of established connections in netstat      1-3 new established connections (like in firefox)      10-26 more connections per URL!!!    URL --------------------------- No. of new connections established  www.google.com/search?q=chromium+issues+too+many+connections -- 10  www.google.com ------------------------------------------------ 12  code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3041 -------------- 14  www.youtube.com ----------------------------------------------- 26    I am behind a university proxy which allows around 8-10 max persistent   connections. Any further connection attempts are blocked. Hence sites like   youtube.com can never load fully in Chromium (loads fine in Firefox because we   can set network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy;8 in about:config). </pre>
