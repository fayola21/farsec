<title>Issue 30100 -   chromium -    Deleting history also deletes extension's localStorage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25      1. Install any extension (which uses localStorage for storing options).  2. Change some extension options and save.  3. Delete browser history via chrome://history.      The extension options shouldn't be deleted.      The extension options (localStorage) will be deleted also.    I think Chrome shouldn't delete any localStorage for pages start with &quot;chrome-extension://&quot;. </pre>
