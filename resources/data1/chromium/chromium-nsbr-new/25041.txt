<title>Issue 25041 -   chromium -    Keyboard key mapping becomes scrambled on Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27  URLs (if applicable) : ALL           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK    This is on Windows XP    After using Chrome for a while  some of my keyboard's keys start inputting   other letters.  No other browser or program does this.  Firefox  IE    Notepad  Windows Explorer  Microsoft Word  etc  all work normally  but not   Chrome.      My keyboard keys should input letters as labelled      When I type a &quot;Z&quot; key  a &quot;Y&quot; appears  and vice versa.  Punctuation also   results in strange characters appearing instead of the labelled key.  Here   are some examples:    1: +  2: ��__  3: ��_��_  4: ��_  ;: ��_��_  &quot;: !    Most of the alphabetical kezs work correctly  apart from z and y.    Restarting Chrome fixes the issue temporarily.   </pre>
