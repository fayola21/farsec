<title>Issue 25408 -   chromium -    Task manager does not support right-clicking to enable/disable columns - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The task manager on windows allows users to enable/disable columns by   right-clicking anywhere within the window.  This is the only way to access   columns that are off by default (such as process ID  cache sizes  etc).  It does   not appear to work on Linux. </pre>
