<title>Issue 39219 -   chromium -    zlib compiled with -O2 produces valgrind errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tracked a number of valgrind errors down to the following: building zlib   with -O2 produces the problem  building with -O0 doesn't.  Note that the   system zlib on Ubuntu is built with -O3 so sometimes the problem manifests   itself as whether we're using the system zlib or not.    I spent a long time looking at this and I *believe* it is not actually a   real error.  It's something to do with a compiler optimization that is   making it look like we're reading off the end of the buffer when we aren't.    But I'd like to confirm it before closing this. </pre>
