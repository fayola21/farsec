<title>Issue 27310 -   chromium -    Split proxy_resolver_mac.h into two files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> proxy_resolver_mac.{cc|h} defines both:      ProxyResolverMac    ProxyConfigServiceMac    To be consistent with the other platforms and files  these should be split   up into separate files:      proxy_resolver_mac.{cc|h}    proxy_config_service_mac.{cc|h}    I didn't split this file when I introduced the ProxyConfigService interface   (because I didn't want to extract the common helpers)  causing this   cleanup task. </pre>
