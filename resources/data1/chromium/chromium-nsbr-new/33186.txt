<title>Issue 33186 -   chromium -    webkit.gyp:pull_in_test_shell is bad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> webkit.gyp:pull_in_test_shell is a problem.  The reason: it creates a circular   relationship between .gyp files.    webkit.gyp:pull_in_test_shell depends on test_shell.gyp.    test_shell.gyp has targets that depend on webkit.gyp.    It doesn't appear that anything actually uses pull_in_test_shell.  At the very   least  it doesn't need to be part of webkit.gyp.  Perhaps we can put it   elsewhere  such as all.gyp?    This circular relationship is causing problems for the Mac build. </pre>
