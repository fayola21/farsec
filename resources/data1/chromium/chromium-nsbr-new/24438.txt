<title>Issue 24438 -   chromium -    Set the ICU default locale to ll_RR even if Chrome supports only ll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This will be more prominent on Linux than on Windows.     Let's say Chrome is launched with     LANGUAGE=ar_EG  chrome     Currently  we map ar_EG to Chrome's locale ar  which is perfectly fine   because we just have 'ar' (rather than many regional variants in Chrome).   However  in the process  we set the ICU locale to ar as well even though   ICU does have ar_EG distinct from ar.     In practice  in most cases  it's immaterial. However  in some cases  it   does make a difference (e.g. thousand separator in some Spanish-speaking   Latin American countries is ' ' while in other countries it's '.' or ' ').   So  es_FOO and es_BAR have to be used when setting the ICU default locale   while both being mapped to es-419 (Chrome's UI language).         </pre>
