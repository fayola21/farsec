<title>Issue 26481 -   chromium -    add support for Date types in JSON schema - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a few places in the extension API where we need to represent   date/time.  So far  we've been representing it as milliseconds since the   epoch in a numeric type  but that requires the caller to translate to/from.    We should be able to handle this automatically for them.  On the C++ side  it   would still be millseconds since the epoch  so we don't actually need to   implement a DateValue object.   </pre>
