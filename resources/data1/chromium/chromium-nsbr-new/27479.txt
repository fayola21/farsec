<title>Issue 27479 -   chromium -    Blank pages will be seen when trying to reload cf:about:version after update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install CF 223.9 from <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">http://www.google.com/chromeframe</a>  2. Launch IE and navigate to cf:about:  3. Install CF 244  4. Focus address bar and hit enter    What is the expected output?   Page shouldn't go blank    What do you see instead?  Blank white page. From this point all CF instances will go blank.    This is happening on Vista with IE8    I'm not sure if this has something to do with <a title="Browser crash @ IPC::MessageWithTuple" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27472"> Issue 27472 </a>. There I see the   crash dialog. But here I see blank pages. </pre>
