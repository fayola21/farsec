<title>Issue 38205 -   chromium -    http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news can't be browsed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested this on Mac and Windows.      1. go to <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news</a>  2. click on one of the lead stories (currently &quot;7 Cat Species Found in 1 Forest&quot;)  3. watch        The article page loads  and then the browser goes back to the main news page.  The fwd arrow   for history is enabled  and clicking on it does more to the story  but you get backed up again.    Pretty much makes it impossible to read the site.    You can even go into history and open the story url directly  it will load and then you'll get walked   back to the history page via nav history. </pre>
