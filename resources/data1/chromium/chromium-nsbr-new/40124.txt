<title>Issue 40124 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame runs in IE in the absence of meta tag or HTTP Header - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 5.0.366.0 (Official Build 43169) unknown    Related URL(s): <a href="http://www.plexus-online.com">http://www.plexus-online.com</a>    I'm a developer at an online manufacturing software company.  As of late  last night ~10:00PM EDT our users who had the ChromeFrame BHO installed  have been unable to use our system  due to ChromeFrame causing security  checks to fail.  We specify neither the META tag  nor the HTTP header to  cause ChromeFrame to run.  This is severely impacting our 30 000 users.    I have verified that this issue happens in Internet Explorer 8  and  Internet Explorer 7.  It may be related to the window name: self.top.name seems to be handled  differently when ChromeFrame is installed. </pre>
