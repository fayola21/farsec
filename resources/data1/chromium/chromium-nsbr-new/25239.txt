<title>Issue 25239 -   chromium -    &quot;Copy text only&quot; context menu action? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have &quot;paste as plain text&quot; but we don't have &quot;copy as plain text&quot; for when   you're copying to paste in programs that don't have multiple ways of pasting.    Perhaps when &quot;Copy&quot; is an available action  we should also have a &quot;Copy text   only&quot; action. </pre>
