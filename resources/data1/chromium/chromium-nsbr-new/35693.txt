<title>Issue 35693 -   chromium -    Popup blocker blocking user-gesture initiated popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lately the popup blocker seems a bit over-zealous  and with the move to the   teeny little icon in the omnibox I am finding myself becoming very frustrated   thinking the site is broken  when in actuality it's Chrome blocking popups   aggressively.    Case and point:    <a href="http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp">http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp</a>    Type in an airport code (SJC) into the search by airport box  hit the arrow.   This is user initiated but the popup gets blocked  and the little icon in the   omnibox is far from sufficiently visible. </pre>
