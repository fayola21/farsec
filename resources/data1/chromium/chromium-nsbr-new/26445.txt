<title>Issue 26445 -   chromium -    PDFs truncated with no option to display in Preview - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Displays in the browser  with a   scrollbar to view more than one page.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Opens Preview to display the PDF      1. Go to <a href="http://www.sfbike.org/download/SFBC_meter_hours.pdf">http://www.sfbike.org/download/SFBC_meter_hours.pdf</a> (for   example).      Ideal behavior would be for the PDF to display in the browser  with the   ability to view all the pages  but also with a relatively obvious way to open   it in Preview.      The PDF displays inside the browser  scaled to fit one page without a   scrollbar. However  only the first page displays  with no scroll bar or way to   get to the second page. There's also no right-click menu or other way to   get it to display in Preview or another PDF viewer. </pre>
