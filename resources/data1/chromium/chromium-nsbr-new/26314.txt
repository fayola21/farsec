<title>Issue 26314 -   chromium -    Crash on Google Groups Search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1.I'm using Windows XP and have 2 Chromium windows open  one with one Tab    and the other  the main one  with a couple of dozen or so open Tabs. In my   main Chromium window  I access this search URL:     <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?">http://groups.google.com/groups?</a>  hl=en&amp;q=Excel%20&quot;range%20name&quot;%20equal%20to%20&quot;sheet%20name&quot;&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-  8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg    ... I selected the second item &quot;Nick's Excel Tip Of The Day - Part 1 |   ExcelExperts.com&quot; with this URL:    <a href="http://excelexperts.com/search/node/There%20isn't%20a%20single%20function%2">http://excelexperts.com/search/node/There%20isn't%20a%20single%20function%2</a>  0to%20return%20the%20sheet%20%20name    ... and Chromium crashes  repeatedly. Only way to stop it is when Chromium   is in the process of Restoring the open Tabs I close the Tab with that last   URL before it has time to load. I tried the URL in FireFox 3.5.4 and it   works there.    What is the expected result? Specified URL should resolve.      What happens instead? Chromium Crash      <b>Please provide
