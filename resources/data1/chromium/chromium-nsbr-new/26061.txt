<title>Issue 26061 -   chromium -    Corp Gmail Doesn't update the message display when searches are attempted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Open corp Gmail  2.  Click on a label  3.  Add a search term  e.g.  label: &lt;labelname&gt; label:unread        A new display of messages.        Pressing Enter  clicking on Search  clicking on another label all display  the little blue message at bottom left Waiting for mail.google.com...   which nearly instantly disappears but the display doesn't change at all.   The same set of messages is displayed  unchanged.    This has been happening  somewhat intermittently  over a number of days   probably more than week.      This morning reloading the page and starting over didn't help.  Stopping  and restarting Chrome actually did seem to help.  When the problem did  occur  Chrome had just been started and this was the first thing attempted.      <b>Please provide
