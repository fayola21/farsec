<title>Issue 36043 -   chromium -    feature request: Clear (some of) browsing data when closing browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Developer Build 38810+0) Ubuntu            Firefox 3.x: OK        It would be nice if we could automatically clear (some) browsing data   when closing the browser windows. For example  delete cookies  clear   history  clear the cache and/or (!) delete saved passwords. If this is   not possible  it would be nice to have at least the option to remove the   cookies on exit.  </pre>
