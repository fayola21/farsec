<title>Issue 27332 -   chromium -    Enhancement: allow invoking any action for downloaded files  not just the default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29903)    You know how right-clicking on a file in Windows Explorer offers several   actions? (Things like open  edit  preview  etc.)    I'd love to be able to invoke all of those actions on downloaded files from   within code. Right now I have to first choose 'Show in folder'.    See attachment </pre>
