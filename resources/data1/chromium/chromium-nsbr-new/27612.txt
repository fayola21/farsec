<title>Issue 27612 -   chromium -    lag while drag-selecting text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : chromium-4.0.227.0-0.1.20091027svn30269.fc11  OS + version : Fedora 11  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bibt  window manager : Metacity (standard gnome setup)            1. Get chrome busy (eg by ctrl-clicking several dig articles)  2. Quickly go to one of the pages that chromium is still loading and try to   select some text on the page by dragging the mouse        The text I dragged over is hilighted          Frequently  the text near the begining of my drag is not hilighted. Seems   chromium realises a little late that I'm dragging  and instead of finding   the location of the start of my drag  it just starts the selection part-way   through my drag.    Note that the text I'm selecting is not moving  and I'm not even sure the   page I'm looking at has to be still loading. Though this does only seem to   happen while chromium is under load. </pre>
