<title>Issue 31820 -   chromium -    chromium linux doesn't respect GTK theme on scrollbar elevator apearance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Chromium	4.0.291.0 (Developer Build 35606) Ubuntu  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.291.0 Safari/532.8    URLs (if applicable) : any where the page is big enough to have scroll bar    Other browsers tested: Firefox      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to a page where the scrollbar is needed  2. Set chromium to use GTK themes (in options-&gt;Personal Stuff-&gt;Apearance)  3. Notice that the scroll elevator color/apearance doesn't match other   windows scrollbar elevators      The scroll elevator color/apearance should match other windows scrollbar   elevators.      It doesn't respect the GTK-theme scrollbar elevator apearance.    Also  when using native apearance (and not gtk-themes) noticed that   chromium/chrome themes don't change the scrollbar elevator color. I don't   know if that isn't configurable  or the ones I tried simply never changed   that. They should though...    PS: this is a problem because the elevator color is too similar to the   scrollbar background  making it difficult to assimilate the relative   position of the page I currently have visible.  Attached is a screenshot. </pre>
