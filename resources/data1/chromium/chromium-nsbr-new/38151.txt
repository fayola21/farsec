<title>Issue 38151 -   chromium -    Tabs don't resize in Win7 150% DPI Display setting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Set DPI to 150% in Control PanelAppearance and PersonalizationDisplay  2. Run Chrome at Full Screen  3. Open large number of tabs      When running in normal resolution (100%) the tabs shorten and you always   see the button for &quot;new tab&quot;.      When running in 150% mode (useful because I'm using HDTV as screen)  the   tabs don't resize properly AND when full screen  I don't see   minimize/maximize/close buttons  because they're hidden behind the   improperly functioning tab.    <b>Please provide
