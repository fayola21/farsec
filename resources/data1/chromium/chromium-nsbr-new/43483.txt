<title>Issue 43483 -   chromium -    New Tab Most Used list too long - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.395.0  URLs (if applicable) : New Tab page  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open a new tab page  2. The Most Used thumbnails force the Recently Closed items off the screen   when using a netbook        In previous versions a text only list of common sites allowed recently   closed to fit on the screen.  In the newest beta this option has been   removed.    I'd like to either be able to choose text mode again or have the thumbnails   drawn slightly smaller to allow recently closed tabs list to appear without   a scrollbar. </pre>
