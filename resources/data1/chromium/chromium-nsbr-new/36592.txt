<title>Issue 36592 -   chromium -    ProcessUpdatesCommand should not be a ModelChangingSyncerCommand - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ModelChangingSyncerCommand is for any command that modifies local data   on SyncNodes.  ProcessUpdatesCommand takes protobuffers and applies   changes to the SERVER_ fields of a sync node  and hence there is no   contention with real model updates from the browser  as these only modify   the local fields.      Need to make this command inherit from SyncerCommand directly and   change the implementation to ExecuteImpl (vs ModelChangingExecuteImpl)    so that it just runs once using shared StatusController state  instead of once   for every ModelSafeWorker in the session. </pre>
