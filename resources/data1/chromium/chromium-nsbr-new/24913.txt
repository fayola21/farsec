<title>Issue 24913 -   chromium -    &quot;Change Proxy settings&quot; preferences item as shortcut to Mac System Preferences-&gt;Network-&gt;Proxies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac Chrome uses OS X's System Network settings for network access. If a   user requires a specific http proxy to be setup for correct web site access    they would need to know to go to System Preferences-&gt;Network to do this.    We should create a preferences item in Mac Chrome as a shortcut to System   Preferences-&gt;Network-&gt;Proxies to assist in this case. </pre>
