<title>Issue 35356 -   chromium -    Cursor flickers while mousing over views::Link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit popuptest.com and open one of the tests.  Click on the popup blocked   icon  and mouse over one of the links in the popup.  As you move your mouse   around  occasionally the cursor will flick to a pointer and then back to the   hand.    Reminds me of <a title="REGRESSION: Cursor flickering over omnibox" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13926"> issue 13926 </a>.  I wonder if there's some spurious OnSetCursor()   code somewhere? </pre>
