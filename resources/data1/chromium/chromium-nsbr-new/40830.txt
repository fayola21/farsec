<title>Issue 40830 -   chromium -    Detect network reachability - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Detect whether or not the network is reachable.  This is necessary so we can   detect whether or not the user is &quot;offline&quot;.    To be more specific  I think we should do a simple check to see whether or   not any interface is up.  This obviously does not cover the case where   you're connected to the LAN  but the router's WAN port is disconnected or   the route is otherwise broken.  I'm not sure we want to do a probe to see if   we can access some website.  Or maybe we can piggyback on the various other   probes we have.  In any case  just detecting whether or not any interface is   up is a good first step. </pre>
