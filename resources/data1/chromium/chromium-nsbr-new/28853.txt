<title>Issue 28853 -   chromium -    Redirect back to a chrome-extension URL does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the URL of Google Data JavaScript Client:   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-javascript-client/">http://code.google.com/p/gdata-javascript-client/</a>    The library (as stated) allows developers to access data from various   Google Services  if the user has a Google account  the library provides a   mechanism to access his/her private data. The authentication process is:  1. The library redirects to a Google website for authentication  2. Google asks the users to grant access  3. Google redirects back to the previous page and allow access to user data    This is a working example of Google Data JavaScript Client (from Google):  http://gdata-javascript-  client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/core/authsubjs/index.html    The problem is  when using this API in an extension page  i.e.:  chrome-extension://[ext-id]/gdata.html  after the user granted access to his/her data  Chrome can not redirect back   to the extension page:  chrome-extension://[ext-id]/gdata.html#2%2F[token-generated-by-google]  it will report a &quot;This webpage is not available.&quot; error as if the page   doesn't exist.    I don't know if this is a security restriction or not  but this effectively   blocked extensions from all Google services.   </pre>
