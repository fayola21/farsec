<title>Issue 39154 -   chromium -    Extension Failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 (Official Build 42060) dev  URLs (if applicable) : Not Applicable  Other browsers tested: Not Applicable      1. Opening Chrome in the Default Profile      Extensions should load and function properly  and appear in the extension page.      Virtually all extension functionality is gone.  The icons have disappeared for   both Browser and Page Actions  they do not load properly on the Extension   management page  and the only functioning property is the mouseover tooltip.    Additional Information:    This problem affects only the default profile of this computer.  All other   profiles are functioning correctly and have full extension capabilities.  This   error occurs regardless of theme.    There's something else that might be relevant; a short time ago (less than a   week) the extensions lost their icons in this profile just like they have in   the screenshots  yet they still functioned.  It's almost like the extension   directory of this profile is eroding  starting with icons and now it's all but   the manifest.  It could be a corrupt profile  but I don't know how to check for   that.     </pre>
