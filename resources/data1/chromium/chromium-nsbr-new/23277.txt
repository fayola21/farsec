<title>Issue 23277 -   chromium -    We need a pre-submit check to prevent people from checking in large binaries to the main repository - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This spawned out of <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/chromium-">http://www.mail-archive.com/chromium-</a>  dev@googlegroups.com/msg08852.html    People keep checking exe's  dll's  and such into the main repo.  These files   then live forever in git and are a pain for even those using SVN.  We should   make it hard to do this by mistake. </pre>
