<title>Issue 24312 -   chromium -    move plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib into the framework - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib currently lives as:      Chromium.app/Contents/Resources/Chromium   Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib    it should live as:      Chromium.app/Contents/Frameworks/Chromium   Framework.framework/Resources/plugin_carbon_interpose.dylib    (well  somewhere within the framework).    The reason is this:  It really is a match for the plugin host code within the   framework  so when we (Mark) properly version the framework to handle   updates while running  we want to always get the matched interpose lib.  If   we leave it over in the helper  then we need to properly version over there   also  which sounds like more work.   </pre>
