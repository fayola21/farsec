<title>Issue 32715 -   chromium -    No Default theme option in theme gallery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's now only &quot;Classic&quot;  which installs a blue title bar (which is very unlike   the default on Mac).    Many users don't know that they can go reset to the default in the   preferences. It's also a bad user experience (go try out a bunch of extensions   in the gallery ... and then have to go to the dialog box to go back to the   default?). </pre>
