<title>Issue 44106 -   chromium -    Provide ability to move the tab bar under the URL bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376)        Firefox 3.6.3: OK           IE 7: OK    Note: There was no option under Template to set this as a feature instead  of a defect report        Chrome should have the ability for the user to choose how they want the  tabs displayed. For myself I use a program called Stickies at work that is  basically just sticky notes on the screen with reminders of what I need to  be working on. I generally keep these at the top of the screen because they  are out of the way of any applications I have running. I am unable to  switch between tabs with Chrome when it is maximized as I cannot see the  tabs because they are above everything else    We should have the ability to choose how we want the tabs to be displayed  and accessed to increase the user experience  </pre>
