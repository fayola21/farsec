<title>Issue 26834 -   chromium -    autoupdate should update disabled extensions as well - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  it just updates the extensions that were successfully loaded.  This   means that developers can't patch broken or blacklisted extensions.  It also   means that if a user keeps an extension disabled most of the time  it may   never autoupdate. </pre>
