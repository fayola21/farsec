<title>Issue 41217 -   chromium -    Dragging an item within a bookmark folder closes the menu as soon as the drag completes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - show the bookmark bar  - create a folder on the bar and fill it with some bookmarks  - click to open folder  - drag one of the bookmarks and drop it in a new place within the same folder    expected:  - bookmark moves to new location  menu remains open so I can see what just happened    actual:  - bookmark moves but menu immediately closes. I have to re-open it to see if it worked or to act   on any other bookmarks. Disorienting  can't see completion of the task I initiated.    Makes doing any kind of rearranging in the menu very difficult since you can only do one at a   time  and if that's the case  what's the point of being able to do this? </pre>
