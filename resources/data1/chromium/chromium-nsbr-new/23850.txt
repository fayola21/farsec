<title>Issue 23850 -   chromium -    Password filling should fill last-used password by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Have several logins for a form  e.g. gmail login.    Visit the page.    Notice it always fills in with one login for some reason  even though you   very seldom use that login.    Password manager should remember the last used login. Note that this isn't   privacy-sensitive information so that when you sign in in incognito mode  we   should persist the last used login in that mode even though we don't offer to   save new logins. </pre>
