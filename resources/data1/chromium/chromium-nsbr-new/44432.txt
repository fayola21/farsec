<title>Issue 44432 -   chromium -    Windows 7 Compatibility Mode does not start Chrome 4.1.249.1064 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376)       Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      On Windows 7    1. Right click Chrome icon or .exe &gt; Properties &gt; Select Compatibility Tab  2. Check on Compatibility Mode for either Win XP SP2 or SP3  3. Apply Settings  4. Open application that launches 'default' (Chrome) web browser (i.e.   Wordpad  Windows Live Messenger  WinWord  etc..)  5. Type in a URL in the application such that it becomes 'clickable' (i.e   'http://www.google.com'  6. Click the URL      Application launches Chrome.exe and loads the webpage      Application was unable to start correctly  and an error message appears   citing error 0xc00000a5 (see screenshot)    Note: Chrome launches sometimes  other times the process just starts and no   browser appears. I cannot reproduce this consistently.  Also  if the application is set to run in compatibility mode for only   Windows XP SP2/SP3  and launches Chrome with compatibility off  the same   error occurs.     </pre>
