<title>Issue 31024 -   chromium -    chrome-extension:// resources do not work with audio and video tags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like this broke again...    As reported in <a title="&lt;audio&gt; tag doesn't work for extension resources" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22152"> bug 22152 </a>:    &quot;The following is my extension  so the bug can be reproduced.     <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj</a>    1. Install the extension  2. Click the Timer icon in the toolbar  3. In the popup  click the custom radio button  type in 1 and click set  4. The timer does not play a sound when the new window pops up.    I can't reproduce the bug  for some reason it works for me. But a lot of my  users say the sound   does not work  even though they've checked the sound on their computers.&quot;    &quot;works:  var music = new Audio('http://xzy.mp3');music.play();    does not work:  var music = new Audio('chrome-extension://xzy.mp3');music.play();&quot; </pre>
