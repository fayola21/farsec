<title>Issue 41761 -   chromium -    Chrome displays AutoFill suggestions nearly in every search box including the one in the History tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;5.0.375.7 dev&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://history/       If you enable AutoFill and typed in your info there  Chrome begins to   suggest them in all search boxes that don't have auto complete feature unlike   the ones in Google  YT or Gmail. I first discovered this in the history   search box but this occurs in every web page including this forum page. </pre>
