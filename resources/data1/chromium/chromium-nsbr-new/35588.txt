<title>Issue 35588 -   chromium -    Set chromium_code = 0 on base.gyp:symbolize and base.gyp:xdg_mime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a TODO in base/base.gypi:          # TODO: these third-party targets should be in a separate .gyp file        # so it can set chromium_code=0 to turn off our aggressive warnings.    Now that <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38658">r38658</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38519">r38519</a> have landed as part of <a title="webkit.gyp:pull_in_test_shell is bad" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33186"> bug 33186 </a>  I can fix this   more directly  by setting chromium_code directly in those targets  without   having to break them out of base.gyp.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/601061">http://codereview.chromium.org/601061</a> </pre>
