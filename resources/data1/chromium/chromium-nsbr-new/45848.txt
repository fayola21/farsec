<title>Issue 45848 -   chromium -    SVGImage Performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Performance: dragging an SVGImage around the screen is slow; it  feels like the browser is re-rendering the image on every frame  when  it could just blit the pixels much more quickly.  See  <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~eparker/maps/svg/map.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~eparker/maps/svg/map.html</a> for a test case  (click the button/title to cycle through different ways of showing an  SVGImage  try dragging each test case to see the performance).  Again   help on filing a bug about this would be appreciated. </pre>
