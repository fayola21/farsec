<title>Issue 44494 -   chromium -    Renderers idle at 1.5% cpu on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 dev  current latest waterfall      1. Open two tabs  one with google.com  one with the NTP  2. Open Activity Monitor (or chrome's task manager)  3. Wait a bit        %cpu used by the renderers should be close to 0. Instead  they hover around 1.5% cpu all the   time. Shark says the time is mostly spent doing IPC.    build-bisect gives these CLs as possible culprits:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?</a>  url=/trunk/src&amp;range=46560:46596 . <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=46567 looks like the most likely culprit to me.    For some reason  I can't reproduce this on windows and linux.    Marking this as Area-Internals for now. </pre>
