<title>Issue 44907 -   chromium -    100% CPU for a minute after waking Mac up from sleep - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a Googler in MTV with a Mac laptop  which whenever woken up from sleep   (the laptop  not the Googler) and logging in  the Chrome UI hangs for a   minute spinning the CPU at 100% and is easily reproducible.    Attached is a sample of the high-CPU process from the OSX activity monitor.    jrg has the contact info. </pre>
