<title>Issue 45777 -   chromium -    autofill dropdown needs right aligned label  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The autofill dropdown currently shows autofill items with the profile label   in parentheses. This makes it look like part of the text to be filled out    not the label of the profile.    As shown in Roma's mocks  profile name text should be right aligned.   http://mocks/roma/design/chrome/autofill/#05-dropdown.png    I couldn't find an existing bug for this. </pre>
