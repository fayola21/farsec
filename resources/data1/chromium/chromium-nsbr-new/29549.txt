<title>Issue 29549 -   chromium -    White background after content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Official version 31639)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to a site that has a non-white background and has little enough   content so a vertical scrollbar is not necessary.  2. Refresh a few times (up to 10 should be enough).      The background of the WHOLE page should always be that of the site (e.g.   non-white in this case).      Sometimes (not always! - about 10% of the tries) the background AFTER the   content is white. That is  until there is content  the background is like   the page specifies (e.g. in CSS)  but after the content  the background is   white. This doesn't always happen  and it's only possible to reproduce on   sites that have little enough content that a vertical scrollbar is not   necessary (obvisouly  since after the content  the page ends). It seems   chrome does hold the real background color for about 1-5px after the end of   content  then it's white (1 in 10 tries).   </pre>
