<title>Issue 41017 -   chromium -    hanging browser_test tests should be listed in the waterfall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now if a browser_test hangs  the waterfall will say &quot;did not complete&quot;  but it doesn't give any   indication of a) what that means and b) what test didn't complete.    At the end of the stdio for such cases we do actually have the list of all tests that failed  including   the did not complete ones. We should expose that on the waterfall.     This caused me a ton of confusion webkit gardening a couple days ago and my cubemate was just   confused by the same. </pre>
