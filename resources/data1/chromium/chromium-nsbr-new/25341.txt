<title>Issue 25341 -   chromium -    After selecting &quot;Always Open Files of this Type&quot; for a particular file type  it cannot be reverted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.223.5     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Download a zip file.  2. Enable &quot;Always open files of this type&quot; from the contextual menu for the file in Download   shelf.  3. Download another zip file.    Expected:  We should see the second zip file in the download shelf and the file should be opened in the   selected or the default download location. If the user wants to disable &quot;Always open files of the   type&quot; he should be able to do so.    Actual:  We don't see the second zip file in the download shelf  but the file is downloaded and opened.  Because of this the user does not have any option to revert his/her decision to &quot;Always open files   of this type&quot;.      This is true for Windows and Mac. And works as expected on Linux (Ubuntu).   </pre>
