<title>Issue 38083 -   chromium -    Rapidly creating webkitNotifications and show() causes notification to clash and not display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a js function as follows    on Mac OSX Leopard.    Google Chrome	5.0.342.3 (Official Build 41132) dev  WebKit	533.2  V8	2.1.2.4  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.3 Safari/533.2  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -  psn_0_11500279    for ( var i= 0; i&lt; 10; i++)  {     var notice = window.webkitNotifications.createNotification(&quot;animage.png&quot;  &quot;test&quot;'  &quot;test&quot;);    notice.show();  }          I would expect to see the notifications and not have them collide  dance  and never get to where   they are supposed to be.    This is really weird as they appear to want to share the same space on the screen and it looks like   they fight each other. </pre>
