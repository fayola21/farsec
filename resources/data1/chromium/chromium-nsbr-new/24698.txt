<title>Issue 24698 -   chromium -    Next/Previous Tab focuses address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Mac)      1. Open two tabs with  say the first with Gmail  2. Focus in the Gmail window. Press 'u' to update the inbox.  2. Tab right w/ ALT-Shift-]  tab left w/ ALT-Shift-[  3. Press 'u'.        Focus is where I left it  pressing 'u' will update my inbox again.        Focus and selection go to the address bar and I override the address with   an 'u'.    This is pretty annoying.   </pre>
