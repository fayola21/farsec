<title>Issue 24571 -   chromium -    Search engine escaping of ' ' should depend on location of %s within URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28160)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s</a>           Safari 4: doesn't support custom search engines    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: dunno           IE 8: dunno      1. Add a custom search engine with a destination of   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s</a>  2. Search for &quot;300 (film)&quot; (sans quotes) using said search engine      I expect to be taken to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300%20(film)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300%20(film)</a>      I am taken to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300+(film)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300+(film)</a>  which Wikipedia   does not interpret as an article title.    In the abstract  it is a subtle question which encoding is more correct. If   the constructed url is considered to be the result of a form submission    spaces should be encoded using +; if the constructed url is just considered   to be a normal url with some parts filled in  spaces should be encoded   using %20.    In the concrete  however  I'll point out that Wikipedia is a prominent web   site that does not treat plus signs as spaces when they appear in its URLs.   </pre>
