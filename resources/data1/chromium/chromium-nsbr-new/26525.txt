<title>Issue 26525 -   chromium -    Reduce file descriptor passing in renderers for seccomp sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;there still seem to be a few other cases in the renderers   where we pass file descriptors or perform other expensive socket operations   without strictly having to do so. I think  when I investigated a while ago    this code could be rewritten to avoid (or cache) some of the expensive   operations. And that would improve performance in the sandbox.&quot; </pre>
