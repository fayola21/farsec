<title>Issue 32161 -   chromium -    If a browser action popup is open and the action button is clicked  the popup should close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1      1. Install an extension with a browser action with a popup  2. Click the browser action button  look at it for a while  3. Click browser action button again        Popup should close        It shows the &quot;open&quot; animation again.    This is both inconsistent with OS expectations and chrome itself (clicking   the bookmark star dismisses the bookmark bubble if it's open). </pre>
