<title>Issue 27403 -   chromium -    If Google Chrome is not registered during the installation  it can not be set as default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=25553">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=25553</a>    This change disables &quot;Make Google Chrome as Default browser&quot; if Chrome   fails to detect if it is default or not. On Vista if user doesn't elevate   during installation Chrome doesnt get registered as a browser on the   system. When we call QueryAppIsDefault() for &quot;Google Chrome&quot; application in   shell_integration_win.cc it results in error. So we disable the button and   user can never set Google Chrome as default. Before the change above the   button used to be enabled and when user clicks on it  Chrome will try to   elevate  register Chrome on the system and then set it as default.    Two possible solutions:  - Always leave the button enabled.  - Add another state which will let user try to set Chrome as default once   on each Chrome start  and if that fails the button will be disabled.   </pre>
