<title>Issue 40851 -   chromium -    IPv6 probe (by default) on Windows is always disabling IPv6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Code in net_util.cc that I landed to detect if IPv6 is plausibly supported on   Windows is not functioning correctly  and is always disabling IPv6 on   Windows.    It appears that the call to WSAIoctl() never returns a list of interfaces   that include an AF_INET6 family (even if the interface is active  up    provisioned with an IPv6 IP address  etc.).  I have not been able to locate a   workaround using that Ioctl function.    I recently spotted the windows method GetAdaptersAddresses().  Hopefully that   can be used as a replacement (on the windows platform ONLY).  The probe   appears fully functional on *other* platform (but uses ifdef's for those   platforms). </pre>
