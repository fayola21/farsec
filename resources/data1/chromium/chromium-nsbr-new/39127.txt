<title>Issue 39127 -   chromium -    Modules Linux (dbg) bot building all targets instead of just those under base/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the Modules Linux (dbg) bot  compile time went up after we switched over   to the make generator.    With scons  running python ../../../scripts/slave/compile.py --solution   base.sln --target Debug --build-dir src/base    runs: hammer -k -j12 --implicit-deps-changed --mode=Debug    Which knows to only look in the base directory.    With make  the same compile.py command runs: make -k -j12 BUILDTYPE=Debug    which builds everything. </pre>
