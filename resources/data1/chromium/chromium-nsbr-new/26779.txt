<title>Issue 26779 -   chromium -    The &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; special folder seems to be editable in the Bookmarks manager but actually it doesn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29916)  OS: Linux      1. Open Chrome  2. Enter the Bookmarks Manager  3. Rename the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder by pressing it once after it is   already highlighted.  4. Return to the Chrome window and see the name is unchanged.    What is the expected result and what happens instead?  If this is indeed a special folder that is not supposed to be renamed  then   the UI should not allow it. If it should be renamed  then currently it   stays in the same name.   </pre>
