<title>Issue 29921 -   chromium -    add simple build step to our buildbot that can parse basic program status from output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add a simple build step to our buildbot that can parse basic program status   from its output.    We have complicated log parsing code in our Buildbot.  Some of this code   does not strictly need to be run on the master  it just happens today   that's where it's run.  Because it's there  each change to it requires a   restart of the master.  Any changes that aren't well-tested can introduce   bugs that lay dormant until some combination of a particular   builder/slave/step/test is hit.  Fixes for those bugs require more changes   to the master and more restarts.    We should add a simple log parser that can read two basic pieces of info:  - status text for step box  - the exit result of the command for evaluateCommand    Then push our logic for parsing program output back into the Chromium src   tree and modify our Buildbot config to run the new step and command.  At   that point  we can change the output of the programs and how we parse the   output without restarting the master.    Some of this work for the perf dashboard requires moving the stats   collection into a system that slaves can remotely update.  I'll file a   separate bug for that. </pre>
