<title>Issue 37832 -   chromium -    tab opens in wrong window  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open 2 chrome windows. Let's call them A and B.  2. Show the bookmarks bar and give window A focus.  3. While window A has focus  cmd+click on a bookmark on window B's   bookmark bar.      I expect a tab to open on window B and for window B to get focus.  Instead  a   new tab opens on window A and window A keeps focus. </pre>
