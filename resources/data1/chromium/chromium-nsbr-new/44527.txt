<title>Issue 44527 -   chromium -    Make URL/Search Suggestion and DNS Pre-Caching Opt-In - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For privacy reasons  the URL/search suggestion and DNS pre-caching features  should be made opt-in.

Having these features enabled by default is inappropriate for a browser  that is now default on a few Linux distributions and being considered for  many others. </pre>
