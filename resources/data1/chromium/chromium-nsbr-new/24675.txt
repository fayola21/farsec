<title>Issue 24675 -   chromium -    Provide a way to view any file as text inside the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=3141">http://llvm.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=3141</a> and   many gmail attachments with non-standard extensions  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Shows in browser by default. But I   think there are other content-types that don't  even if they're actually text.    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57342">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57342</a>  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Visit the above URL  which has a content-type of 'text/x-c++src;   name=&quot;test.cpp&quot;'  hoping just to read the contents.  2. Watch Chrome download it to ~/Downloads/test.cpp  3. Wish you didn't have to show it in the Finder and open it with TextEdit   manually.      In the download bar's popup menu for the download  there should be an   option to view the download as text in either the current tab or a new one.   When there's a link to such a URL  it'd be nice if the right-click menu   would provide this option too  but that might clutter the menu in too many   cases.      I have to take extra steps to view the download as text. </pre>
