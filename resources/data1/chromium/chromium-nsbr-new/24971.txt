<title>Issue 24971 -   chromium -    Theming on Mac doesn't take into account active vs non-active window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you search the codebase for GTMThemeStateActiveWindow vs  GTMThemeStateInactiveWindow (as parameters for GTMTheme)  you'll see that  no one uses GTMThemeStateInactiveWindow (save for one or two places) and  everyone always uses GTMThemeStateActiveWindow.    That's kinda wrong and should be fixed. </pre>
