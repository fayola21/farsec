<title>Issue 26486 -   chromium -    Updating Mac Chrome from within the application results in quarantined files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed that on updates launched from within Chrome  we're setting the   quarantine attribute on files and directories created as a result of the update.    Directories  as well as files that don't change  don't get the quarantine   attribute. </pre>
