<title>Issue 43296 -   chromium -    JavaScript refresh loses login information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 unknown (45376)            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    I have a webpage where users can update their information and also make a   credit card payment. They login with their e-mail address and an unique ID   number. After they have updated their personal information they are   forwarded to a credit card companies service there they can make the   payment. At this time on our own site there is a button which they can   refresh the page after they have made the credit card payment so that   payment information is updated to the website.    The problem is that when clicking on the JavaScript button in Google Chrome   is looses the login information and I need to login again. I have tried   both onclick=&quot;window.location.reload();&quot; and onclick=&quot;history.go(0)&quot; to   make the refresh.    If I press the browsers own refresh button  I get the following dialog box:   &quot;The page that you are looking for used information that you entered.   Returning to that page might cause any action you took to be repeated. Do   you want to continue?&quot;. I don't get that dialog when using the JavaScript   refresh and it looses the login information.      1. Login with your credentials.  2. Go to the separate website.  3. Try to update the first website.      The updated on the first website should be updated.      I get thrown out of the system and I need to login.    I have tried this with Firefox and Internet Explorer. Both are fine.   Internet Explorer displayed the following dialog box:  To display the webpage again  the web browser needs to resend the   information you've previously submitted.    If you were making a purchase  you should click Cancel to avoid a duplicate   transaction. Otherwise click Retry to display the webpage again.   </pre>
