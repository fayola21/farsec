<title>Issue 30977 -   chromium -    Interferes with the videogame &quot;chromium&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all versions  OS + version : GNU/Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): All  window manager : All      1. Attempt to install google chromium  while the videogame chromium is   installed    There is a file collision in the user's home directory.  I don't remember   exactly what the file was called  and it took hours for the browser to   compile on my system  which I'm not about to attempt again.    Next time use a name that isn't already taken Google!  Maybe to a   Google.com search like the rest of us before hand! =)    And Thanks for *finally* making public betas for Linux!! </pre>
