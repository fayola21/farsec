<title>Issue 36591 -   chromium -    NetworkChangeNotifier receives too many notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Jim pointed this out to me.  It looks like all the messages are for the IPv6   address of the interface though.  It's happening once every few minutes    which is probably detrimental to performance since that means we're flushing   chrome's host cache and idle socket pool and what not every few minutes.    We've noticed this on Linux.  I need to check on the other platforms to see   if they have similar issues.  I'm going to go ahead and disable IPv6 address   change notifications on Linux. </pre>
