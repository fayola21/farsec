<title>Issue 30157 -   chromium -    Remove dependency of Sync on {En De}cryptString - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently user_settings.cc uses {En De}cryptString for the service tokens   stored in our sqlite database.  These functions are currently unimplemented   on Mac/Linux (i.e.  the identity function) since there's no easy API like there is   on Windows.    For the short term  according to ifette  it's okay to store the service tokens   unencrypted because they're compartmentalized.  However  eventually we   want to move the functionality of user_settings.cc into web_database.cc (the   only other thing using {En De}cryptString and then make web_database.cc use   Keychain on OS X and the equivalent API on Linux. </pre>
