<title>Issue 40891 -   chromium -    Bookmark list from folder on bookmark bar goes off screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta    OS version               : 10.6.3      1. Have a bookmark bar folder with lots of bookmarks  2. Open it by clicking  3. See the list window go below the bottom of the screen      The list window should stop above the bottom of the screen - preferably ABOVE the OS X icons at   the bottom of the screen too    Clearly the window should auto-scroll when the list is too long to be displayed at once   </pre>
