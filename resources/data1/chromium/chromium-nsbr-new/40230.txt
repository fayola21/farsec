<title>Issue 40230 -   chromium -    Maybe shouldn't show Page Info for clicks on location icon while user is typing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user is typing  clicks on the location icon still trigger the Page   Info dialog.  Not sure if we want to do this.    On the &quot;pro&quot; side  we will still show page actions and the star while the   user is editing  and those all affect the underlying page.  On the &quot;con&quot;   side  the change in iconography seems like the icon clearly has a different   meaning.  However  I don't know what that meaning is.  Do nothing on click?    What happens when I drag it? </pre>
