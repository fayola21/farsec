<title>Issue 40195 -   chromium -    combining diacritics breaks rendering  cursor position or selection highlighting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.365.0 (42923) Ubuntu          Firefox 3.x: broken in different way in 3.6  working previously    This bug has 3 parts:  1. Combining diacritics in text in monospace (with OpenType features)  for   example the one word &quot;mb��_��_́t��__&quot;  is split as if there was a space after the   diacritics.  An OpenType feature in the font used (DejaVu Sans Mono) actually removes   the width of the monospace character since it��_��_��_s a diacritic. The behaviour   is actually correct with characters in the Basic Latin block but not the   others. &quot;��_��_&quot; is correctly rendered but no &quot;��__́&quot;.    2. The cursor is sometimes misplaced in input textarea. If a line has a   Basic Latin characters with a combining diacritic  the text cursor will   seem to be stuck at the front of the line instead of its actual position    For example the line &quot;this is ��_��_́&quot; has the cursor at the right place but   display problem 1.  Whereas &quot;this is ��_��_&quot; will keep the cursor displayed at the front (in   Mediawiki��_��_��_s input textarea for example).    3. The selection highlighting is broken when a line has a Basic Latin   character with a combining diacritic.    The same example as problem 2 apply.  The attached screenshot should have the word &quot;selection&quot; highlighted but   the highlighted text is totally different.   </pre>
