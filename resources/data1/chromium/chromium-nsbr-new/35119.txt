<title>Issue 35119 -   chromium -    Home page does not render correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: u nsure      1. When loading a large page  then opening a new tab at the same time as loading  the home page will not render correctly   (squashed - see screen shot). This happens randomly - opening a further tab may render home pg correctly  but then a   couple of new tabs later will misrender.    May be when loading a page with both Flash and Javascript.    To reproduce  open a site such as www.mirror.co.uk or www.macrumors.com and whilst loading  repeatedly open multiple   tabs and check each one.               </pre>
