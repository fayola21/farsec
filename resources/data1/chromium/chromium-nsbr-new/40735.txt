<title>Issue 40735 -   chromium -    need easy way to get rid of g signal handlers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> currently we manually disconnect from signal handlers we no longer want   during shutdown. This is bad because sometimes we forget to disconnect   signal handlers (this is exacerbated by the fact that most signal handlers   automatically dissolve when widgets get destroyed  so if a widget goes down   during shutdown the we don't have to worry about those signal handlers  so   for the most part programmers don't think about removing signal handlers).     The solution I envisage is analogous to NotificationRegistrar </pre>
