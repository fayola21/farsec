<title>Issue 41420 -   chromium -    Clear cache doesn't clear all javascript until browser is restarted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I'm not exactly sure how to reproduce this bug i'll give it a try.    1. Open your site for testing e.g. &quot;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&quot;  2. Open &quot;clear browsing data&quot; dialog (ctrl+shift+del)  3. Only check &quot;Empty the cache&quot;  4. Click the button that says &quot;Clear browsing data&quot;  5. Makes changes to your javascript files  6. Refresh your page to see if the changes to the javascript have taken   place.      The new javascript should run      Sometimes (very intermittently) the new Javascript from some of the files   doesn't get executed until the browser is closed and restarted. I assume   this is a file locking issue.    <b>Please provide
