<title>Issue 24383 -   chromium -    100% cpu spin in nested event loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You could call this bug also &quot;How to hover your MacBook.&quot;      1. Navigate to javascript:window.alert(&quot;hi&quot;);  2. Renderer process goes to 100% cpu in the nested event loop.    What is the expected output?  Not expected to bring the fan to full-blast and drain my battery.   </pre>
