<title>Issue 32012 -   chromium -    [10.5] Support the Core Animation NPAPI drawing model - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just realized that we don't have a bug for this  so filing for tracking. We need to add support for   the new Core Animation drawing model at some point. Not too many plugins are using it yet  but   more will over time.    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Plugins:CoreAnimationDrawingModel">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Plugins:CoreAnimationDrawingModel</a> </pre>
