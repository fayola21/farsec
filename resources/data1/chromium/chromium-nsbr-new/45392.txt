<title>Issue 45392 -   chromium -    Doesn't use startup-notification correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.55 (Developer Build 47796) Debian  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Debian testing/unstable  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  Window manager: metacity 2.30    When a second instance of chromium-browser is launched via the GNOME  application menu or clicking on a shortcut on the panel  the mouse  cursor continues to play the 'waiting' animation  and the window  switcher continues to say 'Starting Chromium' for quite some time after  the second Chromium window has actually appeared.    I've seen this in other programs that do not properly implement the  startup-notification spec from freedesktop.org. The guide at  &lt;<a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/integration-guide/stable/startup-notification.html.en">http://library.gnome.org/devel/integration-guide/stable/startup-notification.html.en</a>&gt;  states:        Regardless of toolkit  there is one type of application where you      would have to manually handle feedback. Applications with remoting      capabilities (where you tell an existing process to open a new      window instead of starting a new process) cannot use the built-in      mechanism.  The value of the DESKTOP_LAUNCH_ID environment has to be      passed by your application and have it notify the launching system      of your new window.  If you are using GTK+  the documentation for      gdk_notify_startup_complete() has a bit more information.    So it looks like chromium does not properly perform this additional step  when an additional window is opened.      1. Launch chromium  2. Go to Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; Chromium Web Browser      Lack of 'waiting' mouse cursor and 'starting chromium' in task switcher once the   chromium window appears      Observe the 'waiting' mouse cursor and 'starting chromium' in task switcher long after   the second chromium window opens       </pre>
