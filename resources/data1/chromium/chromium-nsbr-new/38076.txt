<title>Issue 38076 -   chromium -    Issue with dragging tab between two windows when on multiple desktops - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create two Chrome windows A and B on different desktops  1 and 2.  2. Place A on the Desktop 1 and maximize  position B so its top border is   at the top of Desktop 2.  3. Switch to Desktop 1.  Create a new tab on A and drag it off to create   window C.  4. Move window C to Desktop 2 (I use the taskbar entry  not sure how on   Gnome).  Ensure you re-select A (otherwise B appears to be &quot;on-top&quot;).  5. Switch to Desktop 2.  Without selecting B  try to drag the tab on C to   attach it to B.  If A is maximized (but on a different desktop)  it will   &quot;jump&quot; over B to try to attach to A.  It's looks as though the dragging   logic doesn't realize A is not currently visible.        Expect not to see any interference from window A.        I can't attach to window B unless I move it far enough away out of A's   &quot;snap zone&quot;.    <b>Please provide
