<title>Issue 37561 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame's host network stack implementation for NPAPI does not get/set cookies correctly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame relies on the host browser supporting the   NPN_GetValue/NPN_SetValue methods for the NPNURLVCookie parameter type.  This is not supported by Firefox 3.5.    We should use the XPCOM cookie service interface to set and get cookies as a  last resort.   </pre>
