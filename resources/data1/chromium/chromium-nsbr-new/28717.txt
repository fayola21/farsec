<title>Issue 28717 -   chromium -    Applying a theme will bounce the Downloads icon in the Dock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.12 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32876">r32876</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Make sure that Chrome's default download location is ~/Downloads and that you have a   Downloads icon in the Dock menu.  2. Open <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>.  3. Apply a theme.    Expected:  A .crx file gets downloaded and installed. Then its removed from the downloaded folder.  All this should happen without the user noticing it i.e without a download shelf popping up or   the bouncing of Downloads icon in the dock.    Actual:  A .crx file gets downloaded and installed and is removed ones the installation is complete. The   downloads icon in the Dock starts bouncing.    Krisr said there is a recent fix to make sure that the downloads icon in the dock jumps for every   download  but shouldn't applying theme be an exception?   </pre>
