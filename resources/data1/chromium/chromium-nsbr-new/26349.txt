<title>Issue 26349 -   chromium -    mouseleave_uitest.cc is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/test/ui/mouseleave_uitest.cc (<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/274010">http://codereview.chromium.org/274010</a>) tests that the proper events are sent when the mouse cursor leaves the   browser content area by telling the OS to move the mouse pointer.  The test   succeeds on Linux.  On Windows  it succeeds when you run it locally  if   you're careful not to move the mouse while the test is running  but it's   flaky on trybot.  As a result  it's currently disabled on Windows.    This test should be enabled on Windows if the trybot can be made stable   enough to run it successfully every time  or if the test can be modified to   be more tolerant of the trybot environment.   </pre>
