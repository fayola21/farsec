<title>Issue 38663 -   chromium -    Highlighting text makes tab unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Sadly... this is probably not going to show up for many people.. but here  is what happens:  1) Goto any website... start highlighting text (left click... drag down  highlighting text in blue) do it around a few times.      That highlighting works as usual.      Okay.. what I see on my machine is the particular tab affected freezes.  Right clicking in the page  scrolling the page  pretty much anything in the  viewport is frozen. Oddly... resizing the page does re-render the text..  however.. the text stays highlighted and the page still does not respond.  The back button and any menus outside of the page do continue to work. I  opened up the task manager and cpu was at zero and memory was in line with  what I would not consider a problem and less than many other working pages  I have open. The odd thing is I tried to highlight text in the chrome task  manager and then it froze with the same symptoms.    <b>Please provide
