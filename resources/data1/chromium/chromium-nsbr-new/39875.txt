<title>Issue 39875 -   chromium -    127.0.0.1 can't be loaded with net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	5.0.308.0 (Developer Build 37385)    Running on Gentoo/Linux amd64  using www-client/chromium-  bin-5.0.308.0_p37385 package.    URLs (if applicable) : http://127.0.0.1:8000/         Opera 10: OK    Firefox 3.x: not tested      1. Bring down all network interfaces except loopback.  2. Open a 127.0.0.1 address at the Chromium/Chrome.      The page should open (since I'm running a local development server at that   port).      Error 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED): The server could not be found.      Extra (detailed) information:  I was accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/ at someplace else  with Internet   connection. It worked very well.    Some time later  I went with my laptop to a room without Wi-Fi and without   any other network connection. The only interface that was up and had an IP   was the loopback. After pressing refresh or clicking on any link  I got   that error message.    I'm attaching a screenshot  and the output of some commands (like   ifconfig  route -n...). The file /etc/resolv.conf was empty. </pre>
