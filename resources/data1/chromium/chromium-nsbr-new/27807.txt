<title>Issue 27807 -   chromium -    [feature] Implement icon url scheme to show icons for file extentions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URLs (if applicable) : moz-icon://.jpg        Firefox 3.x: OK    This is a feature request.    Mozilla Firefox has a specific url scheme to show file icons for specific   file types (based on extension) so they can be used to display system-based   file icons in local directory listings.    If this could be implanted in chromium  it can make a step forward to   providing a &quot;friendly&quot; file:/// view.    Not sure if it helps but Firefox's source code for their method is at   <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8.0/source/modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/ns">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8.0/source/modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/ns</a>  IconURI.cpp   </pre>
