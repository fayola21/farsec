<title>Issue 31531 -   chromium -    SDCH content encoding needs a server generated test suite - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SDCH decompression currently tries to handle a pile of proxy-generated   corruptions.  These include damage to the dictionary  damage to the   content-encoding header  damage to the mime-time header  damage to the   content  etc.  In each case  the effort is to use meta-refresh to get a   clean source of content  and/or blacklist the site (temporarily or   permanently) to avoid recurring problems.    Example: Server sends a nice sdch gzip encoded result.  Proxy discards the   content encoding line  re-gzips the content (a second time!)  claims the   content is now gzipped.    Example2: Server sends a nice sdch gzip encoded result.  Proxy performs a   deflate operation  and adds a second content-encoding line.    Example3: Server sends nice sdch gzip encoded result.  Proxy strips   advertising content from the stream  but does not change the content-  encoding header.    Example4: Server sends nice sdch gzip encoded result.  Proxy strips the   content-encoding header line complely  or partially (leaving only sdch  or   only gzip  or nothing!).    A general search for SDCH bugs should give a list of historically   problematic scenarios.  The hard thing about testing is that there is   always a delay between the first contact with a server  and the acquisition   of a dictionary (on a background channel).  In addition  the error recovery    has global (sometimes permanent) impact on the browser  and hence separate   runs of the browser may be needed.   </pre>
