<title>Issue 25211 -   chromium -    Add presubmit check for svn:ignore when a DEPS is added - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a DEPS file is modified  a new subdirectory is probably fetched in. We   want to make sure the svn:ignore (and .gitignore) are updated accordingly. So   look at svn status/git status output and make sure there's no new directories   that show up.    Could also look at .vcproj  .rules  .sln  .mk  .scons  SConstruct  .xcodeproj   until <a title="Move try server project files out of src/ and into the output directory"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25210">issue 25210</a> is resolved. </pre>
