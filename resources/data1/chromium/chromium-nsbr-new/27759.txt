<title>Issue 27759 -   chromium -    Experimental History API should include getMostVisited(int n) function. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example:    chrome.experimental.history.getMostVisited(8);    Should return an array of the 8 sites which appear in the NTP  in the same   order (including pinned tabs).    Note: Obviously  when the history API is finalized  it should be:    chrome.history.getMostVisited(8); </pre>
