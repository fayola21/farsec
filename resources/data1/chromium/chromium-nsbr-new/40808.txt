<title>Issue 40808 -   chromium -    printed document use US-Letter size (?) instead of A4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Build de d��_��_veloppement 43360)  URLs (if applicable) : any  Other browsers tested: not relevant      1. print any document you wish (at least 2 pages)  2. look at the bottom margin of at least 4 cm on an A4 paper      the bottom margin is the same as the top margin      there is a huge bottom margin    My guess: chromium use by default a US-Letter paper size even though A4 is   the default for my locale. even though A4 is the default in cups.    I use linux and cups 1.4.3 </pre>
