<title>Issue 42788 -   chromium -    It may be possible to leak transport DIB shared memory sections in the browser if the renderer or plugin process that requests them crashes or gets stupid - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because of the sandbox  on the Mac  transport DIBs are allocated in the  browser by RenderWidgetHelper::AllocTransportDIB on receipt of a  ViewHostMsg_AllocTransportDIB sync message  and given to the renderer or  plugin process that requires the DIB. They��_��_��_re supposed to be freed by  RenderWidgetHelper::FreeTransportDIB on receipt of a  ViewHostMsg_FreeTransportDIB async message. It��_��_��_s the renderer or plugin  process��_��_��_ responsibility to send this to the browser process when done with  the DIB. If a renderer or plugin process crashes  hangs  or does something  else stupid  it��_��_��_s possible that the DIB will never be freed in the browser.  This is a shared memory leak and an FD leak in the browser. </pre>
