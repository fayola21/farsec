<title>Issue 37321 -   chromium -    Move chrome.metrics into experimental - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We already have a special class of extension APIs that don't get exposed to   most normal extensions -- chrome.experimental.*. Doing this correctly is a   bit fidgety  so it would be better to have only one class of these.    So instead of having a special flag to enable the metrics API  I think we   should put it in experimental  and just use the existing --enable-  experimental-apis flag. </pre>
