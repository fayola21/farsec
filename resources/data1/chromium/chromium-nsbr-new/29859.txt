<title>Issue 29859 -   chromium -    Dismissing the download shelf isn't elegant - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download a file  observe the download shelf opening.  2. Try to close the shelf.        The only way to close the download shelf at the moment is to mouse over to the close button.    Ideally there should be a keyboard shortcut or other option in place to dismiss the shelf without hitting   a small target with the mouse. </pre>
