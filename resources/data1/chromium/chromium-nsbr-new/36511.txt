<title>Issue 36511 -   chromium -    Don't busy wait the audio hardware when not playing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From AudioRendererBase:  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/media/filters/audio_renderer">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/media/filters/audio_renderer</a>  _base.cc    &quot;To keep the audio hardware busy we write at most 8k of zeros.  This gets   around the tricky situation of pausing and resuming the audio IPC layer in   Chrome.  Ideally  we should return zero and then the subclass can restart   the conversation.&quot;    We need to revisit our audio IPC layer to add fast paths for pausing and   reusing the audio hardware.  The downside of the current approach is we can   continue to consume CPU% when we don't really need to. </pre>
