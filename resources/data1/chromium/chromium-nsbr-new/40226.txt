<title>Issue 40226 -   chromium -    Pinned tab reopening behaviour makes no sense - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2 dev      1. Open a couple of tabs  2. Pin one  3. Exit Chrome  4. Start Chrome  5. Decide to reopen the previously-closed window    When I start Chrome I expect to see a new tab page  or at least links   upfront to reopen the previously-closed window. Instead  Chrome reopens the   previously pinned tabs and only those tabs. If I then open a new tab and   reopen the window from there  I now have a window with all my previously   open tabs  including the pinned ones  and another window with just the   pinned ones.    A sensible approach to functionality might involve:  - Not reopening pinned tabs on startup  or  - Reopening pinned tabs along side a new tab tab on startup    - Closing the reopened pinned tabs when reopening a window the same as when   there are no pinned tabs and only a new tab page  or  - Reopening windows by adding reopened  un-pinned tabs to the current   window which already contains the pinned ones    but the current functionality is illogical and inconvenient. </pre>
