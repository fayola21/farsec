<title>Issue 44300 -   chromium -    Facebook bug after CCleaner with Chrome opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (45376)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.facebook.com">http://www.facebook.com</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK    IE 8: OK          I started CCleaner (in &quot;Cleaner&quot; &quot;Windows&quot; tab I had only checked  &quot;Temporary Internet Files&quot;  &quot;Recent Documents&quot;  &quot;Empty Recycle Bin&quot;   &quot;Temporary Files&quot;  &quot;Old Prefetch Data&quot;  &quot;Custom Files and Folders&quot;. In  &quot;Cleaner&quot; &quot;Applications&quot; tab I had only &quot;Internet Cache&quot; checked in &quot;Google  Chrome&quot; and in &quot;Firefox/Mozilla&quot;. I didn't made any &quot;Registry&quot; fixes).  During the cleaning I forgot to close Google Chrome (opened in my Facebook  page). Now Facebook has a bug (e.g. &quot;chat&quot;  &quot;lists of my friends&quot;  &quot;write a  message to a friend&quot; etc etc  don't work at all). If I enter in Facebook  with Firefox all is ok. I tried a System Restore to a previous recovery  point but not solved.  My Chrome version is 4.1.249.1064 (45376)  My Operating System is Windows XP home  No extensions installed     </pre>
