<title>Issue 30976 -   chromium -    wrong cursor movement when &quot;jumping words&quot; with Ctrl + arrows in RTL message body (Gmail) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make sure your gmail account has the following settings on: Gmail display language = English(US). Right-to-left editing   support = On.  2. Go to your gmail  compose an email  3. move to body section  switch to right-to-left (*not* right alignment - don't touch that button). Switch your keyboard   layout to hebrew (not mandatory - you can stay in english as well)  4. type a few words  space delimited (regular words...). Now  when you've finished typing the final word and cursor is   (naturally) at end of line  press CTRL + right on the keyboard.       - you should jump one word to the right  meaning one word backward.      - the cursor doesn't move. instead  it stays at end of line. If you press CTRL + left  you get the expected results  but   that's in contradiction to the expected results which is uniform in all other browsers.     <b>Please provide
