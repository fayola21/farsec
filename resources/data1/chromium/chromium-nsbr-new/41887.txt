<title>Issue 41887 -   chromium -    gcc 4.5 breaks searching in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.378 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44493">r44493</a>  5.0.380 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44871">r44871</a> (tested both)  Is this the most recent version: pretty much  OS + version: Linux 2.6.33.2  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: awesome (under X11)            1. go to the omnibox  2. enter something that's not a URL  3. hit enter        a search for the test that one entered should start        Nothing. Adding a ? in the beginning or choosing the &quot;Google search&quot; in the   menu that drops down doesn't help either.    This only happens with gcc 4.5  not with gcc 4.4.3 </pre>
