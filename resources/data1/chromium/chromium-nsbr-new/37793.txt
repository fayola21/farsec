<title>Issue 37793 -   chromium -    Chrome needs an option to customize browsing history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.342.2 dev    Currently  Chrome saves your browsing history  download history and form   history with no way of disabling them.    In Firefox (which I'm currently using) you can disable all three forms of   history that the browser usually collects. This rather simple &quot;feature&quot;   would be awesome to have in Chrome also.    It could look like this in the 'Under the Hood' tab:    History    You can choose below what types of history you wan't Google Chrome to   collect.
