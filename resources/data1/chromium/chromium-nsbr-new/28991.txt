<title>Issue 28991 -   chromium -    Suggestion: Right-Click Bookmark Folder &quot;Sort By Name&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be helpful to be able to sort a bookmark folder's contents by   right-clicking it and selecting &quot;Sort by Name&quot;  e.g. after adding a new   bookmark. Currently  I have to use the Bookmark Manager to achieve this    perhaps it could be added to the context menu?     Chrome Version       : 4.0.246.0 (Ubuntu build 31785)  URLs (if applicable) : None           Safari 4: Unknown    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Right-click a folder on the Bookmarks Bar  2. Look at the context menu that appears  3. Note that it lacks a &quot;Sort by Name&quot; option    (I hope you do not regard the above as overly-facetious ^_^)        That a &quot;Sort by Name&quot; option appears in the context menu. </pre>
