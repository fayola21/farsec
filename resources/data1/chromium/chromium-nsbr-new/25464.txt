<title>Issue 25464 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] In Win7 IE8 context menu item &quot;About Chrome Frame&quot; should be opened in a new tab instead of new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. In Win7 launch IE8 and access cf:<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  2. Right click on page and choose &quot;About Chrome Frame&quot;        The cf:about:version is opened in a new window  but it would be better to  open it in a new tab of the original window  just like what XP IE8 does.   </pre>
