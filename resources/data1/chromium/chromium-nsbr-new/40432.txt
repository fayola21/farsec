<title>Issue 40432 -   chromium -    Show &quot;Help&quot; item on extension pop-up menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Extension API enhancement request:    Add an optional &quot;Help&quot; menu item on the extension pop-up menu (under   &quot;Options&quot;  &quot;Disable&quot;  &quot;Uninstall&quot;. The extension author could optionally   define a URL in the manifest that points to a help page (provided with the   extension or an external site) when the &quot;Help&quot; menu item is selected.     This would improve the user experience because the user would have a uniform   way of accessing help for each extension. </pre>
