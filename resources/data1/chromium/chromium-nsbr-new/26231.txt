<title>Issue 26231 -   chromium -    FindInPageTest.FocusRestore crashing consistently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See log:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Interactive%20Tests%2">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Interactive%20Tests%2</a>  0(dbg)/builds/16800/steps/interactive_ui_tests/logs/stdio    It's crashing consistently (although the test log output doesn't always flush   the buffer to show it getting quite to that test). Unfortunately the bot was   down for many hours  so it's not immediately obvious when it started. </pre>
