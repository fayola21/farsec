<title>Issue 37415 -   chromium -    move perf tests (dromaeo  v8 benchmark  sunspider  page cycler) to perf_tests.exe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of our perf tests  like the page cycler  end up in their own exe file.    Other perf tests  like dromaeo/v8 benchmark/sunspider  end up in   ui_tests.exe.  This requires us to add special flags so that anyone running   ui_tests.exe with no filter or with *.* won't also run these perf tests.    We should move the perf tests to their own executable so we can cleanup these   extra args and reduce the size of ui_tests.exe. </pre>
