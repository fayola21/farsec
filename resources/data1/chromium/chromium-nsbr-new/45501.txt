<title>Issue 45501 -   chromium -    Text copied in Incognito mode can still be pasted in new session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps to reproduce:  1. Copy text in an incognito session.  2. Close the incognito session.  3. Open a new Incognito or Non-Incognito session and right-click to open the context   menu; the option to paste is still available.    If I copy a url or any text in Incognito mode  it should not be available to paste in a   new session to protect sensitive information and privacy. Following these same steps in a   Firefox in-private session does not remember the copied text in a new in-private session. I don't know if the copied text is available to paste in a new non-incognito session in   Firefox (most likely not)  but the option to paste is not available in a new in-private   session in Firefox.    Maybe copied text should not be remembered in any new session  but it certainly should   not be remembered if it was from a Incognito or in-private session. Once again  this only   reproduces in Google Chrome  Firefox does not remember the text.   </pre>
