<title>Issue 24317 -   chromium -    In Google Spreadsheets the scrollbar is forgotten or not reset when switching between sheets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to docs.google.com  2. click &quot;new spreadsheet&quot;  3. go to cell A60 and add a value (e.g. &quot;60&quot;)  4. make sure scroll bar has moved so that cell A1 is not visible  5. click &quot;add sheet&quot; (button in bottom left)  6. go back to 1st sheet by clicking &quot;Sheet1&quot; (link in bottom left) - note   how cell A1 is visible and scrollbar has been reset back to the starting   position    I expect the scrollbar position to be maintained.  In FF 3.5 it works right.  In a large sheet with lots of back and forth this is of course annoying.    thx    Dave (dspencer@google.com)                  <b>Please provide
