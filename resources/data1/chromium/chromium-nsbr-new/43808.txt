<title>Issue 43808 -   chromium -    Developer Tools and JavaScript Console panes can get &quot;forever lost&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Choose View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools or View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console  2. Place cursor above the Developer pane and resize the pane to 0 (drag towards bottom of   window) so the window is not seen.        Set a min height for the pane.         The pane appears to be gone forever. I thought I had lost the window since I resized it too small   and quit. When I launched by browser the next day  I thought a pref was corrupted  and spent a   few weeks trying to solve it before JRG helped me triage the issue.      <b>Please provide
