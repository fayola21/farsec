<title>Issue 35228 -   chromium -    Reproducible renderer crash when disabling javascript on youtube - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open youtube.com  2. Open content settings  javascript -&gt; disable all javascript    This immediately crashes the renderer.    That's with 5.0.323.0 (38563) on windows. I don't know if it happens with   249 as well  but it's likely.

Looks like there's no label for &quot;content settings&quot; yet.    I'm tentatively setting this to ReleaseBlock:Beta  to make sure triage sees   it. </pre>
