<title>Issue 43149 -   chromium -    It ain��_��_��_t easy being green: can type green text into the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is like <a title="Can get grey search text in the omnibox" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42794"> bug 42794 </a>  except green instead of grey or gray.    Steps!    0. Have a cleanish profile. (Or not. But a cleanish profile makes it a little easier to reproduce.)  1. Go to some https site  like Gmail. The URL bar will show something like   <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#">https://mail.google.com/mail/#</a>.  2. Select all of the URL starting at the s  excluding the leading http. For example  select   s://mail.google.com/mail/#.  3. Type the letter z. (This is because you��_��_��_re not likely to have any stored sites or search terms   beginning with httpz). Then  keep typing more letters. You��_��_��_ll wind up with something like   httpzyxwv.    Observe: Everything is green.    Except: It ought to all be black.    I��_��_��_m seeing this in 5.0.375.29. </pre>
