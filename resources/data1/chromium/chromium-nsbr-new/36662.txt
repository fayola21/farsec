<title>Issue 36662 -   chromium -    Have official build setting be a target along side debug and release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of using environment variables during the GYP run  it should be new   configuration targets in the gyp common.gypi target.    Since it'll break everything  I recommend doing this in two phases:  - Modify common.gypi to add this new target and modify compile.py to use it.  - A few months later  modify buildbot to not hack the update step with   environment variables. </pre>
