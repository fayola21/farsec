<title>Issue 40719 -   chromium -    Downloading .docx file changes extension to .zip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.danconnor.com/temp/test2.docx">http://www.danconnor.com/temp/test2.docx</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Download .docx file on OSX platform      File is downloaded and saved as a .docx file.      File is downloaded and extracted as a .zip file (which it is  indeed    internally)  making it impossible to open with MS Word without renaming it   back to a .docx file    This seems to only happen on the OSX platform. </pre>
