<title>Issue 39916 -   chromium -    Need to port Infobar creation to Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The extension API chrome.experimental.infobars triggers a NOTIMPLEMENTED in   ExtensionInfoBarDelegate::CreateInfoBar() when run on non TOOLKIT_VIEWS   build.    We've decided the API should be Windows only for now  but at some point need   to revisit that. </pre>
