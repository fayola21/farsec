<title>Issue 36661 -   chromium -    Ctrl-1 gets queued while Ctrl-tab doesn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a slow javascript site in tab N.  2. Desire to switch to tab 1. To do so  hit ctrl-1 (or alt-1 on some   platforms)  3. Wait while javascript site decides if it wants to use that keystroke.  4. Hit ctrl-tab instead to move to the next tab  and then hit ctrl-1    moving you to tab 1.  5. Be done with tab 1  and want to move to tab-2 (e.g.). Hit ctrl-2  moving   you to tab 2.  6. Javascript site decides it doesn't want to use ctrl-1  so the renderer   sends it on  and you get moved to tab 1  when you were working in tab 2.      You don't get moved to tab 1 when you are working in another tab.        You do get moved at a time that you can't guess.    <b>Please provide
