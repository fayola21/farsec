<title>Issue 44901 -   chromium -    ProcessMasterPreferences is noimpl on the mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This causes a line of output in a lot of tests (slowing things down).  Not sure if it maps or what  but   FirstRun::ProcessMasterPreferences is empty on mac (chrome/browser/first_run.cc)  but there is   code in chrome/browser/first_run_win.cc and chrome/browser/first_run_gtk.cc </pre>
