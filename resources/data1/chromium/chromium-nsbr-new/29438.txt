<title>Issue 29438 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Ctrl+S doesn't save in Docs anymore  but instead goes to Chrome's save as dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (James: assigning to you since you last touched this code)    I'm on 223.16  and now ctrl+s doesn't go to Docs anymore to save the   document.  Instead  Chrome grabs that accelerator.    On trunk (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33341">r33341</a>)  this works fine though  so I'm wondering if there's a   regression on one of the branches. </pre>
