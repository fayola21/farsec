<title>Issue 34266 -   chromium -    RenderWidgetHostView doesn't know when its window has been minimized or hidden on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a tab is moved to the background    RenderWidgetHostView::SetHidden is called (and when it is shown again    DidBecomeSelected). On Windows  the same call is made for window   minimization. Ideally  we should do it for both minimizing windows and for   hiding the application.    I thought this would be easy to wire up in BrowserWindowController    listening for the relevant notifications  but it turns out to be very messy   because:  a) drawRect: can be called *after* we are told that we are   minimized/hidden  b) there is no &quot;will be&quot; notification for de-minimizing  so drawRect: gets   called before we know we are visibile again  and there is (sensibly enough) an assert if you attempt to draw while the   RWHV believes itself hidden. If we instead actually hide the NSView  we get   nasty drawing artifacts for window paints that happen while it is hidden.    It looks like we can solve the post-hide draws by telling the RWHV it's   hidden on a slight delay (although I didn't test extensively)  but it's not   clear what to do about showing again. We might need to do something   tricky like snapshot the view and swap that in while the real view is hidden.    The most costly effect of not calling this that I'm aware of is plugins   continuing to paint; given that I'm going to hack plugins to hide specially    and when this bug is fixed the hack can come back out. </pre>
