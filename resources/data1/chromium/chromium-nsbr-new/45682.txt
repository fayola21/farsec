<title>Issue 45682 -   chromium -    Dragging into an ImageMap from above the tab content does not change the cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) create an image with an image map that lies right at the top of the screen. For example:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body style=&quot;margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/srpr/logo1w.png">http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/srpr/logo1w.png</a>&quot; usemap=&quot;#logomap&quot;   /&gt;    &lt;map name=&quot;logomap&quot;&gt;      &lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; coords=&quot;0 0 200 200&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://wwww.google.com">http://wwww.google.com</a>&quot;&gt;    &lt;/map&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2) Move the mouse cursor over the left side of the image ('G' in the Google image in the example   above) - it turns into a &quot;chubby hand&quot; cursor  indicating a clickable item.    3) Now  move the mouse outside the clickable area so it turns back into a pointer cursor. Move   the mouse up into the tab chrome above the clickable area.    4) Drag the mouse down over the clickable area of the image        Expected: The mouse cursor changes to the chubby hand indicating a link element.    Actual: The mouse cursor does not change - it remains a pointer. A similar thing happens if you   move the mouse *out* of the top of the clickable area - it stays as a chubby hand instead of   reverting to a regular mouse pointer. Its as if the proper system pointer events aren't happening   when we move between the tab chrome and the content area.    As far as I can tell  this only happens in Mac Chrome (does not happen in Windows  and does not   happen in Safari 4)   </pre>
