<title>Issue 33669 -   chromium -    Regression in text field autofill security - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Seems to be a dev channel regression. I noticed it recently; it's pretty   blatant.    I'm on Linux 4.0.302.2  but this may have affected earlier versions too.    To reproduce:  - Go to <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a> whilst not logged in.  - (You need to have previously logged in since you last cleared your   cache).  - Type the first letter of your login name.  - Note how it autocompletes immediately.  - I have verified that this autocompleted value is immediately available to   evil Javascript using HTMLInputElement.value;  - Also  if the mouse is hovered over other autocomplete suggestions  these   values seem to immediately be used to populate the input field.    It didn't used to behave this way. We used to require the user to click on   an autocomplete suggestion before it were leaked to the evil page.    I also worry there may be a way to cause autocomplete without any user   interaction at all.   </pre>
