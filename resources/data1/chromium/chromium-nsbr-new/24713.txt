<title>Issue 24713 -   chromium -    app/breakpad_mac_stubs.mm test dependencies keep biting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For good reasons  we don't link Breakpad into anything except for  production builds.  Periodically we break the build because  app/breakpad_mac_stubs.mm isn't being linked into some of the waterfall's  tests  though the try servers do just fine.    The &quot;solution&quot; has been to sprinkle the dependency around in chrome.gyp.  A  better solution would be to find the right combination of &quot;test&quot; and  &quot;common&quot; to get it into the right places. </pre>
