<title>Issue 35809 -   chromium -    Notification that an extension has been updated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request: When an extension is updated  either automatically or   manually  there should be some sort of notification.  The notification could be the same as the current window notification when   an extension is installed  or something within the extensions page that   would show multiple updates.    This would alert the user to possible changes in the extension that they   should be made aware of and that their preferences may have been changed    or that additional functionality has been added.    Currently there is no notification of updates to extensions  this can only   be done by monitoring version numbers which can be tedious. Extensions that   are actively maintained are only updated every week or so (if that) and I   do not believe this would flood the user with an unwanted number of   notifications.     </pre>
