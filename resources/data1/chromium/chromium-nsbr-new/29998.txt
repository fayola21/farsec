<title>Issue 29998 -   chromium -    Can create duplicate shared workers when process limit is hit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create &gt; 16 shared workers in a single tab. 17th will be queued.  2. Have another tab create the shared worker that was queued in #1  3. Close a worker in the first tab  so the queued worker gets started.    Result: Two shared workers with the same name/origin exist in the system.    We need to change WorkerProcessDestroyed() to look for an instance of the worker before firing off   a new one.   </pre>
