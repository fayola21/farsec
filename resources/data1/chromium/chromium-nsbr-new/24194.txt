<title>Issue 24194 -   chromium -    Cache function arguments object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ( Migrated from http://buganizer/941049 )    kasperl on December 03 2007 06:37  (Assigned)  Summary     Cache function arguments object  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; V8 Engine  Reporter     kasperl  Assignee     kasperl  CC     chrome-bugs  v8-dev  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Notes  We should probably stop creating a new arguments object for each access to  the function arguments from outside the function. The current behavior  causes a layout test failure:      fast/js/kde/function_arguments.html  gri on January 04 2008 16:43  (Assigned)  Notes  As pointed out by S��_��_ren Gjesse  a solution for this may relate to bug 900066.  kasperl on January 24 2008 16:24  (Assigned)  Notes  It should now be possible to cache the arguments object in the arguments  adaptor frame  so we don't get a new copy each and every time. I'll look  into this once the arguments adaptor frame code is more stable.   </pre>
