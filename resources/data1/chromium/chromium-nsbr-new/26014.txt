<title>Issue 26014 -   chromium -    Don't show the throbber when an HTTP auth dialog is up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Forked from <a title="HTTP password prompt is not clearly visible (popup has no borders)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25639"> bug 25639 </a>.    &quot;Sometimes I load this webpage and switch to another tab  and if I look at   the tabs it seems as it is still loading because of the loading icon  but it   actually isn't and I can't know that until I switch to the tab.&quot;    Seems reasonable to me. </pre>
