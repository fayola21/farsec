<title>Issue 42692 -   chromium -    Browser crashes @ cooliris extension. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: XP    Repros on 249.1064 and 5.0.375.25    I installed Cooliris extension. Played an video for about 1hr in cooliris.   After some point of time  my browser window crashed. If I restart Chrome    and then going to cooliris page  chrome crashes continuously. Basically    chrome is in unusable state here. Once this problem is detected  launching   Chrome with new profile does not help though. Only solution to get ride of   this is  to restart my machine (as per Mark's request).     The problem is first detected in 249.1064. I restated my machine and   installed 5.0.375.25 (Official Build 45690)  it repros here too. Shown demo   to Mark.    Here are the plenty of crash ID's  14146790c6596099  4a7305033f09b6c8  4a7305033f09b263  940e1f858f7a6416    Unfortunately  call stacks are not yet available on crash servers.   </pre>
