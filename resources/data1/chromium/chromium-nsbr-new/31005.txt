<title>Issue 31005 -   chromium -    TinyMCE stopped working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Chromium	4.0.277.0 (Developer Build 35087) Ubuntu  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.277.0 Safari/532.8    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/simple.php">http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/simple.php</a>           Safari 4: ?

TinyMCE editor should be displayed but it's not      TinyMCE editor should be displayed but it's not      just ordinary textarea is shown    This is a _regression_  it used to work without any problem some time ago   (I use chromium daily builds and I would say that one month ago it was OK);   interesting is that this URL   <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/compressor.php">http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/compressor.php</a> works...    I think that this issue is quite important because:  - it is a regression  - TinyMCE is perhaps the most widely used rich editor  - it is easily reproducible    Thanks a lot!   </pre>
