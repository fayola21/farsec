<title>Issue 40014 -   chromium -    Download iframes in parallel with scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is an opportunity to improve page load time for some pages.    Chrome fails the &quot;|| Script Iframe&quot; test at <a href="http://www.browserscope.org/?category=network&amp;v=top">http://www.browserscope.org/?category=network&amp;v=top</a>    Test case description:  &quot;When some browsers start downloading an external script  they wait until the script is done   downloading  parsed  and executed before starting any other downloads. Although parsing and   executing scripts in order is important for maintaining code dependencies  it's possible to safely   download scripts in parallel with other resources in the page (including other scripts). This test   determines if the browser downloads scripts in parallel with other iframes in the page.&quot; </pre>
