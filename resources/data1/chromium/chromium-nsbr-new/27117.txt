<title>Issue 27117 -   chromium -    Start Toolbar not accessible on Win7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>                    1)When the browser is open and my start toolbar(not sure what its called)   is on auto-hide mode  when i move the cursor towards it  it does appear    meaning its still hidden.  2)Adobe PDF's do not open well. when i click the middle mouse button on a   pdf link from a site  it opens a blank pdf page and a blank Alert window   pops up.    The bug existed in previous version of Chrome too.    Using Windows 7 RC 7100.    <b>Please provide
