<title>Issue 41134 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Advanced Config - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi    I know that the previous similar request is already blocked as Wontfix.    But since a big number of users are requesting for this  I'm opening a new   issue:    a lot of Chrome users are looking for a advanced configuration feature in   Chrome  same as Firefox     --------------  about:config  --------------    because of this  please let the issue remain open so users can vote for it. </pre>
