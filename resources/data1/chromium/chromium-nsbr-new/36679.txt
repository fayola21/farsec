<title>Issue 36679 -   chromium -    Strip RTL language localizations out of Chrome/Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS X doesn't support RTL localized apps but the default language can still be   set to Hebrew/Arabic in System Preferences-&gt;International.    If you do this your system will be borked in many interesting ways but things   will still work and be in English.    However this completely messes up Chrome since we have localized strings   and will display our UI in broken Hebrew.    This bug is to compile out Hebrew/Arabic strings on OS X till the OS adds   support for localization in RTL languages. </pre>
