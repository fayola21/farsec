<title>Issue 33007 -   chromium -    Chromium restore session hangs and needs to be killed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enable option to open previous tabs when chromium is opened.  2. Open several tabs.  3. Close chromium.  4. Open chromium again.      Chromium should automatically load previous opened tabs.      Chromium hangs randomly. Sometimes it loads the tabs OK and other times it  hangs (especially after logging into my Linux account). Sometimes it  crashes and closes itself. However  sometimes only a tab crashes or the  whole browser just hangs. In these cases it needes to be killed with the  command 'killall chrome'.     Please provide
