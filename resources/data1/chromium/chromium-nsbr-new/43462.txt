<title>Issue 43462 -   chromium -    INVALID_GAIA_CREDENTIALS breaks Chromium OS syncer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's impossible to renew Gaia credentials in ChromeOS if they're considered expired by the syncer.  If the syncer already has a gaia cookie for a user  and the cookie is expired  there's no way to renew   the cookie. Logging out and back in doesn't reset it correctly. </pre>
