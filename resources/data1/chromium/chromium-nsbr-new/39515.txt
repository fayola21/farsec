<title>Issue 39515 -   chromium -    Mouse hover on a button on the bookmark bar changes top-left window buttons on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Chrome 5.0.342.7  2. &quot;always show bookmarks bar&quot;   3. Hover a mouse on a bookmark button  4. &quot;X&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;+&quot; icons appear in the three top-left window buttons  &lt;Screenshot attached&gt;    I don't see this issue on Chromium 5.0.358.0  I don't see such things in Safari.    This is a tiny nit  but it's probably easy to fix.  Cc'ing random people  just don't know who's working on Mac UI.   </pre>
