<title>Issue 33413 -   chromium -    support mixed locales for different categories on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some users like English to be the UI language. However  for everything else   (or some parts)  they like to use the locale conventions suitable for their   language of choice (usually native language).    An example taken from <a title="Chromium uses wrong environment variable to determine interface language" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19491"> bug 19491 </a> comment 8 is as follows:      $ locale  LANG=en_US.UTF-8  LC_CTYPE=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_NUMERIC=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_TIME=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_COLLATE=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_MONETARY=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_MESSAGES=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;  LC_PAPER=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_NAME=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_ADDRESS=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_TELEPHONE=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_MEASUREMENT=nl_NL.UTF8  LC_IDENTIFICATION=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;  LC_ALL=    ---------------    The user in question wants to have English UI (LC_MESSAGES)  but Dutch   formatting (LC_TIME  LC_NUMERIC  etc)  Dutch sort/search(LC_COLLATE)  Dutch   case conversion/character classification (LC_CTYPE).     I did something similar in the past because the quality of Korean   translations is so bad (I have yet to find a single application - online or   client-side -  on any platform with a satisfactory translation quality in   Korean) that it takes me a couple of seconds to figure out what a menu   entry means (if possible at all).  These days  I don't do that  (at least   with Chrome) because I like to report issues back to translators (the   translation quality got much better overall recently).     Currently  Chrome has the single locale for all locale categories and it's   determined by LANGUAGE  LC_ALL  LC_MESSAGES and LANG (listed in the   priority order).     As is the case in other Linux/Unix apps  we eventually have to introduce   the concept of locale categories.     BTW  the Webkit has separate currentSearchLocaleID and   currentTextBreakLocaleID. In Chrome's version  both functions return the   locale for the UI language.  For users with environment variables set like   the above  FindInPage would work as in American English  rather than in   Dutch.      </pre>
