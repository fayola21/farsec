<title>Issue 41223 -   chromium -    [FRUI] &quot;External Protocol Request&quot; dialog buttons not clickable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.375.3 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44229">r44229</a>)  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04    Precondition  ------------  Have a browser extension installed.    Repro steps  -----------  1. Delete file &quot;First Run&quot; in ~/.config/google-chrome user directory to   trigger the First Run UI (FRUI).  2. Run Chrome.  3. &quot;External Protocol Request&quot; dialog pops up on top to verify that you   want to run the extension.    Actual  ------  &quot;External Protocol Request&quot; dialog buttons aren't clickable.    Expected  --------  Dialog buttons should be clickable.  First  you have to hit the &quot;Start   Google Chrome&quot; button to close the &quot;Welcome to Google Chrome&quot; dialog (which   is underneath).  Perhaps that dialog should be on top.   </pre>
