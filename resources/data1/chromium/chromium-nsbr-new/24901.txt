<title>Issue 24901 -   chromium -    Mac: assertion failues in single process mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I know it's not officially supported  but let's try to keep it working properly   since it's convenient for debugging purposes. This was on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29063">r29063</a> off the   trunk (running on SL) and on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29095">r29095</a> off the trunk (on Leopard).    1. Start chromium (debug build) with --single-process. Get:    2009-10-15 10:21:35.429 Chromium[40936:6503] ***   __NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x720fbc0 of class NSConcreteData   autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking    2. Cmd-t to create a new tab  and in it navigate to a suitable website  e.g.    &lt;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>&gt;.  3. Cmd-q to quit. Get (after a bunch of not-implementeds):    ASSERTION FAILED: !m_deletionHasBegun  (../../JavaScriptCore/wtf/RefCounted.h:67 bool   WTF::RefCountedBase::derefBase())    The second problem could be a WebKit problem  or it could be our   problem. It might also be a not-just-single-process-mode problem which   manifests itself differently in single process mode (seems likely; I'll file   another bug -- still Mac-only though). </pre>
