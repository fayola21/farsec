<title>Issue 26211 -   chromium -    full keyboard traversal by default? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure when it started  but atleast on mac  i now get fully keyboard   traversal  which also means clicking on links results in a selection rect.    Do we really want this?  Should it follow the user's system wide full keyboard   access setting?  Should be an app level preference they can toggle?  Did this   happen on other platforms? </pre>
