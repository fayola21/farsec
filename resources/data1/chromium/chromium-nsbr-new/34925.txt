<title>Issue 34925 -   chromium -    Tab label font is too big - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev      yes      Debian Linux unstable      64-bit      Metacity      Window tab font is too large.          1. Look at the font used on tab labels      Tab label font should be the same size as the other widget fonts.  The font   size in the tabs is the same as the other widgets in the beta I was running   this morning  so this is a regression in the development branch.  I have   native widget theming enabled.      The font size is larger than expected.    Attached is a screenshot showing the problem.  Notice how the tab label   font is noticable larger than the fonts used by chome and the rest of the   desktop.  </pre>
