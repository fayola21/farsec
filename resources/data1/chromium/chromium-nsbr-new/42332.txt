<title>Issue 42332 -   chromium -    request gclient/buildbot support for DEPS deps_os 'chromeos' type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently chrome for chrome os requires source code that resides in git. To   maintain a single DEPS file that describes a chrome release for all   platforms requires that the git entries in the DEPS file are not visible to   those platforms that are not building for chromeos.     As a temporary workaround  we will resort to stuffing the chromeos git   references in the deps_os 'unix' section.    The correct fix would be for gclient to support a new 'chromeos' type in the   deps_os section  and for the chromeos buildbots to be able to retrieve the   new chromeos section code. </pre>
