<title>Issue 45271 -   chromium -    Mixed content scheme should be grey - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open something that triggers mixed content (images  not scripts) -- for   example  &quot;show external images&quot; in a mail in Gmail.    The lock should be ghosted with a red X (which it is) and the scheme should   be grey (which it isn't).    The grey is the same grey used for dimming out &quot;unimportant&quot; parts of the   URL. </pre>
