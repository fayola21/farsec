<title>Issue 44637 -   chromium -    Keyboard ceases to function in subject field of new Gmail (google apps) message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In Gmail (google apps)  click Compose Mail.  2. Start typing in the Subject field.    Only two (exactly two) characters can be typed in the subject field before   the keyboard stops working for all fields.
