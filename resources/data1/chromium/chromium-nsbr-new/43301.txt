<title>Issue 43301 -   chromium -    Can't copy unicode text to applications running under wine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.388.0 (Developer Build   45533) Archlinux    OS + version: Archlinux (Linux 2.6.33/Gnome 2.30)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Metacity    Behavior in Linux Firefox: Works as expected      1. Copy some unicode text  such as _��_��_��___  2. Start a wine application like notepad (included with wine) or wenlin   (chinese dictionary)  and paste the text.        Unicode text appears.        Gibberish appears (wrong encoding). For &quot;_��_��_��___&quot;  I get &quot;��_��_띕�_��_��_��__��__&quot;.            This works fine with all other linux applications I've tried  and my normal   workaround is to copy and paste from chromium to gedit and then from gedit   to the wine application. I have also had this problem with all other dev   builds of chromium that I have tried it with. </pre>
