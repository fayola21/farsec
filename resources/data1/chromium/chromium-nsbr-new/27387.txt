<title>Issue 27387 -   chromium -    no drop feedback on file attachment sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. go to <a href="http://new.crbug.com">http://new.crbug.com</a>  2. click on the link &quot;Attach a file&quot;  3. drag a png file over the &quot;no file chosen&quot; text and release        The file gets attached  but there is no feedback to show it's going to attache   as a file.  Since the png is also a valid drop into the content area  the cursor    etc. stay constant so you get no different indicators of the drop sites.    Note: Safari seems to have this problem too  but I thought at 3.x it actually   did something to show the file area as a drop site. </pre>
