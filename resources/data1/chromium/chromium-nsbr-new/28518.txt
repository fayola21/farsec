<title>Issue 28518 -   chromium -    Allow opening individual tabs from previously-closed windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox      Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested      1. Open 3 tabs page   2. Close the browser  3. Open the browser and see the recently closed tabs  4. You will see 3 tabs that when you hover the mouse on it you can see what   was the pages closed.      When I hover the mouse on 3 tabs I think could be possible to open for   example only 1 page separately. (Not being necessary to open the 3 tabs)      Even if I want to open only 1 tab of the 3 closed  I can't. In the way it   works now It's necessary to open the 3 pages.    See the video uploaded here to understand my suggestion.   </pre>
