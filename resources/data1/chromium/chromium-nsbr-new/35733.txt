<title>Issue 35733 -   chromium -    Chrome Cross Frame Scripting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)        Firefox 3.x: OK            IE 8: OK          Opera: OK      1.An attacker can create a web page with frames  including the website that  wants to attack one of the frames  2.The attacker can include JavaScript code that monitors keystrokes  3.When the victim hit the submit button  send the victim account details to  the attacker.      Chrome should check that there is no XFS attacks that can capture  keystrokes or modify any part of the website attacked with javascript code.        XFS is not controlled. An attacker can get all the information the victim  enters into a form on any website.      More information.  I did my tests with a form created by me. It controls keystrokes  and when  the victim press the &quot;send&quot; button one window displays the data entered by  the victim in the form.    Instead of doing this  an attacker could send the information to another  website or send email  which is a major threat to security.    Associate files with which I have conducted the tests in order that you  test the XFS vulnerability. </pre>
