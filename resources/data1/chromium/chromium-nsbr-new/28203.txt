<title>Issue 28203 -   chromium -    Mac: NTP detached bookmark bar border color regressed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32425">r32425</a> (which does the morph animation)  I broke the border color (and   presumably other colors as well)  by ignoring existing alphas. E.g.  on the   default theme it displays as black (or is it a dark gray)  whereas it should   display as a mid-light gray.
