<title>Issue 32995 -   chromium -    Plugins don't receive mouse wheel events - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load the Google Earth plugin (e.g. &lt;<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/earth/&gt;">http://code.google.com/apis/earth/&gt;</a>)  2. With the mouse over the plugin  scroll the mouse wheel (or use trackpad   two-finger scrolling)    It should zoom in and out  but nothing happens.     We have all the code in WebPluginDelegateImpl to convert and send mouse   wheel events  but we're never even getting them. </pre>
