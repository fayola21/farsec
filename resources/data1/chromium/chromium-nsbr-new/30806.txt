<title>Issue 30806 -   chromium -    Bookmark button active state is not cleared correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bugged me for a while  finally found repro steps today.      1. Open new tab with NTP  hover mouse cursor over a bookmark   (bookmark bar needs to be in detached mode)  2. Hit cmd-w  3. Move your mouse cursor somewhere else  4. Hit cmd-t  for a new tab with NTP        The bookmark that becomes active in 1 should no longer be active in 4        The bookmark stays active until you hover over it again.    With these steps it's possible to give every bookmark on the bar the &quot;on   hover&quot; look. </pre>
