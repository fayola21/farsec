<title>Issue 26387 -   chromium -    Text in 'disable sync' confirmation dialog is not right aligned in RTL locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start Chrome in a RTL language (e.g. &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot;).  2. Sign in to sync by clicking on the Wrench menu and choosing &quot;Sync my   bookmarks...&quot;. Enter your Google user name and password and follow the next   steps.  3. Disable sync by opening the Options dialog and clicking on the &quot;Stop   syncing this account&quot; button within the &quot;Personal stuff&quot; tab.    What is the expected output?     In the confirmation dialog  the text should be right aligned.    What do you see instead?    In the confirmation dialog  the text is left aligned. </pre>
