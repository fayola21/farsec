<title>Issue 32436 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: sad tab on http://www.hadess.net (and others  include google maps) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Page seems to render  then crash.    Regression range:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?</a>  url=/trunk/src&amp;range=36263:36342    The backtrace makes no sense -- all the addresses are in the stack  not in   the code.  This makes me suspect the v8 roll ager did.    Linux 64. </pre>
