<title>Issue 26898 -   chromium -    highlighting forgotten when mouse moves outside of window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.1    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works as expected          1.  Go to a web page with some text.  2.  Click and drag as if highlighting some text  and then drag the mouse   outside of the chrome window (without releasing the button).  3.  Still without releasing the button  move the mouse back into the   chrome window.      The highlight area should still adjust as normal when the mouse moves   back inside of the window.      The fact that we're currently highlighting is &quot;forgotten&quot;  and the highlight   area does not adjust. </pre>
