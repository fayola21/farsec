<title>Issue 23900 -   chromium -    Chrome toolbar &quot;back arrow&quot; does not function in Gmail tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. when viewing an email the &quot;back up&quot; arrow does not work in gmail         clicking &quot;back up&quot; arrow in toolbar would take me back to the page I had   just visited. Also would expect to right click and see history of previous   pages and be able to select a previous page and be navigated to that point   in my history.      &quot;back up&quot; arrow does nothing. Actslike a dead link. (will not take me back   to previous page)  button flashes as if an action is being performed but no   action is actually performed. Also  right clicking &quot;back up&quot; arrow does   produce drop down &quot;history&quot; list but clicking any of those links achieves   same flash with no change in URL.    <b>Please provide
