<title>Issue 26343 -   chromium -    [sync cleanup fixit] Sort out the notifier and notifier/communicator rats nest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When open sourcing we tried to merge this code into browser/sync  but it   doesn't feel like it really belongs there  and it has been troublesome to   make it look like Chrome code.  From a very high level  it seems like it   should be possible to sort it out into a thin glue layer that bridges Chrome   and Libjingle  and then have everything else live as a libjingle extension   (no chrome/browser includes).  The &quot;everything else&quot; should live somewhere   like third_party/notifier (a better name would be swell). </pre>
