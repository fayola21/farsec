<title>Issue 45576 -   chromium -    SSL Client Auth fails on some webservers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55  URLs (if applicable) : various - protected by SSL client cert auth  OS version               : 10.6.3 &amp; 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):  Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Might work (Firefox has troubles accessing some   Keychains)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works (uses different code path)        Use a smartcard or client certificate to navigate to a webserver that does not require a client cert   upon initial connection  but initiates a renegotiation to require a client cert.        Chrome should prompt the user for the cert to use  send the cert to the webserver  and succeed.        Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): SSL protocol error.    If the server requests/requires a client cert upon initial connection  Chrome works as expected.   This is *only* for webservers that request the client cert after the initial handshake.  This is used   frequently with Apache to allow some parts of the web server to be &quot;public&quot; unprotected   resources.    <a title="Client SSL Cert Auth can cause infinite reload loop" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40561"> Bug 40561 </a> has information related to this issue.     </pre>
