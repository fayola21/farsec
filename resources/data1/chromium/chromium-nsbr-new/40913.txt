<title>Issue 40913 -   chromium -    Enhancement req: Ability to rearrange the panels in developer tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045 (Official Build 42898)             Safari 4: NA    Firefox 3.x: NA           IE 7: NA           IE 8: NA    This is an enhacement request  not a bug.

As far as I can tell  there isn't any way to do this (and at least one   StackOverflow user confirms that he thinks there isn't as well:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580281">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580281</a>). </pre>
