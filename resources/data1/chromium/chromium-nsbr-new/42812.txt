<title>Issue 42812 -   chromium -    Allow Side Scroll Button to Function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK    Google Chrome should be made to allow the side buttons on a mouse to be able to scroll up and   down webpages instead of only being able to rely on the scroll wheel (if the mouse even has one).    It would be advantageous to users who frequently use them to get through webpages faster then   the scroll wheel will let them in a more accurate manner. Personally  it's the only thing that prevents   me from completely switching to Chrome. </pre>
