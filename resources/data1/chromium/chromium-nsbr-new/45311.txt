<title>Issue 45311 -   chromium -    Native translation over-triggers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47050) dev    There are many cases in which native translation infobar triggers   inappropriately. I have observed the following:    - de2en because a YouTube home page in English contained a few German video   titles    - Opening a spreadsheet in English Google Spreadsheets that contained   German words offered to translate the cell contents (this would almost   certainly screw up the ajax app right!)    - Generally  a small number of words in a page is capable of triggering the   infobar.    This wouldn't be such a big deal if the UI wasn't so obvious. Right now it   causes the whole page to scroll up and down if you're navigating around a   site that's over-triggering.    Perhaps rather than moving the web page with a giant infobar  a smaller   dropdown could appear a bit like the find box. </pre>
