<title>Issue 25293 -   chromium -    Chrome does not expect image/x-png MIME type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27 (Official Build 28507)        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Upload a PNG  using IE  to a server that trusts  (and later forwards)    the client-submitted mime type  2. Attempt to view the same image in Chrome in a new tab      A pretty picture in a Chrome tab      A pretty picture in a Quicktime instance      about:plugins lists Quicktime as accepting both image/png and image/x-png.  I'm guessing that Chrome has an overriding priority for image/png but not   image/x-png  leading to inconsistent outcomes. </pre>
