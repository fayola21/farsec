<title>Issue 27804 -   chromium -    Proxy settings shared between multiple browser sessions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 31665)        - Start chromium twice  once with a custom --user-data-dir  - Configure a special proxy in the process with the custom --user-data-  dir      - The normally started chrome shouldn't use any proxy (unless it was   configured to do so beforehand)  - The second process should use the configured proxy      It seems both processes share the proxy config settings  updating it in   either one of them changes the other one as well. </pre>
