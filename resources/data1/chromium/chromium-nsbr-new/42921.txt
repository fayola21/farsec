<title>Issue 42921 -   chromium -    ResourceDispatcherTest.CrossSiteAfterCrash is failing under Valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like the test has become too large to be valgrindified on that bot.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20UI%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/2990/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20UI%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/2990/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio</a>  [ RUN      ] ResourceDispatcherTest.CrossSiteAfterCrash  [5134:5134:0429/222145:11256673698012:INFO:chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc(1206)] BROWSER_WRAPPER was set  prefixing command_line with /b/slave/chromium-rel-chromeos-valgrind-tests-  3/build/valgrind.tmp/browser_wrapper.XZKlw5  [5938:5938:11256685302478:ERROR:chrome/browser/chromeos/cros/cros_library_loader.cc(24)] Problem loading chromeos shared object: Couldn't load libcros from: /b/slave/chromium-  rel-chromeos-valgrind-tests-3/build/src/out/Release/chromeos/libcros.so error: /b/slave/chromium-rel-chromeos-valgrind-tests-3/build/src/out/Release/chromeos/libcros.so: cannot   open shared object file: No such file or directory  [5938:5938:11256701437261:ERROR:chrome/browser/chromeos/cros/mount_library.cc(65)] Cros Library has not been loaded  ==5938==  ==5938==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:  ==5938==        newSuperblock's request for 4194304 bytes failed.  ==5938==        615841792 bytes have already been allocated.  ==5938==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.  ==5938==  ==5938==     There are several possible reasons for this.  ==5938==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the  ==5938==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of  ==5938==       virtual memory or address space?  ==5938==     - You have run out of swap space.  ==5938==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are  ==5938==     not sure  please let us know and we'll try to fix it.  ==5938==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than  ==5938==     normal when running under Valgrind tools  eg. up to twice or  ==5938==     more  depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine  Valgrind  ==5938==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit  ==5938==     machine  Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available  ==5938==     to a single process  up to 4GB if that's how you have your  ==5938==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of  ==5938==     3GB per process.  ==5938==  ==5938==     Whatever the reason  Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry. </pre>
