<title>Issue 35239 -   chromium -    Layout Test svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/text-intro-05-t.svg is failing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout tests are (failing) on Windows:    svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/text-intro-05-t.svg  svg/text/text-intro-05-t.svg    This was after rolling from 54482 to 54493.  It looks like the Arabic text is   positioned incorrectly (way off).    svg/batik/text/textFeatures.svg is also failing.  It looks like the overline    strikethrough and underline are missing.     </pre>
