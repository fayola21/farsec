<title>Issue 37024 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes when dragging a tab (if it's the only one) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.0 (Offizieller Build 39561) dev        1. Open chrome  2. Make sure there is just one open tab  3. Click on the tab and drag it somewhere  the main window will disappear   and you'll just see a preview of the tab's content.  4. Release the tab and chrome crashes          Chrome crashed whith this error message    The program 'google-chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.    (Details: serial 8625 error_code 3 request_code 138 minor_code 6)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()   function.)    I'm running chrome on ArchLinux with Gnome.     </pre>
