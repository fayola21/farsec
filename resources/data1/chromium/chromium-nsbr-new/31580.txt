<title>Issue 31580 -   chromium -    [feature request] option to size image to fill horizontal width - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently when viewing an image that is larger than the available window   area  clicking the image toggles between two display modes; one where the   image is sized to fit entirely inside the window  and another where the image   is displayed at its native size.  This works well for most images  however for   images that are particularly tall  eg. screenshots of discussion threads  this   doesn't always work well.  If the image at its native size is larger than the   width of the browser  then in order to view the entire image  the user is forced   to scroll back and forth horizontally.    As a possible solution  I suggest adding a third display mode - size the image   to fit the horizontal width of the window.  This mode could be made to activate   only in the case where the native width of the image is greater than the width   of the window (just as the current toggle only activates when the image is   larger than the window in either direction)  so that it would only appear in   cases where it is potentially useful.  Such an option would remove the need to   horizontally scroll on such images.    Example of a large discussion thread image demonstrating this issue   (assuming your window width is small enough):   <a href="http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/8964/b0st0ntquestionforsfd.png">http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/8964/b0st0ntquestionforsfd.png</a> </pre>
