<title>Issue 29126 -   chromium -    entire system crash by unpacking google-chrome-unstable_current_amd64.deb - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11          I do not suggest you try to reproduce the problem because you will screw up  your system. Try to see why that happens  because I really like the work  you are doing and I wanted to install and enjoy Chrome in whatever means so  I could report back with errors or bugs and help this way in a quick future  release.    Somehow my system crashed after installing the .deb package for x86_64   linux     <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=unstable_amd64_deb">http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=unstable_amd64_deb</a>    in my Sabayon 5.0 linux distro. I tried to unpack the .deb file using 7z.  Then the .lzma file using again 7z. Somehow after the   # cd / ;  # tar xvf data.tar      Ok  the symptoms I have is that keyboard and mouse stopped working. after  the reboot. Before the reboot I could not run any program even 'ls'. I got  something like &quot;permission denied&quot;. I logged in as root permissions were  OK. So I created a new user account and tried to   $ su  or  $ ssh newuser@localhost    To no avail because:    /bin/bash: permission denied    I changed the default shell to tcsh and tried again. Nothing the same. I  changed the suid bit in /bin/tcsh. Nothing the same. Permission denied.    Is there anyway to fix the system I have Debian installed and I could  chroot as root. Does anybody know what should I do?      I found some suggestion here:  <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue52/okopnik.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue52/okopnik.html</a>    but I do not know how to fix it. These stupid ways of setting permissions  in UNIX systems drives me crazy. What are all these meaningless numbers   750 650 600 etc. But anyway ... Hope somebody knows what I should do.    Cheers   Archwn.   </pre>
