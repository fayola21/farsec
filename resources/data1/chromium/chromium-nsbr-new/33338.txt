Go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">http://www.apple.com/ipad/</a>  2. Most of the Navigation Menu Items' click doesn't do anything  3. e.g. Click on Pricing or Click on Features etc. Even Video doesn't play.      Site navigation should work as it works on other browsers like firefox.      Nothing happens  same page remains active. It seems like something is   happening in the background but after few seconds it comes back with same   page.    It works on Firefox.   </pre>
