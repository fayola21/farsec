<title>Issue 35341 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame: FullTabModeIE_AnchorUrlNavigateTest broken due to OnHttpEquiv patch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrameTestWithWebServer.FullTabModeIE_AnchorUrlNavigateTest is broken on   IE7 XP SP3.    Symptom is that the page with url fragment refuses to load. We get   Bho::OnBeforeNavigate2 for the second time and things go downhill after that.       </pre>
