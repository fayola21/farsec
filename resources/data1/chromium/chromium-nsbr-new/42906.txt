<title>Issue 42906 -   chromium -    Vertical resize with 100% height objects does not always work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. view the attached HTML file  2. Vertically scale the browser window *SMALLER* using the bottom or top of   the window     (IMPORTANT: Do not scale using the corners of the windows. You must grab   the top or bottom edge)      3. *WITHOUT LETTING GO OF THE MOUSE* from step 2  vertically scale the   window larger.    What is the expected output?     The image should scale larger to match the size of the page.    What do you see instead?    The image does not always scale larger. Sometimes it snaps to the correct   size after scaling the browser window. Other times it stays the incorrect   size.     </pre>
