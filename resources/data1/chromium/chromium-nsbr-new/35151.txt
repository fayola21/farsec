<title>Issue 35151 -   chromium -    tab hangs during page load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev  WebKit	532.9  V8	2.0.6.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.9   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.5 Safari/532.9    CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: kde    URLs (if applicable) :  <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/94085?">http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/94085?</a>  locid=94085&amp;from=36hr_fcstHourLink_undeclared      Load that url.  The page initially loads and displays the first screen of   content  but then it's frozen.  It still says it's loading.  Scroll bars   don't work  escape doesn't work  clicking any links inside the page don't   work.    I've been seeing hangs like this a lot recently.  I think it must be a new   bug. </pre>
