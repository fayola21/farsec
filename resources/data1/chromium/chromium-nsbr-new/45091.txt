<title>Issue 45091 -   chromium -    Keyboard language shift is broken with chrome + flash objects - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     this site   like many other flash based sites shows some very annoying   problem..    text fields on the flash object completly ignores alt+shift keystrokes to   switch languages.    I can type english letters  but I can't type other languages such as   Hebrew.    as it happens this website was made by myself and my firm so I can say with   confident that the text field themselves are not restricted in any way...   in face if you open the same page using IE or FF it will function   correctly.    thanks         Hebrew/English character combination using the standard keyboard        Only English characters    <b>Please provide
