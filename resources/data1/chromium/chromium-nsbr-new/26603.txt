<title>Issue 26603 -   chromium -    [Install/Uninstall] GCF latest trunk doesn't work after installing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Go to  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromeframe-rel-xp/?C=M;O=D">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromeframe-rel-xp/?C=M;O=D</a>  2. Get into a build and download the mini_installer.exe  3. run the installer with command line &quot;--do-not-launch-chrome  --do-not-create-shortcuts --do-not-register-for-update-launch --system-level&quot;  4. Launch IE and access cf:about:version        GCF version should be shown  but currently it is a blank page. Actually all  pages are shown as blank page no matter they are with cf: or chrome meta tag.    The user data directory seems missing  and registering npchrome_tab.dll  manually doesn't help on this casse.   </pre>
