<title>Issue 36264 -   chromium -    Checking then unchecking &quot;Use System Title Bar and Borders&quot; changes window size.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.334.0 (Developer Build 39443)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 8.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: Gnome    Behavior in Linux Firefox: n/a        1. Maximize the Chrome window.  2. Right-click on the title bar  check &quot;Use System Title Bar and Borders&quot;  3. Right-click again on the title bar  uncheck it      After step 3  the window should look exactly like after step 1.      Below the (supposedly maximized window)  there is a gap the size of the  system title bar. To get the window back to its old size  one has to  demaximize it  then maximize it again. Urgh. Also  because a maximized  window is not supposed to have a border  the bottom part of the Chrome  window blends into whatever is behind it (see screenshot).    I'm guessing what happens is that the window size is reduced when showing  the system title bar (because the window can't get any bigger)  but when  the system title bar is hidden again  the window size just isn't changed back.       </pre>
