<title>Issue 41301 -   chromium -    Make glGetXXX return the correct values for GL_IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT and GL_IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_TYPE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm really not sure what is supposed to be returned here.    Does it need to change based on the context creation parameters? The Renderbuffer formats? The   renderbuffer formats listed in glRenderbufferStorage don't seem to match at all what glReadPixels   and return.    The place the needs to updated is in gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc inside   the function GLES2Implementation::GetHelper    Renderbuffers and framebuffers are tracked to some degree. Tracking of formats might be needed   to make this work?   </pre>
