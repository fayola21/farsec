<title>Issue 42702 -   chromium -    https://www.networksolutions.com/ is not verified as EV (extended validation) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The server certificate for <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/">https://www.networksolutions.com/</a> is not  verified as EV (extended validation).  This is because CERT_PKIXVerifyCert  returns a certificate chain that ends in the &quot;wrong&quot; root CA cerificate  (CN=UTN-USERFirst-Hardware OU=http://www.usertrust.com O=The USERTRUST  Network L=Salt Lake City ST=UT C=US).  The server certificate has multiple  valid certificate chains  but only one of them is good for EV verification.    Our EV verification code in x509_certificate_nss.cc needs to match the  Firefox code more closely.  In particular  we should pass the desired  root CA certificate as the cert_pi_trustAnchors input to CERT_PKIXVerifyCert.  See <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/ident?i=getRootsForOid">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/ident?i=getRootsForOid</a>    Right now we do not specify cert_pi_trustAnchors  which means all root  CA certificates are acceptable.  While this is OK for normal verification   we should restrict the cert_pi_trustAnchors for EV verification  (X509Certificate::VerifyEV)     ukai  do you have time to work on this?  If not  I can work on this. </pre>
