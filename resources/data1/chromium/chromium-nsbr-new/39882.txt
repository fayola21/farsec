<title>Issue 39882 -   chromium -    window.onFocusChanged fires multiple times for the same window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (1) it seems to fire every time you click on the window  even the same   window.    (2) it doesn't fire when you switch away from chrome to a non-chrome window.    (3) when you switch back from a non-chrome window  you can't differentiate   between that and other clicking around (maybe that would be fixed by (1) and   (2) </pre>
