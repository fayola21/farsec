<title>Issue 39569 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager doesn't show favicons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just downloaded 5.0.365.0 (42904).     1) open bookmark manager    expected:    - bookmarks should have favicons    actual:    - empty file icon for all bookmarks    the bookmark bar has the favicons  so clearly they're in the cache. They don't show up even after   you visit the page. Folders have the correct icon. </pre>
