<title>Issue 26808 -   chromium -    Sporadic KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE  crashes on MacOS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.235.0 (235.0)  URLs (if applicable) :  had a number of tabs open  not sure which one   caused the crash  This is on  Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L30)  Other browsers tested: N/A - have been using Chromium. Not sure which   specific page caused the crash so can't reproduce. Previous experience -   didn't have Firefox/Safari crash when had same gmail/g-cal/gmail pages   open + others      1. Had a number of tabs open (Gmail  Goog Calendar  another domain-  Gmail  news.com  a few other static pages for Javadocs)  2. Open a new tab (news.com in this case) and start context-switching   between apps  to/from chromium  3. Chromium goes into spinning-beachball and subsequently crashes.      shouldn't crash :)    Mac CrashReporter attached     </pre>
