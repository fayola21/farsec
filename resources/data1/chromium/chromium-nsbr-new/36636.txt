<title>Issue 36636 -   chromium -    Boring Proxy Setting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If clicking the Proxy Server Setting in the Advanced Setting tab of the   Options window  it access the system's Internet Options  which is very   unfriendly  as usually it needs username and password to contact with proxy   sever  but Internet Options doesn't save username and password setting. So it   will ask you again and again for the username and password.   I think it can be easy to have its own proxy setting like using IE' proxy   setting or inputting proxy sever with username and password directly. </pre>
