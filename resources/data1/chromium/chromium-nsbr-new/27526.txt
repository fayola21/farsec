<title>Issue 27526 -   chromium -    Make popups closeable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A frequent complaint with browser actions is that developers want to   programmatically control whether the popup will show on click or not.    Currently the only way to do this is to let it open  then immediately close   it. This results in a flicker though.    We should either delay painting the popup until after window.onload (and   not paint it if it has been closed)  or else add a new API that allows   developers to control this.    One way that Erik and I brainstormed is to have a default_popup property in   the manifest and setPopup() methods  similar to what we have for other   attributes of browser and page actions.    This would allow the developer to initially not have a popup  but to modify   it at runtime. </pre>
