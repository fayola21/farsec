<title>Issue 26460 -   chromium -    Viewing PDF: can't go to page 2 or beyond - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : mac 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable)   :<a href="http://www.nationalmerit.org/NationalMeritScholarshipCorporation.pdf">http://www.nationalmerit.org/NationalMeritScholarshipCorporation.pdf</a>           Safari 4: OK            1. Visit   <a href="http://www.nationalmerit.org/NationalMeritScholarshipCorporation.pdf">http://www.nationalmerit.org/NationalMeritScholarshipCorporation.pdf</a>  2. See that there's no (obvious?) way to go to the next page. I tried clicking    double-clicking  right clicking   arrow keys  etc.        This is a multi-page PDF  and pages 2 through N are important :-)  You're able to go to other pages if you open the URL in Safari and use its   PDF viewer; ditto for downloading and opening in another app  e.g. Mac OS   Preview.          You just see the first page  with no scroll bars or indications that there are   more pages.   </pre>
