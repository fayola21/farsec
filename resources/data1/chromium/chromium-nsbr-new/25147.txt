<title>Issue 25147 -   chromium -    MessageEvent.initMessageEvent's data property isn't consistent with Safari or Firefox when null or undefined - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.2 (Developer Build ) <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29372">r29372</a>    WebKit nightly <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=49739">r49739</a>: OK  Firefox 3.5.4: OK    Run LayoutTests/fast/events/init-events.html and look at this line:    testInitEvent('Message'  '&quot;a&quot;  false  false  null  &quot;c&quot;  &quot;d&quot;  window  null').data is   null          PASS. data is null.          FAIL. data is the string &quot;null&quot;.      Additional info:    Chrome's handling of this property used (4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804))   to be consistent with Safari's. Now it's not consistent with either Safari or   Firefox. I suspect that the behavior changed with the integration of WebKit   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=49219">r49219</a>.    Here's how other browsers break down. null and undefined are handled   differently in different browsers.    WebKit nightly  null: data is null  WebKit nightly  undefined: 'data' in event  but data is undefined  FF 3.5.4  null: data is null  FF 3.5.4  undefined: data is string &quot;undefined&quot;  Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29372">r29372</a>  null: data is string &quot;null&quot;  Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29372">r29372</a>  undefined: data is string &quot;undefined&quot;    Note that the WebKit nightly <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=49739">r49739</a> and Firefox 3.5.4 handle undefined   differently--the WebKit MessageEvent's data property is undefined;   Firefox's is the string &quot;undefined&quot;. (Chromium <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29372">r29372</a> produces the string   &quot;undefined&quot; like Firefox.)    Note that init-events.html doesn't test the data argument being undefined.    Question 1: Does the test need to be changed (and Safari fixed) or should   Chrome's behavior around null revert?    Question 2: Should the behavior of undefined be tested? (Presumably   Chromium should line up with Safari? I can't make any sense of the worker   spec.) </pre>
