<title>Issue 32186 -   chromium -    New tabs are created in positions that are not consistent and easily predictable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1) Open a webpage  let's call it &quot;webpage 1&quot;. Middle click a link  the new  tab &quot;1.1&quot; will be created adjacent to the right of &quot;1&quot;.    Middle click another link on &quot;webpage 1&quot;  the next new tab &quot;1.2&quot; will be to  the immediate right of &quot;1.1&quot;    Middle click another link on &quot;webpage 1&quot;  the next new tab &quot;1.3&quot; will be to  the immediate right of &quot;1.2&quot;    2) Press Ctrl-T to open a new blank tab. Then go back to &quot;webpage 1&quot;  if  you middle click  new tab &quot;1.4&quot; will be immediately adjacent to &quot;webpage  1&quot;  and not to the right of 1.3!     Basically after you create a new blank tab  the next middle click will  create new tabs adjacent to the source tab.    3) Also: hold down ctrl+shift and left click on a link  the created tab is  always open adjacent to the source tab  AND if you switch to another tab   the _next_ new tab opened on it will be adjacent to that tab  and not the  end of the group as per 1)!        New tabs should be created in more predictable and consistent positions   without requiring historical knowledge. Preferred behaviour is for new tabs  to be created always immediately adjacent to the source tab. An exception  can and probably SHOULD be made for new blank tabs (those created with  ctrl-t)- which should be created in the rightmost position.    Note: I am assuming a &quot;left-to-right&quot; language/regions. I don't know enough  about conventions for &quot;right-to-left&quot; languages/regions.        New tabs are created in hard to predict positions - they could be  immediately adjacent  or after some other tabs  or rightmost. Reliable  prediction requires historical knowledge of previous actions. Without that  historical knowledge (and knowledge of the strange logic)  the positions  can seem random.    <b>Please provide
