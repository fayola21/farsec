<title>Issue 43360 -   chromium -    Don't create CC profile when configuring address profile and vice-versa - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to http://go/autofillforms/basic_form.html  2. Fill in some fields and hit submit  3. On the AutoFill configuration infobar  click on configure    What is the expected output?   Only an address profile should be created. Similarly when CC profile gets   created address profile shouldn't be created.    What do you see instead?  CC profile also gets created along with address profile.     Google Chrome 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) </pre>
