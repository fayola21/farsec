<title>Issue 26761 -   chromium -    Figure out a better policy to time-out socket connects in TcpConnectJob - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TCPConnectJobs combine the HostResolver::Resolve() step  and the ClientSocket::Connect().    This combined step has a fixed timeout: kTCPConnectJobTimeoutInSeconds.    The problem is  there really is no good static constant that will work here.    For starters  TCPClientSocket::Connect() may require a variable number of connection attempts    depending on how many addresses were in the AddressList. And secondly  the connection timeout   per attempt varies wildly (we have seen anything from 20 seconds to 190 seconds).    See <a title="Chrome does not fall back to IPv4 when using IPv6 fails with Webpage Not Available" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23364"> bug 23364 </a> for an example where this became a problem. </pre>
