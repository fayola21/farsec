<title>Issue 41783 -   chromium -    When Chrome restarts after a crash it does't apply the command line flags it was started with initially - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. run Chrome with some command line flags  for example:    &quot;C:Documents and SettingsuserLocal SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; --enable-file-cookies --allow-  file-access-from-files --enable-internal-flash    For example  first two flags allow TiddyWiki to function properly.    2. Then crash the browser somehow. I cannot reproduce it explicitly because   I cannot crash Chrome just when I want to.    3. After saying &quot;Yes&quot; for restarting after the crash  the command line   options are not in use anymore. I my case TiddyWiki doesn't work properly.   Then if I manually close Chrome and start it again with those flags   everything works fine again.                <b>Please provide
