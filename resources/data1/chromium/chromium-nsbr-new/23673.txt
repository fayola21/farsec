<title>Issue 23673 -   chromium -    Profile picture - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have two Gmail accounts ��_��_��_ yaip.net &amp; asitaithal. I use one of them in  Chrome (asitaithal) as a default sign-in and the other (yaip.net) in  Firefox. In iGoogle  when I click ��_��_��_My Account��_��_��_ (in Firefox)  I see the  following:    (attachment 1)           And I see the following when I do the same in Chrome:     (attachment 2)        So far so good. It works the way it is supposed to. However  in Chrome when  I change my profile picture  it changes it. But when I restart Chrome  it  reverts back to my old profile picture. I don��_��_��_t know if it picks up FF  settings.      This only happens for profile picture. The rest of the settings are OK. </pre>
