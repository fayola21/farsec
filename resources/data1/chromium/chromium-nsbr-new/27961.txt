<title>Issue 27961 -   chromium -    Inaccessible options under wrench-&gt;options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Click wrench-&gt;options  2. Go to middle tab (Personligt in swedish version  might be &quot;Personal&quot; in   english?)        A scrollbar should appear if content is larger than the container. (this is   the case on the under-the-hood-tab)      The content is larger that the container  wich results in inaccessible   options at the bottom of the panel.    The overflow is surely related to what culture/language your chrome-  installation uses.     </pre>
