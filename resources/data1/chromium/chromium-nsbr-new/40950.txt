<title>Issue 40950 -   chromium -    Add UMA counters for various things - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great if we could add a few UMA counters into the code for M5.    I could think of error states we'd want to track  such as a counter in each   datatype's DataTypeController::OnUnrecoverableError() method so we can track   individual data type failures during change processing.  We could also add   one to the DataTypeManagerImpl to log failures to start various types.    Also  does it make sense to log explicit data type activation and   deactivation?   </pre>
