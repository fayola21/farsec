<title>Issue 24219 -   chromium -    Mac Chromium Helper app cannot find ffmpeg  so video does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open up any nightly via finder (do NOT run via Xcode)  2. Try to load any video        Video tag will be disabled.  It should work    The problem is that the Chromium Helper.app is unable to locate the ffmpeg binaries since they   are in the Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS folder.    The fix is to move the ffmpeg binaries into the Chromium Framework.framework package  and   then rebuild the ffmpeg binaries to resolve to one another via @loader_path instead of   @executable_path. </pre>
