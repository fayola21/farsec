<title>Issue 27627 -   chromium -    google docs spreadsheet url with # not scrollable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to http://go/crbug1  2. Scroll down a bit using the trackpad  3. Try to scroll the embed spreadsheet.        It should scroll.        Neither trackpad scrolling  nor clicking the scrollbar does anything. Works   fine in Safari. Didn't test with non-mac chromes.    cc'ing trungl cause he did some mouse stuff iirc. </pre>
