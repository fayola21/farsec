<title>Issue 33964 -   chromium -    Gmail effectively frozen after return from hibernate in Windows XP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Gmail  2. Hibernate the computer  3. Return from hibernate      Gmail can be used normally after the rest of the computer returns to normal    speed from hibernate (10-20 seconds after Windows reappears).      Even after the rest of the computer has returned to running at normal   speed  Gmail will display but will not respond (no scrolling  clicking   links  etc) for several minutes  or sometimes not at all. I usually have to   close it and reopen  but even closing it takes quite a while longer than it   normally does.    <b>Please provide
