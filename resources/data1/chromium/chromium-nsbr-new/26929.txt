<title>Issue 26929 -   chromium -    Download shelf appearance should animate. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Breaking download shelf animate open into its own bug.  I left it out of my fix for <a title="Download shelf disappearance should animate." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25602"> Issue 25602 </a>   because it looked janky.    From <a title="Download shelf disappearance should animate." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25602"> Issue 25602 </a>:  When the download shelf opens it should animate (slide).  Note it shouldn't size... rather it should size and clip its contents.  Refer to windows. </pre>
