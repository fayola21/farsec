<title>Issue 23458 -   chromium -    Toolstrips don't get a background the first time because of IPC issues? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The first time we SetBackground on a RWHV  we send the ViewMsg structure    but the message never reaches the renderer.    For each tabstrip  there is one:    [31412:31412:781750190359:WARNING:/work/chromium/src/ipc/file_descriptor_set  _posix.cc(18)] FileDescriptorSet destroyed with unconsumed descriptors    message printed onto the console. (Tested by uninstalling extensions  etc).    This only happens the first time  while the tabstrip is loading. Subsequent   SetBackground calls pass the background with no errors. </pre>
