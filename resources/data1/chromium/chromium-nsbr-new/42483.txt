<title>Issue 42483 -   chromium -    Backspace stops working in text fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.388.0 (Developer Build 45541)  'about:version'&gt;  URL : Many  but occurs on <a href="http://library.gatech.edu">http://library.gatech.edu</a> and ironically happened to occur in this form.          1. Start typing in a text field  hit backspace or delete and nothing might not occur.  2. This happens at once to all the text fields on that tab  I am going to start firing chrome up from the CLI so I can hopefully post a useful log.   </pre>
