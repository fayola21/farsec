<title>Issue 25397 -   chromium -    Mac: Text Encoding submenu has gone AWOL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to any web page (you may not even have to do that).  2. Go to View (in menu bar).  3. Look.      Expected: an active  unchecked Text Encoding menu item  which opens a   submenu (possibly with its contents disabled if opened  e.g.  from the   NTP). Actual: No submenu opens. Instead  the Text Encoding menu item   acts as checked/unchecked menu item (with the arrowhead at the side   indicating a submenu).    This is on both Chrome Dev Channel 4.0.223.4 (Official Build 29389) and   on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29511">r29511</a> off the trunk. Seen on 10.6.1; haven't tried it on 10.5.x. </pre>
