<title>Issue 30529 -   chromium -    calling openurl on a browser opens in a different browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am working on the usb filebrowser for chromeos.  When the user inserts a usb stick  i pop up a new browser that is a  Popup.  When we finally mount the USB stick  I want to change the URL  of the browser to a filebrowser which points to the directory that the  file was inserted to:      std::string url = &quot;chrome://filebrowse#&quot;;               url += disks[i].mount_path;               TabContents* tab = iter-&gt;browser-&gt;GetSelectedTabContents();               tab-&gt;OpenURL(GURL(url)  GURL()  CURRENT_TAB                    PageTransition::GENERATED);    Expected behavior:    Opens in the specified browser    Actual behavior:    It causes the url to go to a different browser instance     </pre>
