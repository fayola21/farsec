<title>Issue 24527 -   chromium -    close-tab and close-window keyboard shortcuts re-mapped on first use of chromium. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.4 (28686)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Install Chromium 4.0.222.4 (28686)  2. Open Chromium  3. Look at file menu - cmd-W mapped to close window  no mapping to   close tab.  4. Open several tabs in a window   3. Hit cmd-w on the multi-tab window       The current tab should close      The entire window closes without warning      Note: After closing chromium and re-opening it  the proper mappings are   restored.  It only seems to be on the first run of Chromium.  This same   behaviour happened on my laptop and my desktop  both running 10.5.8. </pre>
