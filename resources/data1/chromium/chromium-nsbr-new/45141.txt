<title>Issue 45141 -   chromium -    Shortcut icon from local files won't load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an html file that includes the following line in the &lt;head&gt;   section:  &lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;./icon.png&quot;&gt;  You'll get the same   result if you include the full path to the file.  2. Create a file called &quot;icon.png&quot; in the same directory as your html file.  3. Point Chromium at the html file.      I expect &quot;icon.png&quot; to be loaded as the shortcut icon.      No shortcut icon is displayed.  However  if I move &quot;icon.png&quot; to a   webserver and use the full URL as the href in my link tag  it works just   fine.    <b>Please provide
