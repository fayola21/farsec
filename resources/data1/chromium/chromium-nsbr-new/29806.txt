<title>Issue 29806 -   chromium -    make official builder more hermetic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I started a 4.0.266.0 dev chrome frame build by pressing the force build   button (started on cr-official3). I then checked in a new DEPS to chrome-  official and started a 195 stable build on a different builder (cr-  official5).     The in progress 266 build  picked up the changed DEPS file (for the 195   build) and error'd out. I would expect once a build has started  to be   completely independent of further changes in the source tree.    Or maybe have each official builder have its own independent trigger dir   (there would still be this problem when trying to queue up builds though)    First gclient step (from 266 build)    ________ running 'svn checkout svn://chrome-svn.corp.google.com/chrome-  internal/trunk/tools/buildspec/build/chrome-official C:bslavechrome-  frame-officialbuildchrome-official' in 'C:bslavechrome-frame-  officialbuild'  A    C:bslavechrome-frame-officialbuildchrome-officialDEPS  Checked out <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=4092">revision 4092</a>.    Second gclient step (from 266 build)    ________ running 'svn update C:bslavechrome-frame-officialbuildchrome-  official' in 'C:bslavechrome-frame-officialbuild'  U    C:bslavechrome-frame-officialbuildchrome-officialDEPS  Updated to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=4094">revision 4094</a>.  Error: Can't switch the checkout to svn://chrome-  svn/chrome/branches/195/src@34032; UUID don't match and there is local   changes in C:bslavechrome-frame-officialbuildsrc. Delete the directory   and try again.   </pre>
