<title>Issue 41169 -   chromium -    Maximised window with full screen window behind looks odd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a tab (perhaps <a href="http://www.sometimesredsometimesblue.com/">http://www.sometimesredsometimesblue.com/</a>)  2. Full screen it by pressing F11  3. Open a new window by pressing Ctrl + N  4. go to a different website (perhaps <a href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a>)      A number of options  1) you should see the start menu  2) the new window should take up the whole screen  3) the full screen window should turn black/blue so that it cannot be seen  4) there should be a boarder at the bottom of the webpage so that it can be   seen that there is a difference between the two pages      The webpage that is full screen is seen below the current page  with   nothing to denote that there is a difference  also the full screen webpage   still interacts (for example JavaScript mouseOvers etc.)    <b>Please provide
