<title>Issue 27703 -   chromium -    Mac- Moving windows to another space using Spaces' &quot;Bird's eye view&quot; broken. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 4.0.245.0 (not built from source)  OS version               : 10.5.8        1. Activate Spaces in Mac OS Settings. Create a dock icon for it.  2. Switch to Space 1 if you're not there already.  3. Start a Chrome window in Space 1.  4. Start a second  separated Chrome window in Space 1.  5. Activate spaces by clicking the dock icon. You should see the all spaces   (the &quot;Bird's eye view&quot;).  6. Click and drag one of the windows from Space 1 to Space 2. You should   now see two Chrome windows in two different spaces in the &quot;Bird's eye   view&quot;.  7. Click Space 2. Mac OS will switch to that space.        You should only see the Chrome window you had moved to Space 2.   One Chrome window should be on Space 1  the other should be on Space         Both Chrome windows will have moved to Space 2. </pre>
