<title>Issue 33433 -   chromium -    HttpAuthCache should include authentication scheme as part of the key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently HttpAuthCache uses origin and realm to lookup entries. This should   probably include the auth scheme as well.    In HttpNetworkTransaction::SelectNextAuthIdentityToTry  we already   explicitly compare schemes after retrieving an Entry to prevent this - might   just want to make it part of the cache key itself.   </pre>
