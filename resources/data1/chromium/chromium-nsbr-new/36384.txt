<title>Issue 36384 -   chromium -    &quot;Get started&quot; documentation still claims that the dev channel is required for extensions on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/g">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/g</a>  etstarted.html still says &quot;Subscribe to the dev channel&quot; for OS X. Since   extensions are available in the beta channel on OS X know  that page should   refer to the beta channel on mac instead. </pre>
