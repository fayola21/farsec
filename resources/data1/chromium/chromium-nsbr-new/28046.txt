<title>Issue 28046 -   chromium -    InProcessBrowserTest crashes when BookmarkBarView exists (on linux/view) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know exactly what part of the system don'g wrong  but  InProcessBrowserTest fails at exit if the browser has BookmarkBarView.  Looks like the in the BrowserProcessImpl's destructor  it destroy  the bookmark mode before destroying view. I put a hack for linux/view  build  but I need to find the right solution for this. </pre>
