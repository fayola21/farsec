<title>Issue 31324 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Chrome hangs when processing a 100 response. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It appears that if a server replies with only &quot;HTTP 100&quot; (Continue)  Chrome   endlessly waits for it to continue and no further communication with the   server is possible.    I do not have a working PoC. I stubmled upon this with my HTTP fuzzer. The   HTTP Fuzzer opens several pages  one of which periodically &quot;pings&quot; the   server so it knows the browser is still alive  another does the actual   fuzzing.    When the fuzzers sends &quot;HTTP 100&quot; (those bytes exactly) in a response  the   &quot;pings&quot; stop as well. These two pages should not affect each other at all.    This problem allows a server to DoS itself. This may be annoying  but is   not a big deal IMHO. However  I have not test if only connections to the   server that replies with &quot;HTTP 100&quot; are affected. If connections to other   servers become impossible too  this has a much larger impact. I've   restricted access to this bug until we find out.    Darin; maybe you can have a quick look and help me find out what is going   on? </pre>
