<title>Issue 44169 -   chromium -    Inconsistent theme appearance in normal mode versus maximized mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev onwards      Look at the toolbar and the bookmarks bar in maximized mode - everything is   fluent and fine.  Look at them in normal mode - the bookmarks bar has a slightly darker gray   background. </pre>
