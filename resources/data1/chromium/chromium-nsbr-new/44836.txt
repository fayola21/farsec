<title>Issue 44836 -   chromium -    Detaching tabs: chrome.windows.onCreated fires before a tab was dropped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev    background page:  chrome.windows.onCreated.addListener(function(win) {    console.log('Created '+win.id);  });  chrome.windows.onRemoved.addListener(function(id) {    console.warn('Removed '+id);  });    Screencast: <a href="http://screenr.com/qwp">http://screenr.com/qwp</a>      chrome.windows.onCreated should fire after the tab was dropped.      chrome.windows.onCreated fires right after the tab was dragged  and before it was dropped.      This issue is causing weird behavior of Chrome-o-Tile extension  which heavily relying on chrome.windows.onCreated event.   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/imfegaheedoonlphfligdcmbfiicnbbn">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/imfegaheedoonlphfligdcmbfiicnbbn</a>   Screencast: <a href="http://screenr.com/Hwp">http://screenr.com/Hwp</a> </pre>
