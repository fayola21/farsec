<title>Issue 43167 -   chromium -    Solution for how to add addresses to the Exceptions list in Incognito Mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="[Content Settings] In incognito changes on content settings only take effect after current incognito window closed" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42887"> issue 42887 </a> there was a comment   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42887#c7">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42887#c7</a>) stating that   &quot;if you have good ideas on how to improve incognito browsing experience  without flawing incognito  please share them.&quot;  but the issue is now   closed.  So I figured I would post my idea/solution this way  I don't know   any other way to submit my idea.  Anyway  here's the idea.      To allow the user to add 'Exceptions...' to the 'Content Settings' while   browsing in Incognito Mode (via Omnibox icons and/or manually)  it would   work like it normally did.  The only difference is when an address is added   to the Exceptions list  it will have a 'Yes' switch under the new 'Temp'   section to show that it was added in Incognito Mode and all other addresses   added in Normal Mode will say 'No'.  Now when the browser closes and ends   it session  all addresses that are labeled with 'Yes' under the new 'Temp'   section in all the 'Exceptions...' list windows will be removed   automatically.  If the user wants to have certain addresses to remain after   that current browser session  then they would simply have to edit the   'Temp' tag from 'Yes' to 'No' in the Exceptions list window before closing   the browser.    I'm thinking this idea could be the solution to fix this issue:    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42708">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42708</a>    and other related issues. </pre>
