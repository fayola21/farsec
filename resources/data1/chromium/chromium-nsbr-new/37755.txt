<title>Issue 37755 -   chromium -    problem with clipboards when using pwsafe command. All other browsers are working as they should. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : $  Chromium	5.0.307.11 (Developer Build 39572)  WebKit	532.9  V8	2.0.6.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.9  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.11 Safari/532.9              Firefox 3.x: OK    Opera : OK    Epiphany : OK    Google-chrome: same problem               I don't know how many of you guys are using pwsafe as password manager. It  is a CLI application that stores usernames and passwords which are  protected by a master password.    Basically the command pwsafe -up puts first username and then password in  the X clipboard. This means that the first paste command puts pastes the  username then the clipboard is replaced with the password which can be  pasted by the second paste command. (middle click or Ctrl-v)    This works very well with firefox. If I go  for instance  on gmail and I  use pwsafe -up the first middleclick on the username field pastes my gmail  username and the second middleclick pastes the password.    It doesn't work with chromium though. When I try I only get the second  paste. The first clipboard content gets skipped. So basically instead of  the username the first middleclick pastes the password. If I try only with  username (pwsafe -u) and I paste in the username field it doesn't paste  anything. So for some obscure reason chromium pastes only the second  content in the clipboard and not the first.         It should work the same way as on firefox. So the first ctrl-v pastes the  username and the second Ctrl-v pastes the password.          The first clipboard content is skipped. So instead of obtaining the  username on the first Ctrl-v I obtain the password. This is very annoying  because all my passwords are stored in the pwsafe database.    This is the pwsafe official site. <a href="http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe/">http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe/</a>    Anyway I guess this is not a problem of pwsafe because it works on every  other browser. </pre>
