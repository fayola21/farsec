<title>Issue 32744 -   chromium -    Extensions: browser actions should be hide-able - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : N/A  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    This is a feature request.    Currently  it's possible to show/hide extension page actions. However    browser actions are always visible.    Browser actions should be hide-able  so that extensions can allow users to   specify whether they want to enable the browser action component of the   extension. Many users  myself included  want extension functionality   without UI clutter  and so having the option of turning off the browser   action button (should the extension allow it) would be great.     Right now  extensions that have browser actions cannot hide them  so they   must resort to inappropriately using page actions to achieve the desired   show/hide functionality. </pre>
