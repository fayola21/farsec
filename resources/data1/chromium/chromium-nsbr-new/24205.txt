<title>Issue 24205 -   chromium -    Decide whether to implement storage APIs (window.openDatabase) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ( Migrated from http://buganizer/issue?id=1124568 )    pamg on April 11 2008 18:43  (New)  Summary     Decide whether to implement storage APIs (window.openDatabase)  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; WebKit  Reporter     pamg  CC     chrome-bugs  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Hotlist     Cr__Untriaged  Notes  LayoutTests/fast/dom/Window/window-function-name-getter-precedence.html    fails because we have no window.openDatabase().    Deferring it for now.  If we're never going to implement the storage APIs   we should move it to tests_ignored.txt instead.  pkasting on April 12 2008 09:32  (New)  Hotlist     Cr__Untriaged  Cr__Rel_Future  Notes  Last I heard our plan was to support these and various other HTML5-isms  post-beta.    The Gears folks are heavily involved in the design of openDatabase and the  other storage calls  and long-term I think that's the route most of the web  will use for this. </pre>
