<title>Issue 29027 -   chromium -    tcmalloc should put garbage values in deleted memory for Debug builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using the plain Windows allocator  in Debug builds it puts in magic   values that cause dereferencing pointers to lead to crashes.  This is very   useful for obvious reasons.  It looks like tcmalloc doesn't do this.    Huan: this will lead to catching crashes earlier  Jim: this is in tcmalloc  which you're modifying AFAIK    If you guys agree  can you assign to someone to do this? </pre>
