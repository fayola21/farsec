<title>Issue 42380 -   chromium -    Should be able to close a note in Incognito mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on ToT (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45335">r45335</a>) and 5.0.375.17.  Looks like  it never worked. User can't close a note in incognito window.    -Navigate to <a href="http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/">http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/</a> in Incognito mode.  -Create a note    I will notice two differences/issues here with Incognito Vs normal window.  Incognito:  1)Navigating to the above url  does not open a note  where as it does in   normal window. -  I don't know  which is one is the right behavior.    2) Try to close a note in incognito window - you can't.    PS: <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue2 </a> Works fine in Linux. </pre>
