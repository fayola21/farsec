<title>Issue 42641 -   chromium -    QueuedSharedWorkerShutdown started failing on 1 bot after a webkit roll..but was flaky before. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac 10.6 tests bot failed once in a while on QueuedSharedWorkerShutdown before the webkit roll <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45685">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45685</a> but after that  it always fails...but just on that one bot.    Here's the output:    WorkerTest.QueuedSharedWorkerShutdown:  [9806:263:1031719226210431:ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-rel-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/browser/first_run.cc(180)] Not implemented reached in static bool FirstRun::ProcessMasterPreferences(const FilePath&amp;  const FilePath&amp;  FirstRun::MasterPrefs*)  [9807:519:1031719326089387:ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-rel-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/common/chrome_paths.cc(225)] Not implemented reached in bool chrome::PathProvider(int  FilePath*)  Tue Apr 27 09:43:32 codg75.jail.google.com Chromium[9806] &lt;Error&gt;: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSOrderWindowList  Tue Apr 27 09:43:32 codg75.jail.google.com Chromium[9806] &lt;Error&gt;: kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.
