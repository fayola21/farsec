<title>Issue 32342 -   chromium -    The --single-process flag doesn't work on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium builds (debug or release) do not respect the --single-process flag   on Linux.  This is intentionally disabled on branded builds but should work   on Chromium builds - it's super useful for debugging.  It used to work (as of   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28767">r28767</a> according to rubenbb). </pre>
