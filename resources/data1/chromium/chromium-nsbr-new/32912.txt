<title>Issue 32912 -   chromium -    Feature-Request: A tab  which is dragged out of a vertical maximized window  should be placed on same height like the window where the tab comes from.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.305.0 (36862)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. open a window with 2 or more tabs  2. maximize the window vertically (from the Menu-Bar until the Dock)  3. Drag a tab out of the window      The &quot;new&quot; window should be placed direcly next to the first window on the   same height.      The bottom of the &quot;new&quot; window is not completely to see  because it is   placed not direcly next to the first window on the same height.    The problem is  that I always have to replace the &quot;new&quot; window manually to   see the rest (the bottom) of the window.    Works fine with Firefox and Safari !    Thanks and regards    Mehmet </pre>
