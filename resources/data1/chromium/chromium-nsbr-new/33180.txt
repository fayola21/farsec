<title>Issue 33180 -   chromium -    better display of tester/builder relationships - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has come up a few times on channel  so writing it into a bug to see if   folks familiar with the scripts have ideas:    1. it would be nice if there was some visual relationship between testers and   their builders to help people realize the linkage  2. on the internal bot pages  it would be nice to include a warning on testers   pointing out that clobbers doesn't really do anything  and point them at the   builder that needs the clobber instead. </pre>
