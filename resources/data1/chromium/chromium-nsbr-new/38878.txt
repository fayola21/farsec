<title>Issue 38878 -   chromium -    Extreme caching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Edit a javascript file  add a function or something  2. Reload page  3. JS change won't always register  says the function is undefined      It should load the changed javascript when you refresh.      It doesn't register the changes. Added a new function  all other browsers are OK  Chrome says it's   undefined because the old file is being cached. When I view the javascript file direct in the browser   the changes aren't there  even after an F5  have to do Ctrl + F5 to see the in the JS file  but   numerous Ctrl + F5 on the actual webpage don't help. Even restarting Chrome doesn't always push the   changes through.    <b>Please provide
