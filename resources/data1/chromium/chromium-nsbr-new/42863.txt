<title>Issue 42863 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't apply &quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; to the :first-line pseudo-element without &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 (on Goobuntu)  URL : reduced html pasted below  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Same as Chrome.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: &quot;first line&quot; is underlined  regardless of doctype    Chrome doesn't apply &quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; to the :first-line   pseudo-element when &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is missing. It does apply &quot;font-weight:   bold;&quot;  however. Adding the doctype changes the behavior so that &quot;first   line&quot; is underlined.    It's possible this is intended  but it does differ from Firefox. I'll let   more informed people decide.    &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;      &lt;title&gt;:first-line underline test&lt;/title&gt;      &lt;style&gt;        div:first-line {          text-decoration: underline;          font-weight: bold;        }      &lt;/style&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div&gt;        first line&lt;br/&gt;        second line&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt; </pre>
