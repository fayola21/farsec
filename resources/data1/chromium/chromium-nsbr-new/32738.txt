<title>Issue 32738 -   chromium -    On changelogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello    As things are now  changes for the extension updates are either   displayed in extension's page (in different formats and places)  in   some external URI  or not at all.     I strongly believe implementing a (very easy and basic) changelog   functionality as part of the publishing procedure would be truly   helpful for both the users  and for the developers.     So  what I suggest (though this may not be the place to do so) is that   every time an extension file is updated (uploaded)  the developer to   be presented with a textarea in order for him to input changes related   to the version he just uploaded.     Those changes could/would be displayed within the extension page  in a   separate section.     That way everyone would have a consistent - and kind of guaranteed -   overview of what's new for an extension.  </pre>
