<title>Issue 33172 -   chromium -    Need to restart XCode if `gclient runhooks` modifies xcodeproj files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since about 4 days ago  I need to restart xcode instead of just   closing/reopening projects after running `gclient hooks`  else xcode would   not recognize that the xcodeproj files have changed and hence give me linker   errors.    thomasvl says that this is caused by cycles in project files and that   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/373002">http://codereview.chromium.org/373002</a> should detect this. He asked me to   file a bug. </pre>
