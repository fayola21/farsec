<title>Issue 25167 -   chromium -    Anti-aliasing in Recently Closed section of New Tab page is messed up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.3 (29378)  OS + version : Gentoo Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  window manager : xmonad  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Open new tab page  2. Observe the fonts in the Recently Closed section of the page (below the   thumbnails of the eight most frequently visited sites)      The fonts should look normal.      The fonts are excessively blurry  with what appears to be horizontal blur;   this seems to imply something is going wrong with the anti-aliasing or   subpixel rendering. However  the fonts elsewhere on the page have no such   problems.    I've attached an image from a fresh session (so I wouldn't show you all my   most frequently or recently visited pages); the problem is visible as   described above. </pre>
