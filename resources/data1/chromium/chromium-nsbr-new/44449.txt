<title>Issue 44449 -   chromium -    Testing regex twice fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Offici��_��_le build 45376) unknown  V8:	1.3.18.22         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Load the attached testcase        Green background -- both parseLinks calls return the same result      Red background -- second parseLinks call doesn't alter the string at all.    Note that this is fixed in V8 version 2.2.10 (trunk). I don't know when it  was fixed  but it would sure be good if this fix was in a Chrome release  &quot;Soon&quot;  as it's breaking our linkifier (the testcase has been simplified)  on ebuddy.com.       </pre>
