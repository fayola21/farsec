<title>Issue 36563 -   chromium -    Select control blur event is missing if user clicks outside of the page when popup is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open test url: <a href="http://jsbin.com/afumu">http://jsbin.com/afumu</a>  2. Click on select and show popup list  3. Click OUTSIDE of this page (for example other applications) while the   popup is showing.    What is the expected output?  Popup list is closed and blur event fires    What do you see instead?  Popup list is closed but blur event fires      This is because chrome popup menu uses separate RenderWidget  so the   RenderView does not have focus while popup menu is showing. When user   clicks outside of the RenderView  the RenderView does not receive mouse   event and no blur event fires in this case. Chrome 4.0 has the same issue   and looks like this is not a new issue or recent regression.   </pre>
