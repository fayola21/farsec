<title>Issue 41194 -   chromium -    Remove use of background store in Mac plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the plugin optimization that 12586 would make for other platforms; on the Mac we don't   have to do any extra work because CoreGraphics plugins don't (can't) do their own compositing (and   we don't support transparent QD  and CA uses a windowless-like mode).    This will eliminate synchronous plugin paints for changing page backgrounds  halve the shared   memory we use for transparent plugins  and improve perf for all transparent plugin painting slightly   by eliminating the need to compare backgrounds. </pre>
