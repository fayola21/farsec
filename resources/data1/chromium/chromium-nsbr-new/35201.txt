<title>Issue 35201 -   chromium -    chrome switches to fullscreen mode when launching urls from other apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open a URL from outside Chrome  e.g. click on a link in an IRC or   Terminal Window  2. link is opened in Chrome  3. as soon as I click anywhere on the Chrome window  it switches to   fullscreen mode.      Does not switch to fullscreen mode      Switches to fullscreen mode  need to hit F11 to exit fullscreen mode.  When the Chrome window is not maximized  it looks even stranger: it first   goes to a sorta-fullscreen mode  where the window takes up only part of the   screen  but lacks the tabs and addressbar  and clicking again makes it   actually expand to fill the screen.    <b>Please provide
