<title>Issue 45635 -   chromium -    Save Password Infobar needs to remain appearing on same site not just page used to login. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1        1. Use a website that requires login in to enable save password   2. Having logged on  immediately navigate to another page within the site        The &quot;Save Password&quot; Infobar should remain hanging so one can navigate through any site whilst being able to save the password for that site.      Having logged in  by the time the infobar starts to appear asking me to   save password i have already clicked to navigate to another page within the   site  which forces the loss of the &quot;save password&quot; infobar. Its too slow to   appear.   </pre>
