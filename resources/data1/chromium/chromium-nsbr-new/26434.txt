<title>Issue 26434 -   chromium -    Zoom image with Ctrl+/- loses actual size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load an image URL.  2. Zoom in (Ctrl +) several times to increase the image size.  3. Zoom out once (Ctrl -)  4. Press Crtl-0 to restore the original size.    Instead of the original size  the image is much bigger.    NOTE: At some point the zoom in will make a huge jump in size. I've found some images where it   happens on the fourth Ctrl+ and other on the sixth. If you downsize after that big jump  that's   when the baseline (ctrl-0) image becomes huge.
