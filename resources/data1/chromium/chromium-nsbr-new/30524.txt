<title>Issue 30524 -   chromium -    On bookmarks bar  &quot;move between 2 folders&quot; is impossible (Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make the bookmarks bar visible (Ctrl+B)  2. Create two folders and one URL.  3. By means of dragging  try to move the URL between the two folders.    It does not seem possible to do this -- the bookmark seems to always be   placed into one of the two folders  never between them.  (On Windows  this   is possible) </pre>
