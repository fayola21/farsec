<title>Issue 44664 -   chromium -    Invoking a print session from Flash will not allow the print dialog to be dismissed via mouse interaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Install the latest dev channel (6.0.401.1)  2. Run any flash content  3. Right click &gt; Print   4. Or if the Flash test case allows has a button to print use that.   IE...Buzzword    What is the expected result?  Should be able to click print or cancel      What happens instead?  Print and Cancel do nothing.  Can only close the dialog    The version of Flash does not matter.  This is an injection with somewhere  in the dev channel.  Version 4 and 5 are okay.   </pre>
