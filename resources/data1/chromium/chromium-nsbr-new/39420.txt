<title>Issue 39420 -   chromium -    Bootstrap tarball has &quot;.svn&quot; directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At least in chromium.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=42433">r42433</a>.tgz  the bootstrap tarball has &quot;.svn&quot;  directories included (in all but 4 sub-directories). Thus  when I run  &quot;gclient sync&quot; with an older (?) version of svn (e.g.  1.4.6)  I get the  error message:    &quot;svn: This client is too old to work with working copy '...chromium/src';  please get a newer Subversion client&quot;    This is my first time trying the bootstrap tarball  so I'm not sure if the  &quot;.svn&quot; directories have always been there. </pre>
