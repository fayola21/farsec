<title>Issue 27033 -   chromium -    On small screens  Theme curl-up corner intercepts clicks for lower-right New Tab image. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Resize the New Tab page to fit on a 1024x600 screen.  This brings the   lower-right New Tab image in the grid near the curling-up theme-corner   image.  2. Attempt to click on the lower-right New Tab image  but within the   invisible square bounding box that seems to surround the curling corner   (i.e. not on the curling corner image itself  but below the top of where   it starts  and to the right of its leftmost edge).          Chromium displays the page pictured in the New Tab image I clicked on.          Chromium sends the mouse event to an invisible overlay and I get a page   about Chrome Themes.      <b>Please provide
