<title>Issue 34908 -   chromium -    Repeated form submit after back button and reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1.  Load a page with a form with a hidden field having an ID number that  was generated randomly on the server.      Page headers for the form are set to the following  to force it to always  gets a new page from the sever:    Expires: Mon  26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT  Last-Modified: &lt;set to the current time&gt;  Cache-Control: no-store  no-cache  must-revalidate  max-age=0  Cache-Control: post-check=0  pre-check=0  false  Pragma: private  Cache-Control: private    2.  Submit the form    3.  Use the the back  button to return to the form.  Form is reloaded from  the server and a new number is generated for the hidden field    4.  Submit the form again.  The original number is submitted  not the  regenerated number.    I have verified that a new page with a new ID number is being fetched from  the server.          It should submit the ID number from the second time the form was loaded.          Instead it submits the ID number from the first time the form was loaded.  Continued &quot;backs&quot; and &quot;submits&quot; continually submit the first number.    <b>Please provide
