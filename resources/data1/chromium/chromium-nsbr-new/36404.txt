<title>Issue 36404 -   chromium -    Cmd+W does not close the tab anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issues 34384 was resolved as wontfix  however the problem still does   exist. Here is the description from that issue:    &lt;=cut=&gt;  According to the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?</a>  hl=en&amp;answer=95743 Cmd+W closes the current tab and Cmd+Q -   current   window. This worked for ages  but not since the last update. Now Cmd+W   closes the current window and it's not possible to close the tab via the   keyboard. This breaks both existing workflows and keymap compatibility   with   Safari / Firefox.    See <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=3e16c23426698579&amp;hl=en for some discussion  &lt;=cut=&gt;    The behavior is quite weird - some day the hotkey layout is correct  some   day - not. Sometimes  close &amp; restart of Chrome fixes the problem    sometimes - no.   </pre>
