<title>Issue 30536 -   chromium -    get run_webkit_tests.py to use apache on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Apache 2 on Mac/Linux has really dramatically reduced http flakiness   on those platforms. I'd guess by ~90%. Which is maybe 1/3 of all the flakiness   in the webkit tests.    Seems like we should try to get Windows using Apache (ideally Apache 2).   That would likely reduce flakiness and allow us to shard the http tests on   Windows  which would make Webkit and Webkit-dbg-3 builders 2-6 minutes   faster.    I've tried for far too long trying to get it working and failed. I've lost steam   and am taking a break from this for a while. If anyone else is willing to   attempt it  I can pass off the code to you and hopefully you'll have better luck. </pre>
