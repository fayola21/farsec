<title>Issue 33326 -   chromium -    Improve external extensions install flow to allow internal extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are planning to do parts of the Chrome UI using extensions. Currently   the only way to do this is to use a crx file but a crx file requires signing   which in turns requires us to check in the pem (private key) file which we   want to prevent.    We have discussed two possible changes to the system:    1. Allow non signed crx files  2. Allow a directory to be used instead of a crx file in the default extension   json    Alt 2 seems like a better alternative if we can ensure that we don't do too   much file I/O on startup. One way to reduce the file I/O is to keep the files   in their current location and only stat the manifest file. </pre>
