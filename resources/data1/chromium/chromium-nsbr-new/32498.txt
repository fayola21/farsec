<title>Issue 32498 -   chromium -    captureVisibleTab should give a more flexible image than a data URI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.0 (36481)    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tabs.html#method-captureVisibleTab">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tabs.html#method-captureVisibleTab</a>      This should probably be a feature request  but I'm not seeing an option to   set it as such.    I would like to request an easier way to work with captureVisibleTab than a   data URI.  The reason is that I can't figure out how to do much more than   show the user the screenshot with the data URI.  I want to be able to   automatically (without the user saving the image themselves) upload or even   drag to an embeded google docs document  but Google docs does not support   data URIs for either.  Dragging the image to a new document shows the   image  but after you save and reopen the document it is gone.  I also don't   think many web applications would support a data uri.    In general  I don't think there is much flexibility with the data uri    especially if you don't control the service you want to send the image to    allowing you only to show the image and making he user manually save and do   the rest of the work from there. </pre>
