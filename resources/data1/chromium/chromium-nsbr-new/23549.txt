<title>Issue 23549 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame should not make any entry in HKCU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome frame is installed in machine wide mode as opposed to per user   install. Ideally it shouldn't need to make any entry under HKCU. It does so   today in order to register its progid under 'Secured Mime Handlers'.     On windows vista local administrators do not have write access to 'Secured   Mime Handler' key. It can only be written by a process that has 'Trusted   Installer' sid in its token. The installer could 'take ownership' but   that's pretty crude.    The best option is to figure out way to make the entry as 'Trusted   Installer'  maybe running a custom action via MSI installer service would   make it possible. I checked the msiexec.exe running under SYSTEM and it   does NOT have the 'Trusted Installer' sid in its token. There has to be a   way to be able to run as 'Trusted Installer'  hopefully it's in our reach.    </pre>
