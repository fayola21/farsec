<title>Issue 45234 -   chromium -    Windows XP: Proxy configuration not fetched often enough - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55      1. Set proxy settings to point to a proxy config file that is only   accessible when on a corporate VPN and routes through a proxy that is only   available when on a VPN.  2. Open Chrome while the VPN is disconnected. Visit www.google.com or some   other site.  3. Chrome/Windows fails to get the proxy configuration and remembers this   fact.  4. Connect to the virtual private network.  5. Attempt to connect to a site that requires routing through the proxy.    Expected:  The site is accessible.    Actual:  The site is inaccessible since a connection attempt is made without the   proxy.    There are two workarounds:  - Wait 5-10 minutes. It appears Chrome refetches the proxy information  but   this takes some time.  - Close all Chrome windows.    One observation: The Windows &quot;Internet Options&quot; dialog allows you to set   proxy configurations per profile; for example  you can set a separate proxy   config for the VPN in the Windows Internet settings. Perhaps Chrome is not   noticing when the connection profile changes?   </pre>
