<title>Issue 28315 -   chromium -    A sync server 500 response during an initial sync could cause client to think it's synced. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a hypothetical bug  found by inspection.  We should try to reproduce   it using a server that's been instrumented to return errors often  or   (probably just as easy) writing a syncer unit test.    In the sync engine  the logic of HasMoreToSync() checks to see if we queried   the server and got zero updates.  It does this by looking to see whether   there is a GetUpdatesResponse message.  However  in the event of a transient   error like HTTP 500 or 404  there is also no GetUpdatesResponse.  Since we   hold off initialization until downloading the first set of updates  a   transient error on the first sync could cause us to run the initialization   early.    I can only speculate what would happen in that case -- if we made it as far   as the ModelAssociator without crashing  we'd be caught without the tagged   permanent nodes.  That's an unrecoverable error. </pre>
