<title>Issue 45783 -   chromium -    person names disappeared on facebook - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 6.0.424.0 (Developer Build   48800) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: it is in this ubuntu PPA at least  OS + version: Ubuntu 10.04   CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  Window manager: metacity /w gnome  Behavior in Linux Firefox: it works    I know it's an odd bug summary but I coulnd't explain better. The problem:   since some days I cannot see the person list in the chat window for   example  only the groups  but not the names themselves. Also  in various   facebook applications where there is some possibility to choose persons   (like giving gifts to them in some apps) there are no names at all (even   not the &quot;container box&quot;). I am sure it's a chromium problem since it works   in firefox I've just checked it. </pre>
