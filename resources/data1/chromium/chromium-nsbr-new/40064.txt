<title>Issue 40064 -   chromium -    Extension reload tried to look for an extension in the chrome Application dir instead of User Data dir - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running Windows 5.0.360.4 on XP    I noticed the browser action icon for my slightly customized version of the   gmail checker extension had gone missing. The space was there and if I   moused over it the highlight would show  but there was no image - just the   standard light blue.    I went to chrome://extensions and disabled the extension and then enabled   it  and the browser action icon was still missing. I then tried doing a   reload  and got an error message about being unable to load the manifest.   The path in the error report was &quot;.../Chrome/Application/5.0.360.4/...&quot;   instead of &quot;.../Chrome/User Data/Default/Extensions/...&quot; like you'd expect.   I've attached a screenshot of this.    I suspect the cause is recent changes either to make the bookmark manager   extension live in the application directory  or the persistent loading of   unpacked extensions  or some combination of the two.    Unfortunately I don't know exactly what steps led me to get into this   situation  but we might be able to figure it out just by reasoning about   the buggy behavior. </pre>
