<title>Issue 29891 -   chromium -    Cannot drag and drop between web fields. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Find a site with multiple fields  such as <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en">http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en</a>  2. Enter some text in a field.  3. Select text in the field.  4. Try to drag and drop to another field.        Expect the text to be removed from the original location and placed in the new location.  The   placement cursor appears.  Text selected elsewhere in the page can be dropped in this way.  Safari   allows drag-and-drop between fields.   </pre>
