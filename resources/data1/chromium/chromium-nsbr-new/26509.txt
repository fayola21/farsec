<title>Issue 26509 -   chromium -    Build new FFmpeg binaries for Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need new ones that include the latest round of patches (47 through 49).    Either do it the ffmpeg.gyp (questionable amount of time)  or do it the lazy   way for Mstone-4 then fix it up later (we can create a separate issue for   tracking purposes). </pre>
