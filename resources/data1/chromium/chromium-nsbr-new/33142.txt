<title>Issue 33142 -   chromium -    Extensions gallery: Move from star-based ratings to thumbs-up / thumbs-down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3 dev    The YouTube team recently realized that the 5-star rating system is flawed   because most people either give 1 or 5 star reviews. They switched to the   Digg-like thumbs up/thumbs down  and I think the Chrome team should do the   same with the extensions gallery. </pre>
