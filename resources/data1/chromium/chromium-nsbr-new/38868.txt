<title>Issue 38868 -   chromium -    Address bar turns black - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The same issue as 11075 which was closed but not fixed.    Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 (41514)                    1. It is intermittent. However  when Chrome starts to do this  even   restarting the browser does not help.  2. Usually happens after I have had the browser open with lots of tabs for  a long period of time.      Can view the address bar.      Address bar is blacked out. ( see screen shot). </pre>
