<title>Issue 43326 -   chromium -    allow app windows to hook the new tab button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have been finding the lack of a new tab button in app windows a little   unsettling.    When using a multi-tab app window  what if we allowed an app to declare a URL   to open when you clicked on the new tab button.  So docs could create a new   doc  gmail could create a compose window  etc.  Maybe we'd also have to allow   them to set an icon for it for clarity.   </pre>
