<title>Issue 32108 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Should add an external extension load checker in developer mode of extension management page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently if there is any mistake happened in external_extensions.json  it  is difficult for user to find out the mistake. I think it would be better  if we can add a button in developer mode of extension management page  with  functionality that checks the validity of the items in  external_extension.json and alert the errors if there is. </pre>
