<title>Issue 31101 -   chromium -    Tab not staying under cursor when dragging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Populate browser with multiple tabs.  2. Rip a tab off browser  dragging down and left/right with speed.  3. Try to arrange tab in different window with multiple tabs.      That the tab would stay under the cursor at all times whilst dragging.   Difference in distance between cursor and tab causes much difficulty when   trying to place tab into different window.      When dragging with speed  the tab appears to lag behind by design and   sometimes never catches up to the cursor. </pre>
