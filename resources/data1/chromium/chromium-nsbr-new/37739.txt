<title>Issue 37739 -   chromium -    Extension bar organization feat. breaks menu functionality - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click and drag downward on an extension browser action icon to activate it like a menu.  2.  The icon drags from the toolbar and does not produce the menu  3.  Two clicks are required now in order to use menus.      Many actions make sense to use as menus.  For consistency with the official menus the extensions could   also be clicked and drop down as a menu.  If a mouse is dragged downward first instead of left  right    or up produce the menu and cancel organize.  Many users will try to use a browser action like a menu.   Dragging up could cancel the menu and re-instantiate icon mobility in case of accidental activation.         Now you can only organize in mouse down mode without any access to the menu's items unless you use two   clicks.  This removes menu capability/functionality and decreases usefulness of actions that require   speedy menus.      <b>Please provide
