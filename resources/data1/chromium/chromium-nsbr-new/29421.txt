<title>Issue 29421 -   chromium -    Long videos in flash don't start. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   0. Start chrome  1. Go to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-</a>  8066925138937638623#  2. Wait for the video to start.        What is the expected output?  The video should start playing automatically like it does in other browsers.    What does happen?  The video doesn't start. Toggling the play/pause button doesn't help.    Work around:  If you drag the slider  you can get it to start  but this isn't obvious.     </pre>
