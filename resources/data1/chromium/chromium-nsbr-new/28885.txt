<title>Issue 28885 -   chromium -    Fullscreen Flash video briefly stops redrawing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Here's a vague bug report for you.    Every once in a while  the fullscreen Flash video I'm watching will stop   redrawing for about a second or two.  During this time the audio continues to   play as normal.    I don't have any other apps (besides the Finder) running on my system at the   time  one tab open  and I'm not doing anything with the keyboard/trackpad.    Chrome 4.0.249.12 on a 15&quot; MacBook Pro  though this problem has occurred   for a while -- not sure how long unfortunately. </pre>
