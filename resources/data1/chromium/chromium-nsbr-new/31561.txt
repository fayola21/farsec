<title>Issue 31561 -   chromium -    404 navigation suggestions should show based on content  not length. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  URLs (if applicable) : see below      1. visit: <a href="http://lerdorf.com/404_short.php">http://lerdorf.com/404_short.php</a>  which is non-standard 404  but   short  so it brings up the nav suggestions. vs   <a href="http://lerdorf.com/404_long.php">http://lerdorf.com/404_long.php</a> which is longer and does. It seems if   someone goes to the trouble to show the non-default 404  we should respect   and render it  even if it is short.  </pre>
