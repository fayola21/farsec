<title>Issue 42858 -   chromium -    Change windowless plugin backing store to non-transport memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently backing_store_ is a TransportDIB  but it's not actually transported anywhere. There's non-  trivial overhead for that on the Mac  since it requires IPC to allocate  and gets it involved in the   delayed release system we have on resize. It would be better to factor out the convenience methods   (like getting a canvas) into a common interface  and use a simple memory holder object for   backing_store_. </pre>
