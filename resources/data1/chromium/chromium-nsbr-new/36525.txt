After visiting couple of sites in different tabs  click on '+' icon on   the right side top to open 'New Tab'  3. Arrive at 'New Tab' window and see 'Recetly closed' section in one   straight horizontal line which lists links of sites visited earlier.  4. Click on first link and Voila !!  5. First link on recently closed section will not take you to the intended   site but a totally different link from your bookmark folder.  6. Attaching a screenshot where you can see the first link in 'Recently   closed' section as 'Frequently A..' but status bar at the bottom clearly   shows gtalk link.  7.
