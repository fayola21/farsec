<title>Issue 40321 -   chromium -    tabs.update( { selected: true }) messes with new tab/window auto-focus on omnibar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.369.0 (Developer Build 43576)  Is this the most recent version: Yes (self-compiled)  OS + version: Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: KDE      1. Once Chromium is running  manually open any new window (Ctrl-n) or tab (Ctrl-w / &quot;+&quot;   icon)  2. New window / tab is created with no focus on address bar    What is the expected result? All new (manually created) windows should have auto-focus on   address/url bar for usability. This saved an additional step to either click/select the   address bar  or Ctrl-l      What happens instead? Window is focused instead  rather than address bar.    I've noticed this pre-existing functionality broke recently  then appears to have been   semi fixed (worked sometimes in build 43175)  and now appears to be broken again. Not sure   exactly what the intention is  however thought it worth reporting as it is a huge   annoyance and I assume this is the intention (auto-focus). </pre>
