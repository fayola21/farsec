<title>Issue 29287 -   chromium -    Why DMG is considered more dangerous than ZIP? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.22  URLs (if applicable) : ANY  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): no unnecessary warnings  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): no unnecessary warnings  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Try to download any DMG file and notice the warning in the bottom   download panel.  2. Try to download ZIP or any other archive file and notice the absence of   warning in the download panel.      There should be either no warning at all or it should be present for ANY   archive file  be it .zip  .gz  .bz  .rar or .7z. Would be the best to add the   preference to specify this behavior. It annoys very much to click on the   Save button every time I am downloading the file.    </pre>
