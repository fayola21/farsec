<title>Issue 41459 -   chromium -    Blank White strip in the bottom of webpage when page down is clicked. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Gmail  and login to inbox.  2. Click on an online contact to open teh chat window in the right bottom   corner.  3. Press page down button on keyboard.      The inbox should smoothly scroll down while the chat window is kept locked   in the bottom right corner.      The whole of webpage is scrolled up leaving a blank white strip (equal to   the size of the scroll up) at the bottom. Problem cannot be reproduced when   the chat window is not opened  so this seems to be an issue with child   windows of a webpage.
