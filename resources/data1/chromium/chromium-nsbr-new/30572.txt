<title>Issue 30572 -   chromium -    Split window &amp; Multi-tab selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To assist users when they have too many tabs open  they should be able to   split the window into two tabs.    User action: Right click a tab  from context-menu select &quot;Split window&quot;  Browser's action: makes a new window featuring all the tabs to the right    including the tab which was right-clicked.    &quot;Hidden&quot; feature: CTRL+Click allows to users select multiple tabs  thus when   a user selects &quot;Split window&quot; it creates a new window with the selected tabs   (same idea would be applied with &quot;Close tab&quot;  &quot;Bookmark all tabs...&quot; would   change to &quot;Bookmark these tabs...&quot;  etc...) </pre>
