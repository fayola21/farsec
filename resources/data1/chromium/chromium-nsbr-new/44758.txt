<title>Issue 44758 -   chromium -    captureVisibleTab() distorts text when PNG format is used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.375.53    On Windows XP but not on Mac OS 10.6  captureVisibleTab() appears to  produces semi-transparent (distorted) text.      1. Create an extension that uses captureVisibleTab() to capture a tab in  PNG format  e.g.  pass { format: &quot;png&quot; } as the 2nd parameter.    2. Examine the image produced and observe that text was not rendered correctly.    Expected result:  image should be similar to one captured using JPEG format  (except for improved quality due to use of PNG).    This problem does not occur on Mac OS 10.6 using the same version of Chrome.
