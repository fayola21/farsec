<title>Issue 31862 -   chromium -    No visual representation  if BMB is disabled in fullscreen mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> -Make sure  BMB is enabled (ON) and open a NTP   -Enter in to FullScreen mode.  -Right click on a Bookmark on BMB and click 'Always show Bookmark bar' to   OFF.    Notice that there is no visual representation/animation in UI  even though   BMB is disbaled.    -Now (in fullscreen mode only) repeate step3 to BMB ON.    See the screenshot.    with NTP  Basically  if user enters into full screen mode with BMB   enabled  we will shows one type of UI ( left side of the screenshot). If   user enbles BMB after entering into fullscreen mode  then we will show   different UI (right side of the screenshot). </pre>
