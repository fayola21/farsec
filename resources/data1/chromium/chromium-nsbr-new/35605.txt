<title>Issue 35605 -   chromium -    Specialized file access API for retrieving/deleting Flash LSOs  Silverlight storage objects  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello  this is a feature request.    I saw several comments that stated there are no plans to implement a generic file system API. What   about a specialized API for accessing browser-related files like Flash cookies/LSOs? This   functionality is needed for developing privacy extensions  where resorting to NPAPI seems   particularly undesirable. </pre>
