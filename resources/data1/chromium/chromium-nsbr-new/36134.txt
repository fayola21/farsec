<title>Issue 36134 -   chromium -    Chrome uses different color profile from system default? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta  URLs <a href="http://rijkshuisstijl.communicatieplein.nl/">http://rijkshuisstijl.communicatieplein.nl/</a> :           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Visit the mentioned URL in Google Chrome  2. Visit the mentioned URL in another browser  3. Verify colors of the top bar are the same with a colorpicker        The expected result is to have the two browsers show the same colors.        Chrome shows a different color  even though it's own development tools show  me another color.    This only happens Mac OS X  (I use version 10.5.x)  on a colleagues'  computer with Windows and another with Linux and Chrome Beta I can't reproduce.    See attached file for the difference. I have a photoshop window over the  Chrome render to show the difference in all it's glory.   </pre>
