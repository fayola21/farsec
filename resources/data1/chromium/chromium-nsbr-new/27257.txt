<title>Issue 27257 -   chromium -    GNU/Linux: Using as an application going back to it after closing Chrome browser it crashes WITHOUT giving one the option to recover the crashed page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I don't know the exact series of events but using Chrome as a Reader   Application; upon opening several links from Reader; closing them and going   back to the Chrome GReader application; once it has focus it crashed. Might   be a one off; never the less it still shouldn't crash like that especially   NOT giving me the ability to recover what I was reading prior to the crash.                    <b>Please provide
