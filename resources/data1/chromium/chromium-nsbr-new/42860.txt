<title>Issue 42860 -   chromium -    Mac Crash in PullEventsFromWindowServerOnConnection() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> http://crash/reportview?product=Chrome_Mac&amp;version=5.0.375.23&amp;date=&amp;signature=-  2848A1&amp;newsig=    Stack is almost entirely Cocoa stuff  so not posting it.  I note that the OS is always 10.5.8 9L30 or   10.5.8 9L31a  though maybe there just aren't enough crashes in .23 and .17  yet.    Plenty of them in 342.9.  Same two OS versions.    Giving this to Trung because it reminds me of a discussion we had about getting our startup   process right WRT dialing in to find out who wants to open files.  Maybe something subtle is   messed up. </pre>
