<title>Issue 27143 -   chromium -    PRESUBMIT warning when a builder has 4+ pending builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> '4' is arbitrary and can be changed.    Should retrieve <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/json/builders?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/json/builders?</a>  as_text=1 and count the number of items in pending_builds arrays.    The caveat is 'yet another http request on commit' </pre>
