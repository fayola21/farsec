<title>Issue 28022 -   chromium -    Record all child process crashes in UMA logs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we seem to be recording only browser  renderer and plugin crashes.   Now we have several other type of processes. We do not capture the crashes   for these processes but we should (in 4.0.249.0 the highest crash rate by far   is in extension type of process and there is no indication of it on stability   dashboard).    To do this might require changes at several places:  - Changing the proto buffer to have a new field (or more than one field)  - Client side change to record these crashes  - Serer side change to process the new field  - Dashboard change to display the new field   </pre>
