<title>Issue 32649 -   chromium -    Migrate cache directories out of the profile directory and into ~/Library/Caches/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since <a title="Cache dir needs to be under ~/Library/Caches" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14545"> issue 14545 </a>  new profiles created in ~/Library/Application Support will   put their Cache directories in the standard OS X location of ~/Library/Caches.   However  profiles created before this bug was fixed will continue to use the   Cache directory in the profile directory.    After conferring with akalin  we think it's probably best to stage a migration   (or a simple clobber) of these Cache directories from the profile into   ~/Library/Caches for consistency. </pre>
