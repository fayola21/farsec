<title>Issue 29790 -   chromium -    After clicking &quot;Deny&quot; to a dialog that appeared when a website attempted to cause multiple file downloads  a file was still automatically downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Upon visiting encyclopediadramatica.com  a dialog appeared that stated that   the website was attempting to download files to my computer  and if I wanted   to allow it (don't remember exactly what was said). Two seconds after I   clicked &quot;Deny&quot;  a file with a PDF extension was automatically saved to my   downloads folder. It isn't a valid PDF file  but Kaspersky's online virus   scanner says it's clean (<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus">http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus</a>) I've decided   to attach it to the bug report  in case it helps reproduce the issue.    This is probably nothing  but I wanted to double check that the developers   know about this.    I'm using Google Chrome 4.0.249.30 for Linux. </pre>
