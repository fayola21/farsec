<title>Issue 24706 -   chromium -    CPU profiler should support a console interface for start / stop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> FireBug and Safari both support the following Console API for controlling CPU   profiling:    console.profile([title]) - Turns on the JavaScript profiler.  console.profileEnd() - Turns off the JavaScript profiler and prints its report.    DevTools CPU profiler should support them  too. </pre>
