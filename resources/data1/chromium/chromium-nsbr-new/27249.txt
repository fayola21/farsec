<title>Issue 27249 -   chromium -    You should be able to request notification permission using the extension manifest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since we have the manifest  developers should be able to request permission   to show notifications there without having to do it each time via the   infobar.    Something like:    &quot;permissions&quot;: [    &quot;notifications&quot;  ]   </pre>
