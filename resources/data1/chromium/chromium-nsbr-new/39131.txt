<title>Issue 39131 -   chromium -    Support brand codes in installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to be able to create Mac installers with specific brand codes to   track the effectiveness of marketing and bundling deals.    For now we need to support three codes: organic  marketing  and bundle. We   can get specific codes from mlchan.    AFAIK  Keystone now supports sending the brand code in update pings. If so    we need to be able to build three .dmgs (Beta now  stable later). Each   installer would stuff a different brand code into wherever keystone needs it.    This is  obviously  for Google Chrome builds only. It might be possible to   just change the internal signing build to do this. </pre>
