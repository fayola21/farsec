<title>Issue 36045 -   chromium -    Please remove LSB dependency - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Officiel version 39052) beta    Latest version of chrome for Debian installs the &quot;lsb&quot; package  that depends   on lots of stuff like rpm  that is utterly useless to me.    Chrome works fine without the lsb package (I installed chrome ignoring the   dependency).    Could you please remove this dependency?    Regards  /Rasmus B��_��_g Hansen </pre>
