<title>Issue 27158 -   chromium -    Resource tracking can retain several megs of V8 heap memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On GMail - an XHR-intensive application  running with and without resource   tracking can give difference of 2-3 megs for just the first minute of running it.   With time  even more memory can be retained by strings holding XHR   responses.    I understand the need for holding response strings  but this approach causes   at least two concerns:   - it interferes with heap-profiling application  so a developer can get a   wrong impression that an app leaks strings  while it doesn't;   - a renderer may crash as a result of V8 heap exhaustion due to unbounded   memory consumption by response strings. </pre>
