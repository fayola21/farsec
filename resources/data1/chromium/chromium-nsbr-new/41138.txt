<title>Issue 41138 -   chromium -    Installer file too large - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While Setup file for latest version of Firefox is something about 8MB  and   IE8 is 13MB  Chrome's Installer file is nearly 40MB (5 times bigger tan   FF3.6) (3 times bigger than IE8)    This is a negative point for downloaders  specially when IE is already   included in Windows and FF is included in popular linux distributions. </pre>
