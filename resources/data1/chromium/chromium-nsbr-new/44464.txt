<title>Issue 44464 -   chromium -    Implement chrome.windows.onResize event - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 dev        1. Resize Chrome window.      chrome.windows.onResize should fires.      Nothing.    Would be great to implement chrome.windows.onResize event for Chrome's extensions. Now  the   only way to handle resizing is window.onresize within a content script. However  content scripts   can't run on chrome:// . So  I can't handle resizing then the new tab is opened. </pre>
