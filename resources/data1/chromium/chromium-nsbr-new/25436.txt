<title>Issue 25436 -   chromium -    Two compiler warnings building WebCore on Mac (AccessibilityRenderObject  EditorCommand) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Building WebCore on Mac produces two warnings:    /Volumes/Yttrium/src/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/WebCore.gyp/../accessibility/AccessibilityRend  erObject.cpp:2229: warning: 'WebCore::createARIARoleMap()::RoleEntry' declared with greater   visibility than the type of its field 'WebCore::createARIARoleMap()::RoleEntry::ariaRole'  /Volumes/Yttrium/src/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/WebCore.gyp/../editing/EditorCommand.cpp:1  296: warning: 'WebCore::createCommandMap()::CommandEntry' declared with greater visibility than   the type of its field 'WebCore::createCommandMap()::CommandEntry::command'    If these were fixed we could turn on 'treat warnings as errors' in WebCore  which would be a Good   Thing. </pre>
