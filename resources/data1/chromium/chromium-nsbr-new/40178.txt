<title>Issue 40178 -   chromium -    Deleting Canvas elements in the DOM does not free the memory they occupy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create several Canvas elements and render one or more large images inside them  2. Observe Chrome's memory allocation increase to render the images  3. Remove the Canvas elements from the DOM  delete any references to them and to the Image   objects associated with them  4. Observe that Chrome still has the memory allocated  5. Run V8's gc() call from JavaScript  6. Observe the memory allocation unchanged.        We feel like when the Canvas elements are removed  and at the very least when the Canvas   elements are removed and gc() is called  we should get the memory back.        Nothing  memory allocation remains and if you have 50-100 canvas elements which have come   and gone  you essentially leak memory until you start to swap  or so it seems in our tests.    <b>Please provide
