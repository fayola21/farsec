<title>Issue 40908 -   chromium -    URL overwritten when opening new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. On a slow Windows machine  hit &quot;ctl-n&quot; to open a new window  2. The second the window opens  but before the bookmarks on the default   &quot;home&quot; screen have rendered  start typing a URL      When the bookmarks render it won't effect my typing      When the bookmarks finish rendering  the entire URL is selected. This means   that if a user has already typed &quot;http://ww this is replaced by their next   keystroke (&quot;w.google.com&quot;  for example) Obviously this is an incorrect URL    Please provide
