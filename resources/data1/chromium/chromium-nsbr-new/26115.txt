If you have only one (US) input layout you need to enable additional on   eto reproduce this bug. Go to &quot;System Preferences&quot; -&gt; &quot;International&quot; -&gt;   &quot;Input menu&quot;  and check any additional language  Russian for example.   Also check &quot;Show input menu in menu bar&quot; this will show selected   language in menu bar like this <a href="http://grab.by/cOB">http://grab.by/cOB</a> (helps to test a lot). Now   you're able to switch keyboard layout with Command-Space shortcut. It   work anywhere in any application in any conditions (with one exception    you cannot change input layout while focused to password fields).    2. Go to this url <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dc4scxz9_475d4fs4cf8">http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dc4scxz9_475d4fs4cf8</a>    it's a Google Docs text document shared with anyone  anyone can edit.   Google Docs text area is one of places where the problem appears. Try to   type in English  then switch into Russian with Command-Space  this won't   work. Focus to omnibar (or any other part of UI) and switching will work   again.        Input method should work in RTE textareas.        Input method switching doesn't work. </pre>
