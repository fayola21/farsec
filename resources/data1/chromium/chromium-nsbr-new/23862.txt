<title>Issue 23862 -   chromium -    Sparse http cache entry deleted after cancel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Issue a byte range request  2. Cancel it before completion  3. Issue another byte range request to the same url        The entry should not be deleted from the cache. However  if step #3 happens   quickly after #2 and there is pending IO going on while the request gets   cancelled  we may end up with two objects to the same entry (actually  a   single object with refcount of 2)  and new IO operations will fail because   there is still another operation going on (and we cannot support multiple   simultaneous operations with sparse entries)... so the entry gets doomed   when the failure is received by the http cache.   </pre>
