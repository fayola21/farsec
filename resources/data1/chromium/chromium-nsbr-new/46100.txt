<title>Issue 46100 -   chromium -    Sync: Network settings should not be sync-ed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ENVIRONMENT  Google Chrome	6.0.427.0 (Official Build 49010) dev  WebKit	534.1  V8	2.2.12  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.1 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.427.0 Safari/534.1  Command Line	 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --user-data-dir=datadirJune8_B --enable-sync-autofill --enable-apps    REPRO STEPS  0. Two machines A and B  with the latest Chrome build installed  both   clients online and connected to sync server with the same account;  1. On client A: In Options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Network -&gt; [Change proxy settings] -&gt; Proxy Configuration change the proxy settings;   2. Sync both clients.    ACTUAL RESULTS  On client B changes are absorbed (i) instantaneously (ii)  while typing.    EXPECTED RESULTS  (i) Network settings should NOT be synced.   (ii) This is another vector for instantaneous sync (check crbug.com/45602) - should not be happening.    ADDITIONAL INFO  Repros on Linux-Linux.  Was unable to get a repro on Mac-Linux and Win-Linux (mostly due to vastly different network settings interfaces). </pre>
