<title>Issue 26532 -   chromium -    Ugly Font on Tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.223.11  OS version           : 10.5.8      1. Look at the tab bar      A beautifully typed font showing the site's title.      Most likely because the font is too small the font's rendering looks ugly  as if it isn't   smoothed.  I have no idea why but in the screenshot it looks better than it actually is. </pre>
