<title>Issue 43583 -   chromium -    User profile is messed up after closing Chrome without internet connection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.396.0  Operating System: Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit    *What steps will reproduce the problem?*  1. Open Google Chrome  2. Disable internet connections  3. Restart Google Chrome    *What is the expected result?*  User profile should be loaded without any issues.    *What happens instead?*  A dialog pops up with the following message: &quot;Your profile could not be   opened correctly.    Some features may be unavailable.  Please check that the profile exists and   you have permission to read and write its contents.&quot;  This in turn removes all my websites from the new tab page as well as all   icons from the bookmarks bar.    After logging in and out  the profile is back in business.    I use the full Google Sync &quot;suite&quot;  does that have anything to do with it? </pre>
