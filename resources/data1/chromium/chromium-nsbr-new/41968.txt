<title>Issue 41968 -   chromium -    make force build refuse to do silly clobbers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just realized a few folks have done clobber forced builds on Chromium Linux.    It would be nice if the force build page would suppress the option for clobbers on clobber builders   and on testers since clearly the people trying to force clobber builds there don't realize how the   bots in question are configured. </pre>
