<title>Issue 36489 -   chromium -    Tooltips not shown correctly in non-client area when Aero is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     The AeroTooltipManager does not correctly handle tooltips in the non-client area. This is not not   noticable in chrome/chromium as it doesn't have any UI elements in this area. However  I am   working on a deriviative browser which places icons in this area and tooltips do not render   correctly.        Tooltips will render correctly.        Tooltips render in the wrong location or not at all depending upon placement of the browser   window.    <b>Please provide
