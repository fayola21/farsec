<title>Issue 26790 -   chromium -    Different session id on XMLHttpRequest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.223.9 (Official Build 29618)  URL : <a href="http://Prefko.com">http://Prefko.com</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : perfect  Behavior in Firefox 3.x : perfect      1. just opening the page fails    First noticed this with CF while trying to XMLHttpRequest a page and that  page had a different session id on the server side while opening that same  page directly from the address bar showed a proper session id.    To elaborate:  login.jsp gets called and creates a session id e.g. 1111  this then forwards to index.jsp which still has the same session id 1111  index.jsp sends a XMLHttpRequest for a user_data.jsp page and retrieves it  but with a different session id 2222  typing in the location of user_data.jsp retrieves a page with the original  session id 1111    Works properly in Chrome 3  as well as FF 3.x and Safari 3.x and 4.x    This indicated that Chrome 4 is the one causing the issue. </pre>
