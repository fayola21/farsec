<title>Issue 42126 -   chromium -    Authentication prompt in one tab eats &quot;enter&quot; keys pressed in another tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Open a tab with some textarea field  for example the chromium issue   tracker form  2. Open a new tab  navigate to a site requiring HTTP authentication  i.e.   causes the standard Chrome &quot;Authentication Required&quot; prompt to pop up.  3. Enter a valid username/password combination  but do *not* press OK  4. Switch back to the tab with the input field  5. Focus on the texarea and press the &quot;enter&quot; key          A newline should appear in the textarea having focus.          The contents of the textarea remain the same  but when one switches back to   the tab requiring authentication  the credentials have been submitted. That   is  the tab shows the page shielded by the prompt.    If an invalid username/password combination is entered in step 3 above  the   authentication page shows an empty prompt after the enter key has been   pressed in the textarea. So the credentials are submitted  but since they   are invalid  a new (empty) prompt is generated.      <b>Please provide
