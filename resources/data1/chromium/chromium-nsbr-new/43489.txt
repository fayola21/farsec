<title>Issue 43489 -   chromium -    Get rid of the directory fd in Chromium's SQL VFS implementation for Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like sqlite uses the dir fd only to sync the DB files if sqlite was   compiled with SQLITE_NO_SYNC. We do not compile sqlite with that option  so   it should be safe to not have the directory file descriptor around. </pre>
