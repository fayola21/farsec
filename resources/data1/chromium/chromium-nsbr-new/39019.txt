<title>Issue 39019 -   chromium -    Default encoding is Western (ISO-8859-1) instead of UTF-8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev    Default encoding is Western (ISO-8859-1) instead of UTF-8        To use UTF-8 as default encoding instead of ISO-8859-1. This is non locale   dependent.    Chromium should not promote usage of old codepages anymore and should stick   to standards.     </pre>
