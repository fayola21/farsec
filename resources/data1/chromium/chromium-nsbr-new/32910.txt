<title>Issue 32910 -   chromium -    Should we provide some feedback when the user disables notifications for a domain? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if you click on the &quot;options&quot; button on a notification and choose   to disable notifications for the parent domain  there's not much user   feedback  other than the menu closing.    I'm not sure what the right thing to do here is (maybe the UX guys know)    but I'd suggest closing all of the notifications from that domain at least.   </pre>
