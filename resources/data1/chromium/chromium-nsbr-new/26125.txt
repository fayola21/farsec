<title>Issue 26125 -   chromium -    Size of test binaries built by Linux reliability bot are too large  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both automated_ui_tests and reliability_tests are 40M+  more than the size of   chrome itself. This essentially triples the size of binaries we need to copy.    I put it pri 2 as Chromebot linux is not blocked by this bug. But it pays a   significant performance cost. </pre>
