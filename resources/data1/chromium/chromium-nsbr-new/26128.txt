<title>Issue 26128 -   chromium -    Add stub functions to chrome.* APIs for content scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Developers frequently get confused and try to call chrome.* APIs from content   scripts.    We would like to add some stub APIs that would tell developers that these   APIs are not available from content scripts and refer them to the docs on how   to use background pages.    An easy way to do this is like:    chrome.__defineGetter__(&quot;tabs&quot;  function() {    throw new Error(&quot;chrome.tabs is not supported in content scripts&quot;);  }); </pre>
