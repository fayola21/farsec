<title>Issue 24763 -   chromium -    Scrolling goes &quot;through&quot; Chrome instance to background iTunes/Safari - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.

Only Chrome should be interpreting the scroll input.      Chrome and any Mac app with clickthrough  (scrollthrough? at least Safari   and iTunes) will catch the scrolling as well and scroll for no reason.    <b>Please provide
