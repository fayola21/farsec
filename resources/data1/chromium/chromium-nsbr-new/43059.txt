<title>Issue 43059 -   chromium -    Store passwords in a different keychain than the &quot;login&quot; one (in custom keychain) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9  OS version               : 10.6.3    I would like to store chromium passwords in a different keychain than the &quot;login&quot; one. The &quot;login&quot;   keychain is unlocked automatically and stays unlocked (this can be changed  but for various reasons   I don't want to change that behavior). If it would be possible to select a custom keychain  I could   store my internet passwords in a keychain that would have to be unlocked manually. </pre>
