<title>Issue 32244 -   chromium -    find in page feels janky on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to en.wikipedia.org  2. search for something random like &quot;aklsdjaklsjdf&quot;  3. hold backspace to clear the search string.    When I do the above on a machine with a local X server  it's fast and   smoothly backspaces.  When I'm using NX  there are noticeable hangs.  I   wonder if we're querying the X server in a way that blocks the UI?   </pre>
