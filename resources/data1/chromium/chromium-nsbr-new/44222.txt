<title>Issue 44222 -   chromium -    Changes on the pulse build for flash integration - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Adobe is going to sign the chrome integrated flash dll  currently we sign it   but we need to stop doing that.    This is required so some features work.    The files we need to stop signing are:    Windows             gcswf32.dll  Macintosh           Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin  Linux               libflashplayergc.so     </pre>
