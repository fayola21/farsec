<title>Issue 35949 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Linux needs to log crashes. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  I believe crashes get logged to the Event Log  so users can   look up crash report id. This feature doesn't exist on Linux  so oftentimes   we get this conversation:    user: Chrome Linux crashed  dev: What was the crash report id?  user: I don't know  where do I find that?  dev: On the terminal if you ran google-chrome from the terminal.  user: Oh  I didn't run it from the terminal.      Should we log crashes using syslog? Or just write to a text file somewhere?    Also  what's the situation on the Mac? </pre>
