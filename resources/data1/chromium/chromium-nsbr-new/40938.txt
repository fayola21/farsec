<title>Issue 40938 -   chromium -    Give Chrome its own proxy settings! (Windows) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox does this; why can't chrome? Chrome uses the proxy settings set by   Internet Explorer rather than its own  which is a pain to deal with when you   need both browsers to use separate proxies for whatever reason  or you have   crappily written third-party apps that also just cheap out and use IE's proxy   settings  and then break when they hit a proxy meant for Chrome. </pre>
