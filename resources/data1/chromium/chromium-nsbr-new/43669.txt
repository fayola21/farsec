<title>Issue 43669 -   chromium -    Audio playback with no video on Google Chrome Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.start playback on the embedded video  2.middle click and it will stop  3.continue playback and stop      It should have opened the video on a new tab on step two.  And should stop audio playback when you hit stop.      Audio playback continues independently  until you close the tab.  It's really bad when that happens in Google Reader.      <b>Please provide
