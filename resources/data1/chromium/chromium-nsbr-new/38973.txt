<title>Issue 38973 -   chromium -    TCMalloc breaks the Seccomp Sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a number of issues we need to address:  TCMalloc does thread listing in order to support getting thread stacktraces   for the heap checker which needs to analyze the heaps.  The thread lister   examines procfs  which is broken in the sandbox.  It also uses sys_clone() to   startup another thread to do thread listing.  It does lots of things like   that  which are all broken.  TCMalloc uses sys_futex() to do its spinlocking.  TCMalloc uses sys_munmap() and sys_remap() in MallocHook.    We need to investigate whether or not we can replace some of these syscall   invocations with libc function calls. </pre>
