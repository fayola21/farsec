<title>Issue 32836 -   chromium -    Need better testing of sync behavior with network connectivity changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A few recent bugs have made it clear that we don't test sync behavior very   well under network connectivity changes.  This has been exacerbated by   platform-specific differences.  Some ideas:    - Put the now-cross-platform network status detection code behind an   interface so we can use mock instances in tests.  - Some sort of user-visible UI that indicates when sync isn't working (red   light/green light?) </pre>
