<title>Issue 38820 -   chromium -    Web page semi-freezes  at random  when text is selected. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit web page (any - no rhyme or reason to which pages freeze - does  not happen every time)  2. Select some section of page text    I use Chrome to visit scores / hundreds of pages a day (depending)  and it  happens daily  sometimes as much as 5 times per day.        To use a web page without it locking up.        On the pages that freeze  you will be unable to use the vertical scroll   click HTML hyperlinks  or right-click mouse to view source.  However  on  the current frozen page  I can press the 'play' and 'pause' button for the  flash video player.  I do not know if flash is a common theme on these  frozen pages.    The page will not return to 'normal'  even after an extended wait  but you  can close the tab easily enough.  It does not crash Chrome  it just freezes  the existing web page so that most elements will not work.    Also - my chrome extension page (chrome://extensions/) just froze up in the  same way. I guess this isn't limited to traditional web pages.      <b>Please provide
