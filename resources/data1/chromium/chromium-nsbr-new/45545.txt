<title>Issue 45545 -   chromium -    cursor randomly drops ability to cut/copy/paste and move up/down page using bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. install any version of Chromium 64 on 64-bit Linux distro of your choice  2. open Chromium and surf the web  3. wait for Chromium to drop         To retain the ability to highlight cut copy paste text  to navigate a page  using scroll bar.         The browser drops this function and it becomes impossible to highlight  text/links  and to copy or cut that text or link.    This happens with all versions of Chromium that I have used over the last  few weeks. I have this bug on Mandriva Free 64 and Arch 64.     <b>Please provide
