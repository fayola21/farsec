<title>Issue 44006 -   chromium -    Chrome  esp. Flash use  uses too much CPU and is not green. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a chrome session with the FlashBlock extension and the Options   for Javascript *disabled* except for select (generally non-commercial)   sites.  2. Restart/Start large chrome session with a variety of pages  some of   which typically require Flash.  Typically 100-200 tabs.  3. Run chrome session for a number of days (say 4+ days).      When the computer is unused for N minutes (N from 5-30) it should enter   power saving mode with a reduced clock speed (as observed in Gnome by a   decreasing of the clock rate when using the p4-clockmod configuration   options on a Pentium IV Prescott  or on ACPI power regulated systems by   entering a lower power/low-clock rate state.      Even though the session is largely inactive (nobody at the   monitor/keyboard/mouse) chrome continues to accumulate CPU time and   prevents the computer from entering power-saving/suspend states.  CPU is   typically clocked at 2.1 to 2.8 GHz even though the only active window is   the chrome window in which I am typing this bug.  Reasonable clock speeds   under such situations should be &lt; 750 MHz (with associated power   reductions).      <b>Please provide
