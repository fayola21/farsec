<title>Issue 35598 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Cookies] Unfriendly error messages are shown for extensions when &quot;Block sites from setting any data&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install several extensions like aniWeather  Cooliris  etc  2. Set the &quot;Block sites from setting any data&quot; in &quot;Content Settings&quot; --&gt;  &quot;Cookies&quot;  3. Close and then relaunch chrome      Different kind of unfriendly error messages are shown like &quot;Error:  QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR: DOM Exception 22&quot;  &quot;SmoothScroll: Please restart  chrome&quot; and etc. These are really confusing to users as a result they don't  know what happened to their chrome. Chrome should show some meaningful and  friendly message so that users could resolve their problems.       </pre>
