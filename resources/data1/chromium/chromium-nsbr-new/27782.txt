Click the &quot;Edit&quot; link on the &quot;Repeat&quot; line beneath &quot;When&quot;  4. Change the value of the &quot;Repeat Every&quot; drop-down menu      Chrome tab doesn't crash.      Chrome tab crashes (&quot;Aw  Snap!&quot;).    It's important to note that not only does the tab that contains Google   Calendar crashes  if another tab spawned Google Calendar  it crashes TOO.    Specifically  sign in to Gmail and click the &quot;Calendar&quot; link at the top of the   window.  Google Calendar opens in a new tab.  Follow the steps above and   when the tab that contains Google Calendar crashes  the Gmail tab ALSO   crashes. </pre>
