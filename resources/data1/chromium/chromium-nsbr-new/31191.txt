<title>Issue 31191 -   chromium -    Chrome should not let KDE munge text colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.276.0 (0)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : kde  compiz  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): unknown    May require &quot;ratchet and clank&quot; theme to replicate.    Major usability issue?:   Bookmark toolbar might use system color scheme? If the user selects one of   the default light-on-dark color schemes (or even creates his own)  this   results in white text on a nearly white background for the bookmarks   toolbar.    Solution:  All accessors to system color scheme should be unavailable to anything that   draws UI elements  such as themes (it is extremely common for theme authors   to not consider light-on-dark system font colors). Alternatively  accessors   could be available but with a major warning in the hook's name  e.g.   getSystemFontColor_dark and getSystemFontColor_light (returns black/white   if system font brightness is significantly different than target   brightness  else returns system font color). </pre>
