<title>Issue 28452 -   chromium -    Make iGoogle migration easier for FF/IE users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have no idea how representative of a sample this is  but my mother just   told me that the reason she doesn't use Chrome is that &quot;her Google doesn't   look the same in Chrome as it does in Firefox.&quot; Translating  she has iGoogle   on Firefox and she is signed in (and stays signed in)  when she goes to   google.com in Chrome  she's not signed in (and she doesn't know that she   needs to sign in)  and then even if she does figure out she needs to sign in    she still has to click iGoogle to get her customized google home page.    This is pretty basic  and it's sad to hear someone say they don't use Chrome   because &quot;their google doesn't look the same.&quot; Is there anything we can do in   the import process to bring over things like Google settings? </pre>
