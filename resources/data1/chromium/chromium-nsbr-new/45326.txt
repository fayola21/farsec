<title>Issue 45326 -   chromium -    Prevents Program running properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My son who looks after my system rates Chrome and insisited on switching   me over from IE for improved security and speed.  Speed yes  increased   security - maybe.    However  apart from Tabs overwriting pages and causing frustration and   time-wasting while I find what I was working on  there are various items   that do not 'work' in Chrome either at all  or as well as under IE.    One that has wasted several hours over the weekend was its refusal to   display pages from RoyalMail.com correctly. Try as I might I could not get   past a certain page - attached as PROBLEM.doc. I use this postage facility   most days and it is very annoying as the alternative is queuing for ages   at the Post Office - a few miles away!    Now back with IE the system runs okay - attached as SOLVED.doc. It is not   brilliant Mark One was better  Mark Two has more colourful graphics which   are unnecessary when doing a job of work. A pretty front page is fine but   once past that I cannot see why we have to endue 'programmer's pet   gimmicks' rather than plain simplicity!  Please note.  Not your fault -   the Royal Mail is to blame but the page hanging is down to Chrome!!!!!     </pre>
