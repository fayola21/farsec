<title>Issue 42303 -   chromium -    Call of undefined JavaScript variable returns HTML-object with same id - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1059 (44723)  URL : see attached file  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : alerts 'object'  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: alerts 'undefined' (as expected)      1. Open attached html file    What is the expected result?  the alert window should alert &quot;undefined&quot; as the variable has not been   defined in the JavaScript-code.    What happens instead?  It alerts the html object of the element with that id.    If the variable has been defined previously  it behaves as expected and   does not alert the html object anymore. </pre>
