<title>Issue 33233 -   chromium -    Metrics upload from renderer should use PostDelayedTask to avoid interfering with page loads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At the end of render_view.cc  after all page load metrics have been   summarized in histograms  a call to RenderThread::current()-  &gt;SendHistograms().    The above call does lead to a PostTask  but this body of code is now run as   we're about to load a new page (and not after the timed page was loaded).    We should (instead of calling SendHistograms() here  place the call *after*   we've loaded the replacement page (perhaps after the onload event??)  and   even then  we should add some slack via a PostDelayedTask(). </pre>
