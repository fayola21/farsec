<title>Issue 27841 -   chromium -    Improve our color choices for artist themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Ben:    &quot;From what Glen tells me  in most cases the artist just supplied an  image and we did the color selections for other bits. This tells me we  screwed up in selecting good colors  and for a lot of the themes it's  something we could fix.&quot; </pre>
