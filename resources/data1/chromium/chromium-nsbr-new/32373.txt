<title>Issue 32373 -   chromium -    ALT+NUMPAD7 makes the tab &quot;partially&quot; switch to chrome://newtab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  OS: Windows XP SP3  Keyboard: Keyboard without physical Numerical keys. Numerical keys must be   entered by combining FN-key + some other keys (mapping: 7890 = 789*  UIOP =   456-  JKL: = 123+  M&gt;? = 0./)    How ro reproduce:  - have a tab with a webpage open  focus doesn't matter.  - hold left ALT and press numpad 1  then 7  then 4    Expected behavior:  - character ��_��_ (charcode 174) is inserted at the position of the cursor  if   an input field was focused.    Actual behavior:  - as soon as you press NUMPAD7 (keydown)  while holding the ALT key  the   content of the tab changes to the NEW TAB page  - the address bar changes the url to chrome://newtab  - the TAB title is NOT changed to &quot;New Tab&quot;  it keeps the title of the   previous webpage  - the Back and Forward buttons are disabled    After this  if you press F5 to reload:  - the PREVIOUS site reloads and shows up  not the New Tab page  - history buttons work again.  - The address bar also changes back to the address of that site.      After trying to reproduce  I found different misbehaviors. Sometimes the   tab content doesn't change  and only the tab title and address change.   Sometimes the address bar changes to about:blank. Sometimes history buttons   DID work. Behavior seems unpredictable. </pre>
