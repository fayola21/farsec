<title>Issue 27697 -   chromium -    hash-change-with-xhr.html fails in test_shell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run LayoutTests/storage/hash-change-with-xhr.html in test_shell.        It should pass. Instead  it fails.        It looks like a navigation bug  rather than a DB bug. It looks like the &quot;go back&quot;   action kills the MessageLoop of the DB thread  thus not allowing it to run any   transaction. When run in Chromium  the test seems to run a couple of transactions   before going back to the previous page (instead of just navigating to other   fragments on the same page). So again  it looks like a navigation bug.   </pre>
