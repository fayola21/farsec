<title>Issue 30365 -   chromium -    BMB right click context menu displays farwary  with keyboard navigation. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.269.0 (Official Build 34401)    -Trun on BMB  -Alt+shift+b to get keyboard focus on Toolbar.  -Hit tab key to get keyboard focus on BMB (bookmarks bar).  -While focus is on a bookmark  hit context menu key to get context menu.    Issue:  As shown in the screenshot  thought focus is on the first bookmark on the   bar  the context menu is always displayed at a fixed position irrespective   of keyboard focus.    PS:  In previous builds  step 3 will perform getting keyboard focus on to   Omnibox and then to content area. I don't know  we really changed this   behavior to BMB or not  but I liked this :).   </pre>
