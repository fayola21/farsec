<title>Issue 45643 -   chromium -    Mixed content warning should make details accessible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the user goes to a page with mixed content (e.g. http content on an   https page)  it should be possible for a user to get more information without   having to dig through the inspector. Ideally  clicking on the mixed content   indicator in the omnibox would bring up something saying that there is mixed   content  and this message would include something (link/button) that could be   clicked to get detail on what was loaded insecurely. </pre>
