<title>Issue 43595 -   chromium -    Sometimes the plugin doesn't load on Youtube - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Build ufficiale 46416) dev    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Google#grid/user/12E3C2A3C2C732BC">http://www.youtube.com/user/Google#grid/user/12E3C2A3C2C732BC</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK?          1. Go To any YouTube user defined playlist of videos  2. load the first one        At the end of each video the next one should be loaded.      SOMETIMES the next video is not loaded and a &quot;Missing Plugin&quot; appears   instead. I am forced to click on that video to reload.    I suppose the flash plugin instance is not cleared properly or there is   something wrong in Youtube code. It seems to work fine with firefox.   </pre>
