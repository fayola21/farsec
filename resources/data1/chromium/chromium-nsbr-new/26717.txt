Click &quot;New folder&quot; button on the sheet to create a folder under &quot;Bookmark bar&quot;  4. &quot;New folder&quot; titled folder is created on the sheet ( this is the default name of the folder created   )  5.  Double click on the folder title and clear the complete title of the folder  6.  Give Input &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;URL&quot; on the sheet  7.  &quot;OK&quot; button gets enabled and click &quot;OK&quot; ( Screen shot attached for reference )    Actual: An untitled folder is said to be created on bookmark bar. Folder icon ( with no name ) is   saved on the BMB     What is the expected output?   &quot;OK&quot; button should get disabled if there is no title for the folder.  - We don't allow to create no title folders via &quot;Add Folder..&quot; option from bookmark contextual   menu  similarly it would be good &quot;Add Page&quot; sheet follows the same uniformity.  ( Attached -2 )    How does Windows and linux handle ?  When there is no title for the folder name &quot;OK&quot; button goes disables. </pre>
