<title>Issue 43879 -   chromium -    DevTools Resources TAB: group by protocol/domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev    It would be nice to quickly see in the resources TAB of the DevTools from which domains and which   protocols (http and https) the resources were loaded. It could be implemented as a filter in the   toolbar  which offers a drop down list of all protocol/domain-combinations used in the page. </pre>
