<title>Issue 27895 -   chromium -    Add chrome-xp-3 / XP Interactive Perf to buildbot master - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary: Add chrome-xp-3 / XP Interactive Perf to buildbot master.    Need a slave that we access via VNC instead of RDP to accurately measure   jank.  chrome-xp-3 is set up  installed in 1950.  An updated configuration   was checked in at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32072">r32072</a> that adds chrome-xp-3 and XP Interactive Perf to the   buildbot master.    Remaining steps:  - restart master with new config  - shutdown chrome-xp-4 slave scripts (master won't know about it  so access   will be denied)  - verify chrome-xp-3 can connect (it currently gets access denied because   master doesn't know about it)  - run chrome-xp-3 slave script (it will now be running tests that chrome-xp-4   used to run)  - decommission/reassign chrome-xp-4 </pre>
