<title>Issue 39508 -   chromium -    move context menu API out of experimental - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once we're happy with the base set of features and ready to commit to   supporting it long-term  we need to move it from   chrome.experimental.contextMenu to chrome.contextMenu.    I've set this bug to be blocked on several issues that need to be fixed for   us to do this.   </pre>
