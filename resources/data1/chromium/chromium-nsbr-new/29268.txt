<title>Issue 29268 -   chromium -    javascript event handlers deleted when text matching the handler is present in the URI string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.227            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 6: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK       Opera 10: OK      1. Create a file called example.html with the following content :  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('success'); return false;&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/A&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2. First try opening the file normally (url reads &quot;...example.html&quot;) and  clicking the text. It will pop up a message box.    3. Now open the file and append text which matches the event handler to the  URI string. The message box will no longer fire because Chrome is now  deleting the onclick event handler for some reason.    (url reads &quot;...example.com?onclick=&quot;alert('success');%20return%20false;&quot;    4. Now repeat the above step  but slightly alter the text in the URI string  so it is not identical to the text in the HTML page. In this case  we add  an extra space. The message box now pops up again  Chrome has ceased to  delete the onclick event handler.    (url reads &quot;...example.com?onclick=&quot;alert('success');%20%20return%20false;&quot;        The browser should trigger the onClick javascript handler and pop up a  message box.      When a string identical to the event handler in the HTML page body is also  present in the URI string it somehow causes the onClick handler specified  in the HTML body to be deleted. This means no message box pops up when one  is expected.    Changing the text of URI string so that it is slightly different  even by a  single space  will prevent the issue from manifesting. However  it should  not be occurring in the first place.     </pre>
