<title>Issue 27739 -   chromium -    Clear Specific Saved Form Data with right click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request: (please tag with this  I do not know how)    Many current browsers (including chrome) provide a function to &quot;remember   saved form data&quot; including phone numbers  email addresses and other pieces   of data entered into forms by users. When submitted  these pieces of data   are remembered by browsers and associated with the title of the input   field.    This is designed to be (and is) a massive help to users when filling out   form information. Saving time and perhaps helping a user remember certain   data (such as a username).      Browsers also provide a function (somewhere) to delete all of this saved   form information.      In chrome &quot;clear browsing data...&quot; gives users an option to &quot;clear saved   form information&quot; from different periods of time (last day  last weeks    last 4 weeks or all time).      This is needed as users may type sensitive data into a particular form   which a user does not want a browser to remember. For example online   banking details in non-password fields. Or credit card details in an online   shop.      Clearing all saved form data from all time is quite impractical for most   users (as this defeats the whole point of it remembering users details;   speed and forgetting usernames etc.)      There are certain situations currently when a user might have to undertake   this impractical action (of clearing all saved form information).    * If a user forgets to use incognito mode  and:  * If a user enters sensitive form information into a form that they then do   not return to for some time  and thus do not realise that the data was   saved.  * If a different (permitted) user enters other data in a form that the   normal user would like to remove.      Current implementation:     User would have to remove all saved form data.    Desired implementation:   *  User has option to remove individual piece of data  perhaps through   right clicking on the saved form data currently being provided as an option   by the browser.   *  User has single unified login to chrome and can log-out  with chrome   remembering saved form information when logged-in and forgetting any data   submitted while a user was logged-out.
