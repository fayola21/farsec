<title>Issue 30412 -   chromium -    best revision changelist failed compile on linux official builder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the Dec 9th daily dev build  we auto-selected the best cl src@34130    although this CL failed compile on Linux (also failed on mac  passed on   windows). The particular failure was a real failure for both debug &amp;   optimized builds. The scoring for the email reported:    Revision: 34130 Points: [179/180] Valid: True Errors: []  Revision: 34129 Points: [179/180] Valid: True Errors: []  Revision: 34127 Points: [179/180] Valid: True Errors: []  Revision: 34126 Points: [179/180] Valid: True Errors: []    Although when looking at the chromium linux builder directly    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Google%20Chrome%2">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Google%20Chrome%2</a>  0Linux/builds/5248    Branch: src  Revision: 34130    compile [compile failed] [387 seconds]    actual failure from stdio log:    /usr/bin/ld: out/Release/lib.target/third_party/ffmpeg/libffmpegsumo.so:   error: undefined reference to 'h264_mp4toannexb_bsf'  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status  make: *** [out/Release/ffmpegsumo_nolink] Error 1    I would expect the revision we started with (34130) to pass compile on the   linux builders given the score of 179/180. It may be that the json results   we are parsing are incorrect. At a minimum  we should start saving the   output of the json query for after the fact investigations. </pre>
