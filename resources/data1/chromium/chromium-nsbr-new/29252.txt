<title>Issue 29252 -   chromium -    Picasa Web slideshow sometimes has images displaced in Chrome/Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21 (Official Build 33275)        Firefox 3.x: OK (3.0.15)    Using chrome on Linux (4.0.249.21 (Official Build 33275))  visit an album   with plenty of big images  such as this one:    <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/credentiality/FooCamp#slideshow/537711518809717">http://picasaweb.google.com/credentiality/FooCamp#slideshow/537711518809717</a>  0514    Click slideshow  then start clicking quickly forward or back through the   images.  Every once in a while you'll see an image show up much lower on   the page than it should  and if you stop at just the right time  it'll stay   misplaced. (Takes me 10-30sec to reproduce).    Firefox seems to be unaffected.    Screenshots attached.  The displacement is always consistent for a given   window size  but if I resize it looks like the displacement is different.     </pre>
