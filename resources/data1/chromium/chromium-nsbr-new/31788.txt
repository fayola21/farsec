<title>Issue 31788 -   chromium -    Adding an extension that is disabled looks like it failed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Gmail Notification extension  2. Disable Gmail notification  3. Try to install the gmail notification extension again      It should do something  either re-enable it and give you the &quot;extension installed/re-enabled&quot;   bubble  or give you a message that it's already installed and tell you how to re-enable it.  Instead it   does nothing.         </pre>
