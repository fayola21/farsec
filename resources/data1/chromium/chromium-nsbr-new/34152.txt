<title>Issue 34152 -   chromium -    Automatic Downloads without user prompt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Simple javascript document.write embed's a new iframe into an html   document. If the source of the iframe is an execeutable  a tar  or another   file that does not fall under the heading of filetypes that the chrome   browser opens itself (i.e. html  gif  mp3  etc...) the file is downloaded   automatically to the user's machine without a prompt for their consent.    This is only really dangerous if it used to upload disguised malware to a   users machine which they subsequently execute  compromising their   system.    Attatched is a simple html file which  when loaded  begins an automatic   download. This version simply uploads a copy of the linux kernel source   code to the users machine.    A clever hack artist could disguise a malware program and fool a user into   launching it.    Good will to the chromium team! </pre>
