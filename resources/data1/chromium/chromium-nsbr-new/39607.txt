<title>Issue 39607 -   chromium -    Cannot Scroll DOwn Bookmark Folders Since 3-26-10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Opening a bookmark folder from the bookmark bar                This just started happening to me tonight. Some of my bookmark folders are really long  and I   often times need to locate bookmarks that are new  and hence reside at the bottom of the list of   bookmarks. Normally  I click the bookmark folder to expand it and drop it down. The bottom of   the bookmark list usually stops near the lower browser edge. I drag my arrow to the bottom of   the drop-down list and Chrome scrolls through the surplus list of bookmarks until it reaches the   last bookmark  if that makes any sense.    Now all the sudden  the drop-down list extends beyond the bottom edge of my desktop screen   and I an not able to force Google to scroll through the list of bookmarks.    Also  the layout of the bookmarks inside the drop down list is different somehow  with the titles   of the bookmarks spilling over the left edge of the drop down list and there is more space   between the bookmarks. Just very weird how everyone is having this problem.    I have a brand new iMac  with the lastest version of Snow Leopard 10.6.2    <b>Please provide
