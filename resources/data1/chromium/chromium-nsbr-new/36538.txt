<title>Issue 36538 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Treat all cookies as session cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta (Linux)    Other browsers allow you to treat all cookies as session cookies. Google   chrome doesn't offer this. It's an easy work-around to use sqlite3 to delete   cookies on startup via the wrapper script but it should be a feature of the   browser.    This is a good compromise between privacy and functionality  it also allows   Google and other advertisers to do more tracking than the Block all cookies   option  which is supplied. So why is this option not there? </pre>
