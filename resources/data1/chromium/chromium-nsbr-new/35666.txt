<title>Issue 35666 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Transparent webpages allowing interaction between 1 infront and 1 behind with copying and pasting etc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many times I have information I want to copy from 1 page to another whether   it be form filling or research.    Instead of switching between 2 tabs or putting the 2 pages into windows next   to each other I would like to be able to have the destination webpage eg   google docs or a form page visible through the active viewing page i am on eg   wikipedia.    Be able to highlight text or image from eg wiki and simply drag into place   into google docs page that i can see behind. So essentially the current   webpage i am on is active  as soon as I highlight or click on something and   begin to drag it triggers the webpage behind to become active and accept the   information dragged once i unclick in the wanted position. </pre>
