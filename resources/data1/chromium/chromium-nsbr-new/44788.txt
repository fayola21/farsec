<title>Issue 44788 -   chromium -    using multiple app shortcuts causes hilarity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to and sign in  2. Create an application shortcut  3. Go to google calendar   4. Create application shortcut  5. Close both gmail and calendar app windows  6. Launch Gmail via shortcut  7. Launch Calendar via shortcut    I would have expected calendar to actually launch  but instead  I get   another version of Gmail. Also  while I can't repro now  I've also see the   shortcut icons change over time--my calendar shortcut became a gmail   shortcut.             </pre>
