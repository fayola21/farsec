<title>Issue 33203 -   chromium -    When can I expect help re: open issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : newly installed today    I'm finding this forum very confusing (unlike conventional forums). I have no   idea when the bugs I reported  such as 33194  can expect to be resolved. I   also find that this board's encryption of contact data leaves alot to be   desired. It shouldn't display as many as 5 characters!    I'm also wondering about the inconsistency of there being a horizontal   scrollbar (above taskbar) in the Issues Interface  but not in the Project   Home Listing. </pre>
