<title>Issue 25262 -   chromium -    excessive caching of extension source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I encountered this while testing a new browser extension that I'm coding.  1.  Copy a changed version of the extension to some web-accessible   directory.  2.  Reload the extension in chrome.  3.  Repeat.  At some point  chrome somehow gets a cached copy of the extension source   file from the directory (I'm guessing in its web cache)  and reloading the   extension has no effect (i.e. it doesn't pick up the changed file).  It's   necessary to open that file in chrome (http://&lt;my extension path&gt;) and do a   SHIFT-reload) to bypass the cache.  Then the next extension reload works.    Pretty mysterious error at first  and then annoying.                  <b>Please provide
