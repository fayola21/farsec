<title>Issue 37251 -   chromium -    XMLHTTP GET request to local network is still issued despite returning error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : ALL so far.    Chrome has a protection for cross site xmlhttp access BUT there is a big   security issue:    If from a javascript on a site I do an xmlhttp GET request pointing to   192.168.1.1 for example  the request IS ISSUED. The script returns an   error  but the GET is issued.    With such a request I could make a proof of concept which remotely resets   (I could even do some modifications!) a few ADSL routers (including the   vodafone station) because they just need a GET to do things since they   trust the local network.    This issue qualifies for the google bug hunting.  Check it out and don't forget.    I can provide the proof of concept if needed  but my descriptions seems   enough to me.   </pre>
