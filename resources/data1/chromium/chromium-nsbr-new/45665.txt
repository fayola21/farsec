<title>Issue 45665 -   chromium -    Hebrew Nikud is not handled correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copied from <a title="Hebrew spellcheck does not support acronyms  Maqaf and Niqqud"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22909">bug 22909</a> comment 14:     At <a href="http://www.thmrsite.com/?p=1082">http://www.thmrsite.com/?p=1082</a>     Whenever there's a punctuated word in a line all  the words that are prior   to is will lose their kerning in a funny way and merge into  each other    Try browsing the page   Some of the punctuated words appear right while others have kerning issues    ------------------    I think this is rather serious and we'd better fix it before M6. There are   other complex script rendering issues (like <a title="Devanagari / Thai shaping broken "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43951">bug 43951</a>). This and <a title="Devanagari / Thai shaping broken "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43951">bug 43951</a>   may share the same root cause.      </pre>
