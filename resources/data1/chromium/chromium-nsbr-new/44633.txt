<title>Issue 44633 -   chromium -    Long alert box locks up Chrome completely  force quit required - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:    Firefox 3.x: OK ish - you can at least get to a close.      1.popup a javascript alert with enough text that the alert's height becomes larger than the screen   resolution.      that i can scroll the alert box and close the alert to return to the browser (ideally from both the   top and bottom of the alert box)          the alert is so long  has no visible close controls and cannot be scrolled that it locks chrome   completely from use.    additionally you cannot quit chrome by sending a quit message from right-cliking the chrome   dock icon.    the only way to resolve this situation is to load Activity Monitor and Force Quit.   </pre>
