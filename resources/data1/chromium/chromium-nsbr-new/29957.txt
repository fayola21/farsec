<title>Issue 29957 -   chromium -    Menus unusable in multi-monitor setup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Set up multi-monitor with screens one above the other.  My setup - using xrandr  xrandr --output VGA1 --auto --output LVDS1 --auto --below VGA1  VGA is 1680x1050  LVDS is 1280x800  2.If necessary  launch and/or move Chromium to the bottom screen (primary    contains KDE panel) and maximize.  (In my testing  it doesn't matter if Chromium is launched before or after   setting up the monitors)      Menu show up in the same way it does in single-monitor setup or in my   multi-monitor setup on the upper monitor.      See attachment. The menu shows only a single line which apart from being   unnecessary  makes it impossible to read the items when scrolling the menu.      <b>Please provide
