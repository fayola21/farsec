<title>Issue 30848 -   chromium -    Regression: Windows 7 Jumplists Disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0      1. Attempt to Open Jumplist in Windows 7      It will open a Jumplist (using same icon on taskbar)      If you have an icon with a jumplist  it will open in a new icon.  If you do not have an icon with a Jumplist  you   can't access one.    I tried uninstalling and reinstalling  same behavior. </pre>
