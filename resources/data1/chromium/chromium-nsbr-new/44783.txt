<title>Issue 44783 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Holding ctrl-t causes UI to &quot;hang&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hold ctrl-t.    We'll draw the start of a tab animation  but then until you let go  the UI   will not update at all.  Once you let go  you have lots of tabs.    We need to rapidly animate tabs appearing instead of showing nothing.    Compare with holding ctrl-w on a tabstrip with tons of tabs; in that case  it   animates things closed rapidly. </pre>
