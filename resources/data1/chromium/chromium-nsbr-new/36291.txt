<title>Issue 36291 -   chromium -    Duplicated display of storage db when running Web SQL from an iframe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to   <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~ernestd/samples/websql_fail/test2.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~ernestd/samples/websql_fail/test2.html</a>  2. See the Storage section in the dev tools  3. Every time the iframe is loaded the icon of the database is duplicated   (see attachment).    Tested on mac. I have been told it also happens from when running from   an extension.    What is the expected output?  Show one single instance of the database in the dev tools  What do you see instead?  A duplicate for every reload </pre>
