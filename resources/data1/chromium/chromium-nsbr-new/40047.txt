<title>Issue 40047 -   chromium -    Browser actions/page actions/similar should dismiss bubbles when user clicks again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you click a browser action  page action  or another address bar icon   (e.g. the popup blocked icon)  a bubble appears.  Click anywhere off the   bubble and it dismisses--EXCEPT if you click on the icon itself  in which   case it dismisses and reappears.    This looks especially bad with browser actions which take forever to show   their bubbles.    The cause is that the bubble is a separate window which closes on losing   activation  and that happens before the browser gets to process the click   message.    We &quot;fixed&quot; this with the old Star button by ignoring clicks for 40 ms after   the bubble closed.  Hacky  and subject to edge case problems for rapid   clickers or slow machines.  Now that I'm moving the star button to look   like a page action  it gains this problem.    It would be nice to fix this by somehow realizing that a particular click   closed the bubble  so we could ignore just that click.  I suppose we could   try to make the bubbles not auto-close when losing activation but instead   have the browser close them when it gets a click off the bubble... there   are minefields in this direction though. </pre>
