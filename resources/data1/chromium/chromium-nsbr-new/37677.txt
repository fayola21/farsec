<title>Issue 37677 -   chromium -    Opening the extension options page from incognito fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Enable an extension in incognito.  2. Open an incognito window.  3. Either:  3a. Right-click the browser action and select Options. OR  3b. Go to the extensions management page and select Options.  4. The page opens in incognito and fails.    Opening extension pages in incognito windows is infeasible  but we should   open it in a regular browser window. </pre>
