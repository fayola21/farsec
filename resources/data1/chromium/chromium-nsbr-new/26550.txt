<title>Issue 26550 -   chromium -    need WebKit API for computing a RenderView's current intrinsic height - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I added this feature request upstream:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31036">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31036</a>    James suggested that I should file a companion bug locally against the webkit   API.    Getting this fixed for mstone-4 would be great  but it's not strictly a   blocker  it's more of a polish thing.   </pre>
