<title>Issue 35501 -   chromium -    Multiple keywords for search engines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev      1. Open search engines manager.  2. Try to enter multiple keywords for particular search engine  separate   them by comas or spaces or something else.  3. Use any of provided keywords to search through that search engine.      Multiple keywords used.      Multiple keywords not used.    This feature will be extremely useful for multilingual systems because that   way user may specify two or more keywords in different languages. One for   English layout  one for  say  Russian  and so on  up to the number of   installed keyboard layouts.    For example  I use keyword &quot;w&quot; for English Wikipedia searches  &quot;wr&quot; for   Russian Wikipedia searches. Suppose I have some term to search already in   my clipboard  I need to make sure that my current keyboard layout is   English  switch the layout if needed  type the keyword  then paste the term   and hit Return.    To avoid this I have duplicated search engine entries and assigned them   &quot;same&quot; keywords but in different layout. For above example and Russian   layout they became &quot;��_��_&quot; and &quot;��_��___&quot;. So I do not need to check and switch   layouts anymore.    That trick is very handy and  as far as I know  many users from different   countries with non-latin based alphabets are using it. But duplication of   search engines is very unfriendly. </pre>
