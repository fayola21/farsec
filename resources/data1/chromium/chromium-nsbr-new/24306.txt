<title>Issue 24306 -   chromium -    Bookmark chevron should throb until user clicks it after merge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I merge a second computer's bookmarks  the bookmarks on that computer's   bookmark bar are added to my existing bookmarks  but if I have a lot of   bookmarks on my current bookmarks bar they are added to the chevron overflow   menu. This makes it a little hard to tell that the merge worked - it wasn't   clear to me where the bookmarks went.    It'd be nice to pulsate the chevron after the merged items are added there.   The chevron already pulsates for a short time after a bookmark is added to   the bookmark bar and goes into the menu. I would say that in this case after   the merge the chevron menu should pulsate until the user clicks on it. </pre>
