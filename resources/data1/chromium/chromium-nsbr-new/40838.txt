<title>Issue 40838 -   chromium -    ffmpeg unittest needed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create a unittest that actually uses ffmpeg.  The test should include #ifdef on branding  and use an mp4 for chrome and   ogv for chromium.  The test could live in either src/thirdparty/ffmpeg or src/media  I would lean toward src/media because the test will be  1. similar to other media unittests in terms of unit testing infrastruction  2. similar to ffmpeg_tests or media_bench for how to decode a movie  3. needs data.  ideally we'd use chromeos's hardware validation media    which includes samples of all file formats.  But for now we have C:chrome-  svnsrcmediatestdatabear.1280x720.mp4 and could add an ogv.  This unittest would help catch regressions quickly  especially for chrome    which doesn't benefit as much from layout tests that only test ogg.  mime_util can be used as reference for branding.  srcnetbasemime_util.cc  #if defined(GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD)    // MPEG-4.    &quot;video/mp4&quot;    </pre>
