Create a bookmark folder and put bookmarks inside of it  2. Middle click on this folder      All bookmarks inside that folder should open up in the same window into   separate tabs       If Linux Chrome doesn't have this  it is a platform parity bug.    (See <a title="Middle click on folder in Bookmarks bar should open all bookmarks" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=529"> Issue 529 </a> for Windows implementation.) </pre>
