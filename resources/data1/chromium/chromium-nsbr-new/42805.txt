<title>Issue 42805 -   chromium -    Notifications should be seen even in Incognito when allowed from a normal window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://goto.ext.google.com/notification.html">http://goto.ext.google.com/notification.html</a>  2. Click on 'request permission' button and allow notifications  3. Open Incognito window and go to   <a href="http://goto.ext.google.com/notification.html">http://goto.ext.google.com/notification.html</a>  4. Click on show    What is the expected output?   Notifications should be seen as the domain already has permission    What do you see instead?  User has to allow the same domain again to see notifications    Since we allow Incognito to access all the data that's stored using normal   window  it should work for notifications as well.    Google Chrome 5.0.375.25 (Official Build 45690)   </pre>
