<title>Issue 43757 -   chromium -    &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; submenu UI issue  when Chrome window is expanded to fill screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 (Also tested on latest Dev)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Correct behaviour  submenu      1. Click on &quot;other bookmarks menu&quot;  2. Scroll down to bookmark  let menu open  3. Submenu opens        On Chrome for Windows (shown in 1st attachment)  the submenu opens to the left edge of the   main menu  so you can go back to the menu item below the one opened  if you want to  without   the submenu getting in the way.        On Chrome for Mac (shown in 2nd attachment)  the submenu opens over the top of the main   menu. This means when you try to go back to the menu entry below the one opened  the   submenu gets in the way of doing this. This bug only seems to occur when you have the Chrome   window resized to fill the available width of the screen. When window is not fully maximised    submenu opens to the right of the main menu  negating issue. </pre>
