<title>Issue 29127 -   chromium -    User sees no status bubble or find bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A user reports that they never get a status bubble or find bar.  See screenshot.    I suspect something about font metrics may be wrong.  Turning on   antialiasing didn't help this problem.  Tony suggests maybe we're layering wrong in the floating container.    Hitting ctl-f then typing *does* produce a search. </pre>
