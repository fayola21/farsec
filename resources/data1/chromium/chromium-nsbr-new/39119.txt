<title>Issue 39119 -   chromium -    Repository update delay when running apt-get update (takes 2-5 minutes) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am sorry if this is not the place for this issue as it is probably not.   But I really do not know where else it could go. Maybe it can be passed   along? Or if someone could point me to the correct place to report an issue   like this.    The issue is really straight forward. The repository &quot;deb   <a href="http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/">http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/</a> stable main&quot; is REALLY slow. I'm not   talking I waited 10-20 seconds. You sit and wait 2-5 minutes.     It's been like this for well over a month and I finally had it  completely   out of patience  lol. It literally sits at 99% [Waiting for headers] the   entire time.    Once you comment out the repo in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list   and run apt-get update  it's fast like it should be  1-4 seconds. </pre>
