<title>Issue 33024 -   chromium -    Romanian spelling dictionary not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Romanian spelling dictionary in chromium is old and unusable. The  dictionary has about 50 000 words  and the wrong set of characters.    A much better dictionary with 1 700 000 words is distributed today by  Mozilla  OpenOffice.org  and most BSD and Linux distros. The dictionary can  be found at     <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries#Romanian_.28Romania.29">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries#Romanian_.28Romania.29</a>    Please extract the dictionary files from &quot;��_��_/sunt&quot; OOo extension  or use the  source code archive (dated 2009-11-14) provided on the website.    Also  /trunk/deps/third_party/hunspell/dictionaries/ro_RO.dic_delta in  chromium SVN has lots of misspelled words. </pre>
