Click any video page.  3. Wait for it to load and the video to start playing.  4. **Without clicking** mouse over the timeline    Expected:  A bubble  following the mouse pointer  indicating the offset.    Actual:  No bubble. To get the bubble  you need to click in the plugin area. Then  the mouse tracking works fine.    Fails with Flash 10.1 beta. Works with Flash 10.0 release. </pre>
