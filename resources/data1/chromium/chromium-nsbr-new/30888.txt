<title>Issue 30888 -   chromium -    Chromium builds are slower than Google Chrome builds even with official settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build Chromium with official settings but without Google Chrome branding.  2. Wait.      The generated build is significantly slower than the equivalent Google Chrome   binaries. This is a regression in the 4.x branch from 3.x    From a quick look  it seems the problem is in logging.h:  <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?">http://google.com/codesearch?</a>  q=package:<a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn+GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD">http://src.chromium.org/svn+GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD</a>  In particular  the problem is there:  <a href="http://google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#h0RrPvyPu-">http://google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#h0RrPvyPu-</a>  c/base/logging.h&amp;q=package:<a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn%20GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD%20">http://src.chromium.org/svn%20GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD%20</a>    In the meantime  I propose using the following workaround:  Add in src/build/common.gypi this define: OMIT_DLOG_AND_DCHECK=1    Fix:  The fix is to change most of the GOOGLE_CHOME_BUILD define checks to OFFICIAL_BUILD.   </pre>
