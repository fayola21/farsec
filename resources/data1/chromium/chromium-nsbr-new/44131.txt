<title>Issue 44131 -   chromium -    Add wrapper above NavigationEntry that encapsulates main frame navigations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a number of pieces of info that are relevant to what WebCore would   call the &quot;Page&quot; -- the current main frame.  Right now  we have no data   structure for this; a TabContents is a tab  which can last through many   navigations  whereas a NavigationEntry is scoped to a single navigation  and   thus we get one each time a subframe navigates.    If we added an object that represents a main frame navigation  which could   contain one or more NavigationEntry objects  we could clean up TabContents   some by moving &quot;main-frame-scoped&quot; data to this.  For example  we reset   content settings and infobars when the main frame navigates; these could go   live on this new object. </pre>
