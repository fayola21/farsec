<title>Issue 37549 -   chromium -    Outlook Web Access Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED) Unknown error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.342.1 dev    OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: GNOME    Behavior in Linux Firefox: it works  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): it works      1. Connect to my company Outlook Web Access with a self signed certificate  2. Notice I get the error: Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown error.  3. This is always reproducible and works with Firefox    I'm attaching a screenshot. With Firefox I get some warning about the   security of the certificate but I am able to proceed if I agree to the   security warning. I've seen Chrome work OK on other sites with busted SSL   certificates though and I see the red label on the https with a cross over   it  but this is not the case for my company's OWA.    This is the only thing keeping me from using Chrome as a replacement from   Firefox. I need to get to the stupid OWA calendar.    Attached is a screenshot </pre>
