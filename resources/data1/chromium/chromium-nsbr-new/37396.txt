<title>Issue 37396 -   chromium -    Page title text does not change properly if &lt;title&gt; tag is empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Attempt to visit a host on which no HTTP server is running (e.g.   localhost). This will give the expected &quot;Oops! This link appears to be   broken.&quot; page.  2. Start the HTTP server.  3. Refresh the page. If the page that is now served has an empty &lt;title&gt;   tag  the tab title text for the page will remain as &quot;Oops! This link   appears to be broken.&quot;  rather than defaulting to the URL.      If the page's &lt;title&gt; tag is empty  the URL should be displayed in the   page's tab.      The previous &quot;Oops! This link appears to be broken.&quot; text remains in the   tab.    This is pretty minor  but it suggests potential problems that could be   fixed. </pre>
