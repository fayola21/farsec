<title>Issue 28505 -   chromium -    Webkit Devtools resource tab contains extraneous port - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.0 Safari/532.5  URLs (if applicable) : http://localhost:8000/           Safari 4: Not tested      1. Setup a web service on a non-80 port - example: http://localhost:8000/  2. Go to that URI's root.  3. Ctrl-Shift-J to open the devtools  go to the resource tab.    The resource tab shows all external and local resources. Without a port in   the url  the first entry is supposed to be the full URL (in that example    http://localhost/ However  adding a port to the url results in the   &quot;:8000/&quot; uri being shown. It should follow the other model and have   &quot;http://localhost:8000/ in it. </pre>
