<title>Issue 46023 -   chromium -    The translation of &quot;Native Client sandbox manager&quot; is wrong in many languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The string &quot;Native Client&quot; probably should not be translated  and it was translated in many languages.  In Russian the translation means &quot;Native Client test environment manager&quot;  which is obviously incorrect.  Maybe replacing &quot;Native Client sandbox manager&quot; with &quot;Native Client security manager&quot; will make it easier to translate.   </pre>
