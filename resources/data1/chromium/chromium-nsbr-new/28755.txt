<title>Issue 28755 -   chromium -    Modal dialogs don't block all appropriate menu items. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;            1. Pull up the Print panel.  2. Go to File.  3. Click &quot;New Tab&quot; or &quot;New Window&quot; or many others.        Should not be able to open new tabs or windows while a modal dialog is up.  I think -[AppController   validateUserInterfaceItem:] is broken. </pre>
