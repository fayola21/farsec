<title>Issue 39482 -   chromium -    Search in Omnibar is using wrong page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 build 42199    Usually I can type in &quot;google.com&lt;TAB&gt;&quot; and I search on google.com. However I   experienced this behaviour now two times. I went to code.google.com and did a   search  now everytime I enter &quot;google.com&lt;TAB&gt;&quot; the Omnibar tells me &quot;Search   on google.com&quot; but the result is a search on &quot;code.google.com&quot;.    On a different laptop I did the mistake to search one time on Last.fm. Now   everytime I type in &quot;google.com&lt;TAB&gt;&quot; Omnibar tells me that I am searching   google.com but actually I get results from Last.fm.    I expect that when I type &quot;google.com&lt;TAB&gt;&quot; I get search results only from   google.com  not Last.fm or code.google.com. </pre>
