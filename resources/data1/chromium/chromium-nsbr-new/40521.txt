<title>Issue 40521 -   chromium -    Provide better user experience in case of OOM in v8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When out of memory error happens in a tab the renderer where it occurred   will send notification to the browser and disable JavaScript in the Page   settings. Several tabs may share same renderer process and JavaScript will   still be enabled in other tabs rendered by the process in spite of the fact   that any attempt to access v8 after OOM will lead to renderer crash.    Better approach would be to send OOM notification for each tab in the   renderer and make sure no JS code is executed after that point (it means   that we have to disable JS in all tabs rendered by that process  all   extensions and devtools scripts). This way user would still be able to see   the page though without JavaScript.    As an alternative approach we could abort the renderer process immediately   after sending OOM notification to the browser process.   </pre>
