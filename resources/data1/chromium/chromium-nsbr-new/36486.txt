<title>Issue 36486 -   chromium -    bookmark manager switches to newly created folder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 4.0.298.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36160">r36160</a>)  Is this the most recent version: no  OS + version: Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: GNOME    Behavior in Linux Firefox: creating bookmark folder doesn't switch into it        1. open the bookmark manager  2. create a new bookmark directory  3. chromium just switches into it      chromium should not switche into it      chromium switch directory and go to the newly created directory.  Which is not user-friendly since the odds are high one creates a new empty   directory in order to move some bookmarks in it.  Thus one is forced to select back the previously selected bookmark directory. </pre>
