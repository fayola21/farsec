<title>Issue 44381 -   chromium -    Create a small tool to graph the server usage ratio - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some/most ESX servers are under used CPU and memory wise. We should maximize the juice out of   them.    Task:  Make a script to extract over a week the maximum usage of every servers/vms and find holes   where we can plug more slaves.    Setting to gree tree task force since it means more slaves available per server  hence potential lower   cycle time by creating more builders.   </pre>
