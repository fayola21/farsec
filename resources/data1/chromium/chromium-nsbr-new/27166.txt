<title>Issue 27166 -   chromium -    textarea highlighting is janky when dragging mouse down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.237.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31086">r31086</a>  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  window manager: ion3  URLs (if applicable): <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?</a>  filename=tryhtml_textarea  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works as expected        1. Load <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_textarea">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_textarea</a>  2. Left-click in the middle of the textarea on the left and start slowly   dragging the mouse down.  3. Note that when the pointer moves out of the textarea (looks like it may   be when it's over the border)  the highlighting briefly flickers  such that   the text up to the top of textarea rather than down to the bottom is   highlighted.  4. When you move the mouse further down  the highlighting becomes correct   again (from the mouse-down location to the end of the text).    I don't see any similar flickering when I drag off the top or sides of the   textarea. </pre>
