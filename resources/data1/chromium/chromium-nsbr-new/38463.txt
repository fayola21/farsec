<title>Issue 38463 -   chromium -    AppCache: Need some form of developer facing diagnostic tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need some form of developer facing diagnostic tools for the appcache.    At a minimum  a list of the appcache in the system  and what resources are   contained within this cache. Time permitting I'm sure we can dream up other    info/capabilities to make available via this tool.  * initiate an update job  * enable/disable a cache  * delete a cache  * ...    There is a loosely related bug in webkit land to get appcache info into the web   inspector  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24529">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24529</a>. In the interest of   getting something done in the chrome5 timeframe (couple of weeks)  we're   planning to do something independent of the web inspector to start with    accessible via about:appcache-internals. The inputs and backend control   surfaces for this diagnostic tool should be reusable if/when the inspector work   is undertaken.         </pre>
