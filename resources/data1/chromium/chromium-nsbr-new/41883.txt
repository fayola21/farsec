<title>Issue 41883 -   chromium -    Allow User Positioning of Desktop Notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev    For users with multiple monitors  showing notifications in the bottom right   corner of the screen isn't always optimal. If a user has 2  3  or more   monitors  showing a notification in the bottom right is completely out of   the user's view.    It would be nice to allow the user to position notifications so they can be   placed in a location that is more visible.    Growl on a Mac allows you to choose placement of growl notifications in a   settings dialog.    Microsoft Outlook's Mail Alerts is another good example of one way this can   be implemented  without adding extra options to Chrome's settings dialog.   When a mail alert pops up  the user can drag and drop the alert anywhere   he/she wants. Every new alert will display in that location from that point   on.    This issue is similar to: <a href="http://crbug.com/32369">http://crbug.com/32369</a>    However this bug is about allowing the *user* to define the location of   notifications. <a title="Implement positioning option for Desktop Notifications"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32369">Bug 32369</a> is about allowing a developer to set the location   of a notification. </pre>
