<title>Issue 40431 -   chromium -    Network error page needs link to internet configurator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Computer has not setup the network  or simply is offline  2. Try open a page in chrome  3. Chrome shows an error page with the os provided error code that nobody   understands.        The error page should have a link to the operating system provided network   wizard or internet connections panel. Or at least instructions on how to   get there.    This assumes that it is possible do tell apart not connected to the   internet from most (not necessarily all) states.       </pre>
