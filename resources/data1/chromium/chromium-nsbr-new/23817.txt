<title>Issue 23817 -   chromium -    Multiple file save dialogs on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.220.1 dev/unstable from 4 Oct 2009  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Does not occur on Windows      1. right-click on any image in any page on the Internet  2. as soon as you select &quot;Save Image As...&quot; right-click on the image again   before the dialog comes up  3. select &quot;Save Image As...&quot; again (if the right-click menu appears and is   responsive)    This is likely only reproducible on slower or bogged down computers on   which it takes a while for the File Save dialog to come up  giving you   enough time to interact with the page before input is restricted to the   dialog.      You should not be able to get the right-click menu to appear the second   time because the application should be in a modal loop for the File Save   dialog.      It took some fiddling but I got it to happen twice. Once I only got the   right-click menu to re-appear and it froze the whole Linux session (had to   reset)  the other time I got two File Save dialogs (though the second one   was of the page itself and not the same image file) and one of the two   dialogs did not work and froze the application when I clicked Save.   Screenshots of both cases are attached. It is sort of a re-entry back into   the Chrome browser code when all activity should be limited to the dialog   (even if the dialog has not come up yet).    This may be related to <a title="Implement showModalDialog on mac &amp; linux" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15891"> issue 15891 </a>  the Linux and OS X implementation of   showModalDialog:    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15891">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15891</a>    The original post on chromium-discuss was seeing longer delays before the   dialog appeared and therefore lots of time to re-click the page  and was   not sure if this was a file manager issue rather than a chromium issue:     <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  discuss/browse_thread/thread/4aa738a4bba69ea4?hl=en&amp;pli=1    Even on my laptop which is SLOW  and running Chrome dev inside vmware   player  the dialog appears quickly and this bug can only be reproduced   intentionally. But in the case of the original post  if the dialog were   slow to appear  this would be a serious bug.   </pre>
