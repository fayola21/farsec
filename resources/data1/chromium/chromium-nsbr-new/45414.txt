<title>Issue 45414 -   chromium -    There's no way to &quot;unload&quot; an unpacked extension. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55        1. Go to chrome://extensions/ .  2. Click 'Load unpacked extension'.  3. Navigate to a directory containing an unpacked extension.  4. Click 'Ok'.  5. Reboot Chrome.      The unpacked extension should not load after the reboot.      The unpacked extension still loads  and apparently  there is no way to stop   it form loading  other than actually removing the folder from your hard   drive.      My argument is this: If a developer is testing out his extension  he   doesn't want to continue to use it after he has finished testing. Currently   there is no way to &quot;unload&quot; an extension that has been loaded from the   'Load unpacked extension' button. There are two ways Chrome could go with   this:     1) Have all extensions loaded using the 'Load unpacked extension' button   session specific. In other words  the next time Chrome is started no   unpacked extensions will be loaded.    2) Copy all of the contents of the unpacked extension to the /extensions/   user directory. This way an list item is generated for the extension at   chrome://extensions/  so the user can click the uninstall link for that   extension.    This is an important issue because the first  and only  time I loaded an   unpacked extension I wasn't aware the only way for Chrome to stop loading   that extension was to remove the folder. Sense I didn't want to remove or   move the directory I had to rename it. Now  whenever I create a folder with   the old name the Chrome will read from it. This is very bothersome to me. </pre>
