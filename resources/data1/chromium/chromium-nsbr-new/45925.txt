<title>Issue 45925 -   chromium -    No error when downloading into a full partition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download any file while the destination partition is full.        An error message is displayed.        The download starts but the size and speed displayed both in the bottom   download bar and on the &quot;Downloads&quot; page don't match (see screenshot; the   actual sizes are ~100MB and my speed never exceeds 2MB/s).  Eventually  the downloads are considered finished by Chromium  even though   it is not the case (the files I obtain are ~30MB  which is normal since the   partition is full).    <b>Please provide
