<title>Issue 32914 -   chromium -    4.0.295.0 dev: up and down arrows keys don't work as expected in the Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :4.0.295.0 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Cmd-L to move focus to the Omnibox  2. Start typing  3. Realize you have a typo at the start and hit up-arrow to move the   insertion point to the beginning  as works in all one-line edit fields      Move the insertion point to the beginning of the Omnibox edit field      Note the suggest drop down appears as soon as you start typing  and auto   selects the topmost entry in it  If the current suggest selection is the topmost one  nothing happens.  If the current suggest selection is not the topmost one  up-arrow both   moves the current suggest suggestion upward and moves the Omnibox   insertion point to the beginning.    I would recommend the up-arrow move the insertion point to the   beginning if the suggest selection is at the top.    This does create a special case  and doesn't answer whether both the   insertion point and suggest selection should be generally moved by the   arrow keys if it is possible to do so. However it is a case I hit very often and   find the current behavior inconsistent as the arrow keys don't do anything    which seems broken.    Common use case for me is when I select a URL to put on the clipboard   and missed something at the beginning of the selection. When I paste  I   see I need to correct something at the start  and reflexively hit up-arrow    expecting the insertion point to move to the beginning  just as it would do   in any other single-line text field. It doesn't. </pre>
