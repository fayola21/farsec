<title>Issue 44020 -   chromium -    Extension X-domain requests are not visible in the Developer Tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev  WebKit	533.8  V8	2.2.7  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.396.0 Safari/533.8  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -  psn_0_1655188      OS version               : 10.5.8        1. Create a manifest that has access to an external site. permissions : [&quot;<a href="http://api.twitter.com/*&quot;">http://api.twitter.com/*&quot;</a>]   for example  2.  Construct an XMLHttpRequest  3. Inspect the &quot;Resources&quot; Tab  select &quot;XHR&quot;  see that the request isn't logged.        I would expect the request to appear in the Resource/XHR section.        The request isn't logged.    It is nearly impossible to debug these requests  unless you use a proxy in between Chrome and   the service.   </pre>
