<title>Issue 29095 -   chromium -    Extension popup uses wrong font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See screenshot for what extension bubbles look like on Linux.    Aaron helped me track it down: it's because we use inject the &quot;menu&quot; font as   CSS for the bubble.  We agreed the bubbles should look &quot;webby&quot;  not native    and so we should instead do the standard trick of    font-family: sans-serif;    font-size: 0.8em;  to make it look like a web page. </pre>
