<title>Issue 24637 -   chromium -    Disable Bookmark contextual menu option &quot;Open in Incognito Window&quot;  on Incognito Window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.222.2  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32    Precondition: Always Show bookmark bar - Enable                           Make sure we have few bookmarks on the bar.      1. Launch Chrome  Open Incognito Window  2. Right click on any bookmark on the bar  3. On Contextual menu   Select &quot;&quot;Open in Incognito Window&quot;     Actual: Bookmark page opens in new tab of same Incognito window.   When Selected &quot;Open in New Window&quot; of the same menu - Bookmark page   opens in new Incognito window    Expected:  Disable Bookmark contextual menu option &quot;Open in Incognito Window&quot;  on   Incognito Window.  Since the menu option &quot;Open in New Tab&quot; acts same as &quot;Open in Incognito   Window&quot;  We need to disable the option to avoid redundancy.    How are Windows and Linux handling this?  &quot;Open in Incognito Window&quot; option shows disabled. </pre>
