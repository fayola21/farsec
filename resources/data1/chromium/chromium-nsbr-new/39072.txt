<title>Issue 39072 -   chromium -    Text searches assume page content never changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a page which has a script that allows content to be added or   removed to/from the page. I'll use   <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun</a> as a quick example.  2. Search (Ctrl+F) on that page for the phrase &quot;One Piece&quot;. Chrome will   (correctly) report that it is not found.  3. Now engage the link that says &quot;Open/Close All Folders.&quot;         - The folder script has added content to the page  and included in this is   the phrase &quot;One Piece.&quot; Chrome should update its search and report that it   is found once.         - It still says that the phrase is not found. To find it  you have to   force it to re-search by deleting the last &quot;e&quot; and then retyping it (since   the search up/down buttons are disabled).    <b>Please provide
