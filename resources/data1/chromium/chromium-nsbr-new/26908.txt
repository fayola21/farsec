<title>Issue 26908 -   chromium -    Mouse sellect-drag issue when using tablet pen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16  URLs (if applicable) : any  Other browsers tested: all         Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1.Click and select in any page - move the mouse to select only 10 pixel for example.        When using tablet  is very easy on a click to move the pen like drag/select - but   it was only a click.    For this reason a person like me that use pen  they have incrice the mouse  sensitivity on drag  and double-click    Using the Tweak UI  I have incrice the drag sensitivity in 18 pixel  So I expect the crome start select after this offset of pixel.    Please get this option from the system  and not have it on code.        Not drag on short distance move - just click       </pre>
