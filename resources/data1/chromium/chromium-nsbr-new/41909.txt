<title>Issue 41909 -   chromium -    BS and TAB stop working for certain tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev  OS version               : 10.6.3      1. casual browsing with form filling (sorry I can't be more specific - it's happened to me twice   now on two different Macs - appears to be related to 10.6.3 update  chrome update or one of the   small number of extensions I have installed - FlashBlock  AdBlock  goo.gl shortener + share on   twitter and Google Translate).      Tab and backspace should always work.      Tab  backspace (and possibly others - eg arrows) stop working altogether. Users have to use the   mouse to navigate the form and highlight text to replace it. </pre>
