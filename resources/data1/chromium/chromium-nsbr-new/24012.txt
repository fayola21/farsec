<title>Issue 24012 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] Chrome Frame disabled in IE InPrivate mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Prerequisites:    Chrome Frame full-mode has been installed correctly    Chrome Frame Version:    4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)    Steps:    1. Make sure there are keys under  HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleChromeFrameOptinUrls  e.g. *yahoo.com*  2. Open IE InPrivate mode window  3. In address bar type in <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a>  then press Enter    Issue:    Ideally page should be rendered by CF full mode since yahoo.com is in the  registry  but now the page is rendered by IE.    This problem is probably because ChromeFrame BHO is disabled in IE  InPrivate mode by default.   </pre>
