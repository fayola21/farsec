<title>Issue 30034 -   chromium -    Add a per-data type ChangeProcessor dispatch mechanism (for syncapi-&gt;chrome) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This task is to add a public api and implementation to the sync manager to   register and unregister various data types from the system.  A data type   includes a model associator  change processor  conflict resolver  and   possibly some kind of scheduling policy.    A map/registry of mime-type to to ChangeProcessor might be all we need  so   long as it is configurable and updatable in response to (for example) UI   allowing changing the actively synced types.   </pre>
