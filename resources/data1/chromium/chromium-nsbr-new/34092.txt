<title>Issue 34092 -   chromium -    Reloading a page causes all network loads to hit the server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create a new tab.    Navigate to the page at <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~atwilson/worker-">http://www.corp.google.com/~atwilson/worker-</a>  latency.html - this page creates the same worker (using the same worker   resource) several times - note the latency results. After the initial load of   the worker  future loads should just hit the cache instead of round-  tripping to the server.    Hit reload on the page. Note the latency results increase dramatically.    Network traces show that we are round-tripping to the server on each load   of the worker script resource rather than just loading it from the cache   (we're passing up an if-modified-since header and so the server is   returning a 304). I would have expected the first load to hit the server  but   after that normal cache behavior should take over.    Darin mentioned that this may be a known issue in the FrameLoader code   - this problem does not happen using ToT WebKit+Safari. It seems to be   Chrome only. </pre>
