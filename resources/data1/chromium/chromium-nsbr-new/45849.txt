<title>Issue 45849 -   chromium -    Closing pinned tab moves unpinned tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested...      1. Pin a tab  2. Open another tab  3. Close the pinned tab (don't remove it--just close it)      The non-pinned tabs will stay where they are since closing the pinned tab doesn't actually   remove it from the tab strip.      The other tabs move to the left to fill the space that Chrome thinks was freed by closing the   pinned tab. It is especially noticeable with the recent change in pinned tab persistency. </pre>
