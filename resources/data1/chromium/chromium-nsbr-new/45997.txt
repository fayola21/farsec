<title>Issue 45997 -   chromium -    run_at document_end does not behave as documented on images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.428.0 (Developer Build 49044)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Install   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dkiklnjkgjkmamgoaggongdmekajdlki">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dkiklnjkgjkmamgoaggongdmekajdlki</a>  2. View an image that takes a while to load (animated GIFs are good)        According to <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html</a>  my   content script (&quot;run_at&quot;: &quot;document_end&quot;) should run &quot;after the DOM is   complete  but before subresources like images and frames have loaded.&quot;   Therefore  I would expect it to do its thing (applying styles to center the   image display) before Chromium begins to download the image.        The content script does not run until the image is finished loading. I have   not noticed this happening on &quot;real&quot; pages (the pages for images are  of   course  generated on the fly). </pre>
