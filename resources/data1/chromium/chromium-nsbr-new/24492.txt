<title>Issue 24492 -   chromium -    XHR does not go through safe browsing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tested cross-domain XHR to ianfette.org  and it looks like XHR doesn't go  through safebrowsing. Attached is a test case.    Unzip the directory  go to chrome://extensions  click load unpacked  extension  select the directory. A new tab should open that reads &quot;This is  a test site&quot; (which is the contents of ianfette.org fetched over XHR).    For comparison  navigate to ianfette.org - you should see a warning dialog.    According to Ian: &quot;All requests should go through SB  especially since  requests can be cross-domain with the Access Control spec  (Access-Control-Allow-Origin  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/">http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/</a>)&quot;    According to Paul: &quot;All requests that go through the ResourceDispatcherHost  are subject to checking by SafeBrowsing.&quot;    Not sure what the correct behavior should be here - maybe throw a  javascript error? </pre>
