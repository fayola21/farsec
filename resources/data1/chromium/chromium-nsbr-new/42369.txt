<title>Issue 42369 -   chromium -    Massive numbers of warnings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't have -Werror on in third-party directories  in particular WebKit    Skia  and maybe some other offenders.    As a result  today in MSVC a full build generates something like 3000   warnings.    This is ridiculously noisy  and some of these could be real bugs.  Anyone   want to tackle? </pre>
