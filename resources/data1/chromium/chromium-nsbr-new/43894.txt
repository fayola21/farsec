<title>Issue 43894 -   chromium -    Convert LOG(FATAL) messages into string resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's many places in the source code where we abort the program with   LOG(FATAL) &lt;&lt; &quot;debug message&quot;. Many of these are Linux specific. The   problem with these messages is that they are only shown on the command   line. So if a user starts Chrome from the GUI menus  they will never see   the message and wonder why Chrome does not start.    We need to turn these English-only messages into string resources so they   will get translated.    The list of LOG(FATAL) uses that need fixing are:  PutARGBImage() in app/x11_util.cc  InitializeOpenMaxLibrary() in media/base/media_posix.cc  SELinuxTransitionToTypeOrDie in chrome/browser/zygote_main_linux.cc  ZygoteMain in chrome/browser/zygote_main_linux.cc  ZygoteHost::Init in chrome/browser/zygote_host_linux.cc  SharedMemory::CreateOrOpen in base/shared_memory_posix.cc </pre>
