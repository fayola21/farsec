<title>Issue 43010 -   chromium -    Add &quot;/&quot; as a search shortcut - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 dev    On a lot of tool I use (vim  less...) &quot;/&quot; is a convenient shortcut for   search. On Chrome  it does not works and I try to use it all the time.   Epichany does this and it's one of the feature I miss most since I   switched.    This shortcut doe not seem to be claimed by any action right now  so it   would be great if it was added.        1. press &quot;/&quot;        open the search box          nothing </pre>
