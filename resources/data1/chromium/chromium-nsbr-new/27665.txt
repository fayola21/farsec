<title>Issue 27665 -   chromium -    PlatformContextSkia::setupPaintCommon should unref the old xfermode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should be doing: setXfermodeMode(...)-&gt;safeUnref(); in this function.   Otherwise  an old xfermode object will be leaked.     It probably doesn't happen in practice because we generally make a SkPaint   and set it up as close as possible to using it  so there's no &quot;old&quot; xfermode   object that needs to be freed (new SkPaints have no xfermode). This is why   we don't need to change all of the other callers of setXfermodeMode.    We should also audit other callers in WebKit/WebCore/platform/graphics/skia   for calls to setXfermodeMode on SkPaints that weren't just created (but   passed in via an argument or something). </pre>
