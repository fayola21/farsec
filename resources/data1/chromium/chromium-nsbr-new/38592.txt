<title>Issue 38592 -   chromium -    Tabbed Bookmark Manager: Need a way to drag and drop bookmarks outside the scrollable viewport - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to the new bookmark manager  2. Go to a folder with lots of items (enough to show a vertical scrollbar)  3. Try to move the first item to the end using DnD    What is the expected output?    When the DnD cursor gets close to the edge the scrollable viewport should   scroll so that the user can drop the item after the last item    What do you see instead?    No scroll happens         </pre>
