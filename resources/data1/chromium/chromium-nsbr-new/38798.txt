<title>Issue 38798 -   chromium -    Tabs crash when clicking on a web page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.) Open Google Chrome  2.) Navigate to  <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/03/mcdonalds-beef-soy-seitan/">http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/03/mcdonalds-beef-soy-seitan/</a> or any  article on <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com">http://www.triplepundit.com</a>  3.) Once loaded  click anywhere on the webpage. Personally  I clicked on  the text of the article to eliminate the possibility that I was clicking on  an advertisment in a margin.  4.) The active tab and probably others crash    I've reproduced this on 2 freshly restarted computers.    Computer #1  Windows 7 Professional Build 7600  Google Chrome 5.0.356.2 dev    Computer #2  Windows 7 Ultimate Build 7600  Google Chrome 5.0.356.0 dev &amp; 5.0.356.2 dev    What is the expected result?  I expect Google Chrome to not react at all to a single click on a web page  unless it's on a hyperlink.     What happens instead?  The tab and others crash with the &quot;Aw  Snap!&quot; message.      Please provide
