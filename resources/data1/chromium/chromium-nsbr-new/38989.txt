<title>Issue 38989 -   chromium -    drag and drop with a move target outside webkit doesn't delete data in webkit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  go to google.com and put some text in the search box  2.  select the text and drag the selected text over gedit  3.  release the drag while holding shift      This should move the text from chrome to gedit  but instead it copies.    We need to add a drag-data-delete signal handler to webdragdestgtk.  This   signal handler would need to send a message to the renderer to delete the   selected text. </pre>
