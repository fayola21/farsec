<title>Issue 43768 -   chromium -    Chrome freezes after while loading multiple images (aerial photos for maps) through HTTP proxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.392.0 (45898)-6.0.400.0 (46819)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a>  or   <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">http://www.bing.com/maps/</a>  Other browsers tested: Chromium 5.0.392.0 (45885) - OK!         Safari 4: unknown    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Install HTTP proxy on local machine (tested with Privoxy 3.0.16  other   proxy suspected  but not confirmed)  2. Configure chrome to use proxy either in system configuration or command   line.  3. Open maps web site  switch to Satellite / Aerial mode and zoom/move over   populated area with high resolution images.      Normal zooming and image rendering.      Window freezes  but can be closed. After closing  one thread in the main   chrome process consumes all available CPU (one core) and never ends.    Broken between builds 45885 and 45898 and not yet fixed (last check 46819).  Couldn't reproduce issue without proxies  but browser shouldn't freeze even   if external software does not work exactly as expected   (suspecting proxy failure under high load).   </pre>
