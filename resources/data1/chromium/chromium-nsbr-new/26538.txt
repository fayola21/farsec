<title>Issue 26538 -   chromium -    You should be able to overinstall extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you install an extension with the same version as one you already have   installed we fail the installation.  The idea was that we'd only allow   overinstall if the existing version was somehow corrupt.  However  our   detection of bad installs is not very good.  We currently only check to see   if the manifest exists.  However  if the manifest is illegal in some way or   has become corrupt  the current code won't detect that.    Two possible solutions:  (1) always allow overinstall of the same version  (2) verify that the current version of the extension loads    I think in the past we couldn't safely do (1) because we didn't have a way   to disable an already running extension  so that's why the code is designed   to do (2).  However  now that we have full dynamic reloading  I think (1)   is the safest way to go.   </pre>
