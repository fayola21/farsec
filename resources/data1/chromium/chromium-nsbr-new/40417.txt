<title>Issue 40417 -   chromium -    Margin-bottom attribute not honored for body and &quot;body-root&quot; elements. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 (Ubuntu 9.10 / 64-bit)  URL : <a href="http://camendesign.com">http://camendesign.com</a> | <a href="http://ponyweb.wordpress.com/">http://ponyweb.wordpress.com/</a> (though these   pages clued me in on the problem  I have attached files that isolate the   problem a little more)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Not tested.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: OK.      1. Load either attached margin-bottom-body.html or margin-bottom-div.html  2. Notice that the bottom margin is not drawn.    Supplementary information:  On both example URLs  the bug prevents the user from scrolling beyond the   fixed positioned element.    It seems that the bug happens only on the body element  or when the   rendering engine detects that the margin and paddings calculations could be   equivalently applied to the body element (even if they are not declared   there - for example  on margin-bottom-div.html  the bug disappears when   body padding is uncommented) </pre>
