<title>Issue 32454 -   chromium -    Regression: Autofill causes user to have to hit extra keystrokes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit allmusic.com and type an artist name into the box at top  and hit   enter.  Your page loads.    Now type the artist name into the same box  and hit enter.  Nothing   happens.    This is because the second time  autofill triggers  and even after you've   typed the entire autofilled entry  the autofill dropdown is still active   and highlighting an entry  so hitting enter &quot;selects&quot; the entry (which does   nothing to the textbox and dismisses the autofill dropdown).    Certainly the right thing to do is to submit on enter in this case.  There   are two ways to achieve this: the entry can disappear when we've typed all   of it  or it can become unselected.  I think the better way to do this is   to have the entry disappear.  This way  if you want to select a different   choice  you don't have to hit &quot;down&quot; twice to skip over the useless entry   for what you've already typed.    We need to be careful about what happens when there's more than one entry    and one is a prefix of another.  Let's say I have entered &quot;foo&quot; and   &quot;foobar&quot; in the box and autofill believes &quot;foo&quot; is a better match.  I start   typing &quot;foo&quot;.  What must not happen is that  as soon as I have typed the   second 'o'  we inline autocomplete to &quot;foobar&quot;; that shouldn't happen until   I type 'b'.  So I think the dropdown at &quot;foo&quot; should show only &quot;foobar&quot; and   nothing should be selected.    I would assign this to someone but I don't know who owns autofill.  In any   case  I believe this is a regression from how things used to work  as   lately I find myself having to hit enter multiple times frequently  and I   never used to. </pre>
