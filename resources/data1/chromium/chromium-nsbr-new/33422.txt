<title>Issue 33422 -   chromium -    Set up GPU-accelerated build infrastructure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  our Win and Linux bots don't support GPU acceleration  which makes   layout tests that utilize it a bit useless.    We should set up something really awesome that makes it possible to run a   subset of layout tests (and perhaps later other GPU-related tests?) on our   waterfall. </pre>
