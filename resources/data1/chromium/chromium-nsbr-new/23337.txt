<title>Issue 23337 -   chromium -    File description of a download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1  URLs (if applicable) : any download  Other browsers tested: none  Platform:              Windows    Currently chrome does only display the non-localized descriptions of a file   type. For example: an exe file has the description 'application'. In dutch   this should be 'Toepassing'. IT HAS NO EFFECT TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE OF THE   CHROME UI  THE OPERATING SYSTEM LANGUAGE IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE THAT MATTERS!    In Windows Vista/7 the description of a file is stored on 5 ways: (in order   of priority):    1: (Only Vista/7) UserChoise: current-user defined file description strings  Read the ProgID value of   HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerFileExts[Ext]User  Choice  Now read the value FriendlyTypeName in HKCR[ProgID]  The value will be something like @%SystemRoot%System32shell32.dll -10156  The description of the file is stored in the strings file of   %SystemRoot%System32shell32.dll at item 10156. Read this value and if   your system is dutch the result will be 'Toepassing' if the file was an   exe.    2: (Only Vista/7) UserChoise: current-user defined file description strings  Read the ProgID value of   HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerFileExts[Ext]User  Choice  Now read the DEFAULT value in HKCR[ProgID]  The value found will be the best answer if FriendlyFileType (step1) fails.    3: (All Windows) For all users on the system  Read the DEFAULT value of HKCR[.extension]  Now read the value FriendlyTypeName in HKCR[DEFAULT]  The value will be something like @%SystemRoot%system32notepad.exe -469  The description of the file is stored in the strings file of   %SystemRoot%System32notepad.exe at item 469. Read this value and if your   system is dutch the result will be 'Tekstdocument' if the file was an txt.    4: (All Windows) For all users on the system  Read the DEFAULT value of HKCR[.extension] --&gt; DEFAULT1  Now read the DEFAULT value in HKCR[DEFAULT1]  The value found will be the best answer if step 1  2 and 3 fail.    5: (All Windows) If all methods fail:  extension in uppercase + &quot;-file&quot; (or + &quot;-bestand&quot; in Dutch)        If I look at the description of some file types chrome gives I suspect that   it only uses steps 2  4 and 5    So my point is:  Chrome should use these steps to get the file description of files. These 5   steps ALWAYS return the same description as shown in Windows Explorer  also   in non-English systems. </pre>
