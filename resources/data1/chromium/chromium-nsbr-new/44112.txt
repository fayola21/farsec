<title>Issue 44112 -   chromium -    After update  tab and omnibar fonts have changed to unusual fonts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : Example: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gwyXG.png">http://i.imgur.com/gwyXG.png</a>    I'm on Ubuntu 10.04  updated via apt.  I have the normal sans font as my application font.    Not that it should matter  but I also have the ubuntustudio-font-meta   package installed to give me a larger selection of fonts [Perhaps the title   bar font is one of them  I'm not familiar with them yet...] </pre>
