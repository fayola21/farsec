<title>Issue 35294 -   chromium -    Null pointer dereference in WebKit - Crashes Chrome rendering engine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While this issue still exists in Chrome 4.x  it is only exercised in Chrome   3.x (Check attached Version_Information.txt). Not an issue on Safari 4   (Windows)  FF  and IE8.    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Create a new Google Document and add some text (ie. &quot;asdasd&quot;)  2. Insert a new table  3. Place the cursor at the end of the text and hit right so the cursor is   now just before the table  4. With the mouse  hit the &quot;Increase Indent&quot; button and the browsers   rendering engine should crash    I did some research into the issue which is included in the attached   documents. I stopped researching this when I realized it was an assertion   check failure  but if you have any questions  please contact me at   pmehta.mobile@gmail.com. </pre>
