<title>Issue 29521 -   chromium -    &quot;top&quot; is a reserved keyword - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the &quot;compliance&quot; with safari 4 is becoming a tiresome joke.    there's a related bug - the one where &quot;name&quot; is a reserved keyword.  now on  the pyjs python-to-javascript compiler we've just discovered that &quot;top&quot; is  a reserved word under no browser engine but google chrome  as well.    this is becoming somewhat tiresome.    why not  instead of following safari 4's &quot;stick-head-in-gas-oven&quot; policy   you raise bugs with safari 4 and tell them to bloody fix their problems?   </pre>
