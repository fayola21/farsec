<title>Issue 31429 -   chromium -    Courgette doesn't have magic for Linux binaries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is more of an RFE  because while Courgette builds and runs on Linux at  the moment  it doesn't really operate at its full potential because it only  does its magic on Windows binaries  not Linux binaries. It would be awesome  if it supported Linux ELF. </pre>
