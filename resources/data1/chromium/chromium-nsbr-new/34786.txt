<title>Issue 34786 -   chromium -    Right Click (Context) Menus don't have keyboard shortcuts underlined in some cases. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 (Official Build 37331) dev            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Right click on blank area and you get a context menu with Back  Forward  Reload  and so   on.    2. Pressing the Right Click (Context) button (or SHIFT-F10) on a keyboard brings up the same   exact menu  except the keyboard shortcuts are now underlined.    3. The keyboard shortcuts work in both cases  they are just not underlined in the first case.        That these actions produce the same exact menu  as they do in Firefox. (Or perhaps this is   proper form and I need to file a bug for Firefox?)        One of the two does not have the keyboard shortcuts underlined   </pre>
