<title>Issue 34900 -   chromium -    Cmd-clicking home button doesn't open home page in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Set &quot;Show home button&quot; in prefs  2. Middle-click or cmd-click home button in toolbar        Home page should open in new tab.        Home page opens in current tab.    Not that I have &quot;home page&quot; visible  but I saw a user complain about this   somewhere on the web. Shouldn't be too hard to fix.    (Huh  there's no Feature-Toolbar?) </pre>
