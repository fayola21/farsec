<title>Issue 38233 -   chromium -    ChromeClientImpl::windowToScreen utterly broken for resolution independence - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeClientImpl::windowToScreen converts from window coordinates to screen  coordinates by just adding on the offset of the window. That wroooong. Both  ChromeClientImpl::screenToWindow and ChromeClientImpl::windowToScreen  should be ripped out  and anyone using them should be passing local  coordinates to the view system  which has the ability to actually do the  correct calculations. </pre>
