<title>Issue 45696 -   chromium -    Open bookmark links in same (but separate) tab every time? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apparently  in the pre 5.0 bookmark manager  if you double-clicked on a   bookmark  then it opened in a new tab. But if you then double-clicked on   another bookmark  it would open in the *same* new tab.    In the 5.0 bookmark manager  if you double-click on a bookmark (non-link   portion)  then it opens in a new tab  just like before. However  if you   then double-click on another bookmark  it opens in a *different* additional   new tab.      I propose we match the previous behavior -- that is  the first bookmark   opens in a new tab  but each subsequent bookmark opens in that same new   tab.      arv@ says he thought he didn't make any changes to how this works  but it   is possible that he missed this case. </pre>
