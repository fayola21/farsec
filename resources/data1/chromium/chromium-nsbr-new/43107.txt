<title>Issue 43107 -   chromium -    Don't remember incognito zoom changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta      1. Open inkognito mode.  2. Visit website of your choice (Preferably one that you didn't visit before and that will embarrass   you when other people find out. After all  that's why you're using inkognito mode).  3. Zoom in or out on that page.  4. Close Chrome.  5. Open /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Preferences  6. Find the key `per_host_zoom_levels`. You'll see the website you visited in inkognito mode listed   there. </pre>
