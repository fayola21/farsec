<title>Issue 40691 -   chromium -    Desktop Notifications settings doesn't seem to &quot;stick&quot; in various extensions... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When I try to save the settings to display Desktop Notifications with   Chrowety or Google Mail Checker Plus  it doesn't seem to work after I   &quot;allow&quot; the extensions to use notifications (Chrome asks my permission for   it with the usual notification bar) and the check box or setting doesn't   &quot;stick&quot;.          It should saves my setting and display desktop notifications...      It used to work in previous dev releases  but it now seems to no longer   work. I don't know when it broke for me seeing that my Google Chrome is set   up to update by itself.      <b>Please provide
