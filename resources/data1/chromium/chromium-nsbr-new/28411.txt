<title>Issue 28411 -   chromium -    Chrome sucks down CPU time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a variety of web sites over a 2-day period  2. Watch CPU use climb (top 6 chrome processes consume 60-80% of CPU)  3. Chrome needs to implement real-world use tests rather than just   functionality tests.      I should be able to use a browser without CPU/memory use increasing over   time.  Ideally all CPU/memory usage should be scaled to how much I am   actually using the specific process.  If I am not using the process (i.e. I   have not glanced at the page in days -- it should not be consuming any CPU   and minimal memory).      Chrome  like Firefox  eventually eats up all of the CPU  perhaps all of the   memory.  I have chrome running (for 2+ days) and have 6 chrome processes   consuming 60-80% of the CPU preventing a fallback from 2.8 GHz to 700 MHz   to 1.4 GHz.  I.e. chrome is defeating the power saving (green) perspectives   which I would normally have in operation on my machine.  This is not   dissimilar from Fireofox and is one of the reasons I entertained looking at   Chrome vs. Firefox.    <b>Please provide
