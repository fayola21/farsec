<title>Issue 45569 -   chromium -    Remove perf tests from &quot;Release Full&quot; builders. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Release Full builders take a long time to cycle.    Windows : 1h25 minutes  Mac : 1h33 minutes  Linux: 48 minutes    On windows and linux  close to 20 minutes is spent in perf tests  On mac   it's close to 30 minutes.    We do not act on the results of the perf tests  since all those tests are   also running on the dedicated perf bots.     We run those tests just to make sure we test as much as possible on those   machines  because if the build is green  we will promote it to   'continuous'.    I do not believe that those tests are worth the time they take to run. We   rarely see a failures only in perf tests.    If no one disagrees  I will make the change and remove those tests from the   Release Builders. </pre>
