<title>Issue 28759 -   chromium -    Extension crash infobar has few shortcomings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an extension crashes  the infobar appears with a button 'reload'.    Three problems with this:  1) The bar is not displayed across tabs  2) The bar disappears when navigating to a new page (chance user could  never even see it)  3) Reloading from chrome://extensions does not make the infobar disappear. </pre>
