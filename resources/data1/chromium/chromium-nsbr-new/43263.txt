<title>Issue 43263 -   chromium -    add a way to see and change the network proxy in Preferences-&gt;Under the Hood - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): &quot;Change settings&quot; button under   &quot;Advanced&quot; opens Network control panel.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): button under &quot;Advanced&quot;  &quot;Network&quot;   tab opens Firefox-specific dialog  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not checked  Behavior on Chrome for Linux: Button under &quot;Under the hood&quot; opens network   proxy dialog        Look at Preferences-&gt;Under the Hood        The user should be able to see which network proxy is in use and find out   how to change it.        I have no idea (without doing further searching) whether Chrome is using a   proxy or not  or how to change it.   </pre>
