<title>Issue 35291 -   chromium -    translate infobar: change &quot;Loading...&quot; to &quot;Translating...&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the translate infobar appears to allow user to translate page  the   buttons change to the text &quot;Loading...&quot;. It should be &quot;Translating...&quot;  but   we already missed 4.1 string-freeze deadline by the time this feature was   requested  so we had to use the pre-existing string &quot;Loading...&quot;.  Should   change for M5.  string id in generated_resources.grd is IDS_TRANSLATE_INFOBAR_TRANSLATING. </pre>
