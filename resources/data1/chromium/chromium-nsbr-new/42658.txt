<title>Issue 42658 -   chromium -    444 YUV color space not supported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Videos that use 444 color space look wonky    Play this  <a href="http://fbarchard-kir.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/color/color0.ogv">http://fbarchard-kir.ad.corp.google.com/testmatrix/color/color0.ogv</a>    Expected result: should look normal  What happens instead: see attachment.    Why do we care?  444 does no subsampling.  On very high quality videos  we're seeing the   subsampling as the limiting quality factor.  Especially when there is color   on color.  In the past  h264 and ogg specs allowed it  but the tools only supported   420 in practice.  And mjpeg only supported 422.  But the tools now support   more color spaces and we'll start to see examples.  For jpeg  you can use photoshop cs4 with quality 11 for 444.   </pre>
