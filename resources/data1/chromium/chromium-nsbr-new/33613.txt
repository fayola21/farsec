<title>Issue 33613 -   chromium -    Reorganize files in  the third_party/cld  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> third_party/cld tree was kinda transplanted from Google toolbar source tree   and it has some unneessary redundancy in its directory structure.     &quot;bar/toolbar/cld/i18n&quot; part does not serve any purpose other than making the   path longer. We have to shorten the path and it's also a good preparation   (and in-place testing for the feasibility) for eventual open-sourcing of the   CLD as a separate library.     </pre>
