<title>Issue 31310 -   chromium -    Force-reload ignoring cache won't work with CTRL-F5  but works with double click. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0      1. Get a fail-load image.  2. Try reload with F5  Ctrl+F5  Shift+F5  Ctrl+T.      Reload the image(s) ignoring the cached broken image.        The &quot;reload&quot; just repeat the bad-loaded cached image  without try do to a real reload.      Its can do a &quot;real reload&quot; easily double clicking any reload button/shortcut.  So I think its can be a bug OR a wrong information in   <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95743</a>.  Ctrl+F5 or Shift+F5 is a bunch of nothing  but double click/tap works for real.       </pre>
