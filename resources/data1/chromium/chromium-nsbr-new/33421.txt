<title>Issue 33421 -   chromium -    Implement GPU-detecting helper for run_webkit_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order to determine whether the machine supports GPU acceleration  we   should write a small  cross-platform helper ditty that would allow   run_webkit_tests to detect the state of the GPU tag for the run.    For more discussion on GPU tag  see <a title="Implement GPU tag in test_expectations.txt"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33420">issue 33420</a>. </pre>
