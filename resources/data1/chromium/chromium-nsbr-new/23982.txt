<title>Issue 23982 -   chromium -    External Links Open New Window But Not the Link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy Heron  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : metacity  URLs (if applicable) : All  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A      1. Type a URL in a gnome-terminal window.  2. Right-click and pick &quot;Open Link&quot;      I get either a new tab (preferred) or a new Chrome window (less nice) which   then visits the link.      I get a new chrome window that just stays on the &quot;New Tab&quot; page.    I tried completely moving aside ~/.config/google-chrome and relaunching    but that didn't help. </pre>
