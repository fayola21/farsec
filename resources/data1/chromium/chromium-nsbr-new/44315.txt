<title>Issue 44315 -   chromium -    Google Searches Don't Appear in History - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47052) dev  OS version           : Mac OS X 10.6.3  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/#BetaShortcuts">http://www.google.com/experimental/#BetaShortcuts</a>  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Enable the keyboard shortcuts Google search experiment via the above URL.  2. Do a Google search.  3. Quickly select a result  using a keyboard shortcut.      The results page should appear in the history.  Pressing the back button should return you to the   search results page.        The results page does not appear in the history.  The page that was before the search results   page is displayed.  It's as though the search never happened.  Often  this means that the New Tab   page is displayed instead of search results.    If you wait for on the search results for long enough (about five seconds after loading) the history   will work as expected.   </pre>
