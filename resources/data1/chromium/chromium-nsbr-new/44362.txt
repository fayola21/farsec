<title>Issue 44362 -   chromium -    Hover styles stop working sporadically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1  Other browsers tested: IE6 7 8  FF3 Safari 4      1. I'm afraid there appears to be no set way to make this occur that I have been able to ascertain.         Hover styles such as tr:hover  a:hover should work all the time.        Sometimes even though the page has finished loading hover styles stop working. Table row and   hyperlink pseudo hover styled elements do not change to show the hover style. When this occurs   you can refresh the page any number of times and it does not fix the problem. The way to fix the   problem is to manually place the cursor in the location box and press enter to reload the URL.        </pre>
