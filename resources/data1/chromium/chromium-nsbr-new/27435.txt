<title>Issue 27435 -   chromium -    I can't use tags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From e-mail:    --  I  right now at this very moment  have a need to figure out the exact   contents of a specific source file used for 4.0.223.11.    mark@anodizer bash$ svn ls   svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/releases/4.0.223.11  svn: URL 'svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/releases/4.0.223.11' non-  existent in that revision    That's not encouraging.  I have to fall back on guesswork.  Well  I don't    because fortunately we're still encoding the SVN branch and revision in   each Mac build.  But what happened here?  223.11 was built and released   after the automated tagging thing should have been in place  right?  --    Eric said that the tag is only created on completion of a successful   Windows build.  That doesn't seem good or right.  It makes me question   whether I can use tags to get to the specific bits that went into a non-  Windows build at all.  I really want to be able to. </pre>
