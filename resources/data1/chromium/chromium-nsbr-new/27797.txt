<title>Issue 27797 -   chromium -    Download shelf needs auto hide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0    Hi  Mohamed Mansour suggested people head here for feature requests  this is   mine.  After checking out the chrome support forum  I noticed myself and a few other   would love an auto hide feature on the download bar at the bottom of chrome.   I was thinking maybe put it on a timer. For example:    I download a file  the bar pops up as usual for the dl  when the file is   finished  I have a 5 second opportunity to click the dl to run it. If after   that five seconds I haven't clicked the dl  the bar hides itself.   </pre>
