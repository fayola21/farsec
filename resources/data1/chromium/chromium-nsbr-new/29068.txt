<title>Issue 29068 -   chromium -    Create one utility context per inspected context instead of having one utility context per agent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The utility context should share DOM wrappers with the world of the inspected   context. This way we would be able to view the DOM tree in the same state as   the inspected context's script(because different contexts are likely to   correspond to different isolated worlds and have different sets of DOM   wrappers).    With the current implementation we have one utility context whose script   accesses all objects of the inspected page no matter which context(world)   they originate from. With utility context per inspected context we wouldn't   avoid leaks of JS objects between different worlds and frames. </pre>
