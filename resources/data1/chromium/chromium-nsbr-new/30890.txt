<title>Issue 30890 -   chromium -    Dragging a tab out and back in on Mac no longer drags just tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Have more than one tab in your tabstrip and drag one out.  Now drag it back   into the tabstrip.  At this point it keeps the toolbar and content area attached   as you drag it around  instead of leaving them where they're supposed to go   and dragging the tab around alone  like Windows does or like Mac does   before you drag the tab out. </pre>
