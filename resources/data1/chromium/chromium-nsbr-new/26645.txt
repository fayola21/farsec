<title>Issue 26645 -   chromium -    Bookmark Sync missing some bookmarks - creates folders but nothing inside them - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16 (Official Build 30555)      1. I enabled bookmark syncing for the first time on my main computer  2. I logged into Google Docs to look at the &quot;Bookmarks&quot;  3. I noticed that some folders in &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; were empty  4. I thought maybe they were still transferring??  5. I should mention I have about 1 850 bookmarks - so maybe that's too many to sync??    6. I deleted all the bookmarks on my second computer  then I enabled bookmark syncing for the first time on that computer  7. All bookmarks come over except the top 5 folders in my &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; -those are all empty on my second computer even though they are visible on my main computer  8. My Google Docs account is still showing those 5 folders as empty...  9. I bookmarked a new website on my second computer and it did not sync over to my main computer even though they both say &quot;Last synced: just now&quot;  10. My Google Docs account does not show that new bookmark either  11. I bookmarked a new website on my main computer and it did not sync over to my second computer - Not in Google Docs either    12. I disable sync on both my computers  13. I re-enable sync on both my computers and click &quot;merge and sync&quot; and it says &quot;success&quot; but they both are still missing the new bookmarks  14. My second computer is still missing the top 5 folders in my &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; too    15. I disabled sync on both my computers again  16. I wanted to start fresh  so I tried to deleted all bookmarks and folders from my Google Docs account but it says &quot;Sorry  you can't delete items from read-only sources (such as Bookmarks).&quot;  17. I re-enable sync on both my computers and click &quot;merge and sync&quot; and it says &quot;success&quot; but they both are still missing the new bookmarks  18. My second computer is still missing the top 5 folders in my &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; too    19. So basically  I can't add any additional bookmarks to my Google Docs account - and therefore I can't sync any of the new bookmarks that I create - And because I can't delete the bookmarks   from my Google Docs account  I can't do ANYTHING :(    20. AGAIN: I should mention I have about 1 850 bookmarks in my Google Docs now - Is that too many that I broke this whole thing??? </pre>
