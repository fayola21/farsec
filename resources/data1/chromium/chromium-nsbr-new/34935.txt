<title>Issue 34935 -   chromium -    suggestion: don't animate anything in sluggish environment - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev    Currently there's a lot of animation  each of them takes considerable time   (up to several seconds) when system resources are scarce (i.e. high CPU or   too much memory swapping  or HDD is heavily used).    There should be a way to downgrade animation for such cases  either by user   settings or via auto-detect basing on a current situation with resources. </pre>
