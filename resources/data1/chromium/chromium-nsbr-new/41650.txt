<title>Issue 41650 -   chromium -    Run Closure Tools tests on buildbot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run Closure Tools tests (<a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">http://code.google.com/closure/</a>) on buildbot as as   sanity check.    The setup for this could probably be similar to the Selenium tests  which   use cookies to report data  or it could be like the V8 Benchmark  which   reports results via IPC. </pre>
