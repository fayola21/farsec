I can't scroll    and can't even move the windows.    I don't know exactly what firefox does here  but I never had the problem   with frozen windows.    Here a page with just a simple propmpt button.  <a href="http://webdevtips.co.uk/webdevtips/js/alert/example.shtml">http://webdevtips.co.uk/webdevtips/js/alert/example.shtml</a>  Click demo now.  All other chrome windows are completely locked.  In firefox  other windows are still usable.  In mac chome  this seems to work better  since the other windows stay   usable. </pre>
