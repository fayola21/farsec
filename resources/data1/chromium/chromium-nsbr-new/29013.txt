<title>Issue 29013 -   chromium -    Add password export/profile export features for migration - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When users migrate from one computer to another  there's no obvious way   right now to keep their Chrome profile.    * You can copy the profile folder  but most users don't know this and won't   find it since it's in a hidden folder.  * Even when you copy the profile folder  your passwords can no longer be   read  since they're secured with Windows crypto routines that tie them to   the account on the old system.    If sync synced everything about a profile  it might be an answer for this   (although some users may still not with to use sync?).  However  it   currently doesn't  and is unlikely to do so any time soon.  Accordingly  it   might be nice to have a button or menu entry somewhere to export your   profile so you could import it into another Chrome install. </pre>
