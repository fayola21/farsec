<title>Issue 36137 -   chromium -    google-chrome hangs when loading page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     This is not exactly that easy. This seems to have something to do with only  my setup as I have talked to a lot of people who do not experience this  problem. But here's what I do:    1. Open google-chrome (my home page loads (<a href="http://www.google.is">http://www.google.is</a>)  2. Go to another URL (any will do (probably) but I've had this experience  with cnn.com  mbl.is  visir.is... other than a gut feeling that more  &quot;complicated&quot; pages will rather cause this hanging I don't really have any  other pointers.        The page should load.        The browser hangs for a long while  finally popping up a message that the  page has stopped responding.    <b>Please provide
