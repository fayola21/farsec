<title>Issue 33071 -   chromium -    Popup window omni box allows and loads drag dropped URL's - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.2 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36665">r36665</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Open a popup window.  2. Drag drop any URL or bookmarklet on the popup window omnibox    Actual: Popup window on hovering of dragged URL shows the green plus sign and loads the respective site in the window.    What is the expected output?   Popup's  omnibox(read only) should not allow and load the drag dropped URL's.Windows/Linux doesn't load the drag   drop's. It would be nice to have the same consistency in mac as well.    Notes: Chrome OS-All allows and loads the drag drop URL's to the body content.  </pre>
