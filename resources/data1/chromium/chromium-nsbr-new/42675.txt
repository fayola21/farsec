<title>Issue 42675 -   chromium -    TestTabContents isn't testing process swaps correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TestTabContents still tries to override TabContents::ShouldTransitionCrossSite() to test navigations   with and without process swaps.  This method has long since been moved to   RenderViewHostManager  so no override is occurring and some of the unit tests may not be testing   what they expect.    The overridden version in TestTabContents uses a transition_cross_site field that defaults to false   and is set to true in a handful of tests in web_contents_unit_test.cc.  We should investigate whether   any of the tests are broken or if we just need to remove the stale overridden method in   TestTabContents. </pre>
