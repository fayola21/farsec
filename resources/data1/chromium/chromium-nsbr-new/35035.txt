<title>Issue 35035 -   chromium -    the combination of Active Directory credentials and bookmarks makes Google Chrome crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.249.78 (36714)    Simple Explanation:    At work I access the internet through a Intranet proxy  so when I open new   tab I often have to insert the Active Directory credentials to access that   proxy and then the internet.      1. Open a new tab on Google Chrome;  2. Select a new page from the bookmark list;  3. At this point the input box related do the Active Directory credentials   should pop out;  4. DO NOT enter any credential. Instead select a new page from the bookmark   list.  5. ....and &quot;Whoa!! Chrome as crashed&quot;;        I expected the pop up of the Active Directory credentials to remain active.        Goggle Chrome has crashed.    If you need anything else just email me (cjmsousa@gmail.com)    Thanks.    _________________________  Carlos Sousa       </pre>
