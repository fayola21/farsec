<title>Issue 34593 -   chromium -    Security:  Shared windows across hidden incognito windows allow social engineering hackery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since incognito windows share cookies  it is easy to abuse them to steal access   via social engineering (see steps below).  The documentation for incognito   windows should alert users that they are NOT intended to allow you to safely use   a browser on a vacant machine.    Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 (35163) beta on Mac OS X  URLs (if applicable) :    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1.  Bring up the Chrome browser  launch an incognito window and innocently   point it to www.google.com.  Minimize the window  move it to another virtual   desktop  etc.  etc. so that it's not obvious what you've done.    2.  Convince your friend to use a new Chrome incognito window to &quot;safely&quot; check   their gmail account.   Point out that the help on this page:      <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?</a>  hl=en&amp;lev=index&amp;cbid=tmgnu1higc5&amp;answer=95464&amp;src=cb  clearly states:    &quot;All new cookies are deleted after you close the incognito window.&quot;  When your friend is done  close the incognito window before they log out.    3.  Once they're gone  go back to the open incognito window in the background   (or open up a new one) and refresh the page.  Voila!...you've stolen their   authentication.      What should be done:    At minimum  correct &quot;All new cookies are deleted after you close the incognito   window.&quot; to read something like &quot;All new cookies are deleted after you close the   *very last* of your incognito windows.&quot; and maybe explicitly warn people that   incognito browsers aren't a safe way to browse on their friends' machines.    What would be nice:    Allow multiple incognito sessions.  Probably when a user explicitly starts a new   incognito browsing session (say  with &quot;New Incognito Window&quot; from the menu)    that window should start with a brand new cookie store. </pre>
