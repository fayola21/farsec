<title>Issue 31555 -   chromium -    Doesn't work with QuickCursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.283.0 (35283)  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Opens WriteRoom to edit text  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Same      1. Download and configure QuickCursor   <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor/">http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor/</a>  2. Invoke &quot;edit in external editor&quot; via keystroke      External editor will open with contents of text box. On save and close text   will be returned from editor to text box.      Error message &quot;QuickCursor could not find any text to edit. Make sure that   a text view has keyboard focus  and then try again.&quot;    I was reading over the QuickCursor page and saw where it said &quot; it works   with any application that exposes it��_��_��_s text to the Mac OS X Accessibility API   through a single string value&quot; and wondered if chromium is doing   something with textareas that doesn't support this. It isn't a big issue  but   this is an app I used a lot with safari. </pre>
