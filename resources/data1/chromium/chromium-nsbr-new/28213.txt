<title>Issue 28213 -   chromium -    MessagePortDispatcher seems to leak - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load the attached file in chrome. This file contains a script that:    1) creates a MessageChannel  2) forces a reload of the page by resetting location.href with a timestamp   value at the end.    If we run this script  MessagePortDispatcher.message_ports_ on the   browser process grows without bound.    My expectation is that when the document is detached (due to the unload)    it would free the WebCore::MessagePorts  which would then cascade down   to the Chromium PlatformMessagePortChannel  which would notify the   browser-side MessagePortDispatcher.    This isn't happening for some reason. </pre>
