<title>Issue 31230 -   chromium -    Prevent new windows and tabs in kiosk mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Similar to <a title="Feature: Kiosk Mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23145"> Issue 23145 </a>   When in kiosk mode (and possibly also only when defined by a command-line   option like --onetab or --onewindow or somtheing) the behaviour should be   to ignore the request to open a page in a new tab or new window and open it   in the current fullscreen kiosk tab.   Currently  if a new window is created  it will not be created full-screen   and can give the user an addressbar and other standard functionality  which   was not intended for kiosk mode.  With this new behaviour  it would ensure that the kiosk user CAN'T escape   the kiosk window and cannot then access all of chrome's settings and   features.  The only exception would need to be javascript popups which are sometimes   needed to be opened in separate windows  however as they currently provide   little functionality with a read-only address bar and no toolbar buttons    it is OK.    Hope I made sense - should be possible but might require a bit of work. </pre>
