<title>Issue 36481 -   chromium -    Chrome nags excessively about installing plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89                    1. Visit a site without the flash plugin installed    Every page you look at gets redrawn when the yellow bar at the top comes   down.  It's a really distracting experience.    If you dismiss the yellow bar  then it pops up when you go to any new page.    So it is painful to navigate sites which don't really need flash.        It would be nicer if it only did this once per domain per browsing session.    If I dismiss a prompt to install a plugin  I want it to *stay dismissed*    instead of popping up on every page.   </pre>
