<title>Issue 27392 -   chromium -    Regression: NTP background not drawn correctly for some themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a Windows system  install a theme with a bottom-anchored NTP background   (such as Bayonetta).  Note that with a detached bookmark bar  the background   is not being drawn correctly in the area around the bar (it's ~30 pixels too   low).  It works correctly on Mac; not sure about Linux. </pre>
