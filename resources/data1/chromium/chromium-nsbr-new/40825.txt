<title>Issue 40825 -   chromium -    Renderer unable to sustain a high fps on complicated websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm splitting this bug out from <a title="Mac scrolling performance is still way behind Linux/Windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28947"> Issue 28947 </a>.  I think we've fixed most of the drawing issues  but   now we're hitting problems where the renderer is unable to paint at 60 fps on some of the more   complicated websites.  One example is <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/">http://staff.tumblr.com/</a> .    I've been testing this by running the following snippet of javascript  then measuring the resulting   framerate in Quartz Debug:    javascript:setInterval(function(){ scrollBy(0 1) }  1000/60)    Performance especially suffers on older machines  machines with integrated graphics  and   heavily-loaded machines.    We might not be able to improve things much  but I'll investigate and update this bug with the   results.   </pre>
