<title>Issue 34666 -   chromium -    Scrolling lag when using themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev  URLs (if applicable) : news.bbc.co.uk  OS version               : 10.6.2    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works as expected.      1. Go to news.bbc.co.uk (almost any site will do  actually)  2. Scroll around a bit  3. Install a theme (say   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_baseball.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_baseball.html</a>).  4. Go back to news.bbc.co.uk. Scroll some more.        Scrolling should be quick and snappy.      There is a noticeable delay when scrolling. (Installing one of the smooth   scrolling extensions can make this much more apparent  but the issue   occurs regardless of whether any extensions are installed). </pre>
