<title>Issue 30695 -   chromium -    SPDY: WebKit Throttling - Preload Scanner not used aggressively enough - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The PreloadScanner only runs when the browser is blocked on script.    Investigate  prove  and implement an aggressive PreloadScanner which always   runs.    See HTMLTokenizer.cpp for where the PreloadScanner is instantiated.  I   believe we should always do preloading  every time HTMLTokenizer::write is   called.  More research needed. </pre>
