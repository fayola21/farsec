<title>Issue 36455 -   chromium -    Have a laugh! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For once I found a site that makes ie7 crash but works with Chrome!  I know this is offtopic and silly but FOR ONCE it's the opposite that usually   happens :)    <a href="http://www.robertoner.tk/">http://www.robertoner.tk/</a>    Let me know if your ie7 crashes.  I am not affiliated with that site at all.  This is no spam.   </pre>
