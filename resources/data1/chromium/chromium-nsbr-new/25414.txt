<title>Issue 25414 -   chromium -    Don't restore session with only one new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27 and 4.0.222.3             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Turn on the 'Restore open tabs' feature.  2. Make Chrome your default browser.  3. Leave only one new tab opened in Chrome (chrome:newtab).  4. Close this tab or close whole Chrome.  5. Open any web link from any other application  e.g. mail client.      Chrome will open only one tab with that link.      Chrome opens two tabs: first with new tab and other with that link.    This issue can looks very similar to &quot;4923: Closing last tab using Ctrl+W   should not make it restore if you select 'Restore open tabs'&quot; but it has   additional sense.    I meen if session contains only one tab and it is an empty new tab we don't   need to save it. Even no matter how Chrome was closed: by closing last tab   or by closing Chrome directly. </pre>
