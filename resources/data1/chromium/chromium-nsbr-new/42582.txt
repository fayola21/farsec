<title>Issue 42582 -   chromium -    Mac: get rid of ToolbarButtonCell (and toolbar_button_cell*) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In toolbar_button_cell.h:    // TODO(jrg): Why have a class at all when the base class does it all?  // I anticipate making changes for extensions.  Themes may also  // require changes.  I don't yet know if those will be common across  // the toolbar and bookmark bar or not.  The initial CL which made  // this empty was the use of the base class for both toolbar and  // bookmark bar button cells.  It seems wasteful to remove the files  // then add them back in soon after.  // TODO(jrg): If no differences come up  remove this file and use  // the base class explicitly for both the toolbar and bookmark bar.    (dated June 8  2009  according to git-blame).    I think it's time for it to go. I have a CL for this  since I seem to be cleaning out the attic. </pre>
