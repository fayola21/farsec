<title>Issue 35153 -   chromium -    page_cycler tests don't control window size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the page_cycler tests use a clean profile  but they don't set the size of the   window.  This means any change to our default window size and any changes   in the display size on the bots could result in changes in timings.  Seems like   we should force the tests to use a controlled window size?  note: if we do   this  it means we might have to take a hit on timing data. </pre>
