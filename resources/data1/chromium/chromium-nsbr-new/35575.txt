<title>Issue 35575 -   chromium -    Add restriction to ViewHostMsg_GetRawCookies to block access from untrusted renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add restriction to ViewHostMsg_GetRawCookies to block access from untrusted   renderers    Permission to invoke this IPC should only be granted to a renderer that is   hosting the dev tools frontend.    Because we didn't do this  the websockets code started using this API to get   cookies.  But doing so violates our policy of not exposing HTTP-only cookies   to the renderer. </pre>
