<title>Issue 41929 -   chromium -    Possible to tab out of &quot;confirm form resubmission&quot; dialog  not to tab back in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Submit a POST request.  2. Press Ctrl-R to get a &quot;The page that you're looking for used information that   you entered&quot; dialog.  3. Press tab.  4. Press tab again.  5. Press shift-tab.  6. Try to use a keyboard shortcut  for example to Ctrl-pgup or Ctrl-L.        In step 3: The ok button should get the focus.  In step 4: The cancel button should get the focus (focus should wrap around back   to the first available UI element).  In step 5: The ok button should get the focus (focus should wrap around backwards   too)  In step 6: And the keyboard shortcuts should obviously continue working  Ctrl-  pgup should select the previous tab  etc).        In step 3: The ok button is selected  In step 4: The focus shifts to some element of the (disabled) underlying web   page.  In step 5: Nothing at all happens (the focus remains on the same element  doesn't   shift back to either the dialog or to the previous web page element).  In step 6: And once the focus has entered this limbo  all keyboard shortcuts stop   working. The mouse continues working.    <b>Please provide
