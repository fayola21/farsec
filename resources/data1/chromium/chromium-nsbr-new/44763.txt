<title>Issue 44763 -   chromium -    Crash when downloading files to new folder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Clicking on a link to download a file  2. Navigating to a folder and creating new subfolder to save file in it  3. Finnaly clicking Save      Chrome should keep functioning normally  the bottom download bar should   come up and I should be able to keep using Chrome while the download   progressed.      Chrome downloads the file in the background  but I can't use it to navigate    to any pages  it totally crashes and goes blank when I click anywhere on   the browser and it all happens before the bottom download bar shows up  so   I can't really tell how long it'll be until the download is completed.   Also  the top bar goes back to Windows style  without the tabs on top  just   like any other Windows app.    <b>Please provide
