<title>Issue 25817 -   chromium -    Ctrl-Shift-click (or Cmd-Shift-click) on back/forward buttons to NTP broken. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. From NTP navigate somewhere.  2. Ctrl-Shift-click the back button.      Expected: a new tab with the NTP.  Actual: a new tab with the previously-current tab's contents and   &quot;chrome://newtab/&quot; in the omnibox. Further navigation can cause a DCHECK   failure.    I've checked on Linux and Mac (so it's not my fault)  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30046">r30046</a> off the trunk. </pre>
