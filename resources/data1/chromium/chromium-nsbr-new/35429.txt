<title>Issue 35429 -   chromium -    Sync network integration test harness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For sync  we currently have an in browser test harness  but it exercises a   full integration test requiring a live server. Corner cases in a full   integration test are hard to mock out.    What we want in addition is a nearly full integration test  but with the   network layer mocked out. Sync uses the http bridge for all the communication   it does  so it seems like a pretty good place to mock things out. We can then   expect certain requests coming from the syncer  and expect certain responses   and network behaviors.    In particular  this will make it easier to test sync authentication    notifications  and throttling at the sync-browser integration level. We'll be   able to test integration expectations without a live server. </pre>
