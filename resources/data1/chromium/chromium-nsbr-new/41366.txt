<title>Issue 41366 -   chromium -    DisclosureViewState has a disclosed instance var needs an accessor written for it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We shouldn't allow direct member var access via KVO. When testing with the GTM framework that   allows us to block direct member var accesss via KVO we die because we don't have an accessor   written for the &quot;disclosed&quot; instance var of DisclosureViewState.    <a href="http://codf1.jail/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/disclosure_view_controller.mm?">http://codf1.jail/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/disclosure_view_controller.mm?</a>  revision=39787 </pre>
