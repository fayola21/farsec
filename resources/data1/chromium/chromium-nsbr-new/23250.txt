<title>Issue 23250 -   chromium -    Javascript Alert and other (not-chrome) messageboxes should have a maximum height - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1  URLs (if applicable) : large javascript alerts  Other browsers tested: none      Alerts should have a maximum size. If the text'height' is larger than the   (browser height) - the title bar (height) - (the OK-button + bottom   height)* then chrome should display a button: read next (and previous); and   it should not display any text that was too large. If the user clicks the   next button he/she should see the next part of the text.      Currently it 'disappears' under the task bar if the text is too large        On the bottom of this screenshot you see a part of my task bar. The OK-  button is somewhere down there.  I made some text impossible to read because it where all names... </pre>
