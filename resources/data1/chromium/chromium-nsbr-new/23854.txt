These two commits are on all bots.  Don't be fooled   by the yellow line  it's not a reference build.      27831	estade@chromium.org	  Make sudden termination into a counter.    We were incorrectly interpreting enableSuddenTermination to mean &quot;enable   sudden termination&quot;. Really it should just decrement a counter  and we   should only enable sudden termination when that counter reaches 0.    Related to  but not the fix for  <a href="http://crbug.com/5638">http://crbug.com/5638</a>    This may have been causing memory corruption due to shutting down the   renderer process while writing to a storage area or icon database (although   honestly I don't actually know if we even use those parts of webkit).    Also  add a ui test that fails before this patch and succeeds with this   patch.    BUG=none  TEST=sudden termination still works on a simple page    Review URL: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/245036">http://codereview.chromium.org/245036</a>      27832	brettw@chromium.org	  Convert history to use new sql wrappers. Enhance wrappers in several ways   to  support the needs of history.    BUG=none  TEST=covered by unit tests  Review URL: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/246053">http://codereview.chromium.org/246053</a>   </pre>
