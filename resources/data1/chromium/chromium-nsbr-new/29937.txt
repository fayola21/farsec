<title>Issue 29937 -   chromium -    Subpixel doesn't work when opacity is not at 100% - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.267.0~svn20091208r34059-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu Jaunty  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : GNOME  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/opacity.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/opacity.html</a>    If an html item has an opacity value &lt; 100%  then the subpixel rendering   doesn't work.    You can test this issue very well installing the Facebook Tweaks extension   [1] and looking at the bottom bar: if the mouse is over it (and so the   opacity is full)  everything is rendered correctly  else if the mouse is   not over the chat/notification bar  that is a little transparent and the   subpixel rendering doesn't work.
