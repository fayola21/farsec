<title>Issue 43917 -   chromium -    Some sync integration tests rely on a sync_data_source directory that doesn't exist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build and run sync_integration_tests.exe. Try filtering the tests; for  example  use  &quot;--gtest_filter=LiveSyncTestPrePopulatedHistory1K.SC_AddFirstBMWithFavicon&quot;    What do you see?  Tests fail because they rely on static bookmark data that's supposed to be  in chromepersonalizationtestlive_sync_data1K_url_visit_historyDefault   but doesn't exist.    What is the expected output?   The tests aren't very robust because they depend on static data. They need  to be rewritten such that the test case handles its own data.   </pre>
