<title>Issue 43455 -   chromium -    When converting a Hangul to Chinese character  a new line is inserted before the character to convert. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Add Korean IME (2-set) in System Preference | International  2. Go to any text area and switch to Korean IME (2-set)  3. type 'wjd' ('��_' will show up) and press Option-Return        Expected:   The candidate list shows up and you can choose a Chinese character you want to convert '��_'   (Hangul syllable) to.     Actual:  The first Chinese character in the list is automatically picked up and a new line is inserted   before the character. The candidate list is still shown and I can pick another character from   the list.     In gmail's composition area  the situation is worse. I'll file it separately.     This may or may not have been fixed with suzhe's recent change. I haven't yet built a trunk   with his change in. This report is based on 5.0.375.17         </pre>
