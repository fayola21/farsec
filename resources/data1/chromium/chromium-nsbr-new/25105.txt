<title>Issue 25105 -   chromium -    Support Move Networks media player - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://movenetworks.com">http://movenetworks.com</a>  2. Click the link to view the high-quality video  (3. If you haven't already installed it  go through the install process)    Currently it hangs the renderer (<a title="Plugins that crash during initialization hang the entire renderer" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25104"> bug 25104 </a>)  but eventually we should   support it.    It doesn't work in Safari on 10.6 yet though  so it's probably not easily   supportable OOP at the moment. </pre>
