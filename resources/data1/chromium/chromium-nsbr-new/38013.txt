<title>Issue 38013 -   chromium -    Some Hindi phrases do not get blue selection background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta (Mac only)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://translate.google.com">http://translate.google.com</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to Google Translate  2. Select &quot;Hindi&quot; in &quot;translate from&quot; field. Make sure &quot;type phonetically&quot;   checkbox is checked.  3. Type &quot;hindi rusi bhai bhai&quot; into the text box  hitting space after each   word  including the last  so that conversion occurs.  4. Attempt to select the phrase either through Command+A or using the   mouse pointer.      Blue selection background should appear. This is the behavior on Safari   and Firefox.      Only the whitespace at the end gets highlighted.    Note that this doesn't happen with all phrases. E.g. if you type &quot;namaste&quot;   several times in a row  selection will work properly. Not sure what's   different about this particular phrase.    This bug does not repro on Windows. I have not tried Linux - my version of   Chrome is not fresh enough there.   </pre>
