<title>Issue 25566 -   chromium -    Official builders cannot run tests for two builds in parallel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The linux official and linux 64 official builds running at the same time   cause tests to fail on the official builders:  - layout tests contend over the HTTP port  - page cyclers and ui tests contend over the Xvfb address.    Also  we can't rely on the perf numbers from the perf tests if they're   running in parallel.  Tony suggests adding a lock.    Michael: do you know who would be good to implement this?  Maybe there's   some way to jigger buildbot to just run one builder than the other in   sequence? </pre>
