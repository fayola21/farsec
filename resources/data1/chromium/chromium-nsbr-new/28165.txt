<title>Issue 28165 -   chromium -    extension problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.252.0~svn20091118r32323-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : metacity (gnome)    After upgrading to 4.0.252  it seems there are major issues with   extensions  I could use without problems before. I could not install new   extensions  a dialog says:    Content scripts can not be executed on file:// urls.    And it seems some already installed extensions are gone too  like adblock   and flashblock. the site www.googleextensions.org even does not offer to   add flashblock with saying: &quot;Extension Only Meant For Latest Developer   Builds of Chrome 4.0+&quot;. But it worked some weeks ago with older versions of   chromium  I think.    result of &quot;grep chrome .xsession-errors&quot; is attached. </pre>
