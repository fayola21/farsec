<title>Issue 28627 -   chromium -    Chrome should detect if highlighted text is an address  and include &quot;Search Google Maps for...&quot; in right-click context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4      1. Highlight an address  2. Right-click        The right-click context menu should detect that the highlighted text is an   address  and include &quot;Search Google Maps for...&quot;      You can only &quot;Search Google for...&quot; which just brings you to the Web   results of the address. You then have to click Maps at the top. Since some   people might still want the web address  the right-click menu should maybe   include both options. I suppose this feature could also be done with an   extension  though  since not everyone would need it.   </pre>
