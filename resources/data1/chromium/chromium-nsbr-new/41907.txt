<title>Issue 41907 -   chromium -    Extensions unable to retrieve HTTP headers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Extensions should be able to retrieve HTTP headers for the current page as this would allow for the   development of more advanced functionality.    Case in point: I would like to develop an extension that exposes pre-generated short links   (rel=shortlink) from the headers (and/or HTML HEAD) so as users don't need to mint their own with   a 3rd party shortener (e.g. bit.ly). This results in higher quality  more transparent and more reliable   links.   </pre>
