<title>Issue 33926 -   chromium -    Second wrench button after update to Chrome 5.0.307.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I see 2 identical icons (both look like wrench) for &quot;Control the current   page&quot; and &quot;Customize and control Google Chrome&quot; buttons (top right corner of   the window).    It happened after I got updated to Chrome 5.0.307.1    The problem got solved (left 'wrench' icon became a 'document' icon) once I   reset browser's theme.    The theme I had during the update was 'Minimal' by Google. </pre>
