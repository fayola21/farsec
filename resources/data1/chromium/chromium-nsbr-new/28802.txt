<title>Issue 28802 -   chromium -    gcl should allow svn operations on remote servers to interact with the user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> gcl should allow svn operations on remote servers to interact with the user.    For example  if the local svn client hasn't interacted with   '<a href="https://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/codereview.settings'">https://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/codereview.settings'</a> before  running   'svn cat' on that URL will require a username and password  or might require   accepting a X509 cert issued from an untrusted source.    Without allowing the svn client to interact with the user  the user   experiences the equivalent of a hang in gcl. </pre>
