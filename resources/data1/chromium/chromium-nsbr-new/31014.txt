<title>Issue 31014 -   chromium -    Byte range cache is locked when attempting to open the same video twice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try and load the same video on the same page from two different &lt;video&gt;  elements.  You'll notice they never load.  Attempting to refresh the page  will display the status text &quot;Waiting for cache...&quot; and the page refuses to  load.    This can also be reproduced by having the same video opened (Open video in  new tab) twice.  One tab may start playing while the next tab has to wait.    Does not happen with --disable-byte-range-support </pre>
