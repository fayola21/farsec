Goto to any website like <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>  2. Select the entire URL or any part of the URL from the Omnibox  3. Use mouse to drag the selection to a textbox or textarea      As long as the Omnibox selection includes the beginning of the URL and   includes at least the entire hostname  dragging the selection will include   http:// in dragging and subsequent drops.  It does not matter if you make the   selection starting from the beginning  anywhere in the middle  or the end.      The dropped text is missing the protocol.   </pre>
