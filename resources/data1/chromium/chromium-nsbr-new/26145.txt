<title>Issue 26145 -   chromium -    refactor RenderWidgetHostView initialization to be cross-platform  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This affects several areas using RenderWidgetHostView for UI in a  windows-only way  at least ExtensionView and BalloonHostView (for desktop  notifications).    Suggested impl from beng:    I think the correct fix for the cross-platformness may be to make  RenderWidgetHostView have a static &quot;Create&quot; method that takes a RWH. The  method would be implemented in each RenderWidgetHostView* file  and for  example call Create in the _win version.    We shouldn't need to call ShowWindow... rather RWHV should have a Show()  method.    Then the code in your Init method looks like:    RenderWidgetHostView* view = RenderWidgetHostView::CreateView(rvh   parent_widget);  rvh-&gt;set_view(view);  view-&gt;Show();  Attach(view-&gt;GetNativeView());   </pre>
