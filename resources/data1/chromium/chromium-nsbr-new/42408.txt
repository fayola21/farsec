<title>Issue 42408 -   chromium -    Rapid switch betreen http/https and http/ftp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For China users  they often need to switch to https to pass the GFW.  Just click the urlbar and add a &quot;s&quot; is quick and convenient.    I personal often switch between http and ftp.  Just select the &quot;ht&quot; and press &quot;f&quot; &quot;enter&quot; is quick.    When http:// is hidden  the urlbar is jumpy when toggling between http and   non-http tabs.  That is  the domain name jump to left and right and left and right and   left...etc.    I listed bugs that related with HTTPStripping here:  <a href="http://pastebin.com/6X6cdXgG">http://pastebin.com/6X6cdXgG</a>  59 bugs. Ouch.    You can prevent so many duplicated bugs if you do not tag some of them   &quot;WontFix&quot; in the first place.    HTTPStripping is a *VERY BAD* feature. (Yeh  you call it feature  but I and   many other people call it BUG.) </pre>
