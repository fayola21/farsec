<title>Issue 44554 -   chromium -    Problems with accentuated words in textarea. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>      1. Open a page with a textarea; (<a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>  for instance)  2. Try inserting any accentuated word  like &quot;n��_��_o&quot; or &quot;Jos��_��_&quot;.      A properly accentuated word.      In the first occurrence of an accentuated letter  the accent flashes and disappears  leaving &quot;n��_��_o&quot;   as &quot;nao&quot; and &quot;Jos��_��_&quot; as &quot;Jose&quot;.    PS1. It only happens on the first accent inserted on that page. If you erase the word and try   again  everything works fine.    Video attached. </pre>
