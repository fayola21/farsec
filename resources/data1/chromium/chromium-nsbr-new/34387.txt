<title>Issue 34387 -   chromium -    Omnibox: Ctrl+Alt+Enter doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.307.2 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37599">r37599</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1) Type &quot;google&quot; in the address bar  2) Hit Ctrl +Alt+ Enter     Expected: Should add www and .com to URL and open the URL in the new tab.    Actual: On Pressing Ctrl+Alt   the first suggestion gets selected with adding www and .com to &quot;google&quot;. But on Hitting enter   omnibox clears away omnibox with out loading any new tab. It adds blank lines for the omnibox suggestion drop down. ( Screen   shot attached )    Note: Win/Linux works as expected. </pre>
