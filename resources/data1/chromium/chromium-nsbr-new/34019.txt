<title>Issue 34019 -   chromium -    Personal passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is too easy to access to personal passwords under Options/Personal   Staff/Show saved passwords. Namely in only few seconds I may be able to   access to this exclusive information while owner of the personal computer   is not under my shoulder. Maybe it seems uncommon but people are using   computers owned and managed by other very often  sometimes for few minutes   sometimes even longer. I am not comfortable to borrow my computer for 1   minute if I am aware of risk that the borrower could access to my personal   passwords (or I will turn to other web browser). Also  it is very tempting   not to access this section when you use other person's computer.    In conclusion &quot;saved password option&quot; is generally more than useful in fact   necessary but the access to the passwords should be somehow protected (by   password or in other way - I am not an engineer but lawyer).     </pre>
