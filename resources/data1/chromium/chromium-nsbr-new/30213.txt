<title>Issue 30213 -   chromium -    Global Menu support for GNOME/Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.270.0 (Developer Build 34431)  OS + version: Arch Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager: Gnome/Compiz      1. Install Chromium  2. Open Chromium with gnome2-globalmenu enabled      A global menu similar to that of the OS X version of Chromium      Global menu shows the text &quot;chrome&quot; and nothing else    Screenshot attached.    Is there any way of getting the menu bar to work with global-menu? All   that's needed is a native GTK bar (or at least an optional one) and it   should work with it. It's a shame that there's no popular browser that   works with gnome2-globalmenu  and Chrome/Chromium could be the first. </pre>
