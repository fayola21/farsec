<title>Issue 32855 -   chromium -    Debugging strings with new lines is really painful - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Create a variable and set it equal to a string with a new line.  e.g.   'hinhi'  2. Run the debugger and set a break point to check the value of the string      I'd like to see the new line as n just as FireBug does.  e.g. 'hinhi'        The newline is replaced with a space  so it's really hard to tell new lines   from spaces  how many new lines there are  etc.  e.g. 'hi hi'     </pre>
