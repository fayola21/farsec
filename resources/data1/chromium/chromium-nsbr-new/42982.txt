Drop two folders with bookmarks into Other Bookmarks (say folder 1 and 2)  2. Try dragging one bookmark from folder1 to folder 2.    Expected:  The folder 2 window opens up and we can drop into it and it should close ones we move to a   different bookmark  or click on the browser.    Actual:  The folder 2 window opens up and stays open.  We have to quit the browser to get rid of the open bookmark folder window.   </pre>
