<title>Issue 29337 -   chromium -    RunCommand() should use direct_output=True by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> RunCommand() should use direct_output=True by default.    Recent modification to RunCommand() adds a direct_output parameter and sets   that to False by default.  Try switching to direct_output=True by default and   see if we can get away with removing ourselves from the job of interacting   with process output completely.    See <a title="runtest.py loses output when tests hang" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29140"> issue 29140 </a> for original work. </pre>
