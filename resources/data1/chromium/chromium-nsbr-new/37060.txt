<title>Issue 37060 -   chromium -    attachments in Gmail do not work via Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello     I use operating system UBUNTU.    I use Gmail in browser Chromium.  When I try to attach some files  I am not successful.(see attachment   bugscreen1.png)    Using Gmail in browser Firefox works okay. No problems at all (see   attachment bugscreen2.png)    Also I tried to upload a file to sharepoint of my school   (www.sharepoint.hu.nl) using browser chromium. Again I was not   successful.  Using Firefox  I was successful.    So  I suppose there is a bug in Chromium for UBUNTU (Linux)    So  right now I stop using Chromium in UBUNTU and switch to Firefox.    By the way  I am using Chromium to send this message. So maybe the   attachments will not work here also. Let us hope and pray. I going to   submit the issue now.     Regards and goodluck with finding the bug.    Geert Kapp��_��_  van Vroonhovenlaan 43  5503 CN Veldhoven  The Netherlands       </pre>
