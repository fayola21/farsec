<title>Issue 28407 -   chromium -    Close other tabs should ask if you have over X tabs open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.254.0 (Developer Build 32609)                    1. Open several tabs  2. Right click on a tab  choose close other tabs  3. Tabs close without asking the user        If configured to do so (should this be the default?)  a pop-up should ask   the user if they really want to close all those tabs.        All other tabs close. </pre>
