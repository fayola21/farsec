<title>Issue 26651 -   chromium -    Gears won't work in ChromeFrame if host network stack is being used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Gears and ChromeFrame both rely on intercepting HTTP requests issued by   Chrome. The Chrome network stack does not support chaining HTTP interceptors.   As a result if ChromeFrame intercepts HTTP requests it would end up bypassing   Gears in the browser process altogether. This basically means that features   in gears like offline db  etc won't work.   </pre>
