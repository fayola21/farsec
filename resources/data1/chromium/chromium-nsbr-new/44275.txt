<title>Issue 44275 -   chromium -    libffmpegsumo.so text relocation security problem on installation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :    Google Chrome	5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.38 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome        1. Install chrome from www.google.com/chrome  2. Start chrome by double-clicking icon        Chrome should start.        SELinux troubleshooter pops up with a security problem:    SELinux is preventing chrome from loading  /opt/google/chrome/libffmpegsumo.so which requires text relocation.     See attached for the full security alert.  I don't know what it means  but  I assume it doesn't like something about the Chrome installation.  I  haven't seen this with other installations  and my Linux version is pretty  vanilla:    Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.30.10-105.2.23.fc11.i586 #1 SMP Thu Feb 11  06:51:26 UTC 2010 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux       </pre>
