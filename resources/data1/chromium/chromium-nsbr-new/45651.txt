<title>Issue 45651 -   chromium -    linux dev loses access to profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   There are no repeatable steps that I know. Twice today chrome (6.0.408.1   dev) got hosed (multiple windows locked up this morning -- corp and   personal gmail  facebook  code review -- and just now it failed to fetch   the next page of a code review)  and when I killed / exited chrome and   started again  it couldn't open my profile. In all cases  .config/google-  chrome/Default/User Stylesheets/Custom.css is inaccessible (can't be   removed  can't be moved). Rebooting the machine (glucid on a lenovo T400)   releases the Custom.css file and allows chrome to once again open the   profile. Logging out was insufficient to release the file: I had to reboot.   This happened to me yesterday as well.    I'll put a tar of the profile in ~adeboor/chrome_profile.tar  but I suspect   it won't help.             </pre>
