<title>Issue 25973 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Tab dragging - Chrome window doesn't stay where it is dropped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome: 4.0.226.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30140">r30140</a>)  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)        1. Drag a tab and drop it somewhere on the desktop.    What is the expected output?     The Chrome window should stay where it is dropped.    What do you see instead?    The Chrome window always moves to the same location regardless of where it  is dropped.  Compare to behavior of Chrome/Windows.   </pre>
