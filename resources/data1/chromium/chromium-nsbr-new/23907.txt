<title>Issue 23907 -   chromium -    floating bookmark bar draws slightly off when resizing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> in a theme with bottom-alignment.    It seems the tab contents's allocation gets changed right after we read it    hence we draw for the wrong tab contents allocation. I've tried to work   around it by delaying the draw  but that failed. I also tried to work around   it by using the size of the render area vbox instead  but that doesn't take   into account all the other widgets (such as the download shelf). Solution is   probably to move the download shelf out of the render area vbox and account   for the other widgets (infobars  find bar) by assuming they are above the   tab contents. </pre>
