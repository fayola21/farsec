<title>Issue 45140 -   chromium -    Tabs resize as closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.417.0 (Developer Build 48283)  OS                   : Windows 7 x86  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Open enough tabs (not blank ones) to cause the tab size to shrink.  2. Click the close button on the second tab from the left.      The tab closes and the tab to the right slides to the left putting the   close button directly under the mouse so you are not forced to move the   mouse to close the next window.      The tab closes and then all the tabs grow a little causing the close button   for the next tab to not be aligned with the mouse.    Additional info:  Chrome didn't used to work like this. Before you could close several tabs   at once and the tabs would stay small until you moved you mouse away from   the tab bar. Then they would finally resize. This made it easy to close a   bunch of tabs. If you repeat my steps above but rather then opening tabs   with webpages  open blank tabs. If all the tabs are blank it exhibits the   correct behavior. So the key in reproducing this bug is to be sure you are   not opening a bunch of empty/blank tabs. This bug just popped up in the   past few weeks. </pre>
