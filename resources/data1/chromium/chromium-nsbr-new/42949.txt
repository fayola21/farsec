<title>Issue 42949 -   chromium -    On a slow machine  typing foo +ctrl+enter in NNTP rendered blank page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.375.28  OS: XP    On a slow machine  typing foo +ctrl+enter in NNTP renders blank page.    I thought  It was same as <a title="Typed Omnibox text is erased when Chrome finishes loading" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41466"> Issue 41466 </a>. Filing this as a new issue after   talking with Scott.    -On a slow machine  create a NNTP type foo in the omnibox and hit   ctrl+enter to navigate to foo.com ( you have to finish this before NTP is   loaded)    Issue:  White blank page (No NTP is loaded even)    Expected:  Should navigate to foo.com    To replicate this issue easily  navigate few websites to make Chrome busy    then press and hold Ctrl+T to create NTP's and then type foo (in the last   NTP) and hit ctrl+enter.
