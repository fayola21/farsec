<title>Issue 27559 -   chromium -    Alt+Key should not trigger content access keys on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In DokuWiki  AccessKey+E triggers &quot;edit this page&quot;.  Supposedly  Chrome   supports this on both Linux and Windows via Alt+Shift for &quot;AccessKey&quot;.    However  Chrome/Win also triggers this on Alt+E  which triggers the page menu   in the browser.    I have not tested  but I imagine Alt+S and Alt+Shift+S both trigger &quot;Save&quot; in   DokuWiki.    We should simply not trigger access keys on Alt+Key.  This leaves Alt+Shift   as the canonical access key combo  matches Firefox  and lets us use Alt+Key   in the browser UI as needed. </pre>
