<title>Issue 27851 -   chromium -    Application-positioning algorithm needs improvement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.3.22.2 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=242">r242</a>)  Chrome: 4.0.245.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31763">r31763</a>)    The mini-applications can slide to position themselves (sort of like tabs)   but there is some room for improvement.  Also  what if there are too many  apps open to fit in the width of the screen?         1. Click on icon at far left of title bar to open applications menu.  2. Open Notepad  Calculator  To-do list  Contacts.  3. Note that Notepad is mostly offscreen to the left.  4. Close Calculator application.    What is the expected output?     Notepad should slide over and position itself next to To-do list (Tasks)  application.    What do you see instead?    Notepad remains partially offscreen to the left.   </pre>
