<title>Issue 24060 -   chromium -    Need to make sure all ids are unique in decoding bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A while back we changed bookmark to persist ids  rather the assigning on   startup. It appears at least one user has encountered a situation where his   bookmark file contains duplicate ids and chrome gets thoroughly confused.    We should add error checking code such that if a user has duplicate ids we   reassign them on startup.   </pre>
