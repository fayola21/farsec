<title>Issue 46015 -   chromium -    Print selection results in truncated output for long lines (wrapped text is &quot;unwrapped&quot; and line breaks removed) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16575">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16575</a>  2. select everything from &quot;Reported by prog...&quot; to &quot;Owner: viettrun...@chromium.org&quot;  3. Click page icon &gt; Print (or press Ctrl+P)  4. Select PDFCreator as printer. Under page range  click the radio button next to Selection      To print what was selected.      Major truncation of data on output. It seems that wrapped text &amp; some line breaks are not rendered  resulting in long  single lines of text that should be multiple lines and  on occasion  lines getting joined together  i.e. the beginning of one line is rendered at the end of the previous line with no spacing between them.    Also  the text is cut off at a certain horizontal point  i.e.  everything to the right of that point is hidden.      Also  also  the resulting width of the PDF seems to be determine by the length of the long single lines that are partially hidden as well as some unknown factor for extra padded white space below the selected text.
