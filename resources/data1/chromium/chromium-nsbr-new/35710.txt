<title>Issue 35710 -   chromium -    Hitting &lt;esc&gt; while dragging in omnibox does not cancel drag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.329.0 (39027)  OS                   : Linux (Ubuntu 9.10)    Type in the address bar  click and drag in the dropdown  and while holding   the mouse button  hit esc.       We should release capture and reset the selection to the beginning.    Instead we reset and immediately set the selection back to the hovered   item  and retain capture.      This bug is the same as <a title="Hitting &lt;esc&gt; while dragging in omnibox does not cancel drag" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33460"> Issue 33460 </a>. It seems fixed under Windows but not   under Linux (can't confirm the Mac version).   </pre>
