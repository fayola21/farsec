<title>Issue 32652 -   chromium -    Only the favicon (without the Bookmark-Title) is in the Bookmark-Bar to see  after dragging a marked address from the URL-Bar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.303.0 (36557)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY !!!  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OKAY !!!  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. go for example to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  2. click into the URL-Bar (that the link <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> is marked)  3. Drag the marked link to the Bookmark-Bar      Favicon and Bookmark-Title should be visible      Only the favicon is to see.      Or an alternative option would be: The Bookmark-Save-Bubble could pop-up to edit the title   and address.    Thanks and regards !  Mehmet </pre>
