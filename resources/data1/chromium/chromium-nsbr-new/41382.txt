<title>Issue 41382 -   chromium -    Audio element: The progress thumb is not positioned correctly after clicking the trackbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an mp3 file in Chrome.  2. Click on the audio element somewhere to the left or right of the progress thumb.    What is the expected output?    The progress thumb should be centered at the mouse position.    What do you see instead?    The left edge of the thumb is placed at the mouse position.    FWIW  the progress thumb for Safari 4 does not have the same issue. </pre>
