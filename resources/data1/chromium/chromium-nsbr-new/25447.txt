<title>Issue 25447 -   chromium -    &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; should default to on - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It took me weeks to find the excessively well hidden:    Right click on the &quot;title bar&quot; that chrome implements  Select &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot;    There is also an Options for this.      This should not be the default.  Respect the user's choice of window   managers.  Mine for example is relatively customized; the click-bindings are   NOT stock.  Don't override it.   </pre>
