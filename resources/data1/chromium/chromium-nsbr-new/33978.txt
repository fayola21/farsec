<title>Issue 33978 -   chromium -    CSS rounded corners are rendered badly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78          Firefox 3.6 (Win): OK      Firefox 3.5.7 (OSX): OK      Chrome 4.0.249.49 (OSX): FAIL      Safari 4.0.4 (OSX) FAIL      1. Use -webkit-border-radius in a page's CSS      Smooth  rounded (anti-aliased) corners. Firefox has the optimal rendering  as you can see from   the attached image.      Chrome &amp; Safari have a couple of issues:  - Where the element has a 1 pixel border  the rounded corners look &quot;weak&quot; i.e. slightly thin. They   don't have the same weight as the straight edges lines of the horizontal and vertical borders.  - Where the element has both a border and a background colour  the background colour bleeds   outside the rounded border. This produces artifacts outside the border and is particularly   noticeable on thicker borders that match the page's background colour (as per the last column in   the attached image) </pre>
