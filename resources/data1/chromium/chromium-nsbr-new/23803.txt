<title>Issue 23803 -   chromium -    Scrolling instead of using scroll wheel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                  Just add the possibility of pressing the third button(middle button) and   get a cursor in shape of scroll  which allows moving up and down  instead   of scrolling with the scroll wheels. (Firefox and IE have this feature)  I need this desperately  since i'm lazy. Thanks for all the understanding.     </pre>
