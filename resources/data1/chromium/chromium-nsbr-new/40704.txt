<title>Issue 40704 -   chromium -    Brief flash of tiny browser action popup before seeing regular popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the current version of the Google Similar Pages extension  when you   click on the browser action icon you see a tiny (5x5?) popup just to the   bottom right of the icon for about a second before the regular popup bubble   appears.    I showed this to Erik - he said the place to start looking for the cause of   this is to add some logging in ExtensionHost::UpdatePreferredSize and   ExtensionHost::DocumentAvailableInMainFrame. It's possible we're sending the   EXTENSION_POPUP_VIEW_READY notification before the preferred size is set to   something reasonable.    This was with Chrome version 5.0.366.2 on Windows. I've attached the   extension.  </pre>
