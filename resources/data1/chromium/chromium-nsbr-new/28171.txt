<title>Issue 28171 -   chromium -    Remove &quot;Clear Browsing Data...&quot; menu item from Chrome menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Chrome Menu has a &quot;Clear Browsing Data...&quot; menu item. This placement   is too prominent. We removed the menu item from the wrench menu on   Windows to the second page of Options.    In general  it's better for users if they use an Incognito for web surfing they   don't want traces left of  since this is better than wiping your history.    There's another bug on file for a keyboard shortcut for the clear browsing   data option  which should satisfy power users. </pre>
