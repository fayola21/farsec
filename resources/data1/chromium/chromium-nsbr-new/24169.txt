<title>Issue 24169 -   chromium -    Make focus outline follow OS native style - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our form controls are not native looking and do not follow the look and feel for   hover and focused state but this bug is about the generic focus outline as used   for links and elements with tab index.    Steps to reproduce:    1. Use windows:  2. Tab to a link    Expected behavior:    The link should have an invert 1px dotted outline (no matter the zoom)    Actual behavior:    We show a orange mac focus outline     </pre>
