<title>Issue 27932 -   chromium -    Regression: Forced rendering for every keystroke - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 29857      Chrome appears to repaint on every keystroke  this causes significant   performance degradation when typing inside pages with complicated DOM.    This is apparent in the Google Wave client on machines with slow graphics   rendering- (most apparent on Linux Chrome).    This can also be reproduced inside a plain contentEditable div  after   pasting in large content.    Previously on machines with slow graphics rendering  typing will cause keys   to be batched up and rendered a few letters at a time. With rev 29857  keys   appear one at a time. This significantly reduces typing throughput when   each render cycle is slow. Suppose the render cycle takes 200ms  then only   5 keystrokes can be processed per second.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Open up Gmail compose  and make sure rich text editing is on.  2. Paste in some complicated DOM into the contentEditable  i.e.   <a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domtables">http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domtables</a>  3. Type in the editor and observe that the letters appear one at a time.  4. If the machine renders the page quickly  the effect might not be   obvious  in that case  copy and paste the page 3-4 times.     </pre>
