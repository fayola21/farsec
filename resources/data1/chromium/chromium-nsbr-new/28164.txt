<title>Issue 28164 -   chromium -    Inserting bad character when using the Command key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Load a page which contains a textarea (this text field I am currently   typing in for example)    2. Type Command+Arrow.    My expectation is for the cursor to move to the end of the line -- this   happens. However  it also inserts a garbage character: ��_��_��_    This is pretty annoying since I use the Command+Arrow shortcuts all the   time.    Reproducing for me in 4.0.249.0 (Official Build 32041) on Mac Os 10.5.8 </pre>
