Open page to <a href="http://www.dankantor.com/html5-audio-attachment.html">http://www.dankantor.com/html5-audio-attachment.html</a>  2. The &lt;audio&gt; tag on top has its src set to a file that is served with a content-disposition of   attachment. It does not load (or play) in the player.  3. The &lt;audio&gt; tag on bottom has its src set to a file that does not have a content-disposition of   attachment. It loads (and plays) in the player.        The audio player should attempt to play any audio src that it is given. This works in the Safari   html5 audio player as well as Flash.         It fails to load the audio src.     It does also not work in Chrome if you create an Audio object in javascript.      </pre>
