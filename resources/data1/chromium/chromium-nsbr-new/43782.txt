<title>Issue 43782 -   chromium -    Change chromium shutdown to use ExitProcess / _exit once all important data has been saved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Change chromium shutdown to use ExitProcess / _exit once all important data   has been saved    One possible way to implement this is with a reference count on the browser   process lifetime.  Each subsystem that needs a finalizer  each tab that has   unload handlers  etc. would increment this reference count.    This may be tricky to implement given how asynchronous our system is  and it   may be helpful if base/ provided some support for this  so we can easily   leverage it from net/ and other non-chrome bits. </pre>
