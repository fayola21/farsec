<title>Issue 42406 -   chromium -    After page refresh breakpoints are not shown but still active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Debug my javascript application  2. Set a breakpoint and hit F5 a few times  3. The breakpoint is not shown and Chromium thinks it doesn't exist but   the debugger still stops at the breakpoint        The breakpoint should still be visible  I should be able to delete or disable the breakpoint        Chromium thinks the breakpoint doesn't exist - it's no longer shown. The   debugger still thinks the breakpoint still exists even though I can't   disable or delete it. I end up with lots of useless breakpoints that make   debugging impossible.    <b>Please provide
