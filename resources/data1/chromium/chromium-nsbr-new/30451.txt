<title>Issue 30451 -   chromium -    Download bar increases total window height - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (mac)        1. Size the window so that it takes up all but a few pixels of vertical space.   More than WindowHeight - DownloadBarHeight  2. Download a file  3. Close the download bar        The window should shrink back to the original height.      Total window height is increased  even when the download bar is closed.    This does not happen if the available vertical expansion room is &gt; than the   download bar height. (in that case it does shrink) </pre>
