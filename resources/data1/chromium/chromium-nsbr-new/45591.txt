<title>Issue 45591 -   chromium -    UI thread is accessing disk file Visited Links during start up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was analyzing start up performance. Based on some tracing file sent by   Jeff  I noticed that the UI thread is accessing   &quot;Documents and Settings&lt;user&gt;Local SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultVisited Links&quot; during start up. We need   to find out what code is doing that and fix it.   </pre>
