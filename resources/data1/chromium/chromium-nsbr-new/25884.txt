<title>Issue 25884 -   chromium -    Make fast/dom/Document/CaretRangeFromPoint/caretRangeFromPoint-in-zoom-and-scroll.html less port-dependent. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test was picked up when we rolled webkit to include <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=49990">r49990</a>.  The test   clicks at a specific pixel so different fonts result in slightly different   positions.    Assigning to xji since xji added the test. </pre>
