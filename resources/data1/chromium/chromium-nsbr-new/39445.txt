<title>Issue 39445 -   chromium -    SSL and Non Secure Page Content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate to a page secured by SSL but where some content  like images    are not loaded securely (perhaps because of http links)  2. Click links to navigate to other pages of same domain  also using SSL    but where the code is &quot;clean&quot; and all the content should load securely.    This even happens when a following page of the same domain is a completely   blank PHP tag (open + close with no content).  3. Compare when navigate via https directly to the desired page without   ever first &quot;crossing&quot; through the known problem page.      If the source code on the page that loads is clean and loading all content   appropriately then there should be no warning or error about the given page   rendering some content that is not secure (especially if it's a blank page   with no source code).      The page renders a some-content-not-secure warning if any previous pages   had the error  regardless of whether the source code for those following   pages is clean.    <b>Please provide
