<title>Issue 36320 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Spell checker suggestions are worse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Misspell a common word in a recent version of chrome 4  like   &quot;unnecesarry&quot; or &quot;micelanious&quot;.  2. Right click it to bring up the context menu.      Emil tells me these used to have good suggestions in Chrome 2  but they got   worse in Chrome 3+.  (He has a zip file of Chrome 2 that he apparently still   uses.) </pre>
