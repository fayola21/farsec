<title>Issue 32202 -   chromium -    Support for distributions of chromium other than google chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently Google Chrome is the major distribution of chromium. There are   and will be other chromium based browsers with customization for certain   user groups/countries. This bug is to track our discussion on whether and   what we should do in chromium so that other distribution partners can   easily do the right thing when packaging chromium.    The initial list for consideration includes:  - Put distribution related resource together. This includes branding   related strings  build-in url for help links  icon  etc.  - Ability to build Chromium with official optimization without Google   Chrome branding.  - Ability to install/update to paths other than Google Chrome or Chromium   default.      </pre>
