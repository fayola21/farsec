<title>Issue 35690 -   chromium -    Pages Keep Crashing. I keep running into the Oh Snap Page  Chrome 5.0.307.7 beta on Linux Ubuntu 9.10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.7 beta  URLs (if applicable) : Many different URLs. Here is only 1 example.  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/newborn/AN01687">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/newborn/AN01687</a>  or trying going to this search result:  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?">http://www.google.com/search?</a>  hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;esrch=FT1&amp;q=should+I+wake+my+child+to+give+him+medication&amp;aq  =f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=   and then clicking on the link for &quot;Medicine and your child.   How to give your child medicine&gt;    I have discovered that I get the &quot;Oh Snap&quot; crash page when I click on a   number of links from search results. However  when I type the URL directly   in to the address bar  I don't get a crash.  Like in th example above  if you ever the Mayo Clinic post by typing in the   URL  you are fine. If however  you enter that site by clicking a link from   the google search results  you get a crash.          Firefox 3.5.7: OK                        1. Conduct a search using google search engine  2. Click on link from search results        I expect to click on links from the search results and enter the site.        Many of the links will end up crashing and getting the &quot;oh snap&quot; page with   Chrome Beta 5.0.307.7 on Linux UBuntu 9.10  This was not apparent in the   previous beta version and only happened after update.    Again  this crash results only if I click on a link from search results.   Typing a URL into the address bar on my own does not result in a crash. </pre>
