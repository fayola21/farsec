<title>Issue 43684 -   chromium -    FIX THE 'MARK AS FAVORITE' BUTTON LOCATION.... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: '5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev'&gt;    PLEASE CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE 'MARK AS FAVORITE' BUTTON TO THE LEFT SIDE   AGAIN PLEASE. THE LEFT SIDE IS SIMPLY MORE CONVENIENT.  I AM USING THE DEV   BUILDS AND IN THE LAST VERSION  IT WAS MOVED BACK TO THE LEFT LOCATION AFTER   THE PREVIOUS VERSION. BUT NOW IT IS AGAIN AT RIGHT. IT IS GETTING REALLY   IRRITATING... </pre>
