Same thing happens with Google Calendar  even after successful login to  Google Mail.    This behaviour has only started about two days ago  everything worked fine  until then. It may be related to a recent upgrade  but I don't know how to  check the time of the last update  or what was actually upgraded...        <b>Please provide
