<title>Issue 23252 -   chromium -    Resizing w/NTP looks really janky on Mac. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open NTP.  2. Grab the window resize nub and drag left and right.        On Windows  everything sits still and then &quot;pops&quot; larger (or smaller) at some point.  On Mac    everything jitters around something terrible.    Unfortunately  I'm having some troubles reliably replicating this.  I can't seem to get it at all on the   current devchannel build.  I also often don't get it on my trunk build.    I suspect that there's a latency thing  that sometimes the loop out to the renderer is fast enough to   put the right results up before flush so that I never see the jitter.  I find myself wondering if what   I'm seeing is the render host view being rooted at the lower left on Mac  so that on resize   everything shifts down a bit  then is overwritten with content adjusted for the new size. </pre>
