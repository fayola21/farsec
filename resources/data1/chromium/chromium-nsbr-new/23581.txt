<title>Issue 23581 -   chromium -    use string16 cleanup wstring in shared code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/98c1b1beaecf96bf    For a while we seemed to be making progress on this  but we seem to have   lost steam  and are having to write more UI code that deals with wstring.  If we   could finish this we might even get code shrinkage if we can stop having   string16 and wstring apis for a bunch of stuff. </pre>
