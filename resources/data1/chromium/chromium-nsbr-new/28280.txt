<title>Issue 28280 -   chromium -    Have a &quot;Quick Tabs&quot; screen that shows thumbnails of all open tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I have more than 10 tabs in a chrome window  it gets tough to navigate   them. It would be ultra cool if all my tabs can be seen with screenshots   similar to how a new tab page shows popular tabs.    From anywhere in the chrome window  if I press a short cut key  it can bring   up a page which shows all my tabs as screenshots (9 per page and navigation   to prev/next page) and clicking on the screenshot should take me to the   corresponding tab). </pre>
