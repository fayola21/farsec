<title>Issue 29996 -   chromium -    throbber fails to become favicon on popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4 separate people have commented about this on <a title="Regression: Window icon shows throbber" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26600"> issue 26600 </a>.  From comment   50:    It seems that Chrome fails to update icon on Taskbar Button  from throbber to Chrome icon  when loading is finished.    The icon on Taskbar may vary. If you reload the popup   you'll see different part of circle.  And if you toggle &quot;Use small icons&quot; checkbox in Taskbar option   the icon will be updated correctly.  OTOH  icon on top-left corner of window is proper one.  So this may not be a icon resource assignment issue.    Application mode window has proper icon on Taskbar.  That issue would be applied to popup windows only.    Throbber effect in Taskbar is not supported on WinXP.   </pre>
