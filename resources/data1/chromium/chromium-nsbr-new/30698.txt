<title>Issue 30698 -   chromium -    SPDY: WebKit Throttling - DocLoader throttling of Preload items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DocLoader.cpp manages a m_pendingPreload queue rather than directly issuing   preloads to the network layer when rendering has not started.  This hold-back   of resource requests can hugely delay network resource fetching when there   are large external JS files being loaded in a page before rendering.  (see   <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/</a> as one such example).     </pre>
