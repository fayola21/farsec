<title>Issue 35689 -   chromium -    Hidden extensions dropdown button doesn't fit in with the rest of Chrome. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2    The current dropdown icon for hidden extensions (ï¿½_) looks out of place and   doesn't fit in with the rest of the Chrome UI.    The best thing to change it to is the dropdown icon that appears on the right   of the 'Page' and 'Tools' buttons. This adds consistency on the toolbar and definitely looks much nicer.    See screenshots below of a mookup (good.png) that I made.     </pre>
