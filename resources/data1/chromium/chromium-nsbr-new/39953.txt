<title>Issue 39953 -   chromium -    KISA root CA cert (turned on on Windows) has some issues.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  Chrome uses the same set of Root cert as IE does (AFAIK). As a result  KISA root   cert is accepted. However  apparently  there are some issues with KISA root cert.     See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335197#c99">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335197#c99</a>     Although I want to see KISA root CA cert recognized by browsers including Chrome  I think we   should be careful with what we accept (some Koreans may hate me for filing this bug ;-) ).       </pre>
