<title>Issue 35354 -   chromium -    Developer Tools doesn't follow changes in DOM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193) dev      1. Inspect an element in any dynamic web pages  2. Observe an element that is being changed by  say some scripts  3. Re-inspect the element  there is changes.    Should be able to get the changes in real-time.      It captures and freeze data.    I am actually comparing functionality with firebug here. Firebug would   update and highlight changes to DOM  however developer tool doesn't have   such luxury.   </pre>
