<title>Issue 35217 -   chromium -    Sometimes the tabstrip blanks out in patches when using extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Have a few tabs (not sure if you really need more than one)  2.Try reloading  opening new pages  3.Keep an eye on the tabstrip      Tabstrip should display the tabs without any issues        However you see some blanking out happening in patches (sometimes the   entire strip). Tabstrip repaints properly most of the cases after the pages   are all reloaded but sometimes the patch remains for a while. I caught one   of such cases  where the patch remains.    <b>Please provide
