<title>Issue 44645 -   chromium -    Pinned tab does not unpin properly... unpins in current session but restores on a new session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I pinned a specific intranet work webpage  2. Restart browser  pinned tab restores  3. Unpin tab (closing it or leaving it open afterwards makes no difference)  4. Restart browser  and previously unpinned tab is pinned again    Obviously  when we unpin a tab  we want it to stay unpinned and not restore   when we restart the browser.  Right now I can't figure out any way to   remove the pinned tab permanently  so it keeps coming back.            <b>Please provide
