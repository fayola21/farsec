<title>Issue 28173 -   chromium -    Tab attach animation jank fix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cole suggests the following animation be run when you are dragging a   detached tab and drop it into another tabstrip:    When the drop completes  the tabcontents and the tab should animate   quickly to their target bounds  rather than just snapping as done today. (The   tab actually animates in many cases today  but not always).   </pre>
