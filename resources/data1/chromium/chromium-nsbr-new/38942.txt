<title>Issue 38942 -   chromium -    Suggestions from history take several seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): FF 3.6.2: suggestions show up instantly      1. start typing something in location bar  wait for suggestions from history      history suggestions show up immediately      random site suggestions and search suggestions show up immediately. history suggestions take   several seconds to show up. seems like there are no suggestions if you don't wait long enough.    this seems to be a large problem sometimes and almost no problem at other times. i wonder if   there's some cursor on history suggestions that's held open afterwards - in which case maybe   loading up history is the problem.    on Firefox  there is zero delay. </pre>
