<title>Issue 43421 -   chromium -    Don't mix cookies with &quot;other site data&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In    Options-&gt;Content Settings...-&gt;Cookies    is the    &quot;Clear cookies and other site data when I close my browser&quot;    which doesn't make sense that &quot;other site data&quot; is a tab called &quot;Cookies&quot;.    But the worst part is  that I want to &quot;Clear cookies when I close the  browser&quot; but not also &quot;and other data&quot;.    What happens is that saved passwords and username are cleared as well  when  I want to keep those.    Cookies and &quot;other site data&quot; should not be mixed.    &quot;Other site data&quot; should have its own tab.         </pre>
