<title>Issue 25370 -   chromium -    Scrolling quick with mouse scroll wheel leaks to window behind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    OS version               :  10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not sure sorry      1. Open chrome onto a long document   (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_claim_to_the_French_throne">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_claim_to_the_French_throne</a>)  2. In another window open another long document (it doesn't need to be   chrome  even a long finder window or terminal - anything that will respond   to a mouse scroll wheel)  3. Position the windows so they partially overlap  with the chrome window   in front.  4. Quickly scroll with the mouse wheel in the region where they overlap.   Notice that the back window also scrolls (though at a slow rate).    Also note that this only occurs if the front window is long enough to need   to scroll. On a short page  using the scroll wheel has no effect on either   window.      The front window scrolls  the back window remains static.      Both windows scroll  the back one more slowly than the front. </pre>
