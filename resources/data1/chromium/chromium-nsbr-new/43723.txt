<title>Issue 43723 -   chromium -    composed characters are not correctly inputted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	6.0.398.0 (Build para desarrolladores 46565)  WebKit	533.8  V8	2.2.8  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.398.0 Safari/533.8  Command Line	 /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium -psn_0_2958034           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. open new tab or window  2. go to a page that has an input element (text input  textarea  etc.)  3. try to input composed characters as ��_��_  ��__  etc.       the composed character ��_��_  ��__      only the plain character is inputted (that is  'a'  'u'  etc.)      This happens in places such as google's search box  facebook  etc. Nevertheless  I seem to be   able to input some composed characters as ��_��_ or ��__ (which I have on my spanish keyboard layout)    as well as pressing ~+n  but it does not work with tildes.    This happens just the first time per tab/window. Once you delete and attempt to input the   composed character again  it will do it fine and keep working. </pre>
