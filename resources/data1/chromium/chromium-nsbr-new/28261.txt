<title>Issue 28261 -   chromium -    NSHeightAnimation needs to be renamed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30852">r30852</a> added chrome/browser/cocoa/animatable_view.mm  which contains   NSHeightAnimation.    For Objective-C classes  we should treat NS* as namespace reserved to Apple.    I'm bringing this into M4 because of the potential binary compatibility   problem. </pre>
