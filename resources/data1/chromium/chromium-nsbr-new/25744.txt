<title>Issue 25744 -   chromium -    iGoogle Chat status drop-down list doesn't trigger a scroll-down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : google.com/ig           Safari 4: Not sure    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 8: Doubtful      1. Go to your iGoogle page  2. Drag your Chat window near the bottom of the screen and make sure you're   scroll to the top of the screen  3. Click the down arrow next to Sign into chat. Observe the cut-off status   options list.        The window should trigger the scrollbar to scroll down so the entire list   is displayed.      The list is cut off.    Because this isn't Chrome-specific  I imagine it's a problem with the   iGoogle page. It's a pretty annoying bug because you have to click away   before you're able to scroll down  then you have to re-click the down   arrow. </pre>
