<title>Issue 43704 -   chromium -    Chrome silently crashes/closes aproximately 10 seconds after startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Can't get my about:version as the browser silently  crashes before I can navigate there.  But the version is 5.0.396.0 (and is  current as of now)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    This occurs in Linux 32-bit  Ubuntu Lucid.  I haven't tested in Windows or Mac.      1. Start Chrome  2. Wait 10 to 15 seconds  sometimes a little while longer  3. If you feel like it  try to open a tab or type a URL or click a button      Normality.      Chrome disappears without warning. All the processes were either closed or  crashed.  Sometimes (but not all the time) the windows gray out as is  standard in Ubuntu when the OS believes it is not responding.    Additional information:  If you cannot reproduce it  try reinstalling the Dev version of Google  Chrome (without uninstalling).  The version of the to-be-replaced  installation should match the version of the to-be-replaced-with  installation. (In otherwords  if you have 5.0.396.0-DEV installed  you  should reinstall 5.0.396.0-DEV.) </pre>
