<title>Issue 45688 -   chromium -    Chrome 5 installer writes &quot;client&quot; value to HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT during system-level update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome 4 system-level.  2. Force an update to Chrome 5.0.375.55.    Alternatively:  1. &quot;psexec.exe -s chrome_installer.exe --system-level&quot; where   chrome_installer.exe is version 5.0.375.55. This is equivalent to Google   Update running the installer as Local System during an update.      The &quot;client&quot; value should be written to HKLM    HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT is probably written because Chrome's installer is   writing to HKCU. Installers should not write to HKCU. See <a title="System-level toast should write client code to HKLM  not HKCU"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44378">issue 44378</a>.    I'm told the installer tries to write to the interactive user's HKCU  so   this is really a bug in that logic. Also  what is supposed to happen if   system-level Chrome is automatically updated while not users are logged in?    Fixing <a title="System-level toast should write client code to HKLM  not HKCU"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44378">issue 44378</a> would make this bug obsolete.       </pre>
