<title>Issue 27289 -   chromium -    Add UTF8 to function names in values.h that take UTF8 strings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example  CreateStringValue -&gt; CreateStringValueUTF8 and SetString -&gt;   SetStringUTF8.  This will make it more obvious to the caller that Values is   using UTF8  not some random stream of bytes.    The problem is we have some code that takes FilePath and calls SetString   with the filepath's value().  On Linux/Mac  value() returns a string and on   Windows  value() returns a wstring.  This conveniently works with SetString.    Unfortunately  on Linux  FilePath.value() might not be UTF8  so it causes us   to write the wrong value.    The idea is that by having an explicit SetStringUTF8  it will require people   to use #if's and think twice about what they are writing. </pre>
