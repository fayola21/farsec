<title>Issue 35307 -   chromium -    Can't save cookie settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.323.0 (38568) Ubuntu      What steps wil`l reproduce the problem?  1. Go to Options -&gt; Under The Hood -&gt; Cookie Settings  2. Select any of the options (I chose accept 'Accept Cookies Only From   Sites I Visit'  3. Click 'Close'    I expected the settings to persist  however  they didn't.  I was still have problem with sites that utilize cookies.  In addition  I think there might be a correlation between this is the   &quot;redirect loop&quot; I've seen mention in the forum. I imagine this loop occurs   as result of authentication  but I'm uncertain about that.    Any ideas or fixes?   </pre>
