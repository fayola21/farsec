<title>Issue 33792 -   chromium -    Canadian Government Websites - Security Issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Hello  This is Mika  a website developer / 'systems analysis' expert with a background in SEO and efficiency.     I work in Canada  and there have been times I have needed to use the canadian government's online resources  including the Service Ontario website and the Canada Revenue Agency website.     Since the launch of Google Chrome  I have attempted many times  all unsuccessfully  to use the e-application forms (javascript forms) featured on these websites.    I receive such errors as &quot;the browser you ae using in incompatible with the security features on this site  please download one of the following browsers...&quot;  which lists IE (Internet Explorer)  Firefox &amp; Safari but never Google Chrome. This has forced me to abandon Google Chrome when using these sites &amp; forfeit the security that I need Google to provide.     Sample errors:    (A) Bug @ <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca">http://www.serviceontario.ca</a>    When &quot;changing address&quot; regarding health coverage for residents  the e-application form is inaccessible with Chrome  resulting in the error message stated above.    (B) Bug @ <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca</a>    When &quot;reporting business/personal income&quot; for tax purporses  unable to register with the e-registration available for online income reporting using Chrome  unable to make online changes to accounts using Chrome  such as &quot;change of address&quot; etc.    Basically  for most Government of Canada websites  the security features of Chrome do not allow 'user-interaction' with these sites  making them 'read-only' information sites for Chrome users.    Regards  M.   </pre>
