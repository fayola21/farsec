<title>Issue 28206 -   chromium -    Replace MediaFormat with explicit structs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MediaFormat is a *pain* to use and the entire media pipeline architecture   should be refactored to use explicit data structs for communicating between   different filters.    For example  we keep passing the same information to the audio renderer   every time (channels  sample rate  sample bits  etc...)    Why not give up this silly convention and simply have an AudioRendererParams   struct that we fill out.  Same goes for audio/video decoders.  Gah!!!!    This refactoring can and should be done in stages. </pre>
