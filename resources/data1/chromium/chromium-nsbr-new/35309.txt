<title>Issue 35309 -   chromium -    History expiry causes inline autocomplete flakiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After using Chrome for a while  inline completion in the omnibox stops   working in a subtly irritating way.    Basically  say you get to cnn.com by typing &quot;c&quot; and relying on &quot;nn.com&quot;   being filled so you hit enter after typing &quot;c&quot;. When the omnibox gets into   this state you type &quot;c&quot;  &quot;nn.com&quot; is indeed filled but after a very brief   pause it disappears  so by the time you hit enter you end up doing a Google   search for &quot;c&quot;. The only cure is to type &quot;cnn.com&quot; in full and press enter    which seems to set it straight. This is very annoying.    I'm not sure if the cause is:    - having a profile for a while  - having stopped using a profile for a while. I noticed this on my work   windows machine after returning from a 3 week vacation  and also on my   linux machine which I only use occasionally... but think I recall seeing   this on my laptop which I use continuously as well which leads me to   theorize it's not just profiles that have been unused for a period of time.    Is some sort of history DB cleanup running here? </pre>
