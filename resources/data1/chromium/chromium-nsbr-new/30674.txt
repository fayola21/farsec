<title>Issue 30674 -   chromium -    Match patterns cannot match on arbitrary TLDs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The very company that makes Chrome redirects users of their search service   to a random TLD based on some algorithm. E.g. if I type some search terms   into the omnibar  I get redirected to www.google.ch/search   no matter how   hard I try to make it stop.    Unfortunately  it isn't possible to write a content script that would match   &quot;a google search result page&quot;  since the match pattern   &quot;http://www.google.*/search?* is not a valid pattern because &quot;if '*' is in   the host  it must be the first character&quot;   (<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/match_patterns.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/match_patterns.html</a>).    Kinda lame. Is there a reason why the match on host names is so restricted?    Thx  Matthias   </pre>
