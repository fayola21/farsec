<title>Issue 43065 -   chromium -    Extension api for catching clicks out of the web page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request. Firefox has this feature.    Currently it is not possible to catch the mouse click event when the user   clicks out of the web page. I mean  we can not catch the click on address   bar  refresh button  back button  etc.    Use cases:  With an extension single-click-selects-all behavior can be changed.   www.crbug.com/26140    Right now middle-click on back button opens the previous page in a new tab.   With an extension  middle-click on refresh button can open the page on a   new tab as expected.    Middle-click on a tab closes it. With an extension  middle-click on tabbar   (not on a specific tab) can reopen closed tab.    More things can be done on back/forward buttons. </pre>
