Cut/copy a bookmark or folder from Bookmark bar   2. Paste it on &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder on Bookmark bar via context menu - &quot;Paste&quot;    Actual: Nothing  copy/cut -Paste failed.    Expected: Bookmark should be pasted to &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder.    Mac-only. Windows Works as expected.    Other Observation:  Pasting bookmark to other folders on Bookmark bar works  but they create on Bookmark bar   rather than the actual folder . ( Not sure if this is expected or bug . This is OS-ALL )   </pre>
