<title>Issue 42006 -   chromium -    SELECT elements not losing focus; causes &quot;Delete&quot;  many other keys to stop working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Go to ANY webpage with one or more SELECT form elements:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>  2. Focus on any SELECT form element on that page:  Choose &quot;Defect on Mac OS&quot; from the &quot;Template&quot; menu.  3. Focus on any TEXT or TEXTAREA form element.  Click inside the &quot;Summary&quot; field.  4. Type some text then try hitting the &quot;Delete&quot; key.  Type &quot;Hello world&quot; and hit &quot;Delete&quot;.        The characters to the left of the cursor are deleted.        Nothing.  It appears certain keystrokes are sent to the SELECT element as if it still had focus.    &quot;Delete&quot;  &quot;Tab&quot;  &quot;Home&quot;  &quot;End&quot;  and the directional arrow keys are examples.    Even if no form elements have focus  keystrokes still effect that last-focused on SELECT element.    Using the example above  typing the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrows to scroll the page will instead move   to the previous and next OPTION elements in the SELECT element.    As you can imagine  this is rather frustrating as it's no longer possible to use the delete key in   any TEXT or TEXTAREA element once a SELECT element has been touched. </pre>
