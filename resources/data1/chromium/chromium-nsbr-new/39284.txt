<title>Issue 39284 -   chromium -    Gears &quot;location&quot; causes network card &quot;issues&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install inSSIDer from <a href="http://www.metageek.net">http://www.metageek.net</a>  2. Make sure all browsers which are running (and that maybe using the  'location' funtion) are switched off. You may need to reboot the machine if  a browser has already been run as this seems to be a &quot;modal&quot; issue. I have  discovered that disabling and re-enabling the network card in device  manager fixes the issue.  3. Start inSSIDer and start scanning using the wireless network card. Leave  inSSIDer scanning.  4. Start Chrome and access a webpage which uses the 'location' function  (Google Latitude via iGoogle).  5. inSSIDer should error and crash.        Application Error  Unable to continue scanning with selected interface: Unable to open device  .{FFB5AE4A-197E-45C0-B7FB-3AE1486539F5}. Win32Error = 2          <b>Please provide
