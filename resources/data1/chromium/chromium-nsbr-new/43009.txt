<title>Issue 43009 -   chromium -    Developer Tools: show more information about inherited styles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to see where is particular style inherited from; i.e. what   element it is inherited from and what rule in what resource is it defined by.    While I can see inspected element inherits style &quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;  the   inspector should also tell me that the style is inherited from body which   takes it from rule &quot;body  table td  select {font-family: Arial Unicode MS    Arial  sans-serif; font-size: small;}&quot; which is defined in   &quot;http://127.0.0.1:8888/appengine1/gwt/standard/standard.css    regards    J.
