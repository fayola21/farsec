<title>Issue 26826 -   chromium -    Should provide a Debian menu file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.223.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29900">r29900</a>  OS + version: Debian unstable    Google Chrome should also install a Debian menu file (as   /usr/share/menu/google-chrome-unstable for now; it should be the same name   of the package)  so users with different window managers will get Google   Chrome on their menus.    Note that into postinst you will need:    if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;configure&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ -x &quot;`which update-menus 2&gt;/dev/null`&quot; ];   then          update-menus  fi      And in postrm:    if [ -x &quot;`which update-menus 2&gt;/dev/null`&quot; ]; then update-menus ; fi    (don't know how you create the Debian packages  but if you use debhelper   these snippets are automagically added).  I's also good to install an icon.    A menu is attached. </pre>
