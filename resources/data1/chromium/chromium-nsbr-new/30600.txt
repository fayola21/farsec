<title>Issue 30600 -   chromium -    [Mac] Changes to multiple bookmarks lock up UI thread for seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user has a large number of bookmarks  changing any bookmark locks up the UI thread for a   noticeable amount of time  and changing multiple bookmarks at once multiplies this delay.    This is really showing up badly in the bookmark manager I'm implementing ��_��_��_ I have 2000   bookmarks currently stored in chrome  and dragging one URL in causes a noticeably janky pause   before it appears in the list (maybe 500ms)  while dragging in a whole folder of them from Safari   completely locks up the UI long enough to beachball.    Shark profiling shows that 98% of the time is being spent in BookmarkMenuBridge::Loaded. This   method regenerates the entire bookmark menu  and it's called every time any change notification is   received. There's a comment &quot;TODO(jrg): this is brute force; perhaps we should be nicer.&quot; </pre>
