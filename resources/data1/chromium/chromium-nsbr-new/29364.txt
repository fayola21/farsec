<title>Issue 29364 -   chromium -    Linux_views trybot broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The try bot at <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-</a>  server/builders/linux_view has not worked in days. Ditto for linux_chromeos.    What's going on? Who wants to fix it? If nobody raises their hand soon  I   will investigate. </pre>
