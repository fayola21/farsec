<title>Issue 30756 -   chromium -    tabs.executeScript cannot execute script on local extension page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)      1. Install test extension in attachment. The extension includes a local   html file &quot;hello.html&quot;. The background page loads hello.html into a new   window  and then calls tabs.executeScript to create an alert.      Alert box displays.      The following error message is given:    Error during tabs.executeScript: Cannot access contents of url &quot;chrome-  extension://dhmkanjcmlfhafclcljgelokadenipha/hello.html&quot;. Extension   manifest must request permission to access this host.    I have tried adding &quot;chrome-extension://*/&quot; in the manifest file  but it   was not allowed either.    I think extensions should be given permission to access their local files   by default.   </pre>
