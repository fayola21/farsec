<title>Issue 30511 -   chromium -    Buildbots need hang detection or absolute timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Linux trybot queue had 19 jobs pending just now  because all the trybots   were hanging on ui_tests / browser_tests. A few of the bots have been   running for well for 3 hours.    We need to improve hang detection and/or set an absolute timeout so this   doesn't happen. </pre>
