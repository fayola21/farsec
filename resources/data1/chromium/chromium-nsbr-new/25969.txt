<title>Issue 25969 -   chromium -    Chrome on windows prints SVG different that it supposed to look - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  3.? on Windows XP      1. Using Chrome on windows  visit <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/areachart.html">http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/areachart.html</a>  2. Print the page      The printed page has the SVG chart in it  however the transparency effect is missing hence the blue area is solid instead of transparent.   When the SVG is drawn inside the browser  it looks as it should.    The print option was just released for Mac and Linux and there the printed page looks as expected so this only happens in the windows   version.   </pre>
