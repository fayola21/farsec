<title>Issue 42498 -   chromium -    Dragging tabs out of window while extension is loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Bit of an edge case :-)      1. Click on an extension that takes a bit to load (Google Voice  for   instance)  2. While it's loading  try to drag a tab out of the tabstrip.      It sticks to your mouse  sort of  and can't be dropped. The only way to fix   it is to mouse over the tab strip so it's active and press ctrl+W. With   pinned/mini tabs  this results in a weird gap in the tabstrip that sticks   around till you close the window. </pre>
