<title>Issue 35806 -   chromium -    refresh shortcut/button don't work for Aw  Snap! windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43      1. acquire a whole bunch of Aw Snap! (forcefully killed) tabs; usually this   is as simple as opening many tabs (possibly with flash) very quickly  2. you'll notice you can ctrl-R or hit the refresh button to reload the   page  3. wait 10min  4. you can no longer hit ctrl-R or hit the fresh button -- nothing happens    and you may be sent to about:blank  5. you can  however focus the URL-bar and hit enter  and everything works   fine      Pages should not go &quot;Aw Snap!&quot; -- barring that  ctrl-R and Refresh should   work all the time. </pre>
