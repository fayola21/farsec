<title>Issue 33507 -   chromium -    Logout from HTTPS authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For years  browsers have been unable to logout from pages that use HTTP  (not cookie) authentication.    Fix this!    When viewing a page that you're logged into with HTTP authenticat6ion  provide a simple Logout button that clears the credentials.    Thanks!                         </pre>
