<title>Issue 42232 -   chromium -    Large SSL Uploads Are Slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split from <a title="Large SSL Uploads Crash Chrome" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41775"> issue 41775 </a>:    &quot;However  even uploading files smaller than 512MB gets unusable depending on  the size of the file - the time it takes seems to increase exponentially.  For example  a 10MB file takes approximately 2 seconds on a 1gbps link   50MB takes 27 seconds  and 200MB takes 8 minutes. The largest file I  actually timed was 400MB  which took 29 minutes!&quot; </pre>
