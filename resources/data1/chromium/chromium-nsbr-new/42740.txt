<title>Issue 42740 -   chromium -    We should put a quota on session storage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should put a quota on session storage.  We didn't do this originally because it seemed needless    but since it is using browser memory (not renderer memory) it actually does make sense to try and   limit it.    We need to add hooks to the webkit API to connect to the page settings that already exist to control   this.  Should be pretty easy.    Lets start with 5mb. </pre>
