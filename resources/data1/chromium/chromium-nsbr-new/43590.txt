<title>Issue 43590 -   chromium -    Examination bar doenst close right - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 (Entwickler-Build 46008) Ubuntu                    1. Examine any element on any page. The bar at the bottom of the page   displays the info.  2. Open a new incongnito window. Go to the extensions manager.  3. Goto any page (best if it has a background color  so that you can see   the following).    The bar shouldnt be visible.      The bar at the bottom is not schown anymore (as you would expect) but it   still consumes ists space.      I could reproduce this anytime.   </pre>
