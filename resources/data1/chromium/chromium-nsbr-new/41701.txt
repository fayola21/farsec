<title>Issue 41701 -   chromium -    Location-icon renders poorly on dark GTK themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See the attached screen shot for what the location icon in the omnibox looks   like  when use a GTK theme such as Dark Looks.    I thought that for some inexplicable reason we are drawing a snowflake    until Evan pointed out to me that it is just a poorly anti-aliased image or   concentric circles.    He suggested I create a bug for Elliot to look at. </pre>
