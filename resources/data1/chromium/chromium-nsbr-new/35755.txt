<title>Issue 35755 -   chromium -    Store Extension List - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just wondering if a system can be implemented so that users can sync a list   of their extensions so that they can be synced to other computers...Just like   the bookmark sync that is already in place...    This would probably also require to store the source of the extension as not   all extensions are in the gallery... </pre>
