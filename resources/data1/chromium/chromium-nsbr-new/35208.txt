<title>Issue 35208 -   chromium -    Support a __MSG_ID__ token substitution in extension CSS files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An extension which injects CSS files as content scripts cannot use relative   paths to reference images stored in the extension  because the paths are   resolved to the URL that the CSS file is injected into.    The current workaround is to tell developers to use data URIs or URIs in   the form of chrome-extension://&lt;extension ID&gt;/path/to/image.png.  Data URIs   make it difficult to update images easily  and hardcoding the path will   break the extension if the key ever changes (a dev version  for example).    It would be helpful to support a token substitution for content script CSS   files which would inject the current ID of the extension.  This way    developers could reference URLs in the following way:    chrome-extension://__MSG_ID__/path/to/image.png    and the extension would not break if the extension ID changed.   </pre>
