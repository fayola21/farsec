<title>Issue 37419 -   chromium -    Dragging file from desktop to bookmark bar DCHECKs and doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - drag a file from the content area to the bookmark bar in a browser window    expected:    - bookmark created for local file url    actual:    - in debug builds  it DCHECKs that the GURL that's created is invalid. This is because line 665 of   bookmark_bar_controller.mm gets a path  not a file URL  so there's no protocol.  - continuing does nothing  no bookmark gets created.    i swear we already fixed this for the content area  or did before for creating bookmarks. This   must have regressed at some point. </pre>
