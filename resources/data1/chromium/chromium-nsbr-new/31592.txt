<title>Issue 31592 -   chromium -    Log warning when &lt;script&gt; can't be downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)    It'd be nice if a warning were logged when a javascript file can't be found.    Might save web developers a minute or two of frustration.  Would this be   appropriate for the javascript console? </pre>
