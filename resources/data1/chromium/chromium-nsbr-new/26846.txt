<title>Issue 26846 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar focus events queuing up and gets released when opened menus closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.237.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31086">r31086</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32    Precondition: Always show bookmark bar - enabled.                           Have few bookmarks on the bar                           Enable tool bar ( Page  Wrench tool menus )      1. Launch chrome  Open page menu and mouse hover over all the bookmarks on the bar   2. Close the page menu     Actual: Bookmark bar focus events on the bar are getting queued up and release at a time once   after the menu( page or wrench ) is closed.     What is the expected output?   Should not que up the focus events and release them after the menu close.  Windows or Linux doesnt que its events.    Attached a video for reference. We used some theme to show the scenario clearly. ( Nothing to do   with applying a theme ) </pre>
