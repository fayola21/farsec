<title>Issue 30282 -   chromium -    selecting 'always open files of this type' should open the current file  too - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Download file.  2. Select 'always open files of this type' option.  3. Nothing happens.      The file should open. If I want these files to always open  I certainly want   *this* one to as well.      Nothing. User is confused. </pre>
