<title>Issue 39339 -   chromium -    System level over install fails on Vista and Win-7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   -Install System level Chrome from pack.google.com ( you will get 249.78)  -Upgrade to 249.1042 thr about Chrome dialog.  -Open 249.1042 chrome window.  -Over install 342.7_full or diff install for system-level  -Exit Chrome.  -Relaunch Chrome.    Expected:  Should get 342.7 version.    Issue:  I will get 249.1042 only. I will see chrome.exe new_chrome.exe and pv  opv   values in registry.    PS:If I skip step2  then every thing looks good.  i.e over install 342.7 over 249.78 works fine  when chrome window is   opened. </pre>
