<title>Issue 45509 -   chromium -    Suggestion - Improving 'tactile' feel for viewing images - dragging mouse should scroll image - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you view an large image  e.g. a 8M-pixel jpg  the mouse affords two   actions:  click to expand from scaled-to-fit-page scaled-to-1-to-1-pixels and click to   shrink back.    Viewing the pixel-scaled image is painful - you have to manipulate both   scroll bars to get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.    My suggestion is that if you hold down the mouse in the pixel-scaled image it   should scroll in a natural tactile fashion. </pre>
