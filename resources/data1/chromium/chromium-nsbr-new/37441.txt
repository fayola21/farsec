<title>Issue 37441 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar link title display issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 dev    Bookmarks within folders in the bookmark bar now all appear centered  and the width is restricted    resulting in truncated link titles.    This is a new issue to 342.1  as the previous release did not center or truncate link titles within   folders on the bookmark bar. Previous releases displayed link titles left justified  with the width   accommodating longer (longest?) titles.  </pre>
