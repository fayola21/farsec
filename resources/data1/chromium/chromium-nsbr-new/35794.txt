<title>Issue 35794 -   chromium -    page down is not scrolling correctly  leaving too much overlap - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page):  5.0.322.2  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: ubuntu  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: kde    URL: any page with more than two screens of text    In last couple versions of chrome unstable  page down is not working   correctly (and it's driving me crazy).  It used to page down so that about   2 lines of text from the bottom of the previous page would show up at the   top of the new page.  Now  it's leaving about 10 lines of text.    The same thing happens for page down  space  clicking in the scroll bar    etc.    I think this broke some time in the last month or so.  I just tried on   other machines that have 4.0.249.4 on linux and mac and didn't see this   problem.  Firefox on the same machine is working correctly  so I didn't   think it was a window manager issue. </pre>
