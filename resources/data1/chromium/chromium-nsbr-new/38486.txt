<title>Issue 38486 -   chromium -    Chrome tab freezes in mid-air - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta (on linux)                  What steps will reproduce the problem? (dont know  heres what happened)  1. I had chrome open on my linux box with several tabs  2. Opened a new tab started loading google mail  3. As it was loading  tried dragging the tab to another position      The tab would drag and drop      The tab floated as a standalone and did not respond to further dragging or   any other click (just froze). Clicks in that tab did not pass through to   the window (e.g. another chrome) behind.        Tried killing it using kill  the content of the floating tab disappeared    but the tab outline was still there and it was still was a mouse event   black hole.   </pre>
