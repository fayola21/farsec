<title>Issue 38008 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager does not work in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start with --enable-tabbed-bookmark-manager  2. Open an incognito window  3. Open the bookmark manager    What is the expected output?    The bookmark manager should work      What do you see instead?    I get a bunch of exceptions due to extension not being enabled?    Error during bookmarks.getTree: Access to extension API denied.      What do I need to do to enable the extension in incognito mode. Note that this is a   COMPONENT extension so it is not exposed in chrome://extensions/ and we should allow   all COMPONENT extensions in incognito mode. </pre>
