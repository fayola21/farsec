<title>Issue 26381 -   chromium -    Feature request: drag star from omnibox bar to desktop to create a .webloc file. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request for chrome:    I'd like to be able to drag the star icon in the address bar (or perhaps the   address itself) to the desktop and have it drop a webloc file. Safari does this   and it's a very convenient way to save something to come back to later. </pre>
