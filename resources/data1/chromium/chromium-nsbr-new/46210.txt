<title>Issue 46210 -   chromium -    Extensions and bookmark sync promotion can't be cleared - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome OS	0.7.46.3 (Official Build 7d0aafb0) beta  Google Chrome	6.0.418.2 (Official Build 48851)      1. Setup brand new ChromeOS Dogfood box  2. New tabs contain a promotion announcing that Chrome now has Extensions and Bookmark Sync.  3. Click the X on the extension        That the promotion disappears.        The X changes colors when clicked  but nothing else.    Eventually the promotion did disappear after multiple new tabs were opened.   </pre>
