<title>Issue 26229 -   chromium -    Make it easier for extensions to detect when they've been updated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you want to push out an update to an extension and provide some kind   of release notes information that would only concern people who've been   running a previous version (maybe you made some drastic change in the UI   you want to explain)  it's a little tricky if you didn't have the foresight   to be writing some data into localStorage from the beginning. The best you   can do is a 2-stage rollout where you first rollout a version with no   changes but writes into localStorage  then wait a few days for most people   to be updated  then rollout the version with the real changes and use the   data in localStorage to detect update vs. new installs.     It would be cool to either fire some event  or provide some kind of API   like chrome.extension.previousInstalledVersion() or something to make life   easier for extension developers.      </pre>
