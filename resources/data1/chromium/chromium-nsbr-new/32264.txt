<title>Issue 32264 -   chromium -    [RU] Too long translation for the download ETA truncates the ETA info - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Russian      4.0.266.0 (build 33992)      WinXP SP3      When downloading  the remaining time in the download shelf entry is   truncated by an ellipsis to:  &quot;__��_��_��_��__��__��___��_��_��_��_...&quot; (&quot;Remaining...&quot;) (for 2-digit seconds  minutes  etc.)  or something akin to  &quot;__��_��_��_��__��__��___��_��_��_��_ 2...&quot; (&quot;Remaining 2...&quot;)  which looks plain stupid.    I believe we can either use a shorter translation (like &quot;_��_��___��_ 2 ___��___.&quot; (&quot;2   minutes more&quot;)) or  though undesirable  even sacrifice the order of the   word and time units (like &quot;2 ___��___. __��_��_��_��__��__��___��_��_��_��_&quot;) which should make the time   units completely visible.   </pre>
