<title>Issue 45425 -   chromium -    Please confirm when closing all tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     Quite often  I close all my tabs on accident by clicking the X in the upper   right hand corner  when I really intended to close only the current tab.    Is it possible for Chrome to get confirmation before closing all tabs  a   feature already available in Firefox ?    Thanks     Sukumar  </pre>
