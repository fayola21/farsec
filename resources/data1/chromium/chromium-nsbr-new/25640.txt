<title>Issue 25640 -   chromium -    Context menu of an item on the bookmarks bar should include &quot;Copy&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4.0.223.8    Right-click a bookmark on the bookmark bar. On OS X  there's a &quot;Copy&quot; item.   On windows and linux  there isn't. Which way should it be?    <a title="Feature: Copy Link Address for Bookmarks in UI" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5354"> Issue 5354 </a> is a request to add this on windows  and there was a mail on   chromium-discuss asking for it  so there seems to be some demand. </pre>
