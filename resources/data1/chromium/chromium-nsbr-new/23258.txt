<title>Issue 23258 -   chromium -    Cannot get memory details for SUID sandboxed processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The when using the SUID sandbox  the Zygote process sets itself as non-  dumpable. This is inherited by child processes and prevents a bad renderer   from ptrace attaching to its peers. However  it also stops the browser   process from getting the smaps data that we need in order to fill out   about:memory.    This isn't a problem with the seccomp sandbox. </pre>
