<title>Issue 27037 -   chromium -    Prune archived history more aggressively - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="Ebay auto-refresh keeps growing URL" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24946"> issue 24946 </a> and <a title="History should cap limit of URLs stored"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24947">issue 24947</a>  a long URL that gets auto-added to history   makes our history DB size explode.  In addition to capping the history at a   max size in <a title="History should cap limit of URLs stored"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24947">issue 24947</a>  we should be more aggressive about pruning when   archiving the history results  so that our archived DBs are small and   concentrated on valuable stuff.  I kinda thought this would have been an   AUTO_SUBFRAME transition that we'd trim anyway  dunno what's up here. </pre>
