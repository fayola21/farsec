<title>Issue 28208 -   chromium -    VideoRendererBase clients should use composition over inheritance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  the typical usage of VideoRendererBase is the following:   - Extend VideoRendererBase   - Realize OnFrameAvailable() needs to notify your window manager  so you   inject the window manager into your subclass via a silly filter factory   (refer to <a title="Replace filter factories with passing in constructed filters to the pipeline"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28207">bug 28207</a>)   - Realize the window manager needs to get the frame from your subclass  so   you add a method on your injected window manager for the subclass to   register itself as the video renderer   - FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!    We end up with these quasi-circular-dependencies between a relatively   useless VideoRendererBase subclass and the parent application/window   manager.  We should be able to just create a VideoRendererBase  inject some   callbacks and call it a day  since most of our VideoRendererBase subclasses   today are over-glorified callback-executors-and-thread-proxiers. </pre>
