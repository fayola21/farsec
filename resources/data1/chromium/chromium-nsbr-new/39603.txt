<title>Issue 39603 -   chromium -    Allow deleting downloaded files (from the filesystem) using the download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.8 beta    The download bar is a great feature  but its missing some really obvious and easily   implementable functionality:    1. Right clicking an item in the download bar should bring up the same context menu that   appears when you click the tiny arrow button on the right.    2. There needs to be a way to remove items from the downloads bar.    3. There also needs to be a way to delete downloaded that appear on the bar.         </pre>
