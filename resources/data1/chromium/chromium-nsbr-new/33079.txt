<title>Issue 33079 -   chromium -    Add bookmark defaults to expanded bookmark folder tree - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3 dev                    1.Add bookmark  2.Click Edit... to choose custom folder  3.Very difficult to find the folder you're looking for because all are   expanded    One of chrome's worst bugs is that folder tree is expanded instead of   contracted by default when adding a new bookmark. When I want to choose   where my bookmark goes it's incredibly difficult to find the right folder   because chrome inverts the hierarchy.    Can you imagine if windows explorer folder tree defaulted to expand all?   Quite ridiculous I'm sure you'll agree. So why does chrome expand all   bookmark folder when adding a bookmark? Quite retarded  and in urgent need   of review </pre>
