<title>Issue 32316 -   chromium -    regression: doesn't fallback to direct if gets an error while processing proxy script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When one visits a page via HTTP  say <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>  using test_shell.exe  the following is   displayed (see attached screenshot):    Error -336 when loading url <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>    Pages using the file protocol (file:///) work as expected.  I should note that to reproduce this  it   appears that the following page needs to 404 for the tester:    http://wpad/wpad.dat    Because of this caveat  I suspect the problem is proxy-related.  Before I speculate as to what the   cause of this problem is  I would like to clarify that chrome.exe works as expected.  test_shell.exe   seems to be the only thing that exhibits the error.    I haven't narrowed it down definitively  but my guess is that this was introduced in trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35549">revision   35549</a>:    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/http_network_transaction.cc?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/http_network_transaction.cc?</a>  view=diff&amp;<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1">r1</a>=35548&amp;<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2">r2</a>=35549    It appears that because proxy_info_.is_empty() returns true in   HttpNetworkTransaction::DoResolveProxyComplete()  the method returns before the   proxy_info_.UseDirect() that follows gets hit.    That is my superficial analysis of the error.  I apologize if I'm unduly blaming the aforementioned   change. </pre>
