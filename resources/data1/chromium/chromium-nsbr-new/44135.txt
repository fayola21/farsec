<title>Issue 44135 -   chromium -    Chrome sync can cause data loss due to &quot;server wins&quot; merge logic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. A user of chrome has a home machine and a work machine.  2. The user has a bunch of bookmarks on his work machine  and a list of  websites that he wants to see on browser start-up on his home machine. (The  &quot;start-up websites&quot; setting on the work machine is the browser default  setting of &quot;open the home page&quot;)  3. The user hears of how Chrome can sync your bookmarks  preferences  etc.  and enables sync on the work machine with the intention of bringing all  bookmarks on the work machine to the home machine. (Currently  an empty  value of &quot;session.urls_to_restore_on_startup&quot; is written to cosmo   because  the user didn't know to uncheck the &quot;Preferences&quot; checkbox while enabling sync)  4. User goes home and enables sync.    What do you see?    The entire list of start-up websites on the user's home machine is simply  blown away by sync. There is no warning or confirmation before we delete  this data.     What is the expected output?    I'm not sure what the right answer is here. We need to have more  sophisticated merge logic than the current &quot;server wins&quot; logic.   - In cases where we are deleting client side data with blank (or default)  server side data  maybe we could warn the user? (Potentially ugly UI).   - Or perhaps  in the case of non-conflicting data like this  it could  simply be merged and the superset of client side and server side data could  be written to both  client and server? (Potentially buggy).   - Or alternatively  we could have include sort of warning text in the  existing sync UI that warns you of data loss? (This could potentially scare  away users).    Additional information:  This is just one example scenario of data loss due to sync. The way sync is  built today  there are many different ways in which local data (be they  bookmarks  or preferences  or autofill data) can be replaced by server data  (that could very well contain just simple defaults)   </pre>
