<title>Issue 37331 -   chromium -    sync_timestamp needs to be per-datatype - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Directory currently persists one timestamp to represent the &quot;synced to&quot;   revision.  This is also set in the StatusController.  We now only request   specific types in GetUpdates requests  and so to implement <a title="Syncing new data type requires GetUpdates from TS#0" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33065"> issue 33065 </a>   (doing update from timestamp 0 for new data types)  we should make this   value be per-data type.    ProcessUpdatesCommand sets this value in the Directory as well as the   StatusController (which is already set up to accept a value per-data type).    I think all the required info is available at that point  so it can continue   to be the place this value is set  just needs to set several values.    It would also be nice-to-have this information on about:sync  so we know the   state of each individual type. </pre>
