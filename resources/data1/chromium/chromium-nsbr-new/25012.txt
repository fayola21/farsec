<title>Issue 25012 -   chromium -    cannot load any url without doing a search first! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. start typing gmail.com in the address bar  2. once 'g' is type  Chrome rewrites it to &quot;search google.com&quot;  then the   rest of typing (mail.com) becomes the key word for google search  3. hit enter and the google search starts.        Navigate gmail.com        Search &quot;mail.com&quot; on Google.    It is REALLY annoying!!! I cannot navigate to many websites!     I also tried to launch &quot;facebook.com&quot;  once 'f' is typed  the address bar   becomes &quot;search on facebook.com&quot;. I must do a facebook search before I can   open its website!    I checked the options but I cannot find any way to stop this behavior!    <b>Please provide
