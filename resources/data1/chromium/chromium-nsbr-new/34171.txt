<title>Issue 34171 -   chromium -    [Windows Japanese]Default font size of location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Setup your desktop's theme as &quot;Windows XP&quot;  2.Startup Google Chrome          Location bar's font should not use MS UI Gothic 11 by default.      Location bar usess font settings of &quot;Message Box&quot;.  But font size is not same as &quot;Message Box&quot; settings (approx   2 rank  larger  I don't knw why larger font is selected.).    At Japanese Editon of Windows XP  default font settings of &quot;Message Box&quot; at  &quot;default Theme(Windows XP)&quot; is MS UI Gothic 9.    As a result  default font of location bar is MS UI Gothic 11.  Unfortunatelly  MS UI Gothic 11 is not good font for location bar   because it sometime makes 0px letter spacing(for example: &quot;po&quot; &quot;bo&quot; &quot;qo&quot;).    I think  MS UI Gothic 10 or MS UI Gothic 9 is better than MS UI Gothic 11.    <b>Please provide
