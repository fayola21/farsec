<title>Issue 37730 -   chromium -    PyAuto: Point to chromium dirs at the correct place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Problem:  The automation proxy interface kinda assumes that the running binary would   reside in the same directory as the browser binaries -- ie in Debug/Release   dirs. While this works for all C++ binaries like ui_tests  startup_tests    this fails for pyauto tests since the running binary in this case is   /usr/bin/python (or some such system path). Obviously you can't find Chromium binaries at this location.    A workaround/hack is the copy the python binary to the same dir as the chromium binaries.    PyAuto should be able to load Chromium binaries from the right location. </pre>
