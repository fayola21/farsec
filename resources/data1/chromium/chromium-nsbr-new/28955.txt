<title>Issue 28955 -   chromium -    Options UI not laid out properly (when screen font not Tahoma) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)  Windows Version      : 5.1.2600.5512 (xpsp.080413-2105)  Windows Language     : _��_��__��_��_��_��__ (Japanese)      1. (In an environment where &quot;MS UI Gothic&quot; is the screen font)  2. Open Options -&gt; Under the hood -&gt; ... -&gt; Languages      Opens a properly laid out dialog.      The language selection combo box is only half visible. (Screenshot attached)    * The UI layout is correct if I choose to use Japanese as Chrome's GUI   language.  If I stick with English  certain dialogs are too short or are   shown with overlapping components.    * &quot;MS UI Gothic&quot; is the default screen font for the Japanese version of   Windows XP.    * Specifying '--lang=en' (--lang=en-US ?) at command line has no effect on   the problem.    * Chrome is (was) configured with an English GUI on initial installation.   </pre>
