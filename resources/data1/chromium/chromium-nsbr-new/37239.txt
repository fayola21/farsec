<title>Issue 37239 -   chromium -    dromaeo should output test results as they are completed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should get the dromaeo test to output test results as they're completed.    Currently  the test takes 470s to complete  which is close to the 600s   timeout that Buildbot has to kill hanging tests.    If dromaeo output test results as they were completed  we'd be less likely to   hit the 600s timeout.  And a hang somewhere in the test would be easier to   detect from the stdio output the Buildbot captures.    antom  wdyt? </pre>
