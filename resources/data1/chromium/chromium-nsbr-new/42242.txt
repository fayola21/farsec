<title>Issue 42242 -   chromium -    Chrome thinks mail.google.com:443 is TLS intolerant - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure if this is only Linux  but I get lots of these error messages on ToT Linux chromium build (5.0.383.0 (Developer Build 0)):    [3576:3584:684270022249:ERROR:net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc(1304)] handshake failed; NSS error code -5938  net_error -107  [3576:3584:684270022644:WARNING:net/http/http_network_transaction.cc(841)] Falling back to SSLv3 because host is TLS intolerant: mail.google.com:443  [3576:3584:684270022968:ERROR:net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc(1304)] handshake failed; NSS error code -5938  net_error -107  [3576:3584:684270023944:WARNING:net/http/http_network_transaction.cc(841)] Falling back to SSLv3 because host is TLS intolerant: mail.google.com:443  [3576:3584:684270024120:ERROR:net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc(1304)] handshake failed; NSS error code -5938  net_error -107  [3576:3584:684270083741:WARNING:net/http/http_network_transaction.cc(841)] Falling back to SSLv3 because host is TLS intolerant: mail.google.com:443  [3576:3584:684270090795:WARNING:net/http/http_network_transaction.cc(841)] Falling back to SSLv3 because host is TLS intolerant: mail.google.com:443    I suspect this change:  SSL fixes for sites with buggy DEFLATE support.    1) Keep a global set of known buggy hosts in memory.       Previously we would fallback to SSLv3 with each connection. While I     quite like the idea of making these buggy sites slow  it doesn't     really help users and it feels silly.    2) Catch SSL decompression alerts while reading the initial data from the     server and fallback so SSLv3.       Since we added False Start  servers which believe that they support     DEFLATE compression but fail at it are not detected as a handshake     error. Rather they cause an error when reading the first byte of     application level data.
