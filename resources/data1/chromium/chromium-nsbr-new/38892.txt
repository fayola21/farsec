<title>Issue 38892 -   chromium -    In the Tabstrip there are two active Tabs to see  while dragging a Tab from another Window into it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (42215)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): ---  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OKAY      1. Open two Windows with some more Tabs  2. Drag a Tab from one Tabstrip to the another Tabstrip        The Tabstrip should show only the dragging Tab as &quot;active&quot;      In the Tabstrip there are two active tabs. (see screenshot)    In older versions of Chromium it was okay. Also the Windows-Version works correctly!    Thanks and regards  Mehmet </pre>
