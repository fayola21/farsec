<title>Issue 28324 -   chromium -    System Crash after using killall to kill chrome; 'Unclean Shutdown'  forces fsck - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)  WebKit	532.2  V8	1.3.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.2   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.222.5 Safari/532.2      1.Open Chrome in linux (ubuntu 9.04/crunchbang 9.04)  2.Chrome  at some point  will hang.  3.Kill chrome using &quot;user@box$ killall chrome&quot;    Should kill chrome and not affect stability.    Linux crashes instead  all applications do not launch  open applications   crash. Restart claims 'unclean shutdown'  and demands a manual fsck.   Machine returns to normal operation after fsck  Chrome seems not to be   affected. I've duplicated this phenomenon twice now.    This doesn't seem to occur on any particular pages  it hangs randomly  and   sometimes the kill tab dialog does not come up. </pre>
