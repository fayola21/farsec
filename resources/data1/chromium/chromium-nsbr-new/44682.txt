<title>Issue 44682 -   chromium -    London times crossword - grey grid print problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (45376)    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/genreg/showBarrier.do?">https://www.timesonline.co.uk/genreg/showBarrier.do?</a>  ERIGHTS_TARGET=<a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertai">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertai</a>  nment/games_and_puzzles/crossword/club/            Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK            1.After logging in  and selecting the Times Cryptic PRINT button  the   crossword is displayed with a black grid  and PRINT BLACK GRID and PRINT   GREY GRID buttons.        When the PRINT GREY GRID button is pressed  the grid swaps to grey while   the print screen appears allowing you to set your print preferences then   PRINT.        The grid remains  and prints in black before changing to grey.        The work-around is to hit cancel on the print screen  let the grid change   to grey  then hit the PRINT GREY GRID button again.    Note that with FF/IE the grid changes from black to grey while the print   screen is displayed  and if the print button is hit quickly  you can get a   part grey/part black grid.    This case is obviously trivial  but there must be an event handling or   task scheduling glitch in your code so that you get processes running   sequentially which should be run in parallel:    initiate print  wait for print  initiate grey    should be:     initiate print  initiate grey  wait for print         </pre>
