<title>Issue 42758 -   chromium -    Make mixed-content indicators correct - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For https with mixed content we show the https in the omnibox in gray.   Visually this makes me think I shouldn't care (gray is usually used to de-  emphasize something). When I showed it to Glen he wasn't thrilled about it   either and though we should be using red in this situation. </pre>
