<title>Issue 35821 -   chromium -    Bookmarks don't allow %s in some places - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was very pleased to see that Chromium imported all my Firefox bookmarks...   well  almost all of them.    One of the ones I use the most looks like this:    Address: http://%s.google.com/  Keyword: gs    So that I can put  e.g.  &quot;gs translate&quot; in the location bar to get   translate.google.com. It seems that Chromium doesn't allow this bookmark    but I see no obvious reason that it shouldn't allow it. </pre>
