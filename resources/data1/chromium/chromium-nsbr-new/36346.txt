<title>Issue 36346 -   chromium -    Issue while watching the Source Code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello     when I would visit the Source code from a Webpage  Chrome not show to me  the code from the actual Webpage  who I had open.    Example:    My php Script:  &lt;?php  if(isset($_POST['test'])){    echo '1';  }else{    echo '2';  }  ?&gt;    So chrome shows to me always in the Source-Code view the &quot;2&quot;  not the 1  after I had send a form with the Form_var 'test'.      Regards  Matthias Radm��__ller </pre>
