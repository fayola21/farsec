<title>Issue 30850 -   chromium -    chromium freeze when trying to send a not readable file in a form (eg: attachment to a bugzilla-like site like this one) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.274.0~svn20091217r34829 (ubuntu ppa build)  OS + version : Mandriva Linux 10.0  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): i686 (32bit)  window manager : GNOME        It silently fails to read the file and just send an empty file.    Bugzilla then display a page stating that &quot;The file you are trying to    attach is empty  does not exist  or you don't have permission    to read it&quot;  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): unknown      1.Open a bug report on any bugzilla (eg: <a href="http://qa.mandriva.com">http://qa.mandriva.com</a>)  2.Try to attach a file we have no read permissions on it    (such as one owned by another user with permissions set as 0600)  3. Try to submit the file      Chromium should check it can read the file to attach.  If yes  it should try to send it to the bugzilla.  If no it should either warn the file is not readable (best behavior) or   send an empty file like firefox does (reasonnable fallback behavior).      Chromium tabs just appear to freeze. From times to times  chromium warn   that this or that tab looks freezed and offer to either close it or wait   for it </pre>
