<title>Issue 28687 -   chromium -    Can't drag selection from page (toward tabstrip  or anything else) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  if I select some text in the page  I can then drag the selection to   the tabstrip.    On Mac  I can't drag a selection at all.  Hovering the selection doesn't change   the cursor from the I-beam  and trying to drag just makes a new selection. </pre>
