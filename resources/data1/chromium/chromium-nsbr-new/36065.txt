<title>Issue 36065 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Pop-ups] Sound/voice/music of pop-up page is still being played even pop-up page is blocked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to some web page which has a pop-up page that plays sound/voice/music      This pop-up page is blocked by default  but the sound/voice/music of it is  still being played  very annoying and no way to stop them.    In previous builds with old pop-up blocking feature  a block bar is  displayed on right-bottom corner of browser  in this case we can stop the  sound/voice/music by closing the block bar  but now when with blocked  notification icon in omnibox  no way to stop them.    Issue is detected in Beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069)  it  also happens in latest trunk 5.0.331.0 (Developer Build 39220)       </pre>
