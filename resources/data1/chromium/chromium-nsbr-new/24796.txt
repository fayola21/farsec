<title>Issue 24796 -   chromium -    Submitting a GET form to about:* URL always redirects to about:blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an user submits a GET form to any about: URL  the browser always   redirects to about:blank page  not the page specified in &quot;action&quot; field of   the form element.    The attached HTML file demonstrates this issue.    This issue is probably caused by FilterURL function in render_view_host.cc. </pre>
