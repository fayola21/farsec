<title>Issue 43349 -   chromium -    Provide the OS file context menu in the Download Tray - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Google Chrome	5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) beta      1. Download a file.  2. Right-click the file in the download tray.      It would be nice if the context menu from the OS would display.  For example    on Windows  you would have immediate access to copy the file  &quot;open with&quot;    etc. without having to open the Explorer window. </pre>
