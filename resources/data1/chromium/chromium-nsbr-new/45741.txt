<title>Issue 45741 -   chromium -    Onclick callbacks for context menu API stopped working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This broke recently - I'm not sure yet  but I'm suspecting it's due to our   recent changes to cache the builtin JSON so that our code can't get clobbered   by extension code replacing it:    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=48667">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=48667</a>    Whatever the reason  I need to try and add in some kind of unit or browser   test for this since the existing context menu API tests don't cover the   callbacks being called. </pre>
