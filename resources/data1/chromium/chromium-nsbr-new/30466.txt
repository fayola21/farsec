<title>Issue 30466 -   chromium -    POST requests without content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may really not be a Chromium bug (I've experienced it on version  4.0.249.30 of Chrome Mac version).    I discovered this &quot;alleged&quot; bug actually by discovering a bug in our web  application. We were just doing wrong POST requests from JavaScript  which  had the request parameters in the request header instead of the request  body (I attach a file with dump of the request).    The thing is I found that the request made by Chrome had the Content-Length  header set to 9  which I think should be set to 0. I tested it on other  browsers and they set this value to 0.    I didn't take a dump from the Windows version but it also didn't work  so I  suppose this behaviour is also present in that version. </pre>
