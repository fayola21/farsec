<title>Issue 30027 -   chromium -    Feature req: show screenshot in dialog &quot;Report Bug or Broken Website&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2 to 4.0.x    Feature request: Show the screenshot that is about to be sent. Also I'd like   to copy this to clipboard or save to disk  for my own reference.    (Bonus idea: Since you already have the screenshot function  how about adding   it as a format in the regular &quot;Save as&quot; dialog? Or make it scriptable?) </pre>
