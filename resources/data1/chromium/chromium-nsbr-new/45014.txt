<title>Issue 45014 -   chromium -    [CF] It should prompt user when enterprise install finishes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run CF enterprise installer for example  EXPERIMENTAL_GoogleChromeFrameStandaloneEnterprise.msi      After install finishes  there is no UI to prompt user that the install has  finished  it should prompt user with an UI dialog/box with message like &quot;CF  is installed successfully  &quot; or &quot;Thank you for installing CF...&quot;  just like  what omaha installer does.    Likewise  if install fails  it should prompt user that install fails  because of certain reason.       </pre>
