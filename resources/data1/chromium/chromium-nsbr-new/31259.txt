<title>Issue 31259 -   chromium -    ChromeOS webapp selection page appears unresponsive after an icon is highlighted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repro Steps:    1. Select the webapp tab in Chrome OS (0.5.24.0)  2. Highlight any icon on the page with the mouse (select on mouse drag).    The page does not seem to respond to any other mouse or keyboard event. No   app can be launched from there anymore. The rest of OS (other tabs) seem to   be still responsive.   </pre>
