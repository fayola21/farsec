<title>Issue 39686 -   chromium -    Geolocation: queue info bar requests per-page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If multiple origins (e.g. frames) request geolocation acess concurrently on a   single tab  the infobar request prompts should be serialized rather than   appear stacked.    Also consider what artificial delay is required from dismissing one prompt to   revealing the next  if any  to avoid the animations clashing or the user not   realizing it's a new question.     </pre>
