<title>Issue 37873 -   chromium -    Ctrl-T From an Application Shortcut Opens Old Pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 (Official Build 40685) dev but also older versions    I have an application shortcut for gmail which is always running. When I press Ctrl-T in that window  it   opens a new tab in the main chrome window. If I close the main chrome window and only have the   application shortcut window open  pressing Ctrl-T will open a new main window and open a new tab. So far   so good.    Here's the problem  on one of my user profiles  pressing Ctrl-T on in the application shortcut window   when there is no main window will open up a new main window but instead of just creating a single tab   for a new tab as I would expect  it opens up all the tabs that were opened when I closed the main window   the last time.     This only happens for one of my profiles.     </pre>
