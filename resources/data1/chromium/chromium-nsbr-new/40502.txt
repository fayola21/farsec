<title>Issue 40502 -   chromium -    Chrome Developer Tools ��_��_��_ Gzip Size Reporting Incorrect on Resources Tab ��_��_��_ Dynamic Content Only - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.366.2 (Official Build 43280)   dev  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.2.0.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.366.2 Safari/533.4  Command Line	&quot;C:Documents and SettingsMyuserLocal   SettingsApplication DataGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; --enable-  extension-timeline-api    URLs (if applicable) : www.nytimes.com  www.webmd.com  www.amazon.com    others.    When on the resources tab on Developer Tools Google chrome incorrectly   reports page size for certain dynamic / compressed pages.  This is because   dynamically generated pages are usually &quot;chunked&quot; for fast delivery.  You   do not want a 1 GB page to build before sending data for memory reasons.    However  very frequently dynamic pages are gzipped  but as this happens on   the fly the &quot;content-length&quot; is not known up front.    All of the pages that have this problem all have a response header of   &quot;Content-encoding:&quot; as a compressed format such as gzip.  The &quot;Transfer-  encoding:&quot; response header as I have seen it is almost always set to   &quot;chunked&quot;.  And the page is missing a &quot;Content-Length:&quot; because that is not   known when the page starts sending data.    The issue is that Chrome��_��_��_s Developer Tools reports the size of gzipped   pages  but not if they are &quot;chunked&quot; most likely meaning they were   dynamically generated.  Chrome seems to have recently added real page size   versus &quot;transferred&quot; which is a great thing.  But missed accurately   reporting dynamic pages download times as well.    Want to see the difference?  www.Google.com shows the main HTML of the site   is cached.  Check the blue document for the page.  It looks normal.    Many other sites  such as the www.NYTimes.com or www.WebMD.com and many   others have chunked content  so Chrome is incorrectly reporting the load   time of the page.  Check the blue document on this page as an example when   looking at the resources tab.    If you look at NYTimes.com the homepage shows as 115.9 KB under the Size   tab.  However  it is a gzipped page and only downloads 29.7 KB.  This is a   big reporting inaccuracy from this tool.    Google Chrome should know the correct size once it has downloaded the page   and should be able to update this in the resources.  Even if not  I would   suggest estimating the compressed size would be better than inaccurately   reporting this page as 115 KB  as it clearly is not from a download   perspective.  Estimated page size for HTML of 75% is industry standard  and   far more inaccurate than saying &quot;we don��_��_��_t know  so we��_��_��_re going to assume   the full page size even though we know the Content-Encoding is that of   gzip.&quot;  Without looking at the internals of Chromium I assume &quot;Content-  length&quot; is what is used for the determination in the Resources tab.    Screenshot is from Amazon.  We only see the full page size  but when   clicked on and analyzed at a network level - it is transferred with gzip   compression and much smaller than 209 KB. </pre>
