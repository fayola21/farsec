<title>Issue 25472 -   chromium -    Investigate optimal values for HostCache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the HostCache (dns cache) is using default values (which were modeled after firefox):      - maximum of 100 entries    - time to live of 1 minute    These are very conservative numbers; we should get some data on what the hit ratio would be with   higher values  and bump it up if it will give a performance gain. </pre>
