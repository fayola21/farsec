<title>Issue 25080 -   chromium -    Trybots/local build not as strict as buildbot build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/279004">http://codereview.chromium.org/279004</a> passed trybots and local build  but   still failed buildbot build.    Errors that broke buildbot build but not trybot build:    - &quot;Variable may be used uninitialized&quot; warning. (OS X)  - Link-time errors when a file includes foo.h and not foo-inl.h  where foo.h   contains template class declarations and foo-inl.h contains the   corresponding definitions. (OS X)   </pre>
