<title>Issue 24669 -   chromium -    browser action button doesn't show when icon fails to load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. load gmail browser action extension      there should be a blank button in the toolbar. Instead there is nothing.    I realize that this behavior is intentional as per [1]  but Aaron says it   should show a blank button rather than no button.    [1]    // Load the images this view needs asynchronously on the file thread.   We'll    // get a call back into OnImageLoaded if the image loads successfully. If   not     // the ImageView will have no image and will not appear in the browser   chrome.   </pre>
