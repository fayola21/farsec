<title>Issue 44152 -   chromium -    Mouse Hover Over - Scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load a page which has a mouse hover over object  2. Hover mouse over object to make it change  3. Without moving the mouse  scroll down the page using the keyboard        The mouse is no longer on the object and the hover effect should be   removed.        The mouse stayed as a hand even though it was not over the object.  The   hover effect stays on the object until the mouse is moved...  I have   included a sample website but this works with links  where the underline is   removed/added when the user hovers over the link.  FireFox seems to be the   only browser which correctly handles this.    <b>Please provide
