<title>Issue 29519 -   chromium -    Buidbot failures due to browser processes not being cleaned up after tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Part of the problem is that GMock tests launch IE as a COM server and that process   can loiter around even after the test finishes. This problem could potentially happen   with any other tests that launch a web browser. We have code at the end of each test   to kill all the browser processes but it may not get a chance to execute. Moreover   these issues will (and do) manifest in other kinds of tests: reliability tests  perf   tests and borg tests. I can think of a couple of things to do here:    1. Run tests in a job and setup the job to kill all the child processes on exit. For   COM launches we will have to pre-launch IE with &quot;-embedding&quot;.  2. Initial build step should kill all other browsers running.     These are not mutually exclusive so we could do them both.    </pre>
