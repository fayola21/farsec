<title>Issue 40559 -   chromium -    Feature request: Changes on the way how enable plugins on site works - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps:  1- Hi  I disabled plugins on sites on Chrome options.  2- I go to a site that wants to use a plugin    What is expected:  1- I would like to be informed which plugins the site is requesting.  2- I would like to be able to allow plugin on the site only this time.  3- If the site request more than one plugin I would like to be able to load only one or all plugins site request.  4- If I choose to allow plugin on the site I think the site should automatically realod. (But only plugins content   should realod and not the entire site) </pre>
