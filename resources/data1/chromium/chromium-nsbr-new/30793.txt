<title>Issue 30793 -   chromium -    you should be able to call chrome.bookmarks.removeTree on the read-only items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  if you want to remove all bookmarks  you have to get the children of   the root item (bookmarks bar and other bookmarks) and then get the children   of each of those and call removeTree on each of them (this could be a lot of   async round-trips).  If you try to call removeTree on these read-only nodes   today  you get an error.  Instead  it should just skip over the read-only   items and remove all of their children.   </pre>
