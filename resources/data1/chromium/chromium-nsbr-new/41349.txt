<title>Issue 41349 -   chromium -    Translate operation doesn't appear to time out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repro on trunk/Mac @<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44356">r44356</a>      1. Navigate to www.google.fr and wait for translate infobar to appear.  2. Unplug network cable.  3. Click &quot;translate&quot;  4. Go get coffee  watch a movie  etc...      After some arbitrary timeout the translate infobar should change to the error mode and give an   option to retry.    Instead we just appear to be stuck in the &quot;before translate&quot; mode. </pre>
