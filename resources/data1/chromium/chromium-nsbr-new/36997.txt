Install flas-nonfree  2. Modify google-chrome script to include the line &quot;export   GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1&quot;  3. Start Chrome and navigate to Youtube. Try to view any video  and try to   control the vide with the play/pause button. Some buttons in Flash's config   dialog also do not work.      The button click should trigger its intended action.      Nothing happens. If the button is a 3D button  it stays depressed  and when   you move the mouse out of the button area  the button reverts to its raised   state  when you omve the pointer back in the button area  it becomes   depressed again.    <b>Please provide
