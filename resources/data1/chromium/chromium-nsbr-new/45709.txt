<title>Issue 45709 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't load profile or extensions except if run through sudo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Start Chrome normally.      Chrome should load my settings/preferences/extensions as usual.      When I start Chrome normally it gives an error saying that my preferences   could not be loaded. So it starts but with no extensions installed  no   personal settings applied save for my saved passwords.  I fixed the problem temporarily by backing up then deleting then restoring   my .config/google-chrome/Defaults directory. After I did this  Chrome   started as usual. I closed it  reopened it and it worked fine  but when I   tried for the third time I still received the same error. This time however   my bookmarks were accessible  my extensions visible but not functioning.    The only way that Chrome starts with everything working is if I run it   through the terminal with sudo (sudo google-chrome)     <b>Please provide
