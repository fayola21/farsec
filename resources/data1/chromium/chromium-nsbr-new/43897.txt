<title>Issue 43897 -   chromium -    Page Load Blank  --no-sandbox works  but... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376)  System: XP Pro.    Issue:    Currently pages don't load... about:blank  thumbnails... nothing.    When I do enter --no-sandbox  it works.    I pretty much was running off the recommendations of Nicolas Sylvain in  <a title="No page loading in chrome 3 regression. Works with --no-sandbox" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22699"> issue #22699 </a>  (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22699#c19">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22699#c19</a>). But alas   the conclusion that he came to and my issue were two different ones (as  I've scanned with Avast!/MB/Prevx/and my companies own norton  policy...figured  why not?). No sign of Userinit32.exe or any other  trojans  code injectors  whatnot... So  if it's NOT the same root cause   what may it be...    This as only a chrome issue and unreplicatable on other computers.     </pre>
