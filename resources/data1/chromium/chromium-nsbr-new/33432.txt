<title>Issue 33432 -   chromium -    Gmail-Inbox has become insecure in Chrome 4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78                       IE 8: OK              Firefox 3: unclear        First  make sure that &quot;always use https&quot; setting is turned on in your Gmail account.    1. Go to Gmail login page.  See lock icon to right of URL.  2. Login to Gmail.  3. Inbox opens.  Notice that lock to right of URL is replaced with exclamation point warning   icon.  It says &quot;this page contains some insecure content.&quot;  4. When I click on the icon  there is no way to fix or troubleshoot the issue  although &quot;basic   constraints&quot; may be causing the problem  judging by the warning icon it also displays.    I want to see that the site is secure again.  Now it tells me that it is always insecure  from   the highest level (the Inbox). Once I log in  insecure.  This is a constant state.    <a title="Secure connection to gmail fails and no explanation why"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14082">Issue 14082</a> is similar  but not as bad because it happens within an email  and only if images   are attached.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14082">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14082</a>        Additional info:    I was using Chrome 1.0  and viewing my gmail account earlier today.  The lock was there    indicating it was secure.  Nothing else changed except that I upgraded to the latest version   of Chrome.    Also  the security lock displays fine in IE8 when viewing gmail.  In Firefox it is hard to   tell  since there is no lock.   </pre>
