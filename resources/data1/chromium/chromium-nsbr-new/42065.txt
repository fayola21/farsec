<title>Issue 42065 -   chromium -    copying url with ctrl+insert does not include the http:// part - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter www.google.dk in the omnibox  2. Click with the mouse in the omnibox so the url text is marked  3. on the keyboard press ctrl+insert to copy the marked text.  4. in notepad press ctrl+v (or shift+insert) to paste the url into notepad.  5. The url in notepad does NOT include the &quot;http:// but just   &quot;www.google.dk&quot;  6. If you use CTRL+C to copy the marked url text in the omnibox or use the   mouse and select &quot;copy&quot; then it works.      I expect the paste will include the full url: <a href="http://www.google.dk">http://www.google.dk</a>      The paste only include &quot;www.google.dk&quot;    <b>Please provide
