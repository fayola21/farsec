<title>Issue 30842 -   chromium -    Force web pages to use user selected font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add a switch to force webpages to be shown in the fonts specified by the   user in the Fonts and Languages screen.    I am proposing this for two main reasons:    1. Accessibility. Override fancy font choices (comic sans  bold impact    @font-face's...) with more readable typefaces.  2. Choice. The web is sexier with (properly rendered) FreeSans.          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL   </pre>
