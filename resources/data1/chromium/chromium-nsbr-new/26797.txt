<title>Issue 26797 -   chromium -    Switch to new tab automatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27 (Official Build 28507)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. CTRL + link on a link.      A new tab should be created and it should be switched to automatically.      A new tab is created in the background.    I believe this should be a configurable option in &quot;Under the Hood&quot;. </pre>
