<title>Issue 24857 -   chromium -    Make default theme in theme gallery have no image or color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  the default theme in the theme gallery won't cause the   BrowserThemeProvider to treat it as a &quot;Default Theme&quot; (using   kDefaultThemeID).  We need it to recognize this theme as a default; by   removing all images and colors we allow the BTP to recognize it as a default   theme  and choose the correct code path.   </pre>
