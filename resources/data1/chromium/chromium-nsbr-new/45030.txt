<title>Issue 45030 -   chromium -    [CF] command line silent uninstall fails when IE running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install CF with enterprise installer for example  EXPERIMENTAL_GoogleChromeFrameStandaloneEnterprise.msi    2. Launch IE and access gcf:about:version  3. Run command line silent uninstall: msiexec.exe /q /x  EXPERIMENTAL_GoogleChromeFrameStandaloneEnterprise.msi /l*v uninstall.log        Though the message in uninstall.log shows uninstall has been done  successfully  the CF application folder and profile folder are not removed  at all.    Restarted machine makes the application folder removed  but the profile  folder is still there.    Command line silent uninstall when IE running should prompt user to restart  machine.       </pre>
