<title>Issue 38385 -   chromium -    Selection on tab-away not honored do to ordering bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Linux  svn    Background from comment in AutocompleteEditModel::GetStateForTabSwitch    Weird edge case to match other browsers: if the edit is empty  revert to   the permanent text (so the user can get it back easily) but select it (so   on switching back  typing will &quot;just work&quot;).    This comment is not honored because of an ordering mistake in   AutocompleteEditViewGtk::SaveStateToTab      1. delete the current URL in the omnibar (leaving the empty string)  2. tab away  3. tab back      According to the comment  the url should be reverted and selected.      The url is only reverted  not selected.   </pre>
