<title>Issue 37203 -   chromium -    User interaction bug in url bar with automatic search implementation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>       -- The following is true for any site with open search (if that's the name) set up  but I took   tweakers.net as an example  because it was the site I most often get frustrated at the bug --  1. Type in the urlbar &quot;site:tweakers.net x&quot;  2. The url bar changes to &quot;search tweakers.net: x&quot; (This is in my opinion already unwanted behavior  as it is NOT the same as I typed before  as the first query would execute on google and   the second on tweakers.net)  3. Either way  next hitting backspace should return the previous string &quot;site:tweakers.net x&quot;    however the string is set to &quot;tweakers.net&quot;.       The string should be set to &quot;site:tweakers.net x&quot;       The string is set to &quot;tweakers.net&quot;    <b>Please provide
