<title>Issue 34586 -   chromium -    Broken imags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello     My name is Konstantinos Papathanasiou and I live in Greece and I work in  web development and databases. I found a bug in images.  Long story short  I went to www.f1.com. I zoomed in the web page  (ctrl+middle mouse button). Then I clicked on an image to watch it  enlarged. It appears broken instead of zoomed in.      1.go to www.f1.com  2.Zoom in the web page (ctrl+middle mouse button).  3.Click on an image.(It appears broken)    Thank you for your time.    Konstantinos papathanasiou email:kpapathan@gmail.com    E.g. You have done a remarkable work with Chrome. Being so light and easy  to use for the common user           </pre>
