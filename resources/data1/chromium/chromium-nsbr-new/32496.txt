<title>Issue 32496 -   chromium -    Bookmarks being saved to different folders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create one or more folders in the bookmark bar and add some bookmarks to   them  2. Do a CTRL+SHIFT+B to view the bookmark manager and select a folder. This   is where you expect any new bookmarks to go  3. Save some bookmarks - everything goes where expected  4. Open a bookmark from one of you bookmark bar folders  5. Save some more bookmarks. Now  instead of going to your general   bookmarks folder they will be saved in the folder of the last bookmark you   clicked in step 4    This means i have to keep changing where my bookmarks are saved by default   and if i don't pay attention new bookmarks get saved in my bookmark bar   folders.    A suggested solution would be to disallow bookmarks from being saved   automatically into the Bookmark Bar.                <b>Please provide
