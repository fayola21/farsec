<title>Issue 25959 -   chromium -    Chrome history &amp; thumbnails fill up timemachine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  OS version               : 10.6.1    See <a title="Cache dir needs to be under ~/Library/Caches" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14545"> issue 14545 </a>    I'd like to reopen it.  I'm still experiencing large timemachine incrementals (over 180MB for   chrome). I've used backuploupe to check what files are so large  and these   are the ones:       33344  6 okt 13:20 History Index 2009-09-journal    88835072 27 okt 21:46 History Index 2009-10     1121648 27 okt 21:47 History Index 2009-10-journal      152360 27 okt 21:47 History-journal    68124672 27 okt 21:46 Thumbnails       53864 27 okt 21:47 Thumbnails-journal      I understand why the files are big  but they might as well be in a directory    similar to the cache. With some smaller files.  History is not something you'd like to loose  but thumbnails  could be gone   imo.  Hopefully here can be some solution for this problem  because my time   machine disk is shrinking with around 2gb a day =&gt; 60gb per month only   for chrome history / thumbnails.    For now I will just exclude the files in timemachine  but that's not the   solution </pre>
