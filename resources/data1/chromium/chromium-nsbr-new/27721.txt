Options &gt; Under The Hood &gt; Change Font &amp; Language.  2. Do anything at all.  3. Click Ok.      Changes are set as usual.      Boom - &quot;Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;. Also  Windows reports a memory access   violation.    This worked fine on the previous Dev release.    (Aha! Just realised  it was Friday 13th...) </pre>
