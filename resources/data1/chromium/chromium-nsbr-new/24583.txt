<title>Issue 24583 -   chromium -    The Mode_Switch modifier seems to be always active in text boxes inside a page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28108">r28108</a>  OS + version : Linux 2.6.18 / Gnome  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : metacity  URLs (if applicable) : www.google.com and others  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Correct behavior  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): does not apply.      1.Remap the &quot;page down&quot; (or any other key) as Mode Switch  and    change the behavior of the &quot;d&quot; key with Mode Switch pressed:    The first xmodmap command is neccesary because my keyboard does    not have a real ModeSwitch key.      xmodmap -e &quot;keycode 105 = Mode_switch&quot;    xmodmap -e &quot;keycode  40 = d D   Home&quot;    2. Check that the previous change took effect: Start chrome  and type in  the address bar.       Pressing &quot;d&quot; correctly inserts a &quot;d&quot; character.     Pressing &quot;page down&quot; + d correctly moves to the beginning of the line.       The same behavior is observed with firefox.    3. Go to google.com  and type in the search box:       Pressing &quot;d&quot; without any modifier incorrectly moves the cursor to the     beginning of the line  without inserting the character &quot;d&quot;.       The same is observed when typing on:       - The gmail search box       - When composing a mail in gmail  the To:  Subject: and body text boxes.       - The bing search box       - etc  etc...           When typing on those boxes with firefox  the behavior is the desired  one: &quot;d&quot; inserts a &quot;d&quot;  and Mode_Switch+&quot;d&quot; goes to the beginning of the line.      In summary  it seems that in text boxes inside the page the Mode_Switch  modifier is always active  which makes chrome unusable when that modifier  is being used to change the behavior of regular character keys.   </pre>
