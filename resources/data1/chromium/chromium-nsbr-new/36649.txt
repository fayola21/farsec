<title>Issue 36649 -   chromium -    Disable gears geolocation when built-in geolocation is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11246">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11246</a> is implemented there will be two geolocation implementations available  gears and native.  These occupy different namespace within the DOM and so can co-exist  however   they will result in 2 different permissions review &amp; revoke UIs being   available to the user  which could result in very contradictory view of   user's privacy settings  and hence confusion.    Hence the gears implementation should be disabled when the native impl. is   enabled in stable channel. </pre>
