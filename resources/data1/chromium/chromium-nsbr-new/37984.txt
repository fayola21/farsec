<title>Issue 37984 -   chromium -    Back/forward menu ignores command key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.352.0 (41288)  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK (opens tabs in the foreground  though)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: unknown      1. Open a page and navigate to at least one more page  enabling the back  button.  2. Click and hold the back button to bring up the navigation menu  and  select an item from the menu while holding down the Command key.      The selected history item should be opened in a new tab (consistent with  cmd-clicking on a link or on the back/forward button without bringing up  the menu).      The browser navigates to the selected history item in the same tab  losing  state on the original page etc.   </pre>
