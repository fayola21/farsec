<title>Issue 34453 -   chromium -    Confirm close all tabs! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is ridiculous that when I'm not paying attention and hit X instead of   minimize ALL of my tabs close without any kind of confirmation. I realize   some people will like this feature  but I personally hate it. Please add the   option to confirm closing all open tabs!     Please Please Please! </pre>
