<title>Issue 45029 -   chromium -    Nested message loop won't quit correctly if Quit() is called multiple times in one iteration. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When MessageLoop::Quit() gets called  it only set state_-&gt;quit_received to   true  then MessageLoop::DoIdleWork() will check the flag and quit current   loop if it's true.  But it won't work correctly when trying to quit multiple nested message loops   by calling Quit() multiple times in one loop iteration  in which DoIdleWork()   will only be called once at last. </pre>
