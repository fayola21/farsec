<title>Issue 37449 -   chromium -    Missing /usr/local directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=5">R5</a> candidate  I see the following directories are missing:  CHROMEOS_RELEASE_VERSION=0.5.36.0 (Official Build e02202b5)    /usr/local/sbin  /usr/local/etc    I don't think we intended to remove those  so this is a reminder to put them   back in. </pre>
