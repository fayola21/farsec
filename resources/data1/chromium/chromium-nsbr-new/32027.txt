<title>Issue 32027 -   chromium -    (theme) overlay produced for Classic (blue) theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Obtain superhuman vision. On Mac -- easier: insert an   NSLog()/breakpoint/whatever in -[BrowserFrameView drawRect:]  inside the if   (overlayImage) { ... }. (Or replace the if (color) with if (0).) Similarly on other   platforms (mirandac has checked Windows).  2. Go to the theme gallery and install the Classic theme.  3. Stare really  really closely. Or watch for log messages  or whatever.    On Mac -- the code inside the if (overlayImage) shouldn't be hit.    Checked that this bug reproduces on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35905">r35905</a> on Mac  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35764">r35764</a> on Windows. </pre>
