<title>Issue 27590 -   chromium -    Clicking home button or Alt+Home does not focus the Omnibox (when the NEW TAB PAGE is set as homepage) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0 (Official Build 31086)      1. Set homepage as NEW TAB PAGE  2. Launch Chromium  3. Click the HOME button (in the top toolbar)      The NEW TAB PAGE is displayed and the awesome bar input field is focused   (giving the ability to type).    Since there is no input field on the NEW TAB PAGE  it would be useful to   support immediate typing in case the NEW TAB PAGE does not have what the   user is looking for.      The NEW TAB PAGE is displayed and the awesome bar is NOT focused.    ---  This is an issue is related to when the browser HOMEPAGE is set as the NEW   TAB PAGE only.     </pre>
