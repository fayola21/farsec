<title>Issue 30353 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.MultipleWorkers failing on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MultipleWorkers and SingleSharedWorker ui_tests are failing. Not at all sure why:      /b/slave/chromium-rel-linux/build/src/build/../sconsbuild/Release/ui_tests --gtest_print_time  [==========] Running 167 tests from 44 test cases.  [----------] Global test environment set-up.  [----------] 11 tests from WorkerTest  [ RUN      ] WorkerTest.SingleWorker  [       OK ] WorkerTest.SingleWorker (789 ms)  [ RUN      ] WorkerTest.MultipleWorkers  /b/slave/chromium-rel-linux/build/src/chrome/worker/worker_uitest.cc:29: Failure  Value of: value.c_str()    Actual: &quot;&quot;  Expected: kTestCompleteSuccess  Which is: &quot;OK&quot;  /b/slave/chromium-rel-linux/build/src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc:451: Failure  Value of: process_count    Actual: 1  Expected: 0  Unable to quit all browser processes. Original PID 20676 Leftover PIDs: [ 20693 ]  [  FAILED  ] WorkerTest.MultipleWorkers (60630 ms)  [ RUN      ] WorkerTest.SingleSharedWorker  /b/slave/chromium-rel-linux/build/src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc:451: Failure  Value of: process_count    Actual: 1  Expected: 0  Please close any other instances of the app before testing. Leftover PIDs: [ ]  [  FAILED  ] WorkerTest.SingleSharedWorker (465 ms)    Looks like one of the browser processes is not exiting when the MultipleWorkers test times out   which is causing the subsequent test to fail. The process exits eventually  though  as future tests   don't fail  so I wonder if we just need to wait longer between running test cases (poll for   processes to exit or something)?   </pre>
