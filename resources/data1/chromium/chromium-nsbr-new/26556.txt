<title>Issue 26556 -   chromium -    YUV tests take too long to run on Mac valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While investigating <a title="Mac audio unit tests take too long to run" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26555"> bug 26555 </a> I also noticed that our YUV tests also run   horrendously slow on Mac.  We could get the same amount of coverage on   these tests by simply using smaller resolution files.    [----------] 3 tests from YUVConvertTest  [ RUN      ] YUVConvertTest.YV12  [       OK ] YUVConvertTest.YV12 (63565 ms)  [ RUN      ] YUVConvertTest.YV16  [       OK ] YUVConvertTest.YV16 (62526 ms)  [ RUN      ] YUVConvertTest.Clamp  [       OK ] YUVConvertTest.Clamp (6 ms)  [----------] 3 tests from YUVConvertTest (126113 ms total)    [----------] 2 tests from YUVScaleTest  [ RUN      ] YUVScaleTest.YV12  [       OK ] YUVScaleTest.YV12 (225855 ms)  [ RUN      ] YUVScaleTest.YV16  [       OK ] YUVScaleTest.YV16 (225893 ms)  [----------] 2 tests from YUVScaleTest (451760 ms total)    126113ms + 451760ms = ~10 minutes    This is another area where we could snag a couple minutes for relatively   free. </pre>
