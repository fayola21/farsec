<title>Issue 27623 -   chromium -    Clarify presentation of dragging image outside browser to save it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A nice detail for future releases would be to update how the browser shows   that a user is dragging an image to the desktop to save it.  Currently when   an image is dragged  a small world icon appears next to the mouse pointer.    It would be nice if this instead was the system icon for a jpeg  png  gif  etc.   or a preview of the graphic that is being dragged.    Chrome Version       : 4.0.244.0 (31606)  OS version               : &lt;10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): a preview of the graphic appears  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): a preview of the graphic appears      1. Go to a web page with any graphic  2. Click on the graphic and drag it to the desktop.   </pre>
