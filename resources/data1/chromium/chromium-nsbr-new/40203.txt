<title>Issue 40203 -   chromium -    Recently closed shows 2 tabs on W7 superbar instead of 1 (and then crashes) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open any web page  2. Close the browser  3. Open the browser  4. Click on 'Recently closed  1 Tab'  5. The web page reloads.      Chrome icon shows that only one tab is loaded.      Chrome icon shows as if two tabs were open although only one is (you get   two preview thumbnails  too). If you click close button on any of the   thubmnails  the browser will close.  When you reopen the browser after this behavior has been exhibited    sometimes it will crash. (I can't reproduce the crashes consistently.)    <b>Please provide
