<title>Issue 40254 -   chromium -    NaCl: Issues testing NaCl on Windows virtual machines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enabling the Chrome sandbox causes NaCl processes to freeze on 32-bit Vista   virtual machine.    Ilewis is conducting ongoing investigation to determine which other flavors   of Windows exhibit problems  and if the issues are limited to VMWare.    Currently this appears to be interfering with our ability to run NaCl tests   on virtual buildbots. </pre>
