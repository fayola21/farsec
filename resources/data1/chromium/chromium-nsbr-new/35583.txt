<title>Issue 35583 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't release resources when tabs closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78      1. Open multiple tabs while surfing  2. Close tabs without closing the browser      As tabs are closed  I would expect to see resources used for those tabs   released      Chrome seems to keep some of the resources it should have released    I would like to know how I can better help track this down.  I like to open   up my browser and leave the first tab on my gmail account and then surf   with other tabs  closing them when I'm done with them  but always coming   back to my mail. It seems though  that as the day goes on  I need to   restart chrome or the computer slows down dramatically because of Chrome   using up CPU and memory.  I found that a separate process is opened for   each extension  which accounts for three of the processes on the attached   screenshot  but as I only have two tabs open  one being the New Tab page  I   would expect to see the memory usage and number of processes significantly   less than what it is.   </pre>
