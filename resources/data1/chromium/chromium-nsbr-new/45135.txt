<title>Issue 45135 -   chromium -    Add -Wnon-virtual-dtor flag to gcc based C++ targets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Jim Roskind found a leak caused by a missing virtual destructor.    I rebuilt the chrome target with -Wnon-virtual-dtor set and found 37   violations. After these violations are fixed  it would be great to add this   flag to automatically catch other issues.   </pre>
