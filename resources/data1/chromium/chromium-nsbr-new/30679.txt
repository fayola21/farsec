Open 'opener.html' and click on 'Open'. It will pop up another window.  2. Click on 'Resize me'. It will display the window's dimensions prior and  after resizing.      Window's dimensions should change after resizing.      Window's dimensions remain the same. They will be correct on another click  right before the next resize request (then they will be incorrect once again).   </pre>
