<title>Issue 29358 -   chromium -    IDS_SYNC_START_SYNC_BUTTON_LABEL should not be used for the menu item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are currently using IDS_SYNC_START_SYNC_BUTTON_LABEL for both the   button label and the menu item on Mac. We should have separate items (we   do elsewhere in the code) so the two can vary independently.    This is also true of the &quot;sync'd&quot; and &quot;error&quot; states that the button/menu has.   Each of those needs an additional string entry created for it. </pre>
