<title>Issue 25507 -   chromium -    Feature Request: tab navigation dropdown/menu needed? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Seems like there's no easy way to navigate between tabs via a dropdown (a la   FF3).  A simple solution would be to have a dropdown on the address bar with   a list of all currently opened tabs).    Use case:  - I have 10 google docs tabs open - each of which has a different writely   doc.  Since the icons get squished  i.e. the text in the title becomes ellipses  they all look the same.  - now in order to find the one I really want to edit  i have to do a linear   search. </pre>
