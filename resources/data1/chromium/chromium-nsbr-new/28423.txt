<title>Issue 28423 -   chromium -    [Extensions] &quot;active views&quot; list should update whenever active views actually change in the extension  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Install Web Developer Mini from  <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/webmaster-seo/web-developer-mini/">http://www.chromeextensions.org/webmaster-seo/web-developer-mini/</a>  2. Go to extension management page chrome://extensions/  3. Click on the extenion's browser action icon  popup is displayed and  &quot;Inspect active views&quot; section appears in the extension item.  4. Click again to hide the popup        Ideally the &quot;Inspect active views&quot; section should also disappear  but  currently it is still there  and the page link &quot;tools.html&quot; is not clickable.
