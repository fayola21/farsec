<title>Issue 40814 -   chromium -    FullTabModeIE_UnloadEventTest is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Due to my CL <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=43953">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=43953</a>   chrome_frame_tests!ChromeFrameTestWithWebServer.FullTabModeIE_UnloadEventTest  becomes flaky  since we route all network/cookie related processing into  the UI thread and this changes the timing (cookie related IPC is dropped  when tab is already destroyed).    Reading data from host network stack and cookie related processing may  remain in background thread  so we can get best of two worlds. </pre>
