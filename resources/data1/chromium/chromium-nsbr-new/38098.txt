Enter in 10844 in the test ID field  3. Click on the Flash window to ensure focus.  4. Toggle the Caps Lock key    What is the expected result?  The False True should toggle in coordination  with the caps lock      What happens instead?  Nothing.    When Chrome (5.0.307.11) on Mac (10.6.2) dispatches  NPCocoaEventFlagsChanged to the player as a result of the caps lock key  being pressed  they are not setting the NSAlphaShiftKeyMask bit on the  modifierFlags field of the NPCocoaEvent. </pre>
