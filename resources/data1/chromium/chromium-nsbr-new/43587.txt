<title>Issue 43587 -   chromium -    Strip trailing slash sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Let's try this experiment:    * If the URL's scheme is stripped   * And the path is just &quot;/&quot;   * The strip the path too.    I don't think we need to make any changes to the copy-and-paste heuristic   because I think &quot;<a href="http://foo.com/">http://foo.com/</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://foo.com">http://foo.com</a>&quot; are parsed identically   everywhere. </pre>
