<title>Issue 31670 -   chromium -    Extensions disappear from hard disk  but still (partially) show up in UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0  on windows 7 x64    It happened to me 4 times already. Clicking an extension button just pops   out a &quot;This webpage was not found&quot; popup. Same behavior for all other   extensions as well. I checked the   C:Users[username]AppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser   DataDefaultExtensions folder and it was completely empty.  I had to uninstall each extension manually  and then re-install it from the   extensions library. (trying to overwrite-install did not work).  After the 2nd time  I backed up the above folder  and just restoring the   folder whenever it gets deleted fixes the extensions (until the next time).    I have the following extensions installed (maybe one of them is to be   blamed):  Chromed Bird - Version: 1.4.0  Facebook for Google Chrome - Version: 1.3  Google Calendar Checker (by Google) - Version: 1.0.3  Google Mail Checker Plus - Version: 1.1.5  Google Reader Notifier (by Google) - Version: 1.1  Google Tasks - Version: 1.4.0  Google Wave Notifier - Version: 2.2  IE Tab - Version: 1.0.11208.1  RSS Subscription Extension (by Google) - Version: 1.8.3  Send from Gmail (by Google) - Version: 1.11   </pre>
