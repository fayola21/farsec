<title>Issue 33014 -   chromium -    Warn when trying to load a copy of an extension that is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I'm at home and I want to improve my extension  the easiest way to do that   is to copy my extension from my profile  disable it from the   chrome://extensions page and load it manually from the copied directory.    This  however  silently fails  causing me to start making changes to my   extension and scratching my head as to why nothing works.    The reason it doesn't work is because when loading the copied extension  it   retains its ID (if I don't remove the key field) and the extension system   realizes that that extension is disabled and does no further processing.    It would be nice to be able to accommodate this workflow by not using the key   field for manually loaded extensions  but we should until then/at a minimum   warn the user that loading this extension is a no-op.   </pre>
