<title>Issue 31492 -   chromium -    Minimize  Maximize and Close buttons do not match Gnome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.43  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32 bit (Intel Atom)  window manager: Gnome    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Firefox will use the same buttons   as Gnome.   Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): I haven't tried changing the   icons in Windows.      1. Install Ubuntu  2. Install Google Chrome Beta from .deb  3. Change Gnome Theme in Appearance to one that changes Window Borders      I would expect to be able to have the same buttons in chrome as with all my   other applications at least after changing a setting in chrome.      The icons stay the same. Clicking use GTK+ Theme does not help (nor should   it). Nor does use system title bar and borders (this one does too much).      I guess this is more of a feature request than a bug report. There should   be an option to use system border buttons or the buttons should be made   skinable (perhaps in the themes).    </pre>
