<title>Issue 27955 -   chromium -    Making heap snapshots easier to understand - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Suggested by Lars Bak.    1. Having some UI way of getting an explanation for what (closure) and (code)   are would be very useful.  2. Eliminating the possibility to expand for (closure) and (code) may have   sense.  3. Should (code) be (generated code)? It is easier to understand.  4. Expanding (global properties) is confusing. I get (anonymous) as a sub  node. I assume this is JSGlobalPropertyValue or something. </pre>
