<title>Issue 36258 -   chromium -    Switching windows on meebo using tab key doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta  URL : <a href="http://www.meebo.com/">http://www.meebo.com/</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Not tested  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Works properly      1. Go on meebo.com  2. Login using any account  3. Open 2-3 windows from your buddy list  4. Try to switch between them using 'tab' key    On firefox and IE  pressing the tab key switches between the open buddy   windows  and the search area in buddy list. On Google Chrome  this   switching is erratic - it switches between many other elements  and in the   advertisement bar on the bottom too  thus partially revealing it. On a   similar site (<a href="http://imo.im/">http://imo.im/</a>)  which is almost a clone of meebo  tab   switching works perfectly. This problem is not specific to any operating   system or version of Google Chrome. Please tell me if a screencast is   required to demonstrate the issue.   </pre>
