<title>Issue 24809 -   chromium -    Remove platform duplication in PrintWebViewHelper - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> PrintWebViewHelper's Print and PrintPages are mostly duplicated between Mac   and Windows (I tweaked things a bit on the Mac  but it's nothing that we can't   resolve given more time than I had while getting it up and running). Linux is   completely different though  which is why I didn't move it to the shared file   when I did the Mac part.    I would expect that Linux could use the same architecture for Print at least to   get the print settings  so perhaps the best approach would be to get them   using IPC to get print settings (even if they stay hard-coded for now)  and   moving the whole function to the shared file. </pre>
