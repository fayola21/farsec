<title>Issue 29905 -   chromium -    Support per-datatype GetUpdates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As we add new datatypes to the sync protocol  we should make it so that   clients that don't care about these new types.  For example  there could be a   Firefox plugin  or a mobile OS that wants to sync only bookmarks.    <a title="Add mime-type to sync.proto" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29836"> Bug 29836 </a> talks about adding a per-item enum that identifies the types of   items.  This bug is about adding a specified (possibly a repeated list of these   types) to the GetUpdates message.  The server would suppress sending items   of types not in the list. </pre>
