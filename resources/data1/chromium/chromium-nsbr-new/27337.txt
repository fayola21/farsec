<title>Issue 27337 -   chromium -    Chrome can't open link dropped onto desktop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: SUSE Linux 11.1        1. Drag a link on a page drop it somewhere on the desktop.    What is the expected output?     Should be saved as an .html file. Double-clicking on the icon should open  the page in Chrome if Chrome is the default browser.     What do you see instead?    File is saved with no extension.  Chrome doesn't know how to open it. If  you add an .html extension  Chrome can open it.   </pre>
