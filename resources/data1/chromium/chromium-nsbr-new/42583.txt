<title>Issue 42583 -   chromium -    Dragging and dropping text between text fields can cause text to get eaten - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to any page with multiple text fields. <a href="http://crbug.com/new">http://crbug.com/new</a> is a good   one.  2. Drag text from any text field and drop it on an empty text input.      Text should be dropped in the target text input. Instead  dropped text   disappears if the text input field being dragged over is empty.    This may be related to <a title="Dragging text between text fields only works once." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42125"> issue 42125 </a> -- it works on older builds (I tested at   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44945">r44945</a>) but is broken in newer builds. </pre>
