<title>Issue 26244 -   chromium -    Adobe Reader plugin doesn't show until resize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    <a href="http://www.jadeworld.com/downloads/jade/JADE_Roadmap.pdf">http://www.jadeworld.com/downloads/jade/JADE_Roadmap.pdf</a>            1. Navigate to a pdf URL        The Adobe Reader plugin loads and displays the pdf        The plugin loads but does not refresh the screen so you can't see the pdf.    If you resize the window  it refreshes.    Doesn't seem to happen every time but I don't know what the pattern is yet. </pre>
