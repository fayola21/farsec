<title>Issue 40089 -   chromium -    Missing ability to switch user agents in &quot;Developer&quot; menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.342.7  OS X 10.6.3    It would be useful in development to have a built-in user agent switcher  probably in the   &quot;Developer&quot; submenu.  Safari has a good implementation of this in its &quot;Develop&quot; file menu.   </pre>
