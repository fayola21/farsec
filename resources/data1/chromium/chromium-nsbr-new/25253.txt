<title>Issue 25253 -   chromium -    Scroll wheel events leaking through to window behind this one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Make two windows that have their scollbars showing  2. Put one in front of the other  with the back window a bit visible  3. Roll your scroll wheel at the top one (actually I'm doing two-finger  drag on my MBP 2.33 ghz Intel Core 2 Duo's mousepad)        The front window scrolls and the back window doesn't        They both do. It seems like some fraction of the scroll events are being  sent to the wrong window </pre>
