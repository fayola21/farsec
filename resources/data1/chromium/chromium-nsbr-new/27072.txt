<title>Issue 27072 -   chromium -    Lack of Javascript disablement or security options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.235.0 (Developer Build 30950)    Firefox 3.x: has ability to disable Javascript in Options        1. Startup chromium normally  2. Visit a number of sites (open tabs) which use Javascript  3. There appears to be no obvious &quot;Options&quot; selection to disable Javascript   completely or on a tab-by-tab or site-by-site basis.        Firefox with it NoScript (and other) plugins provides a way to disable   Javascript on a whole browser basis or site-by-site basis.  Opera allows   one to disable it entirely.  Javascript needs significantly more controls   on it -- specifically:  (1) By browser instance (for all processes);  (2) By domain/subdomain instance (e.g. *.com as a default);  (3) Window/Tab instance (for sites running amok).    There are people who believe strictly that &quot;Its *MY* CPU/ ELECTRICITY/   PLANET&quot; and advertisers should have no right to consume those without   restrictions.  This is ignoring the possibility of security holes -- which   if we are still encountering after a decade or more of WWW/Internet use --   so one has to believe these are lurking in the software -- especially *new*   (exploitable) software.          Javascript can run amok -- consuming needless CPU and electricity    contributing to global warming (no matter how efficient the Javascript   machine it is made) due to the fact that running programs which one did not   explicitly request and are not mindful of these considerations.    There appears to be no obvious way to turn off Javascript.  In contract one   appears to be able to do this for new tabs in Firefox and for all tabs in   Opera.     </pre>
