<title>Issue 27259 -   chromium -    Sync UI in options panel resizes on Windows/Linux/Chrome OS and has awkward whitespace on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Preferences -&gt; Personal Stuff -&gt; Bookmark Sync    The button and status text seem to need to be able to change based on the   state of the sync subsystem.  The changes include things like sync status    account it is configured for  etc.  This means the block of text really can be   very different sizes.  You don't want to dynamically resize the UI because if a   message comes in while the window is up  it could cause buttons to move   from under the user's mouse (or worse  move under right before a click   focusing the window causing an action instead).  We need a better way to   display this UI to handle arbitrary sized strings that change at runtime. </pre>
