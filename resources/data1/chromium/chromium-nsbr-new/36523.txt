<title>Issue 36523 -   chromium -    Spellchecker cannot provide suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type a misspelled word &quot;privliged&quot; in a text field.  2. Right-click the word.  3. See suggestions.    What is the expected output?  A correct word &quot;privileged&quot; is shown in the context menu.    What do you see instead?  The context menu doesn't have any suggestions.        This is a regression caused by my stupid mistake in upgrading hunspell to 1.2.8.    Regards     Hironori Bono </pre>
