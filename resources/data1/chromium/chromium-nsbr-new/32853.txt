<title>Issue 32853 -   chromium -    accelerator does not work in compact navigation bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build &amp; Run chromeos build of chrome  2. Switch to compact navigation bar using ctrl-shift-c.  3. In compact navigation bar mode  click the text field of compact    navigation bar  and then type ctrl-shift-c    What is the expected output?  It should switch to normal mode.    What do you see instead?  nothing happens.    It seems like the forcus manager believes different view (other than  compact navigation bar) has a focus and unable to retrieve accelerator   although I'm not expert on this and may be wrong.     </pre>
