<title>Issue 43286 -   chromium -    Google Analytics calendar layer issues in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (46416)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics">https://www.google.com/analytics</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 4.0.5 : OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.5.6 : OK      1. Enter in analytics account.  2. Click to &quot;view inform&quot; (translating from spanish).  3. See the gray layer on top of visitors history.  4. Click calendar options to show.  5. All goes fine.  6. Again click at calendar options to hide.  7. Gray layer is now the full calendar  on top of visitors history.        I think that layer should be behind the visits history when hide.        Calendar layer shows as gray on top of visits history without click. If you click calendar options   then visitors history goes down and all seems good  but another clic to calendar and visitors   history goes down but calendar options stay in front.    In Firefox the calendar has no functionality  so I can't click and change terms  but at least the   layer didn't blind my visitors history.   </pre>
