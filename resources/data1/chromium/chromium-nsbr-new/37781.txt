<title>Issue 37781 -   chromium -    Animation for bookmarks syncing to notify user the status of syncing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.348.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40884">r40884</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.42    When doing bookmarks syncing for huge set of bookmarks (from cloud to Chrome)  stopping the   syncing immediately doesn't download all bookmarks so there is no way for user to know if all   bookmarks are synced or not.    So can we show any animation which notifies the users about the status of bookmarks syncing? </pre>
