<title>Issue 28119 -   chromium -    CFInstall.js injected style rules for mode: &quot;overlay&quot; do not correctly position opaque underlay in standards mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current version of CFInstall.js does not correctly size and position the   underlay node when using a standards-mode DOCTYPE. In quirks mode  the   100% x 100% absolutely positioned rule sizes to the visible viewport  but   that's not sufficient to display the underlay correctly in standards mode. </pre>
