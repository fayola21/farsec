<title>Issue 38033 -   chromium -    Pages loaded in background from NTP are cut off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3 dev  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Make sure the bookmark bar is shown only on the new tab page (and not on  every page).  2. Open the browser (it's now showing the new tab page).  3. Right-click on one of the eight most-visited thumbnails and select &quot;Open  Link in New Tab&quot;.  4. Wait for the page to fully load in a background tab (i.e.  the throbber  should stop spinning).  5. Switch to the newly loaded tab by clicking on it.        The page is displayed normally.        The bottom of the window is not fully painted.  A number of pixels at the  bottom of the tab are white instead of the colors they should be from the  web site (see attached screen shot).  The unpainted region appears to  correspond exactly in size to the size of the bookmark bar on the new tab page.    If you always show the bookmark bar  the issue does not reproduce.   However  in this case the size of the content area on the new tab page is  the same as the size of the content area on the background tab  which might  be masking the issue.    In the screen shot  notice that the dig counts on the left are cut off  but  the Flash ad is not affected.  Also notice that the scroll bar does not  extend to the bottom of the tab.    My theory is that the newly opened tab is rendered as if its content area  were the same size as the new tab page (even though the new tab page is  smaller due to the bookmark bar).  Then  when we switch to the tab  the  page doesn't notice that its content area is the wrong size. </pre>
