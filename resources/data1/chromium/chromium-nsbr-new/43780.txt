<title>Issue 43780 -   chromium -    Backup sockets should be moved into TCPConnectJob - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Windows takes three second to recover from a lost TCP syn packet.    Currently  we start a new ConnectJob from ClientSocketPoolBaseHelper if it   looks like a TCP syn packet is lost.  Instead we should start a new connect   within TCPConnectJob. </pre>
