<title>Issue 37816 -   chromium -    Need validation on Autofill profile fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It'd be nice to have some kind of very basic validation on the autofill   profile fields... e.g.:    for phone numbers  enforce 3-3-4  zip codes  5  etc.    for state  it'd be nice to show a list of available options for all countries   where we can determine this information.    I am not sure what toolbar does here - it would be worth checking. </pre>
