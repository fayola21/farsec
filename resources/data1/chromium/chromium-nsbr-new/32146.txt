<title>Issue 32146 -   chromium -    Foursquare not loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555) dev  URL : <a href="http://foursquare.com/*">http://foursquare.com/*</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Loads fine  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Loads fine    I wasn't sure where to post this  but I've been having trouble getting any of   the pages from Foursquare.com to load on Google Chrome. The page load will   stall and then the sad browser page will come up if you let it be for a few   minutes. It's strange because all the other pages I visit will load fine. </pre>
