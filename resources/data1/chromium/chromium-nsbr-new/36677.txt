<title>Issue 36677 -   chromium -    Valgrind breaks timeout in cocoa_test_helper.mm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cocoa windows can have interesting close semantics which require pumping events.    cocoa_test_helper.mm handles this by pumping events for a limited time  but under valgrind the   timeout is too short  so tests have been disabled.  The timeout should be made scalable (or   something). </pre>
