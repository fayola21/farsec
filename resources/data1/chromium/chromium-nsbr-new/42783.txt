<title>Issue 42783 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.WorkerContextMultiPort fails on linux 64 bit Release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are 2 causes workign together here:  1. the fact that MessagePort creation is using Chromium's PostTask and  WorkerContext.postMessage uses WebKit's callOnmainThread can cause the  postMessage with a port to com ebefore the port was created in the browser  process. This is bad but is not a reason for the crash.  2. The actual crash happens when the non-existing message port id (-2) is  used to access a message port map using index operator. In its infinite  wisdom  the STL authors decided to somehow create and insert a dummy  element when it happens. So dummy Port (with not initialized fields) is  inserted and later used which causes crash or memory corruption.      </pre>
