<title>Issue 23801 -   chromium -    Add an options_page to the manifest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a declarative way to specify the options page for an   extension. Chrome would render UI in the management screen to allow users to   access this page.    The entry would just point to an HTML page that Chrome would open. No clever   integration beyond that. </pre>
