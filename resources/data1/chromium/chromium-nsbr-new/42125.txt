<title>Issue 42125 -   chromium -    Dragging text between text fields only works once. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - visit <a href="http://new.crbug.com">http://new.crbug.com</a> which has multiple text fields  - type some text in the summary field  - drag a word from summary and drop on description  this should work as expected (word is moved   between text fields  - do it again    expected:  - same thing  word is moved between text fields    actual:  - word vanishes from summary and never appears in description.  - if you drag from description to summary  it sad tabs.  - sometimes I can't even start a drag in the summary field  may be unrelated or a side-effect of things   getting horked.    This is bad and a release blocker. Happens both on ToT (44452) and 375.16. Mark says he couldn't repro   in the release 375@45009  but didn't know the exact steps at the time and then lost that build. Now he's   on 375@45061 and it's for sure happening. Maybe it's a recent regression?    Not sure if it's all platforms. Krisr  can you try to repro on others?    Dragging to PasteboardPeeker always shows the proper output  so it must be something internal to   webkit's handling of the drop. </pre>
