<title>Issue 28750 -   chromium -    Add extension autoupdate fallback mechanism - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A developer may create an extension without an autoupdate url and host it   somewhere other than the gallery  but later want to move over to hosting at   the gallery and get the benefits of autoupdate for users of the older   version. So  if an extension has no autoupdate url  we'd like to send an   update check with its id to the gallery (Omaha) server.     If developers want to opt out of this behavior  they just need to put in   something (valid or not) in their update_url entry in manifest.json.   </pre>
