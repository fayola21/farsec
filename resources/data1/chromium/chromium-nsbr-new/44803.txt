<title>Issue 44803 -   chromium -    Reliability bot uses trigger.Trigger instead of reading LATEST file to get current revision - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; I was surprised to see that reliability_tests.py doesn't try to run the   build that triggered it but instead tries to run the LATEST build all the   time. Was that done on purpose? I thought it'd pass the right file to grab   from the build step like the testers run.    &gt;&gt; Yeah  that would be better.  The Windows reliability bot runs immediately   after the archive build step  so in most cases it's equivalent.  It would be   nice to fix it to work way  though  and probably wouldn't be too difficult.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok cool  I just wanted if it was designed this way. The &quot;correct&quot; way is   to trigger.Trigger(copy_properties=['revision']) and pass   WithProperties(&quot;$(revision)&quot;) to the script so it can try to fetch the right   file and fallback on LATEST if it fails  where it can return 88. </pre>
