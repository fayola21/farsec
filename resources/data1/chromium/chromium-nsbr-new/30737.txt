<title>Issue 30737 -   chromium -    Implement internal mixing of audio streams - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux  we currently open a handle to the Alsa device for every video   created.    This has the problem of relying on the system Alsa configuration to handle   mixing of the multiple streams.  For most modern setups  this works okay   for 2-channel PCM audio.  Multi-channel sometimes works depending on the   setup.  However  it's not uncommon to have the multi-channel audio device   (eg.  surround51) set up in a way that only one handle to that device can   be open at a time.    The effect is  if you open a multi-channel audio stream  subsequent   attempts to open either more multi-channel audio  or even 2-channel audio   can be failed because the &quot;Device is busy.&quot;  For the user  it will seem   like only audio from the &quot;first&quot; video can be played  of the first video   has a multi-channel audio-track.    One possible solution to this problem is for us to just mix the audio   streams inside chrome ourselves  and only open the Alsa device once. </pre>
