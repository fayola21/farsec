<title>Issue 40228 -   chromium -    Have at most one Page Info dialog per page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Click the location icon to show the Page Info dialog.  Now click it again.    You get a second dialog.  That seems wrong.    I'm not sure what should happen if the dialog is open and you click the icon   on a different address.  We could open a second dialog  or we could just   change the stuff shown in the existing one.  Thoughts? </pre>
