<title>Issue 43253 -   chromium -    Split |connection_group| logic out of HttpNetworkTransactionDoInitConnection(). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is necessary so that the tcp prewarming code can mimic the same groups.    It will also clean the code up.  Also  we should probably move the pool   selection logic out  now that we have multiple pool types.  Another cleanup   here is to refactor |connection_group| to be a struct instead of a string. </pre>
