<title>Issue 32817 -   chromium -    Chromium exhausts AVWEBGRD.EXE (Avira Antivir Webpage Guard) socket limit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open up Chrome and another browser (or two)  2. Surf around for a bit  using all browsers  maybe a couple tabs in each   browser  paste some links from one to the other.  Any well behaved websites   will do  Google news  Nasa.Gov  news papers  theRegister  etc    3. Soon the &quot;busy&quot; semi-circle on chrome will start revolving  and soon   thereafter the busy indicator on the other browsers will also show busy.    This will get progressively worse till no browser is rendering any pages.    4a. Kill Chrome.  ALL the other browser sessions that were previously hung   now load their pages immediately  and web browsing continues normally    4b.  Kill one of the other browsers  and chrome busy indicator continues to   grind and grind  and none of the other browsers will load pages either.      I expect chrome not to interfere with other browsers  even if chrome itself   gets bogged down      It almost appears as if Chrome has totally corrupted the TCP stack  killing   any browser's ability to load web pages or resolve DNS names.    Chrome brings all other browsers to a halt  even new browser sessions   started once chrome indicates busy.  The only solution is to kill chrome    after which ALL concurrent browsers load all of their tabs immediately.    <b>Please provide
