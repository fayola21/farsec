<title>Issue 35236 -   chromium -    XMLHTTPRequest Inject Security Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm the author of the Chrome SEO extension and was just adding a new   feature when I found a security issue. I later found it doesn't just apply   to extensions it happens with any XMLHTTPRequest. I've tested it in IE and   Firefox and they don't experience the same problem  but I have to admit I'm   not a frontend javascript developer I'm more of a backend developer so I   wasn't able to determine if this was jQuery+Chromium related or just   Chromium related.    The simplest way to explain this is by example so I've attached two files   security-issue.html makes a XMLHTTPRequest to inject.html which has a &lt;div&gt;   element above the &lt;body&gt;  this seems to be the contributing factor. This   causes the body tag to become injected into security-issue.htm with any   code included.    Sorry if this is a jQuery issue  or even more sorry if its my bad code :)   but I wanted to report this to Chromium before I report it to jQuery just   in case.    A few malicious things could be done with this  if a Chrome extension makes   a request to a website the site can now execute code as the extension so it   can hijack any browser session.
