<title>Issue 45733 -   chromium -    URL in omnibox should fade out at right edge. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When there is a long URL in the omnibox that is clipped by the right edge of   the display area  the right edge should be faded to the background color of   the omnibox. I would guess the fade would occur over 5-6 pixels or whatever   looks good. </pre>
