<title>Issue 35333 -   chromium -    Scroll Arrows Placement Differs Between Tabs  Doesn't Respect Preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev  OS version               : 10.5      1. Leave Chrome open for a while with lots of tabs (=&gt; helper processes).        Scroll bar arrows should be at either end of the scroll bar  as preferences   indicates.        Scroll bar arrows are adjacent and at bottom of scroll bar in one tab  while   another has them separated and at either end of the scroll bar.  N.b. that   my system preferences are set to have them separated and have not been   changed in the interim.    Appears to be consistent for tabs from a given helper process  but no clear   reason why one process is affected while another isn't.    Filing as separate bug from 18965 at avi's request. </pre>
