<title>Issue 34398 -   chromium -    Confirm Form Resubmission on GET request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 (Official Build 37331) dev  URLs (if applicable) : data:text/html &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;   value=&quot;Test&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK  Chromium 4.0.290.0 (Developer Build 35487): FAIL      1. Submit a form (e.g. in the data URL provided) to make a POST request.  2. Hit return/enter in the location bar again  causing a GET request.  3. Press Reload.      There should not be a &quot;Confirm Form Resubmission&quot; dialog  as no form is being submitted.  The most recent request  being a GET  is the request that Reload repeats.      The &quot;Confirm Form Resubmission&quot; confirmation appears.  When confirmed  the correct GET request is sent.  (The GET vs POST aspect cannot be demonstrated via data URL  but has been observed over HTTP).    Note that none of the open issues relating to 'Confirm Form Resubmission' cover the case where the   dialog is being displayed in preparation for a non-form-submitting GET request. </pre>
