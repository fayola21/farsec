<title>Issue 30002 -   chromium -    mac browser_tests show a slow down over time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mail I sent out -    Over the last week  I've brought most of the browser_tests that were   running on Windows and Linux online for the Mac also.  But it looks like it   is exposing something bad under the hood...    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Tests">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Tests</a> lets   you clearly see when I landed cls enabling chunks of tests (look at the   browser_tests graph).  But what is odd is the slow climb inbetween these   spots.  From when I landed a chunk that took that graph up to 8-9   minutes  it then climb on it's own to 16 mintes. If you look at the graph for   unit_tests  you also see a gradual climb without any new tests coming   online.  Like whatever is happened to browser_tests also impacted   unit_tests.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Chromium%20Mac">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Chromium%20Mac</a>   (the full clobber build) also shows the same general pattern on   browser_tests and on unit_tests.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Perf(2)">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Perf(2)</a>   also shows some climbs like this.  What is interesting here is not all of the   normal perf graphs show increases  because some aren't plotting time.  For   example the memory_test graph here seems to show a slow climb  but the   perf graph doesn't show any change in memory used.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Tests%20(">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/stats/Mac10.5%20Tests%20(</a>  dbg)(3) is a new bot that runs the browser_test in debug.  Since it is new  it   doesn't have as much history  but it also shows the general trend starting   there also.    I've rebooted the 3 release bots above to see if there is a resource leak of   some kind that builds up over time  but the Mac10.5 Tests bot is already   taking longer for browser_tests then the debug version does... </pre>
