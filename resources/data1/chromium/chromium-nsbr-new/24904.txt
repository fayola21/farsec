<title>Issue 24904 -   chromium -    Rewrite fast/events/mouse-click-events.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test attaches several event listeners to the page then performs a series of   doubleclicks (left  middle  right  4th mouse button).  The event listeners log   what event was received and we compare the results via dumpAsText().  The   problem is that middle and 4th mouse button clicks (which are handled   identically) are handled differently depending on whether the window is   scrollable.  By the time we get to the last clicks (in the Windows test shell   anyway)  enough information has been logged that the page needs a   scrollbar  and we get incorrect results.    The test should be rewritten such that it isn't dependent on the window being   at least a certain size. </pre>
