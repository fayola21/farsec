<title>Issue 45193 -   chromium -    Browser crash @ RtlpUpdateHeapRates in ntdll.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use the browser      No crashes      Chrome crashes constantly. One time it crashed even when pages were   already loaded (around 5 tabs) and without any interaction from user. It   can also crash when typing an address into Omnibox. Usually it just cashes   while loading pages. Unfortunately  crash reports are rarely sent.    In older versions crashes were also happening  but not so often. v5 is   simply unusable.    I reinstalled the browser but with no effect.    Let me know what kind of information I could provide to debug this.      <b>Please provide
