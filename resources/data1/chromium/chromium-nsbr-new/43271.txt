<title>Issue 43271 -   chromium -    Strings for post-update relaunch dialog need to be Mac-ified - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you go into About Google Chrome when there's an auto-update available and click the button to   install it  once it's ready a dialog instructs you to &quot;close all Google Chrome windows&quot; and then   relaunch it. Closing all windows != quitting on the Mac; it should say &quot;quit Google Chrome&quot; instead. </pre>
