<title>Issue 35172 -   chromium -    Add http request headers to developer tools for all resources. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev      Hi     In the &quot;Resources&quot; tab of the developer tools the http request headers sent   by chrome is only displayed for &quot;Documents&quot; resources. It would be great to   have it for all the other resources too in order to debug things like http   cache.    Regards.   </pre>
