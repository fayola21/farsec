<title>Issue 39349 -   chromium -    Move KillProcessTree() to src/base/process_utils.h and use it instead of KillProcess* - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Most of the time we want to kill the process tree  not only a specific   process.    So extract src/chrome/browser/process_singleton_win_uitest.cc :   KillProcessTree into src/process_utils.h and make it work since it doesn't   seem to fly right now.    We should at the same time remove most of the calls to base::KillProcesses(). </pre>
