<title>Issue 45663 -   chromium -    Chrome 5.0.375.55 Mac does not update &quot;Oops!&quot; page title after successful reload if title is blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. load a page of a Web site that is down -  2. Page title (in the tab) will become &quot;Oops! Google Chrome cannot connect to &lt;web site&gt;&quot;  3. bring web site back up  4. reload the page  but ensure that &lt;title&gt; is blank in the HTML (ie. &quot;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&quot;)  5. Chrome will still display a title (in the tab) of &quot;Oops! Google Chrome cannot connect to &lt;web   site&gt;&quot; even after the page has been successfully loaded.        Expected behavior is that when the page is successfully loaded  the page title (in the tab) will be   set to the URL of the site if &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; is empty rather than continuing to display the &quot;Oops&quot;   message.        The &quot;Oops!&quot; message continues to be displayed.    <b>Please provide
