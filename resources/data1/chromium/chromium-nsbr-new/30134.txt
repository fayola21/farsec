<title>Issue 30134 -   chromium -    Do click-to-select-all on right click as well as left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. make the browser window wide enough so that there is some whitespace to   the right of the url in the omnibox  2. right click in the whitespace.        The URL should be fully selected so that Copy in the context menu will copy   the URL        nothing is selected  so you must select the &quot;Select all&quot; menu item  then   right click again and select Copy  or press Ctrl-C to copy.    Both IE and Firefox address bars auto-select the full url  making it much   easier to copy URLs into the clipboard. </pre>
