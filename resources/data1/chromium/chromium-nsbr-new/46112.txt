<title>Issue 46112 -   chromium -    Crash when changing layout of ContentEditable span - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.70 beta           Safari 5: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 8: OK      1. I have the following code:  &lt;span contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;This piece of text is editable. &lt;strong&gt;Even the bold part.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    2. I try to set the text Bold (Ctrl + B)  Italic (Ctrl + I) or Underline (Ctrl + U)      The selected piece of text should become bold  italic or underlined...      The page crashes    When I put the contenteditable in a div around the span it's all working fine.    FF 3.6 just didn't do anything except opening the bookmarkbar or other things related to the shortkeys. </pre>
