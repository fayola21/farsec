<title>Issue 36776 -   chromium -    [inspector] Double click to decode/encode form data doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi    i have chromium 5.0.307.9 (39052) on linux 2.6.32-9    I see the new way to display form data in the inspector tool (great!)  but the double click to siwtch to url encoded or decoded formats doesn't   work.    for me it stays as encoded.    Thanks </pre>
