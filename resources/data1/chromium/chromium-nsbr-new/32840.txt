<title>Issue 32840 -   chromium -    Icon URLs passed to createNotification() must be absolute - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Most APIs that take a URL (window.open()  Worker()  XmlHttpRequest()  etc)   accept relative URLs.    It appears that createNotification() does not resolve relative URLs (seems   to ignore relative URLs)  so you can only display icons if you provide an   absolute URL to the icon.    We should support relative URLs to match the rest of the HTML APIs.     </pre>
