<title>Issue 23382 -   chromium -    Unify reference build for chrome and chrome frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we have two copies of a reference build checked in the source tree    one for chrome and the other for chrome frame. Ideally they should be using   the same.    The concern here could be that chrome frame might need to update the   reference build more frequently and if that would negatively affect chrome in   any way.     </pre>
