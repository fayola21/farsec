<title>Issue 35856 -   chromium -    Crash in WebPluginDelegateImpl::FireIdleEvent trying to access instance() after idle event handling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a handfull of plugin crashes on this if check in FireIdleEvent:     if (instance()-&gt;drawing_model() == NPDrawingModelQuickDraw)       instance()-&gt;webplugin()-&gt;Invalidate();  It looks like instance() must have been destroyed (and nulled out) during idle   event handling  which is certainly possible and something we need to check   for.    The same check should be done in the while loop earlier in FireIdleEvent. </pre>
