<title>Issue 28302 -   chromium -    Making a change to file included in resource didn't trigger a rebuild - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure if this is something to do with how we express dependencies.    I made a change to src/net/base/dir_header.html and then built &quot;chrome&quot;   from Visual Studio.    The resulting binary did not reflect the change I had made to dir_header.html.    To get it working I had to rebuild the &quot;net_resources&quot; target before building   &quot;chrome&quot;.    Is this working as intended? </pre>
