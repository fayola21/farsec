<title>Issue 31111 -   chromium -    Extension page stops responding (and so all extensions) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. i'm coding and extension.. so I edit it  i PACK it  i uninstall it and   the reinstall it.  2. doing so many times  after a while I have to close the 'extensions' page   because it doesn't allow anymore to click on buttons.        you know :)    Another thing (maybe needing a new issue):  when you uninstall an extension  if that extension uses localStorage  that   localStorage is not erased.  If I reinstall the extension  old data show up.      <b>Please provide
