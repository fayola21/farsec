<title>Issue 44770 -   chromium -    Add sync service status details into feedback payload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium OS has a feedback reporting mechanism that lets the user send a message back to   google containing a screen shot of their current session along with various data gathered from the   system.  We should add sync related data into this payload to help us debug sync problems.    See the sys_info_ member in the BugReportView class (chrome/browser/views/bug_report_view.h)   for more info.   </pre>
