<title>Issue 34892 -   chromium -    suggestion: Chrome should restore position on page during session restore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev    Currently if a page is scrolled down in a Chrome tab  re-starting Chrome   with performing session restore opens that page from the very beginning  not   where it was scrolled to before restarting.    It would be very helpful if the scroll position was saved during exit  and   restored upon session restore. </pre>
