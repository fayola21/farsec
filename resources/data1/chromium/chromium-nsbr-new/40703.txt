Type a query in the omnibar where that query also resolves to a hostname. For instance  the query could   be &quot;linux&quot; if there is a host named &quot;linux&quot; on the network (pinging &quot;linux&quot; wouldn't require the FQDM).   2. Press the &quot;Go To&quot; button or press &quot;Enter&quot;.  3. The &quot;Did you mean to go to http://linux/? gold bar will appear in addition to  and at the top of  the   default search engine's result page.   3. The gold bar text isn't normal html.      The link in &quot;Did you mean to go to http://linux/? should be:   a. Right-clickable; and   b. Display the URL in the bottom-right blue status bar.       a. The link is not right-clickable. There is no way to launch the link in another tab;   b. It doesn't appear as a link on the blue bar in the bottom left corner. </pre>
