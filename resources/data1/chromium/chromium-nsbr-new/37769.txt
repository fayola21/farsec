<title>Issue 37769 -   chromium -    Font rendering degraded in 5.0.349.0 (40991) Ubuntu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.349.0 (40991) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a> or anything    I know this is as vague as possible  but after upgrading to latest build    fonts look very small and hard to read. Hopefully you can figure it out so   that we can get the old nice fonts back. </pre>
