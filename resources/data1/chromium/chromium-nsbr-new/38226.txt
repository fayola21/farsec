<title>Issue 38226 -   chromium -    Event pipeline should include caps lock state (at least on Mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the Mac  every event sent to a plugin should have the caps lock state. The NSEvent* that we start   with has that as a modifier flag  but we lose it almost immediately  and so the Mac plugin host has   to fake it based on live state  which isn't perfect.    Ideally  WebInputEvent would have a new modifier flag for the caps lock key  and the whole chain of   event type conversions would preserve that information. This might require some WebKit changes as   well. If we only want this on the Mac  we might be able to piggyback on some of the pieces that are   currently PLATFORM(MAC). </pre>
