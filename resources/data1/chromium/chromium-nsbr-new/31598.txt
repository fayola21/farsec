<title>Issue 31598 -   chromium -    Main process chugs CPU and stalls everything  stuck in poll/read() loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.290.0 (35507) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : almost anything      Firefox 3.x: OK    Once the main process is caught in this vicious cycle  new tabs can be  opened  but no pages will load. I can pretty much do this every time from  startup  but on occasion I can load a couple of pages before it kicks in.    I have attached a strace log of the main process -- in this log  I start  Chromium from command line  then attempt to load <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">http://planet.gnome.org/</a>  from a bookmark. </pre>
