<title>Issue 28573 -   chromium -    suggestion: provide keyboard shortcuts for buttons in bars like &quot;Save password?&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16    Currently  for any bar that has buttons (like &quot;Restore session?&quot; or &quot;Save   password?&quot;) there's no keyboard shortcut for that buttons--they are only   reachable with mouse or with Tab/Shift-Tab. Keyboard shortcuts would save   time in such situations for heavy users of keyboard (or when mouse is not   very reactive  like a trackpoint). </pre>
