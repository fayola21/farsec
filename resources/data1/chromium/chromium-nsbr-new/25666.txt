<title>Issue 25666 -   chromium -    limit memory taken by renderer for one tab/site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27    Currently Chrome does not protect itself from extremely high memory usage   caused by badly-designed web pages (even pure-HTML  without plugin objects).   It easily leads to situations where hundreds of MBs (and sometimes few Gigs)   is taken by a single tab /set of tabs from the same domain (if Chrome runs   with &quot;-process-per-site&quot;)--despite the fact that physical memory is very   limited (2G in my case is quite limited  but not uncommon).    Maybe Chrome should detect such pages/sites  and warn before they grab most   of available physical RAM and make the whole system entirely unresponsive? </pre>
