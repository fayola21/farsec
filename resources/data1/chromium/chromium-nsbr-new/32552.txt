<title>Issue 32552 -   chromium -    Preferences/Downloads: Change Download location to default (/Downloads) when user preferred location no longer exists. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.295.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35884">r35884</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Chrome --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Under the Hood --&gt; Downloads  2. Browse and set as preferred download some location ( Example: &quot;Y2009&quot; folder on desktop )  3. Rename to &quot;Y2010&quot; or Delete &quot;Y2009&quot;   4. Close and Reopen &quot;Chrome --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Under the Hood&quot; and view the Download location    Actual:  -The download location shows the same path with no change  but the folder &quot;Y2009&quot; looses its folder favicon  and   shows the untitled file favicon. ( Screenshot attached )  - Download any file from web or  Perform &quot;Save As&quot; on any web page --&gt; Chrome automatically creates &quot;Y2009&quot;   folder by itself with out any user's interaction and download the stuff to its location.    Expected:  - When Download location is no longer available(deleted)  change the location to default system download   location.(/Downloads) -- ( Safari Firefox on Mac does that )  - When destined downloads location folder got renamed -&gt; Preferences UI  when reopened should change its   folder name updated accordingly . ( FF/mac does it ) or set to /Downloads location (Safari does this) ?      Note: Other platforms maintain the URL(link) for download location. Mac shows the location with the folder   structure having fav-icons.    </pre>
