<title>Issue 28832 -   chromium -    [Extensions] The autoupdate or changing on default-update-frequency seems not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Create a sample extension v1.0 and then upload it to gallery and publish it.  2. Launch chrome with parameter &quot;--extensions-update-frequency=2&quot;  3. Install that sample extension v1.0  4. Update the published extension to v2.0  5. After a while(at least more than 2 minutes)  check whether the installed  sample extension has been updated to v2.0        I waited for 8 minutes  the installed sample extension is not updated at  all  this means either autoupdate or changing on default-update-frequency  doesn't work.    By the way  &quot;Update extensions now&quot; works.         </pre>
