<title>Issue 43374 -   chromium -    URL disappears after enter in a new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open a new tab  2. Type an address in the address bar  3. hit return.        You should see the address you just typed since Chrome is loading that page!        Chrome clears the URL as soon as you hit enter. :(    This may be just the same as <a title="Chrome Mac is very slow to change address bar when clicking link" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43267"> bug 43267 </a>.  This may even be intentional behavior.  However   would argue this behavior is confusing to the   user and should be changed. :)   </pre>
