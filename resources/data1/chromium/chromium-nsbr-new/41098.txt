<title>Issue 41098 -   chromium -    Tab tearing causes error in tab title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev  Have more than one tab open  tear one away and put it back. If you place it   directly over another tab on the tab strip it will switch the tab title of   the tab.  In the screenshot the tab igoogle has been switched with the chrome issues   page. Clicking the tab titled 'new issue' is actually igoogle and vice versa. </pre>
