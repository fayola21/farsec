<title>Issue 23519 -   chromium -    [Docs] Subversion properties documentation is out of date - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style</a>    There's a section on Subversion properties that looks like it predates GYP.   It says to set *.sln = svn:eol-style=native when I would expect it to be in   global-ignores.    Can someone with a good idea of what the defaults should be update this page? </pre>
