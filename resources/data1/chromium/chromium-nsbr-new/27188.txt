<title>Issue 27188 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.update does not always work when updating right after creating tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Call chrome.tabs.create with the newtab page.  2.Call chrome.tabs.update with the about:blank page in the  chrome.tabs.create callback.  or  1.Load the attached extension.      The expected output is that the about:blank page will load.  The actual output is that the newtab page is still shown.      This bug seems to be tied to some sort of race  so it may not occur on your  machine consistently  or at all. You can try tweaking some timeouts in the  extension's bg page. Please see the bg page for more details. </pre>
