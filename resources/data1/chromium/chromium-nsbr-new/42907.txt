Not able to remember the choice  in other words selection is not saved  to exception list  3. Not able to save the cookie  4. etc    The issue is detected with build 5.0.375.28 (Official Build 45883)  it also  happens in most early 375 build 5.0.375.1 (Official Build 44215)  but  doesn't happen in Stable and Beta channel build.
