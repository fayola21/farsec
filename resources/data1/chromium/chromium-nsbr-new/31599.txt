<title>Issue 31599 -   chromium -    Uncaught TypeError: string is not a function native runtime.js:392 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    It happened by mistake  I assigned a string variable the same name of a   function I later used in my code.    The problem is: the error should have indicated the line of my code where the   problem was.  Instead it showed &quot;native runtime.js:392&quot;   </pre>
