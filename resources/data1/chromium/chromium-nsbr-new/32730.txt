<title>Issue 32730 -   chromium -    Window title bar is inconsistent with Mac apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version     : 4.0.249.49  OS version               : 10.5.8    The title bar of the window is not painted consistently with other Mac   windows....instead  the tabs are painted with a fairly thick border above   them.    The result is that it is hard to identify windows that are largely obscured    and pretty much impossible when they are minimized to just a title bar (eg    using WindowShade).    [see attached screen shot  showing minimized Chrome windows on top    and other windows below.]    It would be nice to paint a real Window Title  or at least to allow this as a   configuration option.         </pre>
