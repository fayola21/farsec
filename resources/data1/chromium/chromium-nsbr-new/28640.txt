<title>Issue 28640 -   chromium -    Per-tab/process audio controls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request  not a bug.    Problem: I  like many others  use tabs as a kind of browser to-do list.   When I'm reading a blog  I'll open each link in a new tab and then read all   the links once I get to a good stopping point. This model is broken when   the new tabs play media  however. I might have 20 tabs open  one of which   is playing an annoying audio ad. I can't tell which tab is playing  I just   know that (at least) one of my open tabs is playing audio. Worse yet  the   ad is positioned low enough that I can't see it just by flipping through   the tabs--I actually need to open each tab  scroll down  and find the one   that's producing audio. Or I could start closing tabs indiscriminately  but   that would defeat the usefulness of the tab feature for me. And I don't   want to prevent *all* background tabs from playing audio  because I like   Pandora.    Feature level 1: some UI to indicate that media is playing on a tab. For   instance  a speaker icon next to the tab-close button. Or pulse the   background of the tab in some way. Anything to let me know that this   particular background tab is making noise.    Feature level 2: allow me to interact with the tab without switching to it    to mute the audio or change the volume.     Feature level 2.5: If the audio is coming from a visual element (e.g. a   video) on the tab's page  a hover-popup thumbnail of just that element   would ROCK.     Feature level 3: Allow me to set preferences for media on different tabs.   For instance  let me whitelist which sites are allowed to play in the   background. Let me say that tabs should never play media until I bring them   to the foreground at least once.        </pre>
