<title>Issue 29779 -   chromium -    date.toLocaleString() is broken or not implemented - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK              var a = new Date(1260311630000);        alert (a.toLocaleString());              8. prosinec 2009 23:33:50            Tue Dec 08 2009 23:33:50 GMT+0100 (Central Europe Standard Time)    It seems that this function is not localized to Czech language or is  broken. I run it on Czech localized Vista and XP. Chrome user interface is  localized on both operating systems.     Especially undesirable is that the returned &quot;localized&quot; string is so long  in google.   </pre>
