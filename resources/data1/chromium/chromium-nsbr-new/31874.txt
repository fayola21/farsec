Result:  THe form value is auto-popped in to input box with the value highlighted   in the input box. In this use case  just hit 'esc' key to undo the form   auto-fill suggestion.  The input box becomes empty (as expected)  but the   caret is not showing up on the input box  even thought  focus ring shows   up on the input box. </pre>
