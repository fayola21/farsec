<title>Issue 46139 -   chromium -    Javascript Error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.70  URLs (if applicable) : index.htm (of the included files)      Firefox 3.6: OK           IE 7: OK      1. Open the file &quot;index.html&quot;         You will have to see 2 frames; left one with a tree structure  the right one with a description of the element of the current selected tree node.        The page keeps saying &quot;Loading&quot;. The Javascript console says &quot;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null&quot;.    The HTML files I'm attaching are generated automatically by the UML-Case tool Enterprise Architect and are expected to test this issue. Prior to version 5.x of Chrome  these HTML files could be opened without any problems by Chrome 4.x.    The HTML files can still be read by IE and Firefox.    I am attaching too the expected results as seen in Firefox and IE and the result in Chrome 5.x.    Greetings     Rafael. </pre>
