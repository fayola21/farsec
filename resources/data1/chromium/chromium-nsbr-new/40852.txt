<title>Issue 40852 -   chromium -    multi-click text selection behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. click a million times on any render view text      linux expected: behavior cycles every 3 clicks. First click - set cursor.   Second click - select word. Third click - select line.  windows expected: behavior cycles every 2 clicks  alternating between select   word and select line.    Actual: after third click  subsequent clicks don't change the selection;   selection is stuck on whole line.    apologies if this was already filed somewhere  my searches didn't find it. </pre>
