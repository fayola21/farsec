<title>Issue 41859 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcuts in the bookmark manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      N/A      Have keyboard shortcuts in the bookmark manager for:  - Switch to edit mode  - Open in a new window  - Open in a new tab        N/A    This is a feature request  not a bug.    The issue is that when you use the bookmark manager to edit/classify a   large number of bookmarks  right clicking on a bookmark to edit it is long   and painful (especially on a laptop where there is only a trackpad). Keyboard   shortcuts would be welcome.    :) </pre>
