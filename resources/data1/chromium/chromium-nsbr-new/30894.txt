<title>Issue 30894 -   chromium -    Mac: Text cursors disappear/invisible after dragging a tab in and out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to  e.g.  &lt;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>&gt;  in   Mac Chrome; check that the text cursors appear as normal in the various   text boxes.  2. Drag this tab in and out. If it's the only tab in the current window  you   can just drag it to another window.  [2.5. Crash. (D'oh!)]  3. Notice that the text cursor is now invisible in all the text boxes. (There's   still a location  but no cursor shows. Editing this bug is now hard.)      I expect to see a cursor when I click on a text box. Instead  I see nothing.    I'm not really sure what could be causing this  but haven't actually looked   into it.... </pre>
