<title>Issue 26161 -   chromium -    chrome_debug.log is hard to find - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is incredibly difficult to explain to users how to get at chrome_debug.log.    First I need to have them add the command-line flags:    --enable-logging --log-level=0    And then I need to explain to them the one of EIGHT different locations the log file may be saved to   (<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory">http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory</a>). And even then  sometimes they   may get the Chromium vs Chrome log :(    Since I already need to have them muck with command line flags  maybe we can just have another   flag to specify the log output path  so I can then reference a fixed location.    Or have the ability to open the log file from within chrome. </pre>
