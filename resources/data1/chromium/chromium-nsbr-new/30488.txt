<title>Issue 30488 -   chromium -    Port remaining npapi_test_plugin tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A number of the NPAPI tests in plugin_client.cc (and the corresponding invocations in   npapi_uitest.cc) are currently ifdef'd to be Windows only because the files implementing those tests   don't compile on other platforms. From a quick glance  at least the windowless plugin tests should   be pretty easy to make cross-platform. </pre>
