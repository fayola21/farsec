<title>Issue 44017 -   chromium -    strokeText() produces no output when canvas dimensions are set dynamically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.0 (46998) Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Create a simple HTML file with a &lt;canvas&gt; element. I've attached a   simple HTML file I tested with.  2. Use JavaScript to set the canvas dimensions  then draw some text with   strokeText()  3. DON'T set canvas dimensions this time  then draw text again with   strokeText()      The text shows as in the attached screenshot even if the canvas dimensions   are set in JavaScript      Nothing is shown unless no canvas dimensions are set dynamically    I've attached the simple HTML and JavaScript files I've used to test this   issue. When testing  the console reports no errors or warnings whatsoever. </pre>
