<title>Issue 25584 -   chromium -    When attaching a tab to a tabstrip via dragging  the target frame should be activated as soon as the tab is attached. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create some tabs  drag one out and drop it in a new window.  2. Drag the tab back to the original window... note the magnetism kicks in.        I expect the frame to appear active as soon as the magnetism kicks in.  Instead the frame doesn't activate until I let go  which makes it appear   flickery/janky. </pre>
