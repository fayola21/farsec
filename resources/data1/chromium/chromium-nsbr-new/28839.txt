<title>Issue 28839 -   chromium -    Optimize keyboard event flow between the browser and the renderer. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order to solve <a title="accesskey attributes conflict with browser shortcuts (like tab-switching)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21624"> issue 21624 </a>  since <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=29857  keyboard events will be pending in the browser   until receiving the ack message of the previous RawKeyDown event from the   renderer. This makes the logic so much complicated and causes other   problems  such as <a title="Regression: Forced rendering for every keystroke" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27932"> issue 27932 </a>.    We should try to optimize this logic to make sure the keyboard events can be   sent to the renderer fully asynchronously without waiting for any acknowledgments. </pre>
