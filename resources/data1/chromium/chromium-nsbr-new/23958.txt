<title>Issue 23958 -   chromium -    Extensions created on OS X won't install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It seems OS X puts in extra junk in the crx.  I think this is a known bug   but I checked the tracker for this error message and didn't find it:    &quot;Cannot load extension with file or directory name __MACOSX. Filenames   starting with &quot;_&quot; are reserved for use by the system.&quot;    Assigning to aa since I don't know who is the appropriate person for triage. </pre>
