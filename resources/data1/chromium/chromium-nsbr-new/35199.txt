<title>Issue 35199 -   chromium -    Debugging directive page is Windows specific - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Look at the web page URL.        Believe it or not Windows is *NOT* the only OS which chrome runs on.  The   web page only discusses debugging chrome under MS Windows. I could care a   fast flying f*** about windows.  There are other real 32/64 bit operating   systems out there (long before Windows) -- Linux  NeXt  etc. come to mind.    Windows only became a pseudo-real OS around the time of Windows 2000.    (Real OSes don't allow cross process corruption).    Put the other real operating systems on an equal footing with Windows.    Just because it is a market leader doesn't mean Google should lick its   boots.      Page documents MS Windows debugging but not debugging on other   equivalently  and arguably  better operating systems.  This raises the   specter that Google  like Mozilla  will fall into pit of worshiping at the   feet of the &quot;Windows God&quot; (as witnessed by the fact that core Chrome   session filenames contain spaces).    <b>Please provide
