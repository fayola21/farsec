<title>Issue 34513 -   chromium -    Mac: Deletion of bookmark with bookmark bubble up can crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   0. On a Mac  start Chromium.  1. Set up bookmark sync.  2. Create a bookmark; call it &quot;foo&quot;.  3. Click on &quot;foo&quot;  and click on the star button.  4. Go to another computer (not necessarily a Mac). Start Chrome/Chromium. Set up bookmark sync.  5. When &quot;foo&quot; appears on computer #2  delete it (on computer #2).  6. Wait until it's synchronized to computer #1. (Wait a while; you might be able to see it removed   from the bookmark bar  unless the bubble is covering that up.)  7. On computer #1  change the title of &quot;foo&quot; (in the still-open bubble -- I don't know if this step is   really necessary)  and then click on &quot;close&quot;.  8. Insert smoke and flames.    This is <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38010">r38010</a> off the trunk. Win and Linux Chrome don't crash.    I bet I can (or will be able to) write an extension (to delete bookmarks in the background) which   causes the same crash. </pre>
