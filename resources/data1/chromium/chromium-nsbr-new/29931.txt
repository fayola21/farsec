<title>Issue 29931 -   chromium -    The automation provider exposes too much functionality to ChomeFrame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame instances uses the IPC automation channel to talk to Chrome. The   IPC messages are handled by the automation provider in Chrome. This object   allows more IPC's than those which are used by ChromeFrame. We should   refactor the AutomationProvider or create a new wrapper for ChromeFrame    which filters incoming messages. </pre>
