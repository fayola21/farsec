<title>Issue 45452 -   chromium -    Can't easily retrieve cache files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From about:cache you can get hexdumps of the HTTP traffic and actual payload   of items in the cache  but reconstructing them into their original files   takes additional manual processing.  People should be able to view the raw   images/pdfs/... in their cache by following some link.    On Linux  the script:    echo &quot;contents&quot; | cut -c 12-73 | sed 's/s+/ /g' | xxd -r -p -g 1 &gt; outfile    does the job as a workaround  but is inconvenient  and more work than should   be expected. </pre>
