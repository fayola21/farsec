<title>Issue 38610 -   chromium -    selenium test failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A selenium test started failing here:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20XP/buil">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20XP/buil</a>  ds/10980    It seems like the webkit roll (56165:56197) is probably the culprit.  We should   try to convert this test into a layout test and add it upstream.    I'm going to add it to the selenium expected failure for now.   </pre>
