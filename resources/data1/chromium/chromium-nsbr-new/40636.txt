<title>Issue 40636 -   chromium -    prompted to install already installed plugin (flash) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2    don't know what happened exactly. I got a message from Chrome that   &quot;additional plugin&quot; was needed to dispay some web pages (The Register UK    and Le Monde FR)  although I'm already running the integrated Shockwave   Flash 10.1 d51 with Shockwave Flash - Version: 10 0 45 2 deactivated just   in Chrome. the alert didn't make sense but I wanted to see what happens if   I followed the instructions. So I clicked install  got an &quot;adobe&quot; dialog   box prompting me to close Chrome; did it and clicked install again  and the   dialog showed flash being removed in the Windows Macromedia folder.   Anyway I checked the state and nothing has actually been changed  I still   have 10.0.45 installed and working for other browsers  while 10.1 beta3 is   still up and running in Chrome.   I know that an 10.1 RC has been released but this doesn't seem to be   related. Thanks for any explanation.       </pre>
