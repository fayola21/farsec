<title>Issue 24867 -   chromium -    Add support for &quot;experimental&quot; extension APIs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a way to add extension APIs that are not considered final    yet developers can still play with them.  This gives us more flexibility in   developing them  while not having to support them in an as-is format going   forward.    The current proposal is to create a chrome.experimental.* package.    Extensions that use this package would need to explicitly add &quot;experimental&quot;   to their permissions.  Extensions with this permission would only be   installable / loadable if Chrome is launched with --experimenal-extension-  apis.   </pre>
