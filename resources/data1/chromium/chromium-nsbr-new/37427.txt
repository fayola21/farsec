<title>Issue 37427 -   chromium -    Type a URL and hit enter - URL disappears while loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.0 dev    OS version               : 10.5.8      1. open a new tab  2. type a domain/URL in the location bar  3. hit enter      domain/URL remains until replaced by expanded version once page loads      domain/URL disappears and location bar is shown as empty  as if entering the domain/URL failed    This is not 100% reproducible at will  but happens to me very regularly (several times a day). It   seems to happen especially if it takes a while to resolve the URL  as happens while having network   connection. </pre>
