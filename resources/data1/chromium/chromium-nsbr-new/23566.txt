<title>Issue 23566 -   chromium -    Flash plugin: &quot;Go to the folder&quot; (command-shift-G) really screws things up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to Gmail.  Compose a message.  2. Click &quot;Attach a file&quot;.  3. In the &quot;Select file(s) to upload by mail.google.com&quot; dialog (which is a   weird name  but whatever)  press command-shift-g.  4. Type a path (like /) in the &quot;Go to the folder&quot; sheet and press return.      Expect: the file chooser should jump to the folder that you typed.  Observe: the file chooser disappears.  Actually  the plugin process just   winds up behind Chrome.  You can see this if you hide or minimize   Chrome  and you can resume interacting with the file chooser.    It seems that you can also cancel the &quot;Go to the folder&quot; sheet for the same   effect.    There are a couple of problems here:    1. Flash wants its file chooser to be an app-modal dialog  but since we're   running it out of process  it's not.  It's possible to click back on the Chrome   window to bring it to the foreground while Flash's dialog is up  and that's   not really right.  I guess this is a separate but related bug.  2. I guess we're taking the &quot;plugin window closing should reactivate the   browser window&quot; thing a little bit too far  and we're reactivating Chrome   when the sheet rolls up.      4.0.212.1 </pre>
