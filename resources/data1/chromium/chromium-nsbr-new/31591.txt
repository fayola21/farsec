<title>Issue 31591 -   chromium -    Inspector window attributes script injection ReadAV@NULL (b6cdefc0f00790bb24473e653cad4fad) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a security bug by itself  but requires <a title="Security: Inspector window attributes script injection"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31590">bug 31590</a> to trigger and that may be a security bug. To prevent that attack from leaking prematurely  I am marking this as restruct-view-securityteam.    This is a NULL pointer in V8 code  I am not sure if it has anything to do with the inspector; it may be possible to trigger this without the inspector.
