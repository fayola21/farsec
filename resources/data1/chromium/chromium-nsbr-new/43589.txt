Visit <a href="http://new.crbug.com">http://new.crbug.com</a> which has multiple text fields  2. Type some text in the summary field  3 Drag a word from summary and drop on description  this should work as expected (word is moved   between text fields)  4. Drag few words from description field to summary.  5. Do it again from and to summary field.    Expected result:  5.1 Dragging works all the time.
