<title>Issue 44715 -   chromium -    Status bar doesn't auto-relocate when it overlaps keyboard focus  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376) unknown  N/A to IE  FF  Safari      Repro steps:  1. Get a page with a link in the bottom left corner (e.g. attached).  2. Focus on the link via (TAB) keyboard        - The status bar should pop up  but in a position that does not overlap the   link/focus itself.  E.g. try hovering over the link via mouse and you will   see the status bar auto-relocate.        - The status bar pops up in the bottom left and covers the link/focus    obscuring it.      Please see attached image for visual comparison of behaviors. </pre>
