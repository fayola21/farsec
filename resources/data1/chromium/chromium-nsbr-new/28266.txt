<title>Issue 28266 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-step.html fails in Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Upstream change <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/51159">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/51159</a> implemented a new attribute on the   input element - 'step'. This is a new layout test. However it fails in a way that probably indicates a   real issue.    Kent Tamura is the original feature author  assigning to him for now. </pre>
