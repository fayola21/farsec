<title>Issue 26766 -   chromium -    I can get two or more Print dialogs to show up sequentially. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The delay before showing the Print dialog means that some moderately   ridiculous stuff is possible.    STEPS  1. Go to a complex page  like my Gmail inbox  or a crbug.com list of bugs.    You want it to be complex because that will cause a longer delay before   the Print dialog shows  giving you more time to accomplish something   stupid.  2. Press command-P twice quickly in succession.  3. A Print dialog will show up.  Cancel it or something.  Nobody really   prints  anyway (sorry  Stuart).    Then:    Observe: If you pressed command-P quickly enough in step 2  another   Print dialog  Expect: Hey  that's not right!    Now try command-P followed rapidly by command-S.  Or command-D.  Or   collect all three.  Or a bunch of other things. </pre>
