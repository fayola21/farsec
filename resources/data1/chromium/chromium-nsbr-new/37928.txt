<title>Issue 37928 -   chromium -    Async window.open() creates popup window instead of tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta (Linux / Mac)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.6: OK (Linux / Mac)           IE 7: ?           IE 8: ?    ***What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Execute window.open() within onclick event.  2. Execute window.open() asynchronously.  3. Observe that these do completely different things  even if popup blocking is disabled.    I have attached a demonstration.    ***What is the expected result?    Based on this documentation  window.open() should open a new tab:    <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html#newtab">http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html#newtab</a>    The behavior should be the same even when executed asynchronously  except that the action may be   blocked by the popup blocker.  In my opinion  the action should NOT be blocked by the popup blocker   because a new tab is not a popup.  It seems unlikely that any site would attempt to open an   advertisement in a new tab since this would prevent many users from even finding the site they were   trying to go to -- you might as well just serve a 302 redirect to the advertisement.  And indeed  I   have never observed a site doing this  even though it works in Firefox.    ***What happens instead?    When executed synchronously  window.open() opens a tab as expected.    When executed asynchronously  window.open() creates a new popup-style window with minimal browser   chrome (no navigation buttons  no tabs  etc.).  In fact  even if you use the third parameter to   window.open() to explicitly ask for browser chrome  Chrome does not give it any.    ***Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if possible.    Constructing and submitting a fake &lt;form&gt; element with target=_blank reliably opens a new tab whether   performed synchronously or asynchronously  with no interference from the popup blocker.    The attached file demonstrates both methods of opening a tab (window.open and fake form)    synchronously and asynchronously.    ***What do other browsers do?    Firefox behavior:  Always opens a new tab.  Popup blocker does NOT block asynchronous opens.  Fake   &lt;form&gt; method works the same as window.open().    Safari behavior:  Always opens a new window with full browser chrome.  Popup blocker blocks   asynchronous window.open()s but does not block asynchronous fake &lt;form&gt; submits. </pre>
