<title>Issue 43939 -   chromium -    SQLite temp directory should probably be in user profile. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Someone noted a problem where their system's /tmp/ was on a very small filesystem  and safe-  browsing was failing with SQLITE_IOERR because of a large update.  I can't think of any good reason   why the SQLite temp directory should be outside the user profile. </pre>
