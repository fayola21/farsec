<title>Issue 46203 -   chromium -    Layout isn't stable for absolutely positioned divs with a &quot;bottom&quot; percentage. Rounding error?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to any site with jQuery loaded.  2. Enter developer console and run this:    var body = $(document.body).empty();    var topBottom = (5/12 * 100) + '%';  var bottomTop = (7/12 * 100) + '%';    $('&lt;div&gt;').css({&quot;background-color&quot;:&quot;blue&quot;  &quot;top&quot;: &quot;25%&quot;  &quot;bottom&quot;: topBottom  &quot;left&quot;:&quot;20px&quot;  &quot;width&quot;: &quot;20px&quot;  &quot;position&quot;:&quot;absolute&quot;}).appendTo(body);  $('&lt;div&gt;').css({&quot;background-color&quot;:&quot;green&quot;  &quot;top&quot;: bottomTop  &quot;bottom&quot;: &quot;25%&quot;  &quot;left&quot;:&quot;30px&quot;  &quot;width&quot;: &quot;20px&quot;  &quot;position&quot;:&quot;absolute&quot;}).appendTo(body);        The blue bar's bottom and green bar's top don't overlap.        They overlap 1-2px as the window is resized. I would expect no overlap as in FF or IE8 or at most 1px of overlap and I would expect that overlap to remain stable as the browser is resized.      <b>Please provide
