<title>Issue 23531 -   chromium -    Too many processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1    Other browsers tested: Firefox        Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Opening Google Chrome      Just one process in the processes section of the task manager      3-5 processes taking place at once in the task manager. i do not know if   this is a bug or not  but i think it should be one process for every tab in   Google chrome. because i have a very very slow computer and everything   takes time to load. and with so many processes my computer crashes. 512 Mb   of RAM is what i have. </pre>
