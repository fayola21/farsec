<title>Issue 23286 -   chromium -    We log too much stuff in debug.log - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sync logs way too much stuff in debug.log. We should trim down the logging.   Users will not like this much logging.    (Started a new bug because previous bug had some private log information.) </pre>
