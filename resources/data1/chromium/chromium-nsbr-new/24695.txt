Navigate to a webpage with text and scroll so the text area is immediately   adjacent to browser UI  2. Move mouse directly from text to browser UI components  avoiding the   omnibar  3. Notice that the cursor stays an I-bar until the mouse moves over the web   area or the omnibar.    Google Chrome dev channel 4.0.221.8 </pre>
