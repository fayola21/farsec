<title>Issue 36675 -   chromium -    Feature request: JavaScript function bring focus to location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.0 (39552)    Hello  there are functions to change the location if you supply a URL but a method would be   helpful if you don't know the location the user wants to go to (basically the same function as meta-l   just in a function callable through JavaScript) and the you could take them straight to the location   bar.    Thanks   </pre>
