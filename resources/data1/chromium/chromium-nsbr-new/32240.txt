<title>Issue 32240 -   chromium -    Some files are not loading properly from the browser cache in Chrome4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 (Official Build 35163) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/">http://www.cricinfo.com/</a>           Safari 4: (untested)       Chrome 3: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Click the 'Video' tab in the page.  2. Notice that appx 10% attempts do not load correctly (9 times out of 10  it is okay).    The most common load errors are that it:  1) does not load the blue advert banner or  2) does not load the translation file (and the show name at startup is a  string resource ID rather than the translated text string).        - All files load into the flash player properly.      - Sometimes a file does not load correctly.     </pre>
