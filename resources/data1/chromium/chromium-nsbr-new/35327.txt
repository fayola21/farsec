<title>Issue 35327 -   chromium -    CookiesWindowControllerTest.RemoveButtonEnabled is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test has been flaky under Valgrind and turns the bot red since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38504">r38504</a>.   Under Mac Tests 10.5  it occasionally reports:      malloc: *** error for object 0x31e0468: Non-aligned pointer being freed    *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug    Attempts to reproduce locally were not successful. This code is likely   changing in the future  so it's marked flaky for now. </pre>
