<title>Issue 33194 -   chromium -    HISTORY and RED-X icons on toolbar did not import from Internet Explorer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Newly installed today (doesn't state version on it)    Issues:    (1) See attached GIFs - see how the HISTORY and RED-X icons on toolbar did   not import.   Please help.    (2) Both my Toolbar Quicklinks &amp; Bookmarks get rearranged into Chrome's   alpha order (or whatever)   ...rather than original preferred order as follows:  YahooMail Gmail  Weather  Google  etc).  Even when I manually rearrange them back into the sequence I like   ...yet every new web page I open  the quick-links are back into the non-  preferred order!  Please help.    (3) Browser does not auto-maximize (IE had the same bug  but there was a   fix for it).   What's the fix in chromium?    (4) If I'd want to Rename  for example  a quicklink on toolbar  I can't   right-click to do so  the way IE enabled.   Please help.    There maybe more issues  but so much for now. </pre>
