<title>Issue 39412 -   chromium -    Viewing cookies makes Chrome crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.306.2 dev and 5.0.307.1 dev      OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Chrome Preferences  2. Click on (Show cookies and website permissions)  3. Do anything in the cookie list  I believe both moving the mouse over   the search box  or clicking on the search box or result pane  or typing in   the search box will trigger the bug for me.    Now chrome starts using up all CPU time on two cores  and shows the   rainbow wheel indefinitely  becoming otherwise unresponsive. Have to use   Force quit and restart.    I have tried to remove the cookies DB manually  but I see the crash even   with an empty cookie file.    If I don't look at the cookies  everything seems to work fine. I just ran into   the problem because I had to reset a specific cookie today.   </pre>
