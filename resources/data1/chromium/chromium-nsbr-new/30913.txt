Activate a the &quot;show all windows&quot; expos��_��_ feature.  2. Open Chrome and have no other window open. Activate expos��_��_.   3. The Chrome window is too small  as if there was a second window.      But none is visible?  4. However if you take to fingers (like a right click on the macbooks) and   swipe them over the empty area  you see the title of a second (hidden)   window. (See attached file)      Chrome window not bigger than other &quot;single window&quot; expose cases.       Chrome window too small + hidden/invisible second window.    </pre>
