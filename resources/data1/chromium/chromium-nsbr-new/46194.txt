<title>Issue 46194 -   chromium -    Chrome Mixture 2 pages on screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.70  URLs (if applicable) : Any          Firefox 3.x: Ok           IE 7: Ok           IE 8: Ok      1. Open any page (example gmail.com )  2. Write in Adress Bar a new location (google.com)   3. Then resize &lt;to a bigger one&gt; the browser window before the new page get loaded &lt;someone say chrome it's faster than lighting  but supermans can get it :wink: &gt;    I tried it with Windows XP / 7. In both O.S. you can get the same bug    Chrome mixture 2 pages when you change the address in the address bar and immediately resize the browser window before it loads the new page. This happens with any page. In the example attached I have tested with gmail  then I went to google.com while resizing the browser window with the result of the two pages on screen. Once this happens if you change tab and return to it  the mixed page is updated with the new tab.     </pre>
