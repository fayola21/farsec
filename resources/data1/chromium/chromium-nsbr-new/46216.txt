<title>Issue 46216 -   chromium -    AutoFill: Set as default profile is limited to profiles listed either first or second - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REPRO STEPS  1. In Options -&gt; Personal Stuff -&gt; Form AutoFill -&gt; [Show AutoFill profiles] and create a few profiles for either address data or credit card;  2. Open the third profile and try to check the 'Set as default' checkbox.    ACTUAL RESULTS  Unable to do so beyond the second profile.    EXPECTED RESULTS  Expected that any profile should be able to be defined as default. Especially that profiles cannot be reordered. </pre>
