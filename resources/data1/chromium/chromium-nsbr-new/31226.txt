<title>Issue 31226 -   chromium -    Scrolling while loading a page with lots of large resources is slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/topdraw/wiki/Gallery">http://code.google.com/p/topdraw/wiki/Gallery</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works (fast scrolling)      1. Open <a href="http://code.google.com/p/topdraw/wiki/Gallery">http://code.google.com/p/topdraw/wiki/Gallery</a>  2. Scroll down while the page loads  either using the trackpad or the   scrollbar        Scrolling should be reasonably smooth.        Scrolling pauses for seconds  as if the renderer process would decode   images on its ipc thread.    I don't know if this happens on win/linux too. </pre>
