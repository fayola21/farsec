<title>Issue 26365 -   chromium -    We need to remove CleanUp() from base::Thread and come up with another mechanism to do cleanup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to remove CleanUp() from base::Thread and come up with another   mechanism to do cleanup.  The problem is that Stop is called implicitly from   the destructor of Thread.  So  if a subclass overrides CleanUp() but doesn't   call Stop()  the vtable is torn down before the call is made.  And thus the   subclass's CleanUp is NOT called.  We've hit this a couple times  so it's   time to make it impossible to screw this up again. </pre>
