<title>Issue 41693 -   chromium -    Chrome reverts back to the original space when it exits fullscreen mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.9 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44625">r44625</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.6    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Change Chrome's space when its in Fullscreen mode.  2. Now go to the space where Chrome's running in Fullscreen mode and disable fullscreen.    Expected:  Chrome should come back to normal state but remain in the same space.    Actual:  Chrome jumps back to the space it was in before it was put in Fullscreen Mode.   </pre>
