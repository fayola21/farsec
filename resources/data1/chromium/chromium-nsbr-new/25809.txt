<title>Issue 25809 -   chromium -    Chrome acts strangely after running for a while - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.8    OS version               : 10.5.8      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't tried it.      1. Use the browser for a few days  using multiple tabs and windows and   visiting many sites.  2. After a while the browser will stop working (but not crash).  For   example  it may not allow text to be entered anywhere  or it may prevent   new tabs and windows from being opened (but existing windows work ok).        It should continue to allow text entry and opening new tabs and windows.        It fails in strange ways.   </pre>
