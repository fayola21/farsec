<title>Issue 29156 -   chromium -    Caching bad files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33    So I was downloadings Itunes from apple. The file was downloading  and the   internet connection was cut off for a few seconds. Chrome for some reason   considered the file finished  and attempted to open. It failed to open   obviously. I deleted the file  and attempted to redownload. Chrome istead   gave back a cahced copy of the half download itunes set file. It should have   known the file did not finish downloading properly and should have allowed me   to download instead of giving me a cache copy of a bad file. </pre>
