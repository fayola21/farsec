<title>Issue 43337 -   chromium -    Chrome autoupdate borks flash player. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS Version: OS X 10.5.8  Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta    Chrome seems to have updated my flash plugin. (I know  you'll claim it's &quot;by design&quot;) A few issues   here.    1) It installed an unreleased version of Flash. (10 1 53 22). The beta 10.1 Flash releases have not   been good enough to run  I've tried. Please don't automatically install an unreleased version of   third party software on my machine without asking. You're just not being a good citizen when   you do things like that.    2) It replaced my debug player with a NON-debug player. Yesterday I was able to debug in   chrome  today I'm not.     Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.    </pre>
