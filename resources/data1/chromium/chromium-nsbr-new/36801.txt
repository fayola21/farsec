<title>Issue 36801 -   chromium -    POST downloads (especially to the same page) do not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.workloop.com/test.aspx">http://www.workloop.com/test.aspx</a>    - It's a page with a single button but several hidden form fields.  2. Click the button.        I didn't expect to get the &quot;Do you want Chromium to save this information?&quot;   toast  but I do.  The toast has these two buttons: &quot;Set up Autofill...&quot; and   &quot;Nope&quot;.   </pre>
