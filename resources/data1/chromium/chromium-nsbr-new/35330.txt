<title>Issue 35330 -   chromium -    Extensions leak memory when clicked and when updating icon  badge  or popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install an extension that that has a background page  and preferably also periodic'ly updates its toolbar icon  the badge on its toolbar icon  and/or   popup.    Sample extensions:  --While timer/updates running  and when clicked  Countdown - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gjpgobmdmbpekdmokakiajlcdljldhbm">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gjpgobmdmbpekdmokakiajlcdljldhbm</a>  ChromoDoro - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/edhkjecdcakijjmlelnjjiohjmlaikhb">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/edhkjecdcakijjmlelnjjiohjmlaikhb</a>  Digital Clock - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ojemaikiokmokgkaelkkmdakknenlipb">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ojemaikiokmokgkaelkkmdakknenlipb</a>  Google Alerter - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ikefielkhonlbnjjfhcjmepanaeajkbh">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ikefielkhonlbnjjfhcjmepanaeajkbh</a>  --When clicked (no timer present)  Rikaikun - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp</a>    2. Open Chrome's task manager (Shift-Esc)    3. Watch RAM allocation for the extension increase. Speed of increase is proportional to the frequency of updating the icon  badge  or popup. It occurs   regardless of whether the popup is currently displayed. If the extension has no periodic updates  but has a background page  RAM use will only increase   each time the toolbar icon is clicked. (Extensions that update periodic'ly will also use more RAM each time their icons are clicked.)      In an extension that uses only a finite number of different icons  badges  and/or popup values  the memory use should not increase after all resources are   loaded.      Memory use increases indefinitely until the extension is disabled  or until Chrome closes  or until the system faults due to lack of free memory.    <b>Please provide
