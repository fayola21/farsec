<title>Issue 38926 -   chromium -    Strange reports from __NSThread__main__ under TSan/Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The reports are flaky (i.e. show up once in a few runs) and look strange.    I've added &quot;fun_r:*__NSThread__main__*&quot; locally and did manual run.  Attached is the report from the bot on net_unittests --gtest_filter=&quot;*Directory*&quot;  Here are some bits of the report:  INFO: ignoring all accesses below the function '__NSThread__main__' (0x23421870)  ....  WARNING: T1 ended while the 'ignore reads' bit is set   Last ignore call was here:   NO STACK TRACE    WARNING: T1 ended while the 'ignore writes' bit is set   Last ignore call was here:   NO STACK TRACE    WARNING: T2 ended while the 'ignore reads' bit is set   Last ignore call was here:   NO STACK TRACE    WARNING: T2 ended while the 'ignore writes' bit is set   Last ignore call was here:   NO STACK TRACE    &lt;and then reports under __NSThread__main__ from T3 with T1 and T2&gt;    This may be related to the new fun_r optimization code introduced in TSan recently </pre>
