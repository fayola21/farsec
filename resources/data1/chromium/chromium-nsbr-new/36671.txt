<title>Issue 36671 -   chromium -    content_scripts can't be loaded in an extension iframe loaded document. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using 5.0.322.2 dev    I defined a content_script in my manifest file for a given page. It just  loads a css file.    It works fine when I open the given page in a tab  as expected.    But if I open the given page in an iframe created in a tab opened by my  extension  content_script does nothing...    And  that makes me sad.    Thanks. </pre>
