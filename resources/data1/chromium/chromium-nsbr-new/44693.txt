<title>Issue 44693 -   chromium -    SWF Files which include child SWF files dynamically will report the wrong referrer when they load external URLs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Create an SWF (parent.swf)  file that will load a second SWF file dynamically (child.swf)  2. Within child.swf load an external URL (webpage.php)   3. Within webpage.php  log the referrer  4. Load parent.swf in Chrome  and note the referrer logged in webpage.php  it will be parent.swf        Load parent.swf in the browser and note the referrer logged  it should be child.swf      In chrome  the referrer is reported as parent.swf      Background  At Armor Games we use a flash file to inject game services into flash based games. Developers   can simply include our SWF at runtime which will enable features like high scores. We noticed that   chrome browsers were having an issue interactive with our services which we implement via a   Zend_Amf (a PHP based AMF server). We finally realized that it has to do with our session   handling; specifically the referrer checks on our sessions. Chrome browsers were being failed in   this check while other browsers were not. It turns out chrome was returning a different referrer   than all other browsers we are working with.   </pre>
