<title>Issue 45181 -   chromium -    class LiveSyncTest overrides SetUp()  but not TearDown() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build and run the sync integration tests.    What is the expected output?   class LiveSyncTest overrides the SetUp() method in class  InProcessBrowserTest where it starts an instance of the python sync test  server. It should also override the TearDown() method in which the test  server must be stopped.    What do you see instead?  There is no corresponding override for TearDown().   </pre>
