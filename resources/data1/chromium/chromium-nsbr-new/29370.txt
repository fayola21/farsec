<title>Issue 29370 -   chromium -    Select+copy from Inspect Element screen should be more intuitive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12    Previously reported in <a title="Inspect Element screen should allow select+copy" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28903"> issue 28903 </a>.      1. Right click on this page and click Inspect Element.  2. Find an element with some text  and try to select it.  3. Fail.  4. Double-click the element  5. Succeed in selecting within a single attribute  but not across two   attributes.      I should be able to select text without double-clicking. Firefox  for   example  allows me to view a selection's source as plain text. Very few   other apps require a double-click before selection.      I can copy whole elements without double-clicking  but that's not fine-  grained enough. </pre>
