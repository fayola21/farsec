<title>Issue 31508 -   chromium -    Full download URL of downloads not always visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. Download a file that has a long download URL (e.g.  any file from   CodePlex)  2. Open the Downloads tab (Ctrl + J)  3. Observe the download URL      The full download URL should be visible      The download url gets truncated with an ellipsis. This prevents copying of   the download URL. Either the entire download URL should be kept visible  or   a context menu option to copy the URL to clipboard should be provided. I   believe that was the route Chrome 1.x took (with a separate context menu   for the listed downloads).   </pre>
