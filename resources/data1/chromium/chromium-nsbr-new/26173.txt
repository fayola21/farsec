<title>Issue 26173 -   chromium -    Linux about box is ugly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The about box has:    - bold font face - there should be no bold anywhere in this dialog  - font size for about text is too small. should be standard dialog text font   size.  - spacing is weird below and above the about text. Compare to Windows or Mac   for better spacing examples.    Throwing to estade since erg is helping with Mac right now. </pre>
