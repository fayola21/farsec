<title>Issue 26725 -   chromium -    Windows Auto-Hide start-bar hidden when chrome is maximized. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 3.0.195.27    Windows 7 &amp; XP  have been tested to have this issue      1. Autohide the windows start-bar  2. Maximize Chrome to full screen (NOT F11 fullscreen  just maximized)  3. Move mouse to bottom of window to show hidden start bar.      The windows start bar (bottom task bar with the start button and clock) is   supposed to expand upward from a hidden state.      The start bar never expands (it expands behind chrome so you can't see it)    if i un-maximize or move chrome to another monitor  it will show the start   bar. </pre>
