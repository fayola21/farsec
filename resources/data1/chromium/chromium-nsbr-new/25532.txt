<title>Issue 25532 -   chromium -    Mac: quitting doesn't work from full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to full screen mode (Cmd-Shift-F).  2. Try to quit (Cmd-Q).      I evidently expect Chrome/Chromium to quit. Instead  I get an Aw  Snap!   page. Then  after leaving full screen mode (Cmd-Shift-F again)  quit still   doesn't work.    This was on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29758">r29758</a> (off the trunk; local debug build) on 10.5.8. </pre>
