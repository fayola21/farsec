<title>Issue 29102 -   chromium -    System becomes unresponsive and mouse pointer lags during session restore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11 (Official Build 32790)  OS Version           : Windows 7 RTM (x86 | x64)      1. Set the &quot;reopen pages that were open last&quot; option.  2. Open 20 tabs in Chrome (duplicating a few different tabs is sufficient).  3. Close Chrome.  4. Start Chrome.  5. System becomes almost completely unresponsive and mouse pointer lags   behind input; this lasts for the duration of session restore (~30 seconds).    I have done considerable testing and fiddling to try and eliminate or   identify the problem's cause. Here are my observations:    - Affects Windows 7 RTM x86 and x64 versions exclusively    - Does NOT affect Windows Server 2008 x86 or Windows XP x86 on the same   hardware    - Passing --disable-javascript on the command line almost completely   ameliorates the issue (I still see about 1/2 second of unresponsiveness   during the session restore  but nothing like the 30 seconds seen with JS   on).    - While problem is occurring  my CPU usage is at 100% constantly (dual core   system  both cores maxed out).    - The following command line arguments have no effect on the issue:  --  single-process  --process-per-site  --process-per-tab  --in-process-  plugins  --nosandbox  --dns-prefetch-disable  --disable-hang-monitor    - Launching Chrome with single-core CPU affinity or BelowNormal base   priority does not help (and actually exacerbate the problem).    - Another user who is running Windows 7 build 7100 (pre-RTM) reports that   uninstalling Windows Update KB971961 cured the problem. This update is not   available to uninstall from Windows 7 RTM versions  presumably because it's   integrated.    - Disabling all Aero/theming functionality has no effect.    - The problem is not related to conflicts from other 3rd-party software. To   confirm this  I did a clean install of both Win 7 RTM x86 and x64 versions    then immediately installed Chrome and performed the steps to reproduce.   Both OS versions exhibit the problem behavior. Installing all available   drivers and Windows Updates has no effect. Killing every possible app and   all Windows services which wouldn't break the OS had no effect.     - A large number of other users have been reporting what may be the same   problem here: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=0d34429a369f2a20&amp;hl=en . They all seem to be running into the problem   on Windows 7 exclusively. The reports also indicate that the problem only   afflicts certain hardware configurations.      I've attached the output of about:histograms and about:net-internals   shortly after session restore completed  in case these reveal anything of   use.    If you'd like me to run any specific tests or Chrome versions let me know. </pre>
