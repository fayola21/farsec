<title>Issue 38772 -   chromium -    aero peek preview doesn't change the tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Developer Build 42189)      1. open 2 or more tabs  2. hover over the aero peek preview's  3. the preview changes but the active tab is always the last activated tab   and not the tab you are over      i think it should be like in FF and you should see the right activated tab   but if you don't click on the preview the last activated tab shouldn't change   (like it is in FF) </pre>
