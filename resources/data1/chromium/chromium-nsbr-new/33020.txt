<title>Issue 33020 -   chromium -    &quot;Reopen pages that were open last&quot; did not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.5.8        1. Open tabs  2. Quit Chrome  3. Restart Chrome        Previously open tabs reopen        Default home page  and no other tabs.    I am pretty sure I cleanly quit Chrome  and didn't use force quit.  Force  quitting might explain the issue  but I'd expect it to behave the same way  regardless of the method used to quit Chrome. </pre>
