<title>Issue 27689 -   chromium -    Chrome should save to temp filename before renaming to desired filename - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0 Mac OS X      1. Right-click and save-as a file.    It proceeds to write out a file using the filename. This can be very confusing if   the download is interrupted  since in the Finder I appear to have a completed   file  when it fact might actually be corrupt or half-completed.    Like Safari or Firefox  Chrome should write out to a temporary file  and then   rename it to the desired filename at the very end (being prepared to deal with   filename conflicts if something came into existence in the meantime.) </pre>
