<title>Issue 39182 -   chromium -    Use Mac specific strings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From b/2537015    Issue:  Chrome Mac frequently uses the same en-US source strings as Windows.   However  Mac translations are different than Windows for menu items  so we   need to create some new Mac-specific message strings.     Solution:  1. Create new strings for the affected message IDs (listed in the trix)    and note in the description that these are Mac-specific and require   consistency with Mac terminology.  2. Determine if other strings need to be recreated too for Mac-specific   translation. The strings listed in the bugs are Mac menu items. Do we have   an easy way to determine all of the strings that are menu items?  3. Have the Chrome Mac build pull in these new translations instead of the   current Windows strings. </pre>
