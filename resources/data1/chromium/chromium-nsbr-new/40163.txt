<title>Issue 40163 -   chromium -    Need to display scheme/port on origins in geolocation bubble when the same hostname has multiple different settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When creating the omnibox bubble for geolocation  we decided to just display   bare hosts  with no schemes or ports  because it didn't really matter if the   setting was for http or https  or even if the same setting was set for both.    There's one exception  though  which is the (admittedly unlikely) case where   the same hostname has different settings on different schemes or ports.  In   this case the user will see the same name in the allowed and blocked lists    which is confusing.  In this case  we should add the scheme or port to the   hostname that differs from the &quot;default&quot; (http/80). </pre>
