<title>Issue 26839 -   chromium -    Navigation fails in tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure how to repro  but while debugging  I reached a point where I could   not navigate anymore from the NTP: entering a URL in the location bar or   clicking an entry in the NTP would not trigger a navigation.    It appeared somehow the current RenderViewHost is_waiting_for_unload_ack_ was   true even though no unload handlers were pending.  Since before we start a cross-navigation we'll require the unload handler to   run  then the RenderViewHostManager would be stuck waiting for the unload ack   to come before resuming the new navigation. </pre>
