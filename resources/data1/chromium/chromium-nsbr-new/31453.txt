<title>Issue 31453 -   chromium -    Crash during move of detached tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    OS version               : 10.6.2      I visited a website in a new tab. Somehow the tab became detached (I didn't   intentially click-drag it). Moving the mouse around the screen the new tab   followed. I couldn't release either by clicking or dragging back to the main   window. Chrome eventually crashed taking  the whole browsing session with   it.    Mac OS X crash report attached. </pre>
