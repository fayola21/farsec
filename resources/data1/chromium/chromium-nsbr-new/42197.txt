<title>Issue 42197 -   chromium -    Silly ffmpeg bug breaks decode of valid Theora videos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just committed a fix for a rather silly bug in ffmpeg's theora decoder that broke decode of some   videos that use huffman codes longer than 16 bits.    Patch (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=22931">r22931</a>) is attached  it should apply cleanly to chrome's version of ffmpeg.
