<title>Issue 38336 -   chromium -    Get QuickTime working under Core Animation drawing model - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> QuickTime doesn't like our fledgling Core Animation support for as-yet-unknown reasons; it just   never displays video.    For now  so that we can enable Core Animation in general  I'm going to hard-code our negotiation   to tell QuickTime that CA isn't supported. </pre>
