<title>Issue 44935 -   chromium -    Task Manager: memory column too narrow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome/5.0.375.55 beta      1. Open Task Manager  2. Notice the column for memory is slightly too narrow and shows ...      The default view shouldn't need to show ...    Workaround: Really any kind of change to columns (add one  remove one    double click between two columns) fixes the problem.    It might be as easy as adding a call to TableView::ResetColumnSizes()   somewhere in TaskManagerView::Init()    src/chrome/browser/views/task_manager_view.cc    src/views/controls/table/table_view.cc      Other bugs about task manager columns: <a title="Task manager column settings not persistent"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29950">issue 29950</a>  and <a title="some task manager memory fields don't work for extensions"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29307">issue 29307</a> </pre>
