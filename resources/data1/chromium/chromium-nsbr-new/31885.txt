<title>Issue 31885 -   chromium -    Get more extensions link should be on top - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.294.0 (Developer Build 35869)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/      1. You want to install a new extension and already have a number installed  2. Go to the extension page  3. Depending on screen resolution and browser window size  if you have more   than ~10 extensions installed  you will need to scroll down to find the   &quot;Get more extensions...&quot; link      =&gt; The link to the extensions gallery should be visible directly after   going to the extensions page      =&gt; you may need to scroll to find the relatively small link      There is a huge unused space in the header of the extensions page  which   could easily hold the link there instead of the bottom line </pre>
