<title>Issue 36920 -   chromium -    chromeos valgrind test failure due to timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromeos valgrind test fails once a while due to timeout.    The log says it finished all tests  but it does not seem to exit.   This is not happening on linux  so views/chromeos specific component  may be hanging on exit. Happened to shard 4 this time.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20U">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20U</a>  I%20(valgrind)(4)/builds/1680/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio </pre>
