<title>Issue 42632 -   chromium -    Page loading gets stucked in the middle sometimes (often) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open browser and type some address (happened with 911tabs.com almost everytime)  2. wait for the page to load  3. keep waiting..      Fully loaded page      Part of the page gets immediately rendered  but after that  the throbber on tab keeps spinning like   the loading continues  but the page is unresponsive  scrolling doesn't work  even the cursor   doesn't change when hovering over links. The page seems to be loading for some time  but then   the popup informing that it's taking too long to load shows offering to kill that loading. Sometimes   the page loads ok  but after clicking on some inner-site link  it starts loading and gets stucked   again (this happens on facebook.com for example)    Please provide
