<title>Issue 35758 -   chromium -    Google Gears Downloaded Virus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Google Chrome	5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev  WebKit		533.1  V8		2.1.0.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)  		AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML  like Gecko)  		Chrome/5.0.322.2 Safari/533.1    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/*">http://mail.google.com/mail/*</a>    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Set your Gmail to operate offline  2. Complete sync  3. Scan your hard disk for viruses      No viruses      Viruses are found  if someone had emailed a virus to your Gmail account.    Somehow Gears was able to get around my virus scanner and allowed 3 viruses   to be hosted on my computer.  Gears should be alerting the virus scanner to   all downloaded files so they can be scanned by the anti-virus program.    The log of the viruses which were found are below  but it could be any   kinds of viruses:  * C:UsersUSERNAMEAppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultPlugin   DataGoogle   Gearsmail.google.comhttps_443GoogleMail@nathanbrauer.com[10]#localserver  41673406924785862image[11835] �_ ZIP �_ image.exe -   Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AN trojan - was a part of the deleted   object  * C:UsersUSERNAMEAppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultPlugin   DataGoogle   Gearsmail.google.comhttps_443GoogleMail@nathanbrauer.com[10]#localserver  41673406924785862ecard[12332] �_ ZIP �_ ecard.exe -   Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AN trojan - was a part of the deleted   object  * C:UsersUSERNAMEAppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultPlugin   DataGoogle   Gearsmail.google.comhttps_443GoogleMail@nathanbrauer.com[10]#localserver  416734069247858ecard[12166] �_ ZIP �_ ecard.exe -   Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AN trojan - was a part of the deleted   object </pre>
