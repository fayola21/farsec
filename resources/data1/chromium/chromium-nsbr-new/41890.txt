<title>Issue 41890 -   chromium -    No way to bypass the security warning concerning a revoked SSL certificate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): Google Chrome	5.0.342.9   (Official Build 43360) beta  WebKit	533.2  V8	2.1.2.7  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.9 Safari/533.2  Command Line	 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome    Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bits  Window manager: metacity  URLs (if relevant): <a href="https://alam1.aclibrary.org/">https://alam1.aclibrary.org/</a>  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Does not even register an expired certificate.  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): N/A      1. Go to the URL in question    I understand the need to make users aware of security issues such as   expired SSL certificate  but please allow us to proceed anyways if we so   choose. (Perhaps a Proceed Anyways button) In this case  the most anyone   could steal would be my library card number and so I'm willing to take that   risk. </pre>
