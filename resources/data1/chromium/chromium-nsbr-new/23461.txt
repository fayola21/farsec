<title>Issue 23461 -   chromium -    infobars don't handle skinny windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. type something short into the url bar that is an corp host name  2. hit enter  3. once the info bar shows up for &quot;did you mean http://[theName]/ make the   window very skinny    the text can get clipped.  this is true with the other infobar types.    the question is: should we word wrap the text in the given space and make   the info bar taller so we always fit the text? </pre>
