<title>Issue 29571 -   chromium -    tapuz.co.il: Problems opening user account - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to chat.tapuz.co.il  2. Create a new account by clicking on ___��__��__��__��_ _��__��__��__��__��_ -&gt; _��__��__��__��__��_ _��__��____��___ _��__��__��__��__��_  3. in _��__��__��_ _��__��_ ___��__��____��_ enter a username that already exists e.g. &quot;avi&quot;.  4. Hit the &quot;tab&quot; key twice to navigate to another field.    Expected results:  A Window should open with a list of alternate usernames you can click on.    What actually happens:  The whole window is grayed out and nothing is clickable - see screenshot.    If you try this a few times you can get the window with the alternate   usernames to be active but most of the times I tried it wasn't.    Browsers tested:  Chrome/Mac: FAIL </pre>
