<title>Issue 35054 -   chromium -    Bounce of translated page by infobars is undesirable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to a page that requires translation.  2. Accept the translation.  3. Notice the infobar disappears (slides up)  4. Translation happens (takes maybe 1 second)  5. Notice a new infobar appears showing that the page was translated   (slides down).    This creates a &quot;bounce&quot; every translated page... the infobar appears    disappears then reappears. Also the translation isn't instantaneous so   there is a brief period where nothing seems to have happened.    Suggestion: Instead of removing the infobar while translation is performed    keep it around and show a spinner at the left and the text:   &quot;Translating...&quot; next to it:    | @ Translating...                                    |    This would remove the bounce. </pre>
