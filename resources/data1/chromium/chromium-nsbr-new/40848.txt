<title>Issue 40848 -   chromium -    finalize origin override policy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are two changes we need to make to the policy before we can enable web   origins:  (1) For gallery downloads  require the presence of an origin and only trust   that.  (2) For non-gallery downloads  require the absence of an origin  and force   the origin to be the same as the download URL.   </pre>
