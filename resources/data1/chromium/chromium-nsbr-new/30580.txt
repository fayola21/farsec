<title>Issue 30580 -   chromium -    dragging text can leave webkit in an unusable state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.22 (Official Build 33427)    Steps to reproduce:  1. Highlight some text in a Gmail message.  2. Move the mouse pointer slowly across the text  clicking the first button   quickly as you go.    WebKit gets confused at some point (I'm able to trigger this within a few   seconds in Gmail but haven't seen it in e.g. Google News) and stops   accepting any further keyboard or mouse input events.  Clicking Chrome's   reload button works  but input appears to be permanently broken in the   renderer in question.    I've only tried this on Linux  but I'm curious whether it also occurs on   other platforms.  (Does anyone actually intentionally use this &quot;drag   highlighted text&quot; feature?  Wish we could just get rid of it.)    I ran across this while trying to repro some other broken behavior that I   trigger accidentally pretty often  where WebKit gets stuck in a mouse drag.    The WebKit and/or GTK pointer-grabbing code that's used to drag text   probably has races. </pre>
