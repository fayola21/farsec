<title>Issue 33271 -   chromium -    Jumping to source code in the debugger from a CPU profile entry only works correctly when source script is already opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Collect a CPU profile from a page with multiple source code files (e.g. V8   benchmark)  2. Click on the link to the source code (on the right of function entries in CPU   profile view)  3. Having that source code file hasn't been opened already in the debugger    observe that the source line is first highlighted  then hidden because source   file has been re-opened by the debugger.  4. After returning to Profiles panel and clicking the same link  jumping to   source code works OK. </pre>
