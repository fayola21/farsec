<title>Issue 45369 -   chromium -    Port SSLClientSocketNSS to use Mac OS X CDSA/CSSM for SSL client authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the Mac version of <a title="Port SSLClientSocketNSS to use Windows CryptoAPI for SSL client authentication"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37560">issue 37560</a>.    Since we want to support client certificates and smart cards using  Mac OS X CDSA/CSSM  the remaining work is to port SSLClientSocketNSS  to use Mac OS X CDSA/CSSM instead of NSS for SSL client authentication.  This may require modifying NSS's SSL library. </pre>
