<title>Issue 46197 -   chromium -    BadDrawable when quickly opening/closing windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Disclaimer: the scenario I wrote is contrived  but I am able to crash the entire browser not just a renderer.  (See the attached htmls).    To reproduce easily:  google-chrome <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~evannier/chrome/window.html">http://www.corp.google.com/~evannier/chrome/window.html</a>  (or replace the path with the location where you placed your html).  Then  keep pressing the 'Go' button. After a few tries  the entire browser will crash:    The program 'google-chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.   (Details: serial 28 error_code 3 request_code 15 minor_code 0)   (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;    that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.    To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)    The JS code is definitely bad since it attempts to close itself  and then try to open a popup.    I did not dig as to whether this can be exploited in any manner to gain access to anything in the browser.    I am running 6.0.422.0 (Official Build 48573) dev on Linux.   </pre>
