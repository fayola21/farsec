<title>Issue 45344 -   chromium -    Policy names need to agree cross-platform - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the Windows code uses upper-case  (see configuration_policy_provider_win.cc):    &quot;Homepage&quot;  &quot;HomepageIsNewTabPage&quot;  &quot;CookiesMode&quot;    while the Linux code (configuration_policy_provider.cc) uses:    &quot;homepage&quot;  &quot;homepage_is_newtabpage&quot;  &quot;cookies_enabled&quot;    We need to get them to agree  and we need to make that happen fast before  anyone starts writing policies.    This is a good idea too so that the same policies work on all platforms.   </pre>
