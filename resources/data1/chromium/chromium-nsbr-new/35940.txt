<title>Issue 35940 -   chromium -    Extension popup remains on screen even if extension process is killed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev  Mac OS X 10.5.8  URLs (if applicable) : (not applicable)      1. Find a rogue child process - triggering <a title="Regression: Glitchy &quot;vibrating&quot; extension popup behavior" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31970"> Issue 31970 </a> would cause the RSS   extension process to use CPU a lot  after a popup is shown  2. Start Task Manager  3. Kill the RSS Extension process      Once the extension is killed  the extension popup should disappear.      The popup still remains on screen (its &quot;glitchy&quot; contents disappears).    I guess the container popup does not &quot;belong&quot; to the extension - it should   still get closed on process kill (since there's no apparent way of closing it).    This issue was discovered on Mac OS X  but might also appear on other   operating systems. </pre>
