<title>Issue 26160 -   chromium -    Think about which metrics are useful to measure to learn if people out there actually care about the single-click behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Obvious metrics:    *) How often does &quot;click and edit (and navigate)&quot; happen  *) How often does &quot;click to navigate (i.e. edit everything)&quot; happen    These could be used for comparison  but they might be skewed because   people who use cmd-L are probably pretty savvy.  *) How often does cmd-L type navigate happen?  *) cmd-L edit navigate?    Different between normal mode and &quot;search&quot; mode?    Do count navigates on a new tab separately (maybe most people always   open a new tab with an empty omnibox anyway?). </pre>
