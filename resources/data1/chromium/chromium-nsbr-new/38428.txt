<title>Issue 38428 -   chromium -    Internet Explorer 9 Test Drive uses 100% of one CPU and only achieves 1/2 fps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/</a> especially <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/01FlyingImages/Default.html">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/01FlyingImages/Default.html</a>             Safari 4: ~3fps fail (but better than chrome? slightly ^_^)    Firefox 3.5.7: ~35fps Pass           IE 7: ~3fps Fail           IE 8: ~3fps Fail           IE 9 testdrive: ~55 fps Passes a lot better than others. Still   fails acid 3 test though ;-)      1. Visit address  2. Observe lack of fps with high CPU usage      High fps  at least on a par with IE 9!!      Chrome gets bullied by the new kid at school :-( </pre>
