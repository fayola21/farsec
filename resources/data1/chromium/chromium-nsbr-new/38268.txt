<title>Issue 38268 -   chromium -    Mac: bookmark menus allow unfettered keyboard input while displayed ... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ... and don't close upon keyboard input.    This manifests itself in various existing bugs (with a bookmark menu displaying  pressing Cmd-  Shift-B  or Cmd-Shift-F  ... others?). Here's another example:    With a bookmark menu displaying  you can press Cmd-L to focus the Omnibox  type some stuff    select (using the arrow keys) stuff in the dropdown  press enter to navigate  etc.    There are two possible fixes (broadly speaking):  (1) Modify the event hook to also look for key events and do the right thing. This may be tricky   to get entirely right  given the tricky things we do with key events. My hunch is that it may be   tricky in other ways as well  and wouldn't solve other &quot;modality&quot; issues which (2) might.  (2) Make the bookmark menus run a nested event loop (or possibly multiply-nested loops    depending on the semantics desired). This is the standard solution for this sort of thing  and   would also let us get rid of the app-level event hook. (It's what's done by standard menus  for   example.) It may be nontrivial to write a nested event loop which handles everything we need to   handle. </pre>
