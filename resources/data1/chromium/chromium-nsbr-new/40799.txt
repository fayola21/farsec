<title>Issue 40799 -   chromium -    --enable-login-images suppresses dialogs spawned by network picker on login screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. On a chromium OS device set up with the ToT chrome and login package    log in once.  2. Reboot  3. Enjoy the whizzy login UI  then select a secure wireless network from   the network picker menu.    What is the expected output?  The dialog should come up and allow me to provide creds that can be used to   connect to my network.    What do you see instead?  Instead of seeing the dialog into which you need to type the password  it   seems like the box is there but you can't see it.       </pre>
