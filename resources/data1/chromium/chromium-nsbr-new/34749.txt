<title>Issue 34749 -   chromium -    Implement client sending HELLO Message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On FlipSession establishment we should send a HELLO message.  Initially  we   can use 0 values for bandwidth and RTT.    Make sure that we don't do two writes to the socket; tee up the frame to be   sent in the same Write() call that we send the first request. </pre>
