<title>Issue 33113 -   chromium -    Need better chevron for the bookmarks bar and the browser actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both the bookmarks bar and the browser actions container use the chevron   (IDR_BOOKMARK_BAR_CHEVRONS) for the overflow menu.    The problem with it is that it is very dark (completely black?)  which is a   problem for dark background (themes) and clashes with the Page and Wrench   menu button colors (when used in the Browser Actions container).    Glen said he'd provide better ones. </pre>
