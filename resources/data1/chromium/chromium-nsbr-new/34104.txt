<title>Issue 34104 -   chromium -    Opening HTML file from Finder gives error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an html file from Finder (using Command-O)  2. Get following error dialogue:   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/4322093881/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/4322093881/</a>    The document &quot;i18nchanges.html&quot; could not be opened. Chrome cannot open   files in &quot;HTML Document&quot; format.    Somewhat odd for a web browser.    (Dragging the file into Chrome does work.) </pre>
