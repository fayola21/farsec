<title>Issue 29071 -   chromium -    Functions called in event handlers not being called for events synthesized in content scripts. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Load an HTML page containing the following:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;  &lt;script&gt;function changePage() { window.location = 'http://example.com'; }  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;form&gt;  &lt;input onclick=&quot;changePage();&quot;&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    From a content script  we synthesize an event on the DOM using   &quot;element.createEvent&quot; and &quot;dispatchEvent&quot;. The &quot;onclick&quot; handler fires  but   the content script indicates that &quot;changePage&quot; is not defined.      One of two things: less desirably  the &quot;onclick&quot; handler doesn't fire at   all  or (infinitely better) the &quot;changePage&quot; method is called successfully.      The &quot;onclick&quot; handler fires  but the content script indicates that   &quot;changePage&quot; is not defined.    <b>Please provide
