<title>Issue 42243 -   chromium -    &quot;Customize Sync&quot; and &quot;Set up Sync&quot; dialogs should both be modal (Windows and Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.380.0  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. wrench --&gt; set up sync --&gt; customize sync      &quot;Customize sync&quot; dialog should be modal to the &quot;set up sync&quot; dialog  which   in turn should be modal to the chromium window. If you  click on the &quot;set   up sync&quot; dialog  the &quot;customize sync&quot; dialog should stay in the foreground   until it is dismissed. Similarly  the &quot;set up sync&quot; dialog should remain in   the foreground if you click on the chromium window.      Mac: Both dialogs behave as desired.  Windows: &quot;Customize sync&quot; is not modal to &quot;set up sync&quot;  but &quot;set up sync&quot;   is modal to the chromium window.  Linux: Neither of the two dialogs are modal as described above.    </pre>
