<title>Issue 42576 -   chromium -    pinned new tab page shows blank favicons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.388.0 (45546)  URLs (if applicable) : new tab page    This is a feature request.  It should be nice if when you pin a ntp you see a favicon that is not the   blank one used for sites with no favicons  so you can easly find it. Pinned   NTP is useful now that you have pinned tab restore  so you can always have   the NTP as first page. So a favicon (maybe the chrome icon used for extension   gallery page?) would be better...     </pre>
