<title>Issue 23925 -   chromium -    Themed new tab page jumps each time I switch to it if bookmarks bar is undocked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Themed new tab page jumps each time I switch to it    The background image jumps vertically.  This only happens if the bookmarks   bar is not docked.  I suspect what is happening is that we resize the new tab   page to the size of a browser window without the undocked bookmarks bar  and   then we insert the bookmarks bar  which causes the new tab page to resize   again.    (This makes the new tab page kind of annoying to use when it is themed.)    Observed in 4.0.221.5 (Developer Build 27975) </pre>
