<title>Issue 36417 -   chromium -    &quot;Recently Closed&quot; section loses entries if Chrome gets (accidentally) closed again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (dev  but not a regression)      1. Have only one window open  with several tabs  2. Close a tab  3. Close the whole window (causing Chrome to shut down)  4. Open Chrome again  5. Go to the New Tab page and restore the window.  (Note that the tab that was closed in step 2   is still there)  6. Close the window again (again causing Chrome to shut down)  7. Open Chrome again  and look at the New Tab page      Both the closed window and the closed tab should still be listed  since the &quot;recently closed&quot;   list persists across sessions.      Nothing but the closed window is listed; all the other entries have been lost.  (This is particularly infuriating if step 6 occurs by accident or if Chrome deadlocks (or   livelocks) during the restore  as has happened to me several times today...) </pre>
