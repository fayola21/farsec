<title>Issue 43391 -   chromium -    user-typed URL + onbeforeunload handler == wrong URL displayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to a page with an onbeforeunload handler that prompts you.  A good   testcase is Google Spreadsheets -&gt; New Spreadsheet -&gt; Type into several   cells.  Now type an address into the omnibox  hit enter  and say &quot;stay on   this page&quot; to the prompt that appears.    At this point the wrong (i.e. user-typed) URL is displayed in the omnibox    and the right URL cannot be recovered by hitting &lt;esc&gt;. </pre>
