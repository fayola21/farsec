<title>Issue 35141 -   chromium -    Sad Tab when autocomplete dropdowns open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Do something to trigger an autocomplete dropdown  for example on the gmail login page.  With   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38429">r38429</a> this causes the renderer to crash  although I think I saw the same problem earlier as well.    [71656:779:43828086124673:FATAL:/Users/Shared/Chrome/git/src/chrome/renderer/render_wid  get.cc(149)] Check failed: false. Invalid message with type = 65666    How do you look up which ipc message corresponds to a given type id? </pre>
