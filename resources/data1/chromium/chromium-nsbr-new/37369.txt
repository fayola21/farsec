<title>Issue 37369 -   chromium -    initial_sync_ended needs to be per-datatype - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/650008">http://codereview.chromium.org/650008</a> (see syncable.h/cc) contains a mock   implementation of initial parts of this.    First steps would be:    In the Directory's PersistedKernelInfo struct  instead of a single bool    nick proposed using a bitset&lt;MODEL_TYPE_COUNT&gt; for initial_sync_ended. I   think this is a good idea.    Change initial_sync_ended() accessor (and mutator) to accept ModelType   parameters.       </pre>
