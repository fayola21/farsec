<title>Issue 41712 -   chromium -    Geolocation can get in a stuck state where infobar won't show - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Only  noticed this on OSX so far  but can't see why it wouldn't be on all OSes.      0. make sure geolocation is set to 'ask'  1. open <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/m">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/m</a> in first tab  2. (allow it to access location)  3. click location icon -&gt; manage -&gt; exceptions -&gt; remove all  4. open a second tab  5. close first tab (note: order of this is important)  6. in the second (now only) tab  reopen <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/m">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/m</a>        Expect the info bar to show again    instead  no info bar is shown.  the page cannot use geolocation    7. open a new (third) tab  8. go back to the previous tab    -&gt; now the info bar is shown.    9. click 'allow'  -&gt; location show  but the icon is not shown!    switching tabs makes the icon appear.   </pre>
