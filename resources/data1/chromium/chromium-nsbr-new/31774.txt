<title>Issue 31774 -   chromium -    nothing happens with tabs  page button  and customize button clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38 (Official Build 34131)            Firefox 3.x:OK        Running Windows XP 2003 with SP3.  Clicking on tabs does nothing.  Page button and customize button also do   not work.  Back  Forward  and reload button work.  Small &quot;plus sign&quot; button   for opening new tabs works too.  Using ctrl-tab I can still switch between   tabs.  I can also use keyboard shortcut to open new windows  including   incognito window.  The problem is exactly the same in new windows.     Chrome has been working fine all morning  this happened after system was   unresponsive for a few minutes.  Closing chrome and reopening did not fix   the problem.       </pre>
