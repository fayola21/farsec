<title>Issue 32384 -   chromium -    IME within search box doesn't accept text properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Go to foreign language web page (e.g. google.co.jp)  2. search for foreign language entry (e.g. type C-F  select the search box    in Japanese  type &quot;kensaku&quot; into IME  hit space to begin conversion  select   &quot;__��_��_��_��_&quot; from the alternatives.  Accept by hitting return.  3. The search isn't carried out.  No text is highlighted.  If you enter   more text into the search box and delete it  you do get the search and   highlighting though.    This happens to me with the uim-anthy combination of IME's on ubuntu 9.04.      What is the expected result?  Search should happen as soon as the IME text   is accepted by the user.    What happens instead? Search doesn't start until you enter more text via   the IME or otherwise.  You can enter more text and delete it  and then the   search does go through.   </pre>
