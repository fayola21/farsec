<title>Issue 32745 -   chromium -    unresponsive page dialog comes up when stopped at a js breakpoint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) dev      1. Open the developer tools and set a breakpoint.  2. Trigger the breakpoint.  3. Wait.      The browser waits for you to debug.      The &quot;unresponsive page&quot; dialog comes up  giving me the option to kill the   page I'm trying to debug. If I dismiss it by clicking &quot;Wait&quot;  it pops up again a   few seconds later. </pre>
