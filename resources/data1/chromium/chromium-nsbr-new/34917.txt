<title>Issue 34917 -   chromium -    Need to pump events in the renderer when the browser might be showing a cookie prompt during a synchronous IPC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to pump events in the renderer when the browser might be showing a   cookie prompt during a synchronous IPC    Cases where this could happen:  1- reading document.cookie  2- sending a synchronous XHR request  3- accessing localstorage    If we don't pump events  then we could end up deadlocking the browser.  For   example  the browser's UI thread could be blocked on a plugin's UI thread    which could in turn be blocked trying to script the page (sync IPC to the   webkit thread).  If the webkit thread is meanwhile blocked waiting for the   browser UI to show the user a prompt  we could be stuck. </pre>
