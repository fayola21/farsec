<title>Issue 37375 -   chromium -    Need to support status bar icons for persistent extensions and notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're dogfooding a new feature for long-lived extensions (extensions that continue running when   the last browser window is closed). Part of this feature requires adding status bar icons to allow the   user to interact with the extensions.    We're putting a single icon up there  and for now clicking on the icon will just bring up the   chrome://extensions/ page - long term  more complex interactions with the extensions will be   possible via a popup menu.    We may eventually also use this for notifications as well (to provide some way for the user to detect   missed notifications  or to interact with notifications on platforms that don't allow the user to click   on them). </pre>
