<title>Issue 34669 -   chromium -    Don't re-use the cookie strings in the LocalStorage or Database CONTENT_SETTING_ASK dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When LocalStorage ASKs about a content setting  it should provide more   useful information.  Right now we pass in size on disk and last modified date.    The key  value  and size of both are much more interesting in this context.  In   fact  size on disk and last modified are probably not even worth showing. </pre>
