<title>Issue 30470 -   chromium -    Pages unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33             Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK  Chrome: Fail    We have tested our web-based business solution on several computers   running Chrome and Chrome continually hangs and throws out a dialog   about &quot;these pages have become unresponsive&quot;. Our product can put up   several pages and tabs  all interlinked. This never happened with IE    Firefox or Safari. We do several under the cover javascript web service   calls  so I suppose that's what's hanging things.    Chrome is not reliable for serious business purposes.    What steps will reproduce the problem? Private application: contact the   writer.    What is the expected result? Chrome works.    What happens instead? Chrome hangs.         </pre>
