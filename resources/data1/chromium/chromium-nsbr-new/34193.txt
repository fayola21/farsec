<title>Issue 34193 -   chromium -    it can't free memory... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 5.0.307.1        1. First  just open one url  for example:   <a href="http://www.google.com/sitemap.html">http://www.google.com/sitemap.html</a>  2. Open page &quot;about:memory&quot; to observe memory usage. And we can see   &quot;SiteMap&quot; tab just use memory about 5MB.  3. Then  we open all urls from &quot;SiteMap&quot; page. Observe memory usage    &quot;SiteMap&quot; tab use memory about 120MB now.  4. Close all tabs except &quot;SiteMap&quot; tab  and wait for 10mins. Observe memory   usage  &quot;SiteMap&quot; tab use memory about 60MB now.          I think  after closed all tabs except &quot;SiteMap&quot; tab  it must be used less   than 10MB of memory usage.   I found this issue because I open Google Reader from GMail  and open other   pages from Google Reader. Even I closed other pages except GMail  &quot;GMail&quot;   tab still used 1GB of memory usage. It made my chrome browser and system   become very slow.   I reproduce this issue on latest version of the chrome  but it still a   issue on old versions.    I try to use argument: &quot;--process-per-tab&quot; and &quot;--process-per-site&quot;  but   it's not working now... </pre>
