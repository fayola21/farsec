<title>Issue 28631 -   chromium -    Race condition opening download item menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Download a theme  or other file that auto-opens and auto-removes itself  from the shelf. Right as the download finishes  click on the popup menu for  it. If you time it right you will crash Chromium.    The stack looks similar to <a title="Chrome crash: [DownloadItemController handleButtonClick:] + 0x43 (download_item_controller.mm:203)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28215"> issue 28215 </a> but is nastier:    19 Google Chrome Framew0.251.0.0            0x0248fa93 -[DownloadItemController  handleButtonClick:] + 0x43 (download_item_controller.mm:203)  20 AppKit              0.949.54.0           0x93dc2e8e -[NSApplication  sendAction:to:from:] + 0x6f    Except that the DownloadItemController is gone by the time we get the  click; you can race the click on the NSView to catch its controller dead. </pre>
