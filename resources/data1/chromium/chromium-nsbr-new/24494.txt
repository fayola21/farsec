<title>Issue 24494 -   chromium -    'esc' key should close the 'Search engines manager' window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.222.2  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open 'Search engine manager' from preferences.  2. Hit 'esc'.    Expected result:  2.1  'Search engines manager' window closes.    Actual result:  2.2 Window doesn't close.    Note:    - Do we want maximize and minimize button for this window? Not filing a  separate bug since I am not sure about the expected behavior. (Windows  Chrome doesn't have them) </pre>
