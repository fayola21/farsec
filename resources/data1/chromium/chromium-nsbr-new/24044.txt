<title>Issue 24044 -   chromium -    Deleting a folder with a large number of children from one client doesn't propagate to other clients right away - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start two instances of Chrome with two different --user-data-dir   folders.  2. Enable sync on both clients.  3. On one client  create a folder and under it create about 30 other   elements (either bookmarks or folders).  4. Make sure the changes were propagated to the other client.  5. One either client  delete the top level folder created in step 3.    What is the expected output?     The deletion should propagate to the other client right away.    What do you see instead?    The change doesn't propagate right away. The only way to see the change   propagating is to create another item (bookmark or folder) on the second   client.    The problem is likely related to the fact that the first client sends the   nudge to the second client before the server finishes the deletion (the   deletion is done asynchronously and it takes longer than the amount of time   it takes to delete only one item).    The way to fix this without involving any server changes is to send the   nudge from the first client after verifying that the server is done with   the deletion. This can be done by doing a GetUpdates in a loop until the   server returns the deletion of the corresponding items. </pre>
