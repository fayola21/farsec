<title>Issue 25458 -   chromium -    extension popups right edge flickers when it's width shrinks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create a popup that changes size dynamically.  Make it animate its size   transition using -webkit-transition.  If you resize it a few times  you'll   notice that its position seems to flicker a bit while it's resizing.    I spent a bit of time debugging this  and it seems to be the border when it   calls SetBounds on the widget  which then calls SetWindowPos.  If I step over   SetWindowPos  I can see the flicker happen across that single step (it moves   and then moves back).  No clue what's going on there. </pre>
