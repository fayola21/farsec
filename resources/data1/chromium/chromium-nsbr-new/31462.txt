<title>Issue 31462 -   chromium -    Throbber sick in tabs opened with cmd-back/forward-button click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35384">r35384</a>      1. Open NTP  2. Go to e.g. google.com  3. Cmd-click back button  4. Switch to new tab  (5. Cmd-click forward button  switch to new tab)        The two new tabs should finish loading and stop showing the throbber.   The NTP should never show the throbber.        The two new tabs are stuck with the indefinite throbber state even though   they finish loading.    Might be cross-platform. Works fine in the beta release. </pre>
