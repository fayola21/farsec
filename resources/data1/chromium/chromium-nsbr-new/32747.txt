<title>Issue 32747 -   chromium -    Zooming out in an NTP destroys the view. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36504">r36504</a>  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Open an NTP  resize the page so that you get both vertical and   horizontal scroll bars.  2. Press and hold cmd + - till the max zoom out possible.  3. Hit cmd + 0 to get back to the actual size.    Expected:  We should get a screen as it was before we zoomed out.    Actual:  The thumbnails are scattered and overlap on the recently closed bar at the   bottom of the page.    Screenshot attached. </pre>
