<title>Issue 41564 -   chromium -    Related Tasks in Task Manager window become confused after you change the column sorting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version     :  5.0.372.0-43941 and 5.0.377.0-44433    Task Manager window correctly lists running tasks (e.g.  browser  tab   Plug-in). When the user clicks a task  the correct task is highlighted  and  it's related tasks are also highlighted. However  after changing the sort   the relationships of the tasks become confused  and the wrong tasks are  highlighted when you select one.      1. Login  and open 2 or more windows  with 2 or more tabs per window.  Effect of bug can be seen more easily if each tab is opened to a different  web page  but this is not necessary to reproduce the bug.  2. Press Shift-Esc to display Task Manager window.  3. Click several tasks in sequence. Note that any related tasks are  highlighted automatically when a task is click-selected.  4. Click a column header to change the sort  or sort direction. E.g.  click  Page or Private Memory column headers.  5. Repeat 3.      When a task is click-selected  only the related tasks should also be  highlighted. Unrelated tasks should not be highlighted.    Instead  some unrelated tasks are highlighted  and some related tasks are  un-highlighted.      </pre>
