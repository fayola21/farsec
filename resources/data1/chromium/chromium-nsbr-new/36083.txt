<title>Issue 36083 -   chromium -    Chrome crashes iMac? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.7  OS version               : 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard)    I don't know if this is the right place to post this (please redirect me if that is the case) but I have a   HUGE issue with Google Chrome on my Mac. I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact time and   place when this happens  but sometimes when I have Chrome running my computer will totally   crash. I get a black screen and everything hangs.    For weeks I thought something was wrong with the hardware on my computer  but I checked the   Console log and got messages like this after EVERY crash:    2010-02-13 16:58:42	[0x0-0x13013].com.google.Chrome[143]	  [0213/165842:WARNING:/b/slave/chrome-official-  mac/build/src/chrome/app/breakpad_mac.mm(62)] Breakpad disabled  2010-02-13 17:00:09	[0x0-0x13013].com.google.Chrome[143]	  [0213/170009:WARNING:/b/slave/chrome-official-  mac/build/src/chrome/app/breakpad_mac.mm(62)] Breakpad disabled  2010-02-13 17:00:11	[0x0-0x13013].com.google.Chrome[143]	  [143:519:339360715814:ERROR:/b/slave/chrome-official-  mac/build/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/browser_window_cocoa.mm(143)] Not implemented reached   in virtual void BrowserWindowCocoa::ShelfVisibilityChanged()        I have since switched back to Safari and my computer hasn't crashed since. To try out my theory I   started up Chrome and after about 15 minutes of use my computer crashed again. Something is   seriously wrong with this browser. Maybe it's Flash? I don't really know what causes it. All I know it   has something to do with Chrome.    I have a late 2006 Intel Core 2 Duo iMac with 4 GB RAM and a GeForce 7600 GT graphics card. I   googled the issue a bit but only found one other user who seems to have the same problem (on the   same Mac too). </pre>
