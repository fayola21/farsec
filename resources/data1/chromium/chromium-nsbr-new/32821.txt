Make sure your Chrome is logged into sync  2. Shut down Chrome and take down the network connection  3. Start Chrome        about:sync should not show OFFLINE_UNUSABLE.  Bringing the network   connection up should move the state into ONLINE.    Only tried on Mac so far.    Spawned off from 30156  regression of 24973. </pre>
