<title>Issue 24543 -   chromium -    URL in footer printed page is shortened... makes footer useless - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Print a page with a (middle-)long URL  2. Notice that the URL gets shortened after about 8 cm (on the paper)  3. If you cannot see the full URL  printing it is useless!    The URL I used was '<a href="http://www.wrts.nl/lijst/print/15070602?wat=ab'">http://www.wrts.nl/lijst/print/15070602?wat=ab'</a> (don't   try to visit it  you'll have to register/log on first). This URL got   shortened to '<a href="http://www.wrts.nl/lijst/print/1507060...'">http://www.wrts.nl/lijst/print/1507060...'</a> This makes the URL   completely useless. It is the same as when I have an URL called   <a href="http://site.com/folder1/folder2/folder3/userprofile1287.html">http://site.com/folder1/folder2/folder3/userprofile1287.html</a> and it gets   shortened to <a href="http://site.com/folder1/folder2/folder3/userprofile..">http://site.com/folder1/folder2/folder3/userprofile..</a>. not a   single human is able to revisit it...    Chrome should only shorten an URL if it is larger than this: Page_width -   Left_margin - Right_margin - PageNumber_of_Total_pages_width   (- means minus  not a separator)    <b>Please provide
