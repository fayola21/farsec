<title>Issue 40268 -   chromium -    closing autofill and options dialog behave differenly in windows and linux  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5.0.368.0 (Official Build 43461)    Don't know what is correct behavior as windows and linux autofill settings   dialog behave differently. Haven't checked mac.    Windows XP :   1. Go to Wrench &gt; Options &gt; Change Autofill Settings   2. Click Close in Options dialog [ Don't close Autofill profile dialog]    Both Options and Autofill profile dialogs close.      Linux Ubuntu 8.04 :  1. Go to Wrench &gt; Options &gt; Change Autofill Settings   2. Click Close in Options dialog [ Don't close Autofill profile dialog]    Options dialog closes but Autofill profile dialog doesn't close.    Should they both behave as Browsing data dialog behavior where you can't   close the Options dialog if you don't select any option in import data   dialog?       </pre>
