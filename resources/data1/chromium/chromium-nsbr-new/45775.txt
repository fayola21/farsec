<title>Issue 45775 -   chromium -    Mac: pressing Delete key doesn't work in cookies dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have some cookies.  2. Go to Prefs -&gt; UtH -&gt; blah  3. Select a cookie or something  4. Press Delete key      I expect stuff to be deleted. Instead  I don't see anything happen. I do   however  hear a beep. Maybe we should play a song instead. </pre>
