<title>Issue 30328 -   chromium -    Improve install-build-deps.sh to reduce manual slave maintenance. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> src/build/install-build-deps.sh must install anything necessary to build   chromium  google chrome  chromium os or chrome os.    It must verify git version  install (compile) a newer version if necessary    etc.    libxslt1-dev libjpeg62-dev  etc.    It must be fast too.    Note: I can't assign it to msb@chromium.org so assigning to dave. :) </pre>
