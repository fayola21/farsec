<title>Issue 25645 -   chromium -    Possible data race on reference counter in WebKit on StringImpl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This data race was found using ThreadSanitizer (   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/using-valgrind/threadsanitizer">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/using-valgrind/threadsanitizer</a> ).  Please note that the previous data race found on ref. counter was the cause   of a top crasher (see <a href="http://crbug.com/18488">http://crbug.com/18488</a>).    I couldn't prove this data race with RaceChecker class (yet) as I did for   <a href="http://crbug.com/24724">http://crbug.com/24724</a> but the attached ThreadSanitizer report shows that the   same StringImpl instance is ref/deref'ed from multiple threads. This is very   likely to be a data race similar to 18488 and 24724. </pre>
