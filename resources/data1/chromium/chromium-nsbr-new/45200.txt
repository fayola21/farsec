<title>Issue 45200 -   chromium -    Native jQuery  text/markdown  text/BBCode  text/ReST and others - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I propose a plugin mechanism for Chromium    1. pre-compile jQuery into native code it's as fast as native javascript/DOM   functions    2. Provide a mechanism to natively render   markdown/BBCode/ReST/Textile/Wikitext directly to a webpage.   </pre>
