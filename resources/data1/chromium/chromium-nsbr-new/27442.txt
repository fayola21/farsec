<title>Issue 27442 -   chromium -    Add a minimum_chrome_version property to extensions manifests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This property would be optional and would enforce the minimum version of   Chrome required to host the extension. This would mainly be useful for   developers on prerelease channels who are using new APIs that haven't gone   to more stable channels yet. </pre>
