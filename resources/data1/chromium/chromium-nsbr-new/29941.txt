<title>Issue 29941 -   chromium -    Check manifest files for case sensitivity issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should do one of:    a) Check  if possible  that the case of files in the manifest matches the   case of files in the zip  or    b) Lowercase everything when unpacking an extension.    Otherwise it's easy to write extensions that work on Mac/Win but not Linux. </pre>
