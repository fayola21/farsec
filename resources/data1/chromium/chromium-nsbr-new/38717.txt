<title>Issue 38717 -   chromium -    Two cleanup items with string size calculations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (1) I believe SizeStringInt()  on Windows  does not adjust the passed in   height for single-line strings  but just the width.  If this is true  we   should probably set the height correctly (to the font height) within that   function  then audit callers and remove any unnecessary code (or fix any   bugs) due to this.    (2) Canvas::SizeStringInt() and Font::GetStringWidth() can both calculate   string widths  and worrisomely  they do it using different win32 calls --   DrawText() vs. GetTextExtentPoint32().  I don't know if this can result in   different return values for similar inputs.  Probably all calculations should   go through the same codepath.  Ben suggests that perhaps SizeStringInt()   should move over to Font and become the One True Way. </pre>
