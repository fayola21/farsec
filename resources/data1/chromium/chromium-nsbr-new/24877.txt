<title>Issue 24877 -   chromium -    Switching tabs with command-option-arrow doesn't work if the page scrolls horizontally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open at least two tabs.  2. Switch to a tab with a horizontal scrollbar visible.  3. Put the horizontal scrollbar somewhere in the middle.  4. Try to switch tabs by pressing command-option-left arrow or   command-option-right arrow.      Expect: to change tabs  Observe: the page scrolls left or right  as though command-option was not   pressed at all.  Once the page has fully scrolled horizontally  the tab will   switch in that direction.    We're offering these keystrokes to the renderer now  and it's taking them.    That sucks.  I don't think we ever want to offer tab-switch keystrokes to   the renderer.  At the very least  the renderer shouldn't have default   bindings for our tab-switch keystrokes.    Nico  didn't you do this command-arrow stuff?      trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29077">r29077</a> </pre>
