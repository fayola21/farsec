<title>Issue 43290 -   chromium -    Strange Flash behaviour with transparent window-mode and fixed position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.375.29  URL : <a href="http://domos.no-ip.org/dwagner-pre/">http://domos.no-ip.org/dwagner-pre/</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : -  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Hover the mouse over the flash menu on top.  2. Zoom in on the page    Notice  that the hitareas are not zoomed in. Therefore  you can't use the   flashmenu anymore. The same happens when you scroll the page. The flash   object obviously moves  but its hit areas doesn't seem to do the same.    Without zooming or scrolling  it does recognize the hitareas but does not   display a proper cursor. Clicking works  though.    Firefox has had the same issue some time ago  details here:   <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/other/hit_bug_in_fire">http://snook.ca/archives/other/hit_bug_in_fire</a>   </pre>
