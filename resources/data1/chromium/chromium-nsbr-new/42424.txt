What is the expected result? Flash Player loads with downloaded MJPEG Stream.        IO error&gt;&gt;Flashplayer in debug detects an IO error from URLStream class and  throws the error. Player dies and user needs to use other browser to view  the stream. This is 100% in testing internally and in complaints from  clients logging in using Chrome.
