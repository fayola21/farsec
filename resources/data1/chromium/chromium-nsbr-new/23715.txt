<title>Issue 23715 -   chromium -    Orkut.com does not open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This happens only in Chrome. I first open my account in www.gmail.com and   when I try to open www.orkut.com in the new tab then it does not opens. It   shows an error that it cannot open www.orkut.com(sorry I havent copied the   error). But when I logout from gmail and open www.orkut.com then the login   screen comes. Many time sI had to open the www.orkut.com in IE or Firefox.    I don't know the version number of chrome but it showed that my chrome was   fully updated. I have now unistalled the chrome and I am going to   reinstall it.    I want to also thank you for making a great browser.     Bye.  Randheer Singh </pre>
