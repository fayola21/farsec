<title>Issue 31378 -   chromium -    Mac Chrome can leave many zombie ps processes around - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See the original bug report in the comments to <a title="Chrome causing -10810 errors?"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28547">issue 28547</a>.      1. Install Chrome. Putting it in a place with a really  really  really long path   will probably expedite the zombies showing up.  2. Run Chrome with lots and lots of tabs and in particular renderer   processes.  3. ???  4. Mmmm. Brains.    The zombies are caused by a failure to waitpid() when the output buffer is   read to capacity. Oops! (The output buffer is read to capacity because I   seriously underestimated the length of a line of output from ps. But we still   shouldn't leave zombies around.)    I'll take care of this ASAP. </pre>
