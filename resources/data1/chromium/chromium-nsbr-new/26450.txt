<title>Issue 26450 -   chromium -    Consecutive popups cannot be stopped  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.195.27  Issue: A chain of alert popups in a page is showing &quot;Prevent this page from   creating additional dialogs&quot; checkbox  however this checkbox has no affect   unless the user accepts the popup  forcing the user to click OK  regardless   of whether the user wants to OK  cancel or just close the window.       1. Open a page with multiple javascript alerts. On the second alert  you   will have a checkbox to prevent more dialogs.   2. Check the box.  3. Click &quot;cancel&quot; of close the popup using the red icon. Next popup will   show up.      1.	Checking the box will prevent additional popups from showing up    regardless of which popup button the user click (OK  cancel  X close icon).  2.	Possibly provide alternative mechanism  such as a link &quot;Get rid of   this dialog and prevent this page from showing additional dialogs&quot;. This   link will close the dialog without requiring the user to OK.  3.	Have some other option to stop dialogs without accepting them or   interacting with them.      The browser does not prevent consecutive popups unless you click OK  even   if the dialog message is something that you do not want  eg &quot;Buy 10 more of   this item now&quot;  &quot;subscribe to our newsletter&quot;  &quot;allow us to spam you   forever&quot;  etc.    Sample HTML to reproduce problem:  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;Before Alerts&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;  confirm(&quot;Alert 1&quot;);  confirm(&quot;Alert 2&quot;);  confirm(&quot;Alert 3&quot;);  &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;After Alerts&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;   </pre>
