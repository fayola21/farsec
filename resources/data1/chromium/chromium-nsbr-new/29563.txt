<title>Issue 29563 -   chromium -    Flash blocks fill the entire web page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	4.0.266.0 (Developer Build Ubuntu build   33943)                         WebKit	532.6                         V8	2.0.3                         User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;   en-US) AppleWebKit/532.6 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.266.0 Safari/532.6    URLs (if applicable) : Any page with flash ads. i.e:   <a href="http://kotaku.com/5420193/comparing-the-boobs-and-butts-of-bayonetta">http://kotaku.com/5420193/comparing-the-boobs-and-butts-of-bayonetta</a>      1. Load any page with flash ads.  2. Scroll down using mouse wheel (bug can come up or not but it's been   pretty consistent lately).      One would expect to be able to view the page normally.      Big blank blocks appear filling the page. They are usually black but I've   also seen white and black and white patterns.   </pre>
