<title>Issue 36120 -   chromium -    Setting src on &lt;source&gt; shouldn't restart the resource selection algorithm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Consider:    &lt;video&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;  &lt;script&gt;  onload = function(){    document.body.firstChild.firstChild.src = 'test.ogv';  }  &lt;/script&gt;        This should not load anything  because the resource selection algorithm   should have been started during parsing and have discarded the &lt;source&gt;   element (so that &quot;pointer&quot; is between the &lt;source&gt; and the end of the list).         Chrome happily loads the video. The author should be required to   explicitly call load() per spec.    <b>Please provide
