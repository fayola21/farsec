<title>Issue 43701 -   chromium -    Requesting option to enable system title bar and borders for non-maximized windows only - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On my Athlon64 X2 5000+ (Linux)  the Chrome titlebar and borders are only   an annoyance because they don't offer the snap-to behaviour and context   menu of the native WinDeco.    However  on my old Celeron 2Ghz  they cause significant performance issues   when dragging or resizing.    While it is possible to force no borders on maximized windows for many   window managers without actually full-screening them  that leaves maximized   Chrome windows without a minimize/un-maximize/close button box.    My suggestion is to offer a third styling option which uses native window   decorations for un-maximized windows and the compact styling for maximized   ones  thereby preserving the design decision to have the active area for   the tab bar extend to the top row of pixels on the screen (slam your mouse   up and scroll to switch) while still providing good manipulation   performance and native WM behaviour for non-maximized windows. </pre>
