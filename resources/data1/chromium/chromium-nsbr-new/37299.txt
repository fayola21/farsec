<title>Issue 37299 -   chromium -    entering bookmark title locks keyboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use ratpoison as window manager and configure it to use C-M-section as   meta key (the bug is probable to appear without this configuration    although not confirmed)  2. In chrome  press C-d to bookmark a page. Don't press Enter or Close.  3. Give a command to the window manager  e.g. C-M-section Down to switch to   another frame      The window manager should be able to act on the command.      The keyboard is locked by chrome  effectively keeping the user from doing   anything else in any other application before being done entering the   bookmark title.    <b>Please provide
