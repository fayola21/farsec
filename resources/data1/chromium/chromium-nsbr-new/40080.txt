<title>Issue 40080 -   chromium -    Cookies not properly detected or saved when closing browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cookies with an expiration date set do not seem to either not be properly saved or not properly   loaded when the browser is closed and reopened. The problem can be reproduced by visiting   Facebook  clicking the remember me checkbox and logging in. Close the browser  reopen and come   back to Facebook. You are not logged in. This happens on other sites with the same functionality.    I was able to reproduce this bug on Chrome 5.0.360.4 dev  OS X 10.6.2. </pre>
