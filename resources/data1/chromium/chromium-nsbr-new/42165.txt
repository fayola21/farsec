<title>Issue 42165 -   chromium -    Autofill dialog on mac has a titlebar  but the close button is disabled (inconsistent with other OS X dialogs) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.383.0    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Go to preferences --&gt; personal stuff --&gt; form autofill --&gt; configure      A dialog whose behaviour is consistent with other dialogs in OS X   applications -- i.e.  for non-modal dialogs  the red (close) and yellow   (minimize) buttons are enabled  while modal dialogs simply slide out of the   parent window (in this case  the preferences window) and do not have a   title bar or any of the coloured buttons.      The dialog that pops up is modal to chromium  and yet  it does not look   like any other dialog. The title bar is visible  but only the green   (maximize) button is enabled. The autofill dialog _looks_ like a non-modal   window  but behaves like a modal window. </pre>
