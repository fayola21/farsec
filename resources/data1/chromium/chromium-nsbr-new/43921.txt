<title>Issue 43921 -   chromium -    Progress tags are not parsed correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://vimeo.com/6354402">http://vimeo.com/6354402</a>         Safari 4: OK       Webkit Nightly: OK       Chrome 4: OK       Chrome 5 Beta: FAIL      1. Open the console  2. Go to a Vimeo video page with the html5 player enabled    An error comes up in the console:  &lt;progress&gt; is not allowed inside &lt;div&gt;. Content ignored.    I don't see anything in the spec to suggest that this should be the behavior (where are you   supposed to put progress elements if they can't be inside divs?). </pre>
