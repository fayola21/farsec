<title>Issue 35578 -   chromium -    scoped_nsobject and the 10.6 SDK don't get along well when NSColor* and NSSize are involved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26348">r26348</a>  &quot;Avoid spurious errors about NSColor*-CGColor* and NSSize-  CGSize conversions&quot;: The SDK has gotten stupider in 10.6  and has conspired   with the compiler  which now thinks that when the receiver is held in a   scoped_nsobject  NSColor and NSSize arguments should be converted to their   CG cousins.    Some more of these came up in <a title="10.6 SDK compatibility fixes for February 12  2010"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35569">bug 35569</a>.  We discussed it a little bit in   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/604038">http://codereview.chromium.org/604038</a>.    If the precise nature of the stupidity can be isolated  it may be possible to   resolve this directly in scoped_nsobject  instead of having to rely on   peppering ugly .get()s onto scoped_nsobjects all over the place where   NSColor* and NSSize are involved. </pre>
