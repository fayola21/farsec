<title>Issue 30776 -   chromium -    Transparent flash application shiftkey error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After 2 hours of trying to isolate my problem  I found out that the keyboard   inputs on google chrome do not work correctly when running a transparent   flash application.    For some strange reason the shiftkey in combination with the ' ' key to get a   '?' (azerty keyboard Belgium) doesn't work and outputs another character (&lt;).    This works on all other browsers... </pre>
