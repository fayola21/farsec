<title>Issue 38112 -   chromium -    Modules Linux build is hanging during tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Leiz says it started as of about   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Linux/builds/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Modules%20Linux/builds/</a>  17147.  It hangs in various places  most recently in browser_tests.    There's a zombie chrome process that blocks everything  but it's not clear   how it got that way.  When you kill that process  it unclogs things such that   just that one test fails. </pre>
