<title>Issue 41673 -   chromium -    RenderView not resizing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Will admit to not recalling 100% how I got into this situation  but I think I   opened a new window  typed in the omnibox  did a search  clicked the first   thing on the result page  and maximized immediately thereafter as the page   was loading.    Afterwards  I wound up on a page where the new tab page was &quot;bleeding   through&quot;. Screenshot attached. I then opened two more tabs to see if they   would also be improperly sized; they were not. I can switch to the other tabs   (#2 or 3)  scroll around  and then switch back to #1 (which is the only one   that is not properly sized) and see the other tabs  bleeding through still.    5.0.366.2 </pre>
