<title>Issue 31010 -   chromium -    build/try bots need to run window manager as well as Xvfb when running tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> linux_view chrome uses Window Manager to know which window is active.  Currently  runtest.py used in build/try bots only starts Xvfb but not  window manager and following two tests are failing due to this.    ProcessSingletonLinuxTest.NotifyOtherProcessSuccess  ProcessSingletonLinuxTest.NotifyOtherProcessHostChanged    I tested with Xvfb + fluxbox and above tests passed fine.    Maruel  Lei  can one of you do this?  Thanks    </pre>
