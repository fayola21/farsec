<title>Issue 31970 -   chromium -    Regression: Glitchy &quot;vibrating&quot; extension popup behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Aaron reports:  ---   I see really glitchy behavior with the popups currently on dev. Not sure if   they are known issues. If you go to <a href="http://www.aaronboodman.com">http://www.aaronboodman.com</a> (sorry) with   the RSS extension  it does this weird vibrating thing  and never goes away (I   can switch to it via alt+tilde).  ---    Looks like dev channel is currently 4.0.288.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35427">r35427</a>). I'm unable to   reproduce in 4.0.266.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33992">r33992</a>) on Windows.   </pre>
