<title>Issue 26200 -   chromium -    Fix incorrect class defines in C++ namespaces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : svn30269  OS + version : Fedora 11+    While compiling Fedora packages based on svn30269  I hit a series of  compiler errors (e.g):    error: declaration 'struct buzz::XmppClient' does not declare anything    In several places  classes were defined within namespaces  like this:    namespace foo {   class foo::bar;  }    This is incorrect  the additional &quot;foo::&quot; in the class definition is  redundant and causes gcc to throw the error. The attached patch resolves  all the cases I hit in the compilation. </pre>
