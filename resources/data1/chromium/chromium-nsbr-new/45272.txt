<title>Issue 45272 -   chromium -    Chrome on Linux: Window decoration does not honor Titlebar Action settings in Gnome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In gnome there is a setting under Preferences &gt; Windows &gt; Titlebar Action.   There the user can select the action when a windows titlebar is double-  clicked (minimize  maximize  rollup  et.    Chrome on Linux doesn't honor this setting.    How to repro:     Preferences &gt; Windows &gt; Titlebar  Select &quot;Minimize&quot;.  Double click a terminal window titlebar to see that it is minimized.  Double click a chrome window titlebar to see that it does not honor the   setting (it probably toggles maximized). </pre>
