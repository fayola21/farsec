<title>Issue 31011 -   chromium -    I get &quot;aw  snap!&quot; or empty page too often with some specific sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.279.0~svn20091222r35149-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : metacity/gnome  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com (also some other google services   especially the feed reader)  facebook.com        Since the last upgrade from ubuntu's chromium PPA gmail.com went almost   unusable  it returns with the &quot;aw  snap!&quot; page all the time. Sometimes I   can use gmail for some seconds before it dies  though. It happens with   facebook.com pages too  but less frequently. Maybe it's not related  but   also another issue: I sometimes get empty page  and sometimes I even need   reload the tab for several times before I get the page ...   </pre>
