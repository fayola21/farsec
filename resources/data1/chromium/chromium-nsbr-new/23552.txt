<title>Issue 23552 -   chromium -    Remove DCHECK hit when LANG=th getting hit in AutocompletePopupViewGtk - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. export LANG=th  2. run chrome  3. type some text into the omnibox so that the popup appears    You'll then hit a DCHECK around line 491'ish:    DCHECK_LT(actual_content_height  kHeightPerResult);    This is the result of the fix for 22791. Previously we weren't returning the   right height for our fonts. As a result of fixing that you can see that in   the thai locale we end up with a largish height. We could request a smaller   font  but I'm not sure if that results in one less readable. </pre>
