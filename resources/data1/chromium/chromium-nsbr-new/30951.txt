<title>Issue 30951 -   chromium -    Mac HTTP page cycler graphs look horrible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Take a look at these:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/moz-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/moz-</a>  http/report.html?history=1000  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/bloat-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/bloat-</a>  http/report.html?history=1000  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5-v8-latest/moz-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5-v8-latest/moz-</a>  http/report.html?history=1000    That's not a good look for a graph.  This appears to be a mac-only issue.    Looking at the detailed results for the 'bad' runs  there's a pretty clear   pattern:    www.nytimes.com_Table	 74.00	11.37	 17555.0	92.0	 98.0	  67.0	 70.0	70.0	 67.0	68.0	 67.0	67.0    Most of the times are sane  but there's a few gigantic outliers (like the   17.5 second one here).  The magnitude of these outliers seems to be   increasing - from around 3.5s when the problems first started to show up to   nearly 20s on recent runs.    What's going on here?  Is this definitely just a buildbot artifact or   something that our users are also experiencing?     </pre>
