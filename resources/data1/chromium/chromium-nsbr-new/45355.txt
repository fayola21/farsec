<title>Issue 45355 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Unable to install Flash when prompted; &quot;Get Plugin&quot; button does nothing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: Unable to install Flash when prompted; &quot;Get Plugin&quot; button does   nothing    The &quot;Cancel&quot; button also does not dismiss the dialog.  (See attachment to see   what dialog I'm referring to in case it is not clear.)    I can only dismiss the dialog by clicking the 'x' in the top-right corner.    Observed using 6.0.418.0 (Developer Build 48387) on Vista. </pre>
