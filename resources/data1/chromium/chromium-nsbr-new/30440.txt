<title>Issue 30440 -   chromium -    First new window should open home page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch chrome on mac  2. close all windows without quitting  3. click the dock icon to open a new window      The NTP opens. The home page should open instead.    This change should only affect new window launch behavior (clicks from the   dock and from other launch points like spotlight)  NOT new window creations   with cmd+n or the menu--those should still open the NTP.    Pinkerton  I've discussed this with the UI team  do you agree? </pre>
