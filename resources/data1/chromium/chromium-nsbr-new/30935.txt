<title>Issue 30935 -   chromium -    Invent a user.css analogue to user scripts to be installed as extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be cool if user styles (like on userstyles.org) could be installed   as extensions. To make this possible  we would need to:  1. invent a standard format for the CSS file  like suffixing it with   .user.css.  2. add code to convert .user.css to an extension  like we do for .user.js.  3. get places like userstyles.org to adopt this convention for chrome users </pre>
