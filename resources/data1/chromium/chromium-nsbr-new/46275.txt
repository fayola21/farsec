<title>Issue 46275 -   chromium -    Don't send extension events when no listener is present to consume it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A regression in xpdual/moz/total_byte_b indicates a problem caused by a recent commit.  rsesek says this is due to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=49390">r49390</a> and explained another fix is on its way.  I'm bumping expectations to green the moz test and filing this bug so we track the issue.    Jochen  please let me know if you think this is misfiled.  Otherwise  let me know when you land a fix so I can adjust the expectations for this test downward.  Thanks. </pre>
