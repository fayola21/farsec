<title>Issue 45592 -   chromium -    History menu should include actual history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version      :  5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)      1. Open History Menu      Find a list of recently viewed websites.      I see two lists: &quot;Most Visited&quot; (Unhelpful) and &quot;Recently Closed&quot; (Pretty Useful).  To get to history I have to select &quot;Show Full History&quot; and select from that page.    I'd like to have a short history in the History menu. Seems counter-intuitive to not have history in   the history menu. I wonder if &quot;Most Visited&quot; doesn't make more sense in the &quot;Bookmarks&quot;   (favorites) menu?   </pre>
