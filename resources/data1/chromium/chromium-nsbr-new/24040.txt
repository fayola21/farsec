Launch IE  go to cf:<a href="http://www.sohu.com">http://www.sohu.com</a>  page should be rendered by CF  full mode  2. Go to IE menu  View -&gt; Encoding    Issue:    There is no available encoding option can be selected  but if the web page  is rendered normally by IE  a list of encoding will be displayed.
