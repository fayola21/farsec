<title>Issue 34303 -   chromium -    My american express credit card number is saved as suggested form input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've entered my credit card number a few times in forms where they ask for   the full number in one text box.  Now when I get to one of these forms and I   start typing  it suggests my credit card number.  This is a big security risk for   users using a shared computer.  Easy to catch with a regex for each type of   credit card.    Using Chrome Version:  5.0.307.1 dev   (I believe this has also happened to me on the non dev build)  Operating System: OS X    Credit card format:  American Express 37XXXXXXXXXXX06 (15 digits)     </pre>
