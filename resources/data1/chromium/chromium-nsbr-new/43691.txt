<title>Issue 43691 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Hitting enter does not activate default form action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/search.x?terms=abcdef&amp;type=comments">http://www.shacknews.com/search.x?terms=abcdef&amp;type=comments</a> .  Focus   the &quot;search for:&quot; box that says &quot;abcdef&quot;  type something  and hit enter.    In other browsers  and most Chrome versions  this submits the form (triggers   a search).  In Chrome 5.0.396.0  nothing happens.    Not sure if this is WebKit or V8.  CCing a few people who can maybe triage. </pre>
