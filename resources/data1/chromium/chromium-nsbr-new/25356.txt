<title>Issue 25356 -   chromium -    support monochrome icons in browser actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be cool if developers could specify that their browser actions   should be treated as monochrome.  Then we could theme/tint them  etc.  We've   already seen one example where a dev tried to make a monochrome icon using   the default blue color  which of course winds up looking strange on other   themes. </pre>
