<title>Issue 24433 -   chromium -    Defunct processes eating 100%+ of CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.2 (28508)    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not yet tested      1. Browse with several tabs  2. Close some tabs  3. Wait      All processes should close when tabs are closed.      Intermittently some Chromium Helper processes will still be running even   when their tabs have been closed  and eventually they will start eating up   100%+ of CPU. They can be force quit through Activity Monitor or kill  and   do not seem to affect the running Chromium processes. A sample from   one of these processes is attached.    This issue has been present since early this week  maybe late last week--  similar timeframe to <a title="Chrome fails to collect defunct/zombie processes remaining from closed tabs/windows." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23778"> bug 23778 </a>  although apparently a separate issue. </pre>
