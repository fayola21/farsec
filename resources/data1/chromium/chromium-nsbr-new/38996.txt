<title>Issue 38996 -   chromium -    Fix event handling in Unity on 10.6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On 10.6 (where we support CA drawing)  Unity drawing works well  but mouse   events sent to the plugin (including mouseover) cause the whole window to   lose focus.    This may be our Cocoa interposing doing something odd  or it may be   something Unity is doing that we need to block (or just ask them not to do). </pre>
