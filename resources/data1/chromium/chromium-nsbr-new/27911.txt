<title>Issue 27911 -   chromium -    TCMalloc needs to be forked in order to compile correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently have the directory src/thirdparty/tcmalloc in Chromium.  The   genuine open-source project is pulled into   src/thirdparty/tcmalloc/tcmalloc/src.  We had what we considered chromium-  forked files in src/thirdparty/tcmalloc/*.  Sadly  these chromium-forked   files were not consistently replacing the baselines.  Specifically  any   time a file was the target of an include  it would be pulled first from the   local directory (such as the baseline)  and then the include directives   would kick in and suggest first looking in our forking area  and then the   baseline.  As a result  in some cases  we were pulling in forked files   during one compilation  and unforked files during others.  We don't know   that this caused any terrible problems yet  but it is highly undesirable.    We need to have a consistent way to work with forked files in this area  as   we (minimally) diverge from the open-source baseline  or as we make changes   that we hope to upstream. </pre>
