<title>Issue 25680 -   chromium -    Firefox/Chromium takes a real long time to do DNS lookups... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; Also  Fedora 10 did not have the problem  just F11.  Before I switch to  Opera  where should I look???    Fix for firefox:    about:config  network.dns.disableIPv6  TRUE    I guess it was the Linksys WRT54G router that didn't support IPv6...  (about 8 years old) Firmware Version: Satori-pre3.7 v2.06.1.7sv    No idea about Chromium  tho...  Filing a bug...   </pre>
