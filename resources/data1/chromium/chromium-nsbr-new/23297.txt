<title>Issue 23297 -   chromium -    can't see dangerous download box when browser window is narrow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try to install an extension.  If you resize the window to be too narrow  the   warning in the download shelf disappears completely.  If you browse at that   narrow  it's not entirely clear what you're supposed to do or why the   extension didn't install.    I'm not sure what's supposed to happen here... </pre>
