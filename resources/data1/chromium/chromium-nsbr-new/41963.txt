<title>Issue 41963 -   chromium -    PRIMARY buffer missing protocol in URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.9 (Official Build   44625)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: gnome  URLs (if relevant): any  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Not an issue  do not strip the http:// from the   location bar.  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Not an issue. There   is no PRIMARY buffer.      1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  2. Try to copy location to PRIMARY buffer.  3. Ctrl-C contains protocol 'http://www.google.com' while PRIMARY does   not.      Middle-click elsewhere would contain the protocol (&quot;http://&quot;    &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&quot; like CLIPBOARD buffer.      PRIMARY buffer starts at the domain.    &quot;www.google.com&quot;      With the removal of the protocol from the location bar  it would be nice if   the PRIMARY buffer did the same thing the CLIPBOARD buffer does. </pre>
