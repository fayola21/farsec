<title>Issue 43999 -   chromium -    Chrome exhibits excessive CPU use on new window initiations. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run chrome in single process mode  e.g. &quot;-single-process&quot;.  2. Restore or open a large session  probably 100+ tabs  though in this case   it was 200+ tabs to a variety of sites.  Both FlashBlock and the effective   NoScript (by blocking Javascript on most sites) *were* largely enabled --   i.e. only a very limited subset of sites had Javascript and/or Flash   capability.  3. Stop the Chrome &quot;flash&quot; sub-process.  E.g. kill -s STOP &quot;pid-of-output-  of-enhanced-ps-including-program-args piped through grep of   'chrome.*flash'&quot;.  This is probably not required to demonstrate this bug --   it simply eliminates the flash process as a &quot;designated blame-ee&quot; for this   problem&quot;.    Open a new tab (fast  little CPU use)  start any new window  e.g.   www.google.com  www.wikipedia.com  chrome issues  etc.  perhaps by pasting   a URL into the URL line  typing one in  going to a bookmark  etc.  There is   full CPU use by chrome for 10-20 seconds even *after* the window has been   opened and displayed.    The point being -- that one has *opened* the window (therefore there is   little or no X activity); one may have cached the page (chrome runs through   a local squid cache); and one has *displayed* the page  i.e. it appears on   the screen.  The CPU use *continues* long after the page is displayed.    (This is evidenced by using the Gnome panel system monitor for   CPU/Memory/Network/Disk I/O in real time).  And if your developers aren't   using this as a minimum monitoring utility -- how does one know what chrome   is really doing?    If the page is displayed CPU use should immediately drop to zero.  If not   then chrome is doing something behind the curtain -- why is it doing this?    The reason that this is being run in single-process mode is because chrome   uses excessive memory if one runs it in &quot;process-per-tab&quot; mode and because   chrome no longer adheres to &quot;process-per-tab&quot; guidelines due to inherent   problems with process limits under Linux (though the developers fail to   document how to properly resolve this in previously filed issue reports).    What is the point of attempting to use the security/reliability features if   Google distributes a product which doesn't attempt to document how a user   could tailor their system (either Linux itself or a local chrome build) to   be both secure and reliable.                <b>Please provide
