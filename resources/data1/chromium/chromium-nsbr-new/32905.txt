<title>Issue 32905 -   chromium -    Speed of stylesheet manipulation is extremely slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jsbin.com/ohovu/2">http://jsbin.com/ohovu/2</a>    Above URL is a simple test case to test the performance of insertRule.  The following is my results with a few browsers:    Opera 10.10:  1st run: 9 ms  2nd run: 16 ms  3rd run: 24 ms    Firefox 3.6.0:  1st run: 7 ms  2nd run: 7 ms  3rd run: 7 ms    Chrome 4.0.295.0 (without extension):  1st run: 121 ms  2nd run: 218 ms  3rd run: 311 ms    Here you can see the difference  not only that Chrome is much slower  it   is even slower each time as CSS rules on the page increases.    I get similar results with Safari  so I guess this is related to webkit.  However  I am reporting here because of a much bigger problem stated below.    Chrome 4.0.295.0 (with extension AdBlock 1.2.89 enabled):  1st run: 491 ms  2nd run: 594 ms  3rd run: 692 ms    Chrome 4.0.295.0 (with extension AdSweep 2.0.4 enabled):  1st run: 714 ms  2nd run: 815 ms  3rd run: 907 ms    Some may wonder who will need 1000+ CSS rules and here it is. With   extensions like these  page loading performance is seriously affected.    One of my extensions utilizes stylesheet manipulation a lot. With AdSweep   enabled  my script actually halts my computer for more than 3 seconds when   inserting CSS rules  no kidding.    Therefore I hope someone can address this issue and fix it  thank you. </pre>
