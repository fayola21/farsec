<title>Issue 23232 -   chromium -    Focusing the omnibox causes input elements within the page to become gray - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.1    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK      1. Go to a page with some select boxes or scrollable text areas on it  2. Click in the omnibox (or press command-L)  3. Notice that the page scrollbar and all input elements become gray        Normally the gray input element color indicates that the window is no   longer the foreground window  so I'd expect the input elements to remain   aqua-y (i.e. blue).        The input elements in the page become gray  as though they were in a   background window.    This is a pretty subtle thing  and doesn't affect functionality at all. Still  it's   a little weird once you notice it. </pre>
