<title>Issue 39003 -   chromium -    Aw Snap errors on certain pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : macworld.com  wired.com  maybe others  OS version               : OS X 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Normal  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Visit a page within a certain domain (so far the ones I've encountered are macworld.com and   wired.com  2. Hover over the Share This button (or anything that uses javascript?)  highlight text  etc.        Either of the actions I mentioned above on either of the domains causes an Aw Snap! error.   Reloading the page will bring it back. I suspect there's a common element on these pages that's   causing the conflict  but I can't isolate it. HIghlighting text invariably causes the crash  as does   hovering over the Share This button  which I think uses javascript to generate its drop-down   menu? I'm not a web dev or anything  so I'm afraid I can't be more useful than that in pinning   down the cause. I suspect there are other domains that would have this issue that I haven't come   across as well. I disabled all extensions and got the same result. </pre>
