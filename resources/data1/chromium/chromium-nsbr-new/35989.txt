<title>Issue 35989 -   chromium -    Make it possible to see which extensions modified the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev    I've been fighting with a bug in my Image Search for many months (filed as   internal http://b/2217631 before by chance I found that disabling one   extension fixes it.    I had no idea that extension could be a reason for the problem  since there   were no indication that extension modifies the source of the page I'm   viewing.    Here I suggest to add an option (e.g. under Developer menu at least) to see   the effects of extensions on the current page. </pre>
