<title>Issue 40787 -   chromium -    Local files doesn't load with Ajax - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.342.7 (42476)  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit  Behavior in Linux Firefox: works correctly    Loading local files using ajax (e.g. jquery's methods) doesn't work. It   makes it impossible to work with pages/apps on user's machine.    Simple test case attached.    Launching with --disable-web-security makes it work  but it's a bad   workaround. I suppose it was designed to protect user's data to get read by   Internet pages  but maybe local files from the local page's directory (and   subdirectories) should be allowed by default?    E.g.  /home/user/stuff/application.html  could have access to:  /home/user/stuff/data.html  /home/user/stuff/months/2010-03.html  and  /home/user/stuff/* in general? </pre>
