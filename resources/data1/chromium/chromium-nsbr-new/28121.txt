<title>Issue 28121 -   chromium -    The content of HTML input fields is not restored across restarts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32041">r32041</a>    Chrome does not store text in HTML forms across restarts. I.e. if you fill   out a form but do not submit it  and then restart chrome  you have to fill   it out again.    This works in Firefox 3.    I'm not sure whether other HTML input fields (checkboxes etc) are affected   as well.      1. Go to google.com  2. Type &quot;test&quot; into the search box. Do NOT press enter.  3. Close chrome.  4. Open chrome.        Chrome should open google.com and the search box should contain &quot;test&quot;.        Chrome opens google.com but the search box is empty. </pre>
