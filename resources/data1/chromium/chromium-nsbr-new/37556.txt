<title>Issue 37556 -   chromium -    Freshly opened window moves when loading recently closed tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Close Chrome with a couple tabs open.  2. Re-launch Chrome.  3. In the New Tab window select the &quot;tabs&quot; link from the Recently Closed   section of the page.        The tabs load in the current window without the window moving.        The tabs appear to load in the current window (although maybe it's a new   window behind the scenes) but the window moves down and to the right a   little bit.  It appears to be the same movement as when opening a new   window in addition to a current window.  In other words  the position used   to &quot;cascaded&quot; the new window position so the new window doesn't exactly   obscure the original one.    <b>Please provide
