<title>Issue 27398 -   chromium -    Crashing badly in tiny_malloc_from_free_list  heap corruption suspected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a lot of distinct crashes in tiny_malloc_from_free_list.  Looks like   heap corruption.    http://crash/search?  query=product:&quot;Chrome_Mac&quot;+version:&quot;4.0.237.0&quot;+tiny_malloc_from_free_  list    237.0 already has 300-350 between 11-08 and today.  229.1 has between 150 and 200 between 11-05 and today  and the volume   has been pretty low over the past couple of days.  223.11 has fewer than 50 between 10-25 and now.  223.11 was the   current dev build for a long time.  223.8 was the current dev build for only   a couple of days  but it only has 4 crashes in here.    It looks like we introduced some serious memory errors between 223 and   229. </pre>
