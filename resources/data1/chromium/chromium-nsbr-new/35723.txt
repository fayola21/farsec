<title>Issue 35723 -   chromium -    Make XSS auditor faster - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:   - 4.0.249.78 (36714)  for Windows (and all after that    - also latest dev channel for windows  - safari for Windows with webkit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=54586">r54586</a>  - Chrome for Mac  version 5.0.307.7 beta:     URLs (if applicable) : Not possible    I visit a page made for a customer:    On first page request it loads quite fast.  Then if I request same page more than once without leaving the same page it uses very    very long time to load.    Page size was: 1075 KB.  1. Page request loads in approx 2 to 3 seconds.  All other page requests (without leaving this URL) loads in:  2. page request loads in: 1min:05sec  3. page request loads in: 1min:04sec  4. page request loads in: 1min:05sec      Then I visit another URL on the site and then request the page again:  1. page request loads in: approx 2 seconds  2. page request loads in: 1min:07sec  3. page request loads in: 1min:05sec      The timings above was done using: Chrome version: 5.0.322.2 dev  But see affected versions in start of this post.    See attached files for CPU usage on 1 page request and 2 page request.    cpu-usage-1-request show a tall but short lasting spike as the page loads.  (spike inside red line)    cpu-usage-2-request show a tall and very long lasting &quot;spike&quot; as the page loads.  (&quot;spike&quot; inside red line)    Note: For both requests the data returned was exactly the same.    If I visit another page on the site and then request the page again  then I   allways see similar results. 1 page request is fast  all consecutive page requests   are very  very slow.    Chrome version 3.0.195.3 does not show this issue.    Couls someone please tell me what is going on and hopefully fix this ASAP.     </pre>
