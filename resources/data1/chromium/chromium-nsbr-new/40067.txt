<title>Issue 40067 -   chromium -    Fine grain Javascript permissions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.364.0 (Developer Build 42859)            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Go to Content Settings -&gt; Javascript        Fine grained control of individual Javascript actions to be allowed or   disallowed.        Can only turn Javascript on or completely off.    THIS IS A FEATURE REQUEST NOT A BUG    It would be a great feature to be able to control Javascript permissions at   a much finer grained level. For example  Firefox has a dialogue to allow   you to allow scripts to:    [ ] Move or resize existing windows  [ ] Raise or lower windows  [ ] Disable or replace context menus  [ ] Hide the status bar  [ ] Change status bar text    These controls can make some really annoying practices by some websites go   away and really puts the user in control. </pre>
