Make sure no IE window is open  2. Uninstall CF from &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot;      Uninstall should succeed and no need to restart machine since CF is not in  use  but now it prompts me to restart my machine.    This issues happens in recent builds and only happens in IE6-XP3  it  doesn't happen on my IE8-XP.       </pre>
