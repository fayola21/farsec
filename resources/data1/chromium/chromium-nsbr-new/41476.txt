<title>Issue 41476 -   chromium -    provide a way to collect uninstall feedback for extension authors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Suggestion from an extension author:  When a user uninstalls an extension  it would be nice if we could prompt the   user for uninstall feedback that could be shared with the developer.  We've   also talked about asking for a review (or a star rating) at this point. </pre>
