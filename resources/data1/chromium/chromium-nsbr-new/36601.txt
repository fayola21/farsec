<title>Issue 36601 -   chromium -    Autofill profile dialog box polish items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - dialog box should always open on same monitor as the window that opened it   (either the browser window or the options dialog)    - If there are no profiles  the &quot;Add profile&quot; section should be expanded by   default... it's a bit confusing right now as to what to do since there's   just a dialog box with two buttons in it that comes up    - The dialog box should be a slightly smaller size than the main options   dialog box so that the main options dialog box is visible behind it. </pre>
