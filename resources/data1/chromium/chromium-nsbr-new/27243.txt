<title>Issue 27243 -   chromium -    'gcl diff bar' should not output anything if given change is empty. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Suppose 'bar' change  which is empty:    % gcl changes bar                                                --- Changelist bar:    --- Changelist foo:  M      net/base/net_util.cc      In this case  'gcl diff bar' should not diff anything. But it does output the   result of 'svn diff' instead:    % gcl diff bar                                                 Index: net/base/net_util.cc  ==============================================  =====================  --- net/base/net_util.cc        (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31504">revision 31504</a>)  +++ net/base/net_util.cc        (working copy)  @@ -750 18 +750 6 @@  ....  ....   </pre>
