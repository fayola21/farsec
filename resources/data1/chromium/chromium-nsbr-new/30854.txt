<title>Issue 30854 -   chromium -    One should be able to edit the text in the Create application shortcuts... popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You know how the popup displays above the check boxes the text that becomes   the name of the desktop shortcuts (as in the screenshot)? I should be able to   edit that text within that window instead of having to rename each individual   shortcut after creating them. </pre>
