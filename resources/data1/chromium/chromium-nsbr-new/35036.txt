<title>Issue 35036 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame: chrome_launcher.exe needs crash reporting and version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Although it is simple enough  chrome_launcher.exe should report crashes (if   any) to go/crash. It should also have version information to be consistent   with other binaries. Version info is also useful for crash reporting.       </pre>
