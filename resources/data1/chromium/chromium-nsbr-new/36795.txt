<title>Issue 36795 -   chromium -    Can not show post title in soufun.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> soufun.com is a Chinese website. In its BBS  I find out that all the   titles of posts can't show. for example  look at   <a href="http://shbbs.soufun.com/board/1210019701/">http://shbbs.soufun.com/board/1210019701/</a>  the title text is hidden. Actually these titles show up in Internet   Explorer normally.  I see the sourcecode of webpage  Chrome does not correctly handle the  DIV element.  &quot;  &lt;div class=&quot;box13MenuL2Titile&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;  &quot;    I tested it at version 4.0.249.89 and before.    thanks </pre>
