<title>Issue 29258 -   chromium -    chrome frame doesn't include full Chrome version number in UA - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order to enable UMA to differentiate version of GCF histogram data  we   should include the full Chrome version number in the host UA  not only the   major version (as we do today). e.g.:        chromeframe/4.0    would become:        chromeframe/4.0.255.12 </pre>
