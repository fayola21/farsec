<title>Issue 35303 -   chromium -    Cancel on download very  very annoying. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is a retarded user interface design to make the buttons on the download   bar function such that when hitting the down-arrow your cursor is over the   cancel option. Instead how about prompting for confirmation the user if the   download has persisted for more than 5 minutes  *and* making the cancel   option at the top of the menu. On my configuration I can cancel a download   simply by double clicking the down arrow.    This sucks when you're 1MB away finishing a 700MB iso. </pre>
