<title>Issue 36594 -   chromium -    Remove ModelChangingSyncerCommand::ModelNeutralExecuteImpl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I added ModelNeutralExecuteImpl to use in   ProcessCommitResponseCommand as part of the change to run the core   model-mutating logic of this command once for every ModelSafeWorker    instead of just once.  ModelNeutral is where the code that did not mutate the   model and should only be run once  but this turned out to be the only   instance of this across the commands  so instead we should split this part out   into a plain-old VerifyCommitResponseCommand (inheriting from   SyncerCommand)  and leave the rest where it is. </pre>
