<title>Issue 42029 -   chromium -    Backward navigation during page rendering locks.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: XP    Repros on 249.1059  DEV and ToT.    -In NNTP  navigate to a webpage which takes bit longer time to load (eg:   cnn.com).  -While page loading is started (or in middle)  click on Back warding   navigation arrow button.    Issue:  We notice few issues  which may relate to each other.  1. Backward navigation locks up. -&gt; the button is enabled/click-able and   clicking on the button does nothing.    Actually  NNTP page is the active page (as per the Task manager -   screenshot attached)  but it is not loaded.  2. with this issue  if user switches to another tab and comes back to the   same tab  then the URL (cnn.com) in the omnibox is empty.     Expected: Should navigate to prev. page (i.e NNTP)    PS: Works fine on 2.x build. </pre>
