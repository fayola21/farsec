<title>Issue 33971 -   chromium -    Chrome Vomits on Hard Drive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Spend time with Chrome; browse to several hundred pages and download a   few Chrome updates as they become available.  2.  Check the size of User/Local/Google/  and if possible  file   fragmentation using PerfectDisk 10 (or something similar).  3.  Gasp in horror.        Chrome shouldn't be utilizing ridiculous (read: easily over a gigabyte) of   storage space for old versions of the browser and assorted cache.    Besides being a bad citizen on my MacBook Pro's Windows 7 partition  I   wouldn't be surprised if someone far more advanced than I could utilize the   runaway caching scheme to run a maliciously crafted .exe disguised as an   older version of Chrome.        Note the screenshot of PerfectDisk 10 after fully defragmenting my drive    and then visiting 3 websites.  Note how there are already dozens of files   with dozens or even hundreds of fragments.  If I wasn't religiously   clearing my cache  these files would make a mess of my Windows partition   and aversely affect drive performance.    <b>Please provide
