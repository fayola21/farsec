<title>Issue 34799 -   chromium -    Unit test needed: BrowserImpl dtor can not assume full construction of all sub-objects - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. start chrome with --try-chrome-again=0  2. dialog will appear in the corner of the screen  dismiss it  3. chrome crashes (more visible under debugger)    The reason is that this switch causes (browser_main.cc) to exit the program   early before some sub-objects of BrowserImpl have been created  the dtor   assumes that all are created so it crashes trying to access local state.     </pre>
