<title>Issue 27637 -   chromium -    Chrome Extension pages (like options) cannot use the link tag to have a tab icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Get any extension with an options page  such as AdBlock+ (no relation to   Firefox's AdBlock Plus) from the unofficial extension site   <a href="http://chromeextensions.org">http://chromeextensions.org</a>  2. Open said page.  3. Note that there is no space for a favicon in the page's tab.  4. Create a simple extension with an options page using instructions at   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/</a>  5. Create a 16x16 test image (I made a PNG) and drop it in the extension   directory.  6. Create a simple options page with a link tag to point to the image as   instructed here:   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Standardization_and_implementation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Standardization_and_implementation</a>  7. Open the options page and no favicon is displayed.  8. Rename your image to favicon.ico (actual file type shouldn't matter) in   the extension root.  9. Remove the link tag and reload the options page.  There is still no   icon.        An icon should be displayed just as for web pages.  If there is no icon    then don't display the default favicon (which web pages with no icon will   display in the tab).        No icon is displayed and no space for the icon is provided.    <b>Please provide
