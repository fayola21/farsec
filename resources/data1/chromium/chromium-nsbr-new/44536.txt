<title>Issue 44536 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Mouse Cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's very good that the color of the input field changes  when you enter an   ssl secured website. But couldn't you also change the mouse cursor? or at   least just the color? So that we are always sure that we are in a secure environment?    From what my own experience  I almost never look on the input field while   browsing.    I know that the mouse cursor can be changed very easily with a script    that's a problem  but maybe you could turn that feature off because it's   useless anyway.       </pre>
