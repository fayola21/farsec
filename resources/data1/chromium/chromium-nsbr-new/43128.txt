<title>Issue 43128 -   chromium -    Clicking a link then using a control shortcut spawns new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.28 (Official Build 45883) dev (Win)      1. Click a link in one tab without holding a key.  2. Use a control-shortcut (such as Ctrl-tab to switch to a third tab)      The shortcut operates independently of the link click.  If the control key   wasn't held when the link was clicked  no new tab spawns.      The link opens in a new tab. </pre>
