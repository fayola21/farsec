<title>Issue 27082 -   chromium -    Alt text for images should be shown if the image doesn't exist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : a page with a &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; alt=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; to a non-existing image             IE 7: Partially OK           IE 8: Partially OK      1. Go to any page with an image that doesn't exist  2. Notice the alt(ernative) text isn't shown    According to the w3c any image &lt;img /&gt; should have an link to the image &lt;img   src=&quot;<a href="http://www.site.com/image.png">http://www.site.com/image.png</a>&quot; /&gt; and an alternative text that should be shown if the image   doesn't exist or cannot be shown. So the minimum of an image should be &lt;img src=&quot;logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;The   logo of our site&quot; /&gt;    The alt text is NOT the same as the title tag  this is a stupid bug in Internet Explorer (that is why   I set IE to 'partially OK').  *The alt text should be (and is in most browsers) the text that is shown if the image cannot be   displayed (e.g. non-supported format  wrong link  not correctly downloaded  etc...).  *The title attribute text is the text that should be shown if the user moves his mouse over it.    So if an image doesn't exist  Chrome should display it's alt text on the same place the image would   normally be. If the image is correctly shown  the alt-text should NEVER be shown!    (Please be so kind not to merge this issue with an issue that sais the IE behaviour (show the alt text   in a tooltip) should be happening  because the IE behaviour isn't the correct behaviour according to   the W3C.)    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#adef-alt">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#adef-alt</a>  <a href="http://w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp">http://w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp</a> </pre>
