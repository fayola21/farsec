<title>Issue 42336 -   chromium -    Flash plugins don't reload when enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.17 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45275">r45275</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.6    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Disable both external and internal flash plugins from about:plugins.  2. Open a youtube video in a new tab.  3. Enable one of these two flash plugins.  4. Refresh the tab running the youtube video.    Expected:  The video should load and run since the plugin is now enabled.    Actual:  The video doesn't load and still says the plugin is unavailable.    Note:  Repeating the same steps with an Flip4Mac plugin does work as expected.  Seems like we have this issue on windows too.   </pre>
