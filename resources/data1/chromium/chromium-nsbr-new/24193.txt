This is not a V8 issue yet  AFAIK. There's still some basic plumbing to be  done to get the JVM NPAPI plugin working.  sky on October 09 2007 17:15  (Assigned)  Notes  Doesn't the Java plugin use OJI  which we don't support? I believe Sun  provides a version of the plugin that uses ActiveX. If we provide  ActiveX support (yikes)  then the Java plugin should work.  mal on October 16 2007 21:13  (Assigned)  Hotlist     Cr__Rel_1.0  fqian on December 06 2007 13:48  (New)  Assignee     &lt;none&gt;  nsylvain on January 30 2008 08:25  (Assigned)  Assignee     joshia  aocampo on March 12 2008 17:45  (Assigned)  CC     chrome-bugs  mshrivastava  v8-dev  Notes  1063438 has been marked a duplicate of this issue  aocampo on March 20 2008 09:51  (Assigned)  Hotlist     Cr__Rel_1.0  chrome:compatibility-frequent-bugs  mal on March 24 2008 18:37  (Assigned)  Notes  This should be working  but it fails with the current JRE (6 u5).    There are a couple of remaining issues:      1. Seems to be looking for the np*dll files in new_plugin  but there's no  'new_plugin' dir anymore    2. I copied the files into that folder  and the plugin shows up in  about:plugins  but trying to use it crashes the plugin process.  joshia on March 25 2008 10:35  (Assigned)  Notes  The java plugin should be downloaded from: <a href="https://jdk6.dev.java.net/6uNea.html">https://jdk6.dev.java.net/6uNea.html</a>    I have been testing various versions and since this is still a beta there  have been changes that broke our implementation. This plugin still needs  some mozilla specific interfaces and hence the special case code and breakage.    The recent versions I have tested are:    Java SE 6 Runtime (JRE) Update N build 13 (March 6th)  Java SE 6 Runtime (JRE) Update N build 14 (March 17th)    and these are working.    Given that there may be breaking changes as they go through their beta and  release cycle  I think we should keep this bug open.  sandholm on April 02 2008 02:27  (Assigned)  CC     chrome-bugs  mshrivastava  chromedashboard-buganizer on April 21 2008 02:02  (Assigned)  URLs affected     <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml</a>  <a href="https://jdk6.dev.java.net/6uNea.html">https://jdk6.dev.java.net/6uNea.html</a>  eseidel on June 12 2008 13:35  (Assigned)  Notes  Is this still a bug?  It hasn't been touched in nearly 2 months.  If not   please close.  If it is  please explain what the current state of our Java  Plugin is and what we'd need to do to resolve this.  joshia on June 12 2008 14:02  (Fixed / Fixed)  Notes  I hadn't marked this as fixed since the new Java plugin was going through  release cycle. First few releases contained some breaking changes but  subsequent ones work fine. So although the new Java plugin is still not  released  I think we should do OK overall.    I am marking it fixed now.  deanm on June 23 2008 17:50  (Fixed / Fixed)  CC     chrome-bugs  joshia  mshrivastava  Notes  We are still failing layout tests:    V8 | KJS # LayoutTestsfastreplacedapplet-disabled-positioned.html = FAIL  V8 | KJS # LayoutTestsfastreplacedapplet-rendering-java-disabled.html = FAIL  laforge on October 28 2008 12:40  (Verified / Fixed)  Verifier     laforge  Notes  Cleanup operation  batch updating old 'FIXED' issues to 'VERIFIED' that  have not been modified since 9/2/08.
