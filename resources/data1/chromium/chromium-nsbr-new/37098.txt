<title>Issue 37098 -   chromium -    WebGL constructors should not be visible to the page unless --enable-webgl is specified - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebGL constructors should not be visible to the page unless --enable-webgl is   specified    These constructors may be used by websites to check if WebGL is supported by   the UA  so we should hide them per our usual EnabledAtRuntime mechanism.    It is also important to prevent script from poking at this code since it is   not a released feature yet.  It may have stability problems  etc. </pre>
