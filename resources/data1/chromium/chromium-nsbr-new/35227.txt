<title>Issue 35227 -   chromium -    Make Extensions work for Chrome Applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193) dev    When running a web app as a Chrome Application (i.e. Create application   shortcuts...) the Omnibar is not visible. This makes it difficult for   extension developers as the Page Action or Browser Action button is not   visible.    Is it possible to make some real-estate within the Chrome Application   interface available to Page/Browser Actions?         </pre>
