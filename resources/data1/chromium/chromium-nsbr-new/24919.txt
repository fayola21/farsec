<title>Issue 24919 -   chromium -    Wrong caption text in alert box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Language] Dutch    [Version number] 3.0.195.25    [OS details] Vista Home Basic SP2      In a Javascript alert box  the caption says '... waarschuwen'. This means   'Warn ...' but I think it has to be something like 'Warning from ...'. To get   to the point  I'd suggest changing it to 'Waarschuwing van ...'.    Note: with ... it says the domain url  e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a> </pre>
