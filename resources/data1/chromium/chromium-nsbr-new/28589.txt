<title>Issue 28589 -   chromium -    allow disabling of default search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The default search feature creates ambiguity for the browser  resulting in  such artifacts as &quot;Did you mean http://wiki? pop-up when I enter &quot;wiki&quot; in  the omnibox.  This is pretty annoying when you use a lot of hostname  aliases  and to avoid an unwanted search I end up typing the &quot;http://  prefix manually.    I'd much prefer using an explicit keyword to invoke a search (e.g. &quot;s  wiki&quot;).  In fact this is the exact setup I've always used on Firefox.    Please make a way to disable default search.   </pre>
