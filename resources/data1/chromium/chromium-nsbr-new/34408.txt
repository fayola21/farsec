<title>Issue 34408 -   chromium -    Tablet PC Input Panel option does not appear within web pages in Chrome. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use a tablet or tablet PC on Windows XP Tablet PC Edition  with tablet   input controls enabled.  2. Attempt to use Google Chrome as normal  3. Navigating/using Chrome (at least viewing the web pages) will be   alright  however text boxes will not work right.      When clicking on a text box within Chrome  a button should appear  allowing   text input via handwriting  or an on screen keyboard.      When clicking on a text box in Windows (and the address bar in Chrome)  a   button or icon would show  allowing you to press it  and either use an on   screen keyboard  or write in what it is you are going to turn into text.    When using Chrome  this button doesn't appear within a web page - if I   click the text box I'm typing this into  I am unable to use the tablet pen   to input anything - I must turn my screen and go into laptop mode to use   it.  Firefox  I.E.  and other programs work relatively well  when needed.    <b>Please provide
