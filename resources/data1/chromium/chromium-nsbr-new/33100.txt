<title>Issue 33100 -   chromium -    Plugins not getting enter/exit events for edges touching the window edge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To repro:    0. Use Flash 10.0  1. Load the demo swf from <a title="Flash Mouse.hide() not working on Mac" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32703"> issue 32703 </a>  2. Click the button and watch the cursor disappear  3. Move the cursor out and note the cursor does not reappear    I just confirmed with Flash 10.1  dropping NSLogs into the  NPCocoaEventFromWebMouseEvent's switch. We give one mouse enter at the  beginning but that's it. </pre>
