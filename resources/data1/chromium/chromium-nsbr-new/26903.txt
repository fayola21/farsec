<title>Issue 26903 -   chromium -    Shadow on closure hover card demo is off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Happens with 4.0.229.1 and a trunk build on OS X and Windows. Does not   happen with today's WebKit nighly on OS X.      1. Go to http://closure-  library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/demos/hovercard.html  2. Hover over one of the cards        The hover card should have a correct shadow. Instead  the shadow is offset   in y direction.    At least it's not broken in webkit. </pre>
