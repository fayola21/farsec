<title>Issue 39957 -   chromium -    autofill change processor doesn't properly associate ids - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It does Associate() on the chrome -&gt; sync path  but when a new node is   created by sync  there's no call to associate the new ID with the tag.    I believe this would cause an unrecoverable error when an update to this   node occurs.  This is bad. </pre>
