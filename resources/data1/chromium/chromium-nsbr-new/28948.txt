<title>Issue 28948 -   chromium -    Implement context menu for browser actions and page actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to implement a context menu for browser actions and page actions    which will have actions such as uninstall and configurations (full list TBD).    The first step in this direction is to remove the mouse flags enum for Page   Actions (sorry mattm)  before more people start relying on it.    Another alternative is to leave it in  but only send down left-click/middle-  click and never the right-click enum value.    Aaron  thoughts? </pre>
