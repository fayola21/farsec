<title>Issue 34756 -   chromium -    Tabs are not resizing  when closing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.249.78         1. Open many tabs (enough to open about 7-10 tabs).  2. Close tabs one by one but not the right one.  3. Don't move pointer below tab bar or address line.    When tab's size is minimized (a lot of tabs in the window)  and to begin to   close them - they are resizing back. All good if to begin to close tabs   from the most right.    But if to begin to close tabs from the middle - they are not resizing back    only shifting left.  If to move pointer down  below address they will resize back.   </pre>
