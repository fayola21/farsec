<title>Issue 24379 -   chromium -    Remove menu integration from browser actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> a) Incompatibility with dynamic images. We currently assume that if there is   not at least one icon in the icons list in the manifest  that it should not   have space in the toolbar. However  with dynamic images  we would like users   to not have to put anything in the manifest. The workaround is to put a   transparent gif as your single icon in the manifest  which is ghetto.    b) Weird UI. After building and using a gmail checker browser action  I   conclude it is weird to put every browser action in the wrench menu   automatically. In this case  having something happen when you click the icon   is not really the main feature. It certainly doesn't warrant an appearance in   any menus.    I think that we should split menu items out into a separate explicit API. </pre>
