<title>Issue 37303 -   chromium -    Weird Google Translate bar behaviour. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1021 beta (40167)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.libreriauniversitaria.it/page_home.htm">http://www.libreriauniversitaria.it/page_home.htm</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A        The new Google Chrome translate feature in Chrome 4.1.249.1021 beta (40167)   doesn't work properly.    In the supplied page the bar shows the following:  &quot;This pages is in [Italian]. Would you like to translate ir? [Translate]   [Nope]    The first problem is that the bar lacks a choice for a target language.    If I carry on and click on translate the page gets re-rendered into a   translated version in English. Now the bar says:    This page has been translated from [Italian] to [English]  [Option].    If I select another language such as swedish in the target language drop   down  then the page is translated into swedish.    The second problem is the following:  When I select from the language bars option dropdown to always translate   Italian to Swedish for this page  then it doesn't work when I refresh the   browser.     If I refresh the browser  the browser asks me again if I want to translate   the page  if I choose to translate the page the page will be translated   into english and not swedish.     The above behaviour is quite awkward...          Chrome to offer a target language when first accessing the page.  or  Chrome to always offer swedish translation for the page.  or  Chrome to always automatically translate the page to swedish.          Chrome always default to the browsers current language.    Regards Johan Akerstrom (jakerstrom@gmail.com)   </pre>
