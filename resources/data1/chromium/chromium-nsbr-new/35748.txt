<title>Issue 35748 -   chromium -    Flash Plugin for Linux does NOT honor the --proxy-server command line options - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make sure Flash is installed and working.  2. Launch Chromium with --proxy-server=&lt;IP:port&gt;  3. Go to www.decloak.net and START TEST  4. Let the test run.  5. Look at the results.  Flash is NOT using the proxy server set at the   time of launch.  This is a HUGE bug for any Flash applications that are   behind a proxy server.  It would break any Flash app that is behind a   corporate firewall that requires all your traffic to pass through the   proxy.      The Flash app should report the same IP as the EXTERNAL address.       It showed the IP I was coming from and NOT the IP of the proxy server I'm   using for protection.      <b>Please provide
