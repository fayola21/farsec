<title>Issue 26391 -   chromium -    use a gyp condition instead of $(CHROMIUM_BUILD) when building locale dlls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In chrome/app/locales/locales.gyp (which I think is only used on Windows)    we include the correct .rc file for each locale dll like so:    '&lt;(chrome_grit_out_dir)/strings$(CHROMIUM_BUILD)_am.rc'     These days we should use the gyp branding variable and include the right   file at gyp time.   </pre>
