<title>Issue 43591 -   chromium -    &quot;Pop out&quot; on hulu.com broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I checked with 375.29 (10.1 RC2) and 375.38 (10.1 RC4). I checked 375.38 on all three platforms   with internal Flash.    Go to hulu.com  play something  click on &quot;Pop out&quot;. Watch it not work. You can click on &quot;play&quot; / click   &quot;Pop out&quot; again / repeat a few times and hear the audio being played multiple times (not in sync  of   course).    I think this is pretty bad. </pre>
