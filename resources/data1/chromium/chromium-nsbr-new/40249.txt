<title>Issue 40249 -   chromium -    Chrome isn't telling the WM which version of WmIpc it's using - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome looks like it's no longer sending the Chrome OS window manager a   message stating which version of the Chrome-to-WM IPC protocol it's using.    This manifests itself when dragging panels -- the panel will jump to the   right at the beginning of the drag.  The window manager logs a message like   &quot;Got WM_NOTIFY_IPC_VERSION message saying that Chrome is using version 1&quot;   when it's notified  but this is no longer showing up in the logs.    WmMessageListener::DidProcessEvent() should be calling   WmIpc::HandleNonChromeClientMessageEvent() when it sees the WM announce that   it's managing screen 0.  Chrome also initializes the WmIpc info at startup.    I don't see any recent changes to either wm_message_listener.cc or wm_ipc.cc   in src/chrome/browser/chromeos that look suspicious.    Scott  I think that this probably isn't the same regression that we ran into   with _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW not getting tracked correctly  since wm_ipc.cc is   already using gdk_window_set_events() rather than XSelectInput(). </pre>
