<title>Issue 39207 -   chromium -    [MAC] URLs should be copied w/o font formatting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copying URL fromt he URL bar copies them with a serif font. This is especially ugly/annoying   when pasted in a sans-serif text. If RTF w/o a font is not possible  plain text would be nicer.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 (Official Build 42060) dev         Safari 4: copies as plaintext    Firefox 3.x: copies as plaintext      1. Copy the url from the address bar.  2. Paste in an rich text enabled text field (f.e. adium chat)      Plain text or an hyperlink w/o a set font.      The pasted link has a serif font (Times New Roman?).   </pre>
