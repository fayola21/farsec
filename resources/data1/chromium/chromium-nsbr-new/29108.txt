<title>Issue 29108 -   chromium -    Have an option to reload a crashed extension besides reloading in the infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install an extension (i.e. google mail checker)  2. Open Chrome's task manager   3. Kill the extension process      If user accidentally closes the tab where the infobar showed up (or the  infobar is closed)  then user has no way of telling that the extension has  crashed  and therefore extension can't be reloaded    For the gmail checker extension example  user might just keep on clicking  on the extension icon and nothing is happening. The only way to get the  extension to start working again is to restart the browser.       </pre>
