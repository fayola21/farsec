<title>Issue 39280 -   chromium -    Show URL Suggestions in Info Bar before waiting for DNS Timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 (Official Build 42060) dev    This is a feature request.    Currently when a user mispells a URL such as www.twiyyer.com (twitter) or   facebppk.cpm (facebook) or even www.google.com.ai (australian google)  it   tries to lookup the domain name (which takes a few seconds) and then   provides multiple suggestions in the error page.     I propose that Chromium should try to detect these typos and either 1.   automatically redirect to the correctly spelt site (with an info bar   telling you that you are NOT going to what you typed in) or  more securely    2. show an information bar while trying to resolve the name like &quot;Did you   mean www.twitter.com ?&quot;    This would help people that are using unfamiliar keyboards and other that   very often mis-spell things. </pre>
