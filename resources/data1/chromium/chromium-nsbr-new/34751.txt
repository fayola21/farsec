<title>Issue 34751 -   chromium -    Implement protocol version checking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The latest spec specifies how to handle version checking for SPDY.    When we receive a control frame  we should check the version.  If it is a   SYN_STREAM frame  and the version is not supported  we should send a   RST_STREAM with UNSUPPORTED_VERSION.  We should ignore frames which are   mismatched in version.   </pre>
