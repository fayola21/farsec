<title>Issue 23971 -   chromium -    Chrome needs to ask for &quot;where to save ?&quot; when the destination folder does not exist. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testing-102.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.221.6  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32.18        1. In Chrome preferences change the download location to a particular   folder.  2. Download a life to that folder.  3. Remove the folder.  4. With out changing preferences download another file.    What is the expected output?  chrome should ask where to save the file   when the destination in the   preferences is does not exists.    Work similar to Windows.    What do you see instead?  It creates a new folder and saves it to that folder.    If the volume is missing a new volume is created and files are added.      Works fine on windows.     Issue in Windows and Ubuntu. </pre>
