<title>Issue 36076 -   chromium -    Ubuntu package &quot;google-chrome-beta&quot; - Too many dependencies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.307.9 (Offizieller Build 39052)   beta  WebKit	532.9  V8	2.0.6.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.9   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.9 Safari/532.9    The newest Ubuntu package &quot;google-chrome-beta&quot; added two or three new   dependencies that are pulling in way too many unnecessary packages. One   notable one was &quot;lsb&quot; which resulted in pulling in packages like qt  rpm    alien  postfix and many more seemingly unrelated and unneeded by chrome.   Also  the total installation size dramatically increased due to this. </pre>
