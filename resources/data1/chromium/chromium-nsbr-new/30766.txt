<title>Issue 30766 -   chromium -    Window won't maximise from dock application icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Enable 'minimize windows into application icon' in the Dock System   Preferences  2. Open Chrome and minimize it - it doesn't go near the trash can it goes   into the application icon  3. Click the application icon  Chrome will not be restored (which is the   normal behaviour for other applications)      The window should be restored when the application icon is clicked      Nothing at all!    This used to work fine  until one of the recent automatic updates  about   two weeks ago  I think from the pre-beta version to the official beta  but I   couldn't be sure about that. </pre>
