<title>Issue 38899 -   chromium -    process terminated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev                    1. The bug was found as follows:  It opened a window  after right clicked the mouse to open link in a new   window  the same procedure done the same. After it was closed and returned   to the first window.    What happens is that the process has remained open as if with all the   windows open  the right to terminate it would be to not consume memory.    Overleaf with images that have 5 tabs and 2 windows open and has 7 process   chrome.exe running.    Attached pictures of what happened </pre>
