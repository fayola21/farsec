<title>Issue 36311 -   chromium -    Match patterns request: should be a simple way to match &quot;all possible pages&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     There's no simple way to match &quot;all pages&quot;  no matter what scheme  domain    port or directory the page is located.          It's desirable having a simple way to declare that the extension should run   in &quot;all possible pages&quot;.    For instance  one may be testing the webpage using a local webserver. So   the URL will be using the local IP address  or the &quot;localhost&quot; alias:    http://127.0.0.1/  http://localhost/    Or you could be running on a virtual machine  using another IP address:  http://192.168.1.100/    Or you could be running in your local host  in other port than the default   80:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/  http://localhost:8080/  http://127.0.0.1:8123/  http://localhost:8123/    Also  you could be using different aliases (other than &quot;localhost&quot;):  <a href="http://name1.local:8456/">http://name1.local:8456/</a>  <a href="http://name2.local:8456/">http://name2.local:8456/</a>          There's no way to manually match all possible URLs (the combitations are   endless).    <b>Please provide
