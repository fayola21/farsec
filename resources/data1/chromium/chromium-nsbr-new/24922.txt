<title>Issue 24922 -   chromium -    base/third_party/nspr does not list local modifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've taken some bits of NSPR to use for the internal implementation of some   of base's time routines.  We've made local modifications to some of what we're   using.  We have a README.chromium file that states what the license of this   code is  but we're not keeping track of local modifications beyond what SVN   revision history tracks.  Admittedly  SVN revision history tracks this very well    but we typically maintain a more explicit list of what we've changed  or   provide .patch files.  This makes it much easier to reapply local changes when   merging a new upstream version.    Additionally  the README.chromium file should list a proper URL and version   of the third_party code  and should provide a minimal description.  For   example  see third_party/ocmock/README.chromium. </pre>
