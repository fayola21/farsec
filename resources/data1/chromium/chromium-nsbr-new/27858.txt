<title>Issue 27858 -   chromium -    If any CSS contains items for a; a:hover; a:active a:visited the style inspector puts a stripe through the first items - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Create any html file with an &lt;a&gt; tag (hyperlink).  2. Place these two lines in the css of this html  a {text-decoration: none;}  a:hover {text-decoration: underline;}  3. Open the file and open the element inspector. Select (in the element   inspector) the &lt;a&gt; tag and look at it's style settings on the right.   Now notice that one of these two (a or a:hover) has been striked-through.   This is not right  because the :hover (and all other a:*) are different.   a:hover is the style shown if the mouse hovers over the a.       to see a:hover and a:link and a:active and a:visited and a:visited:active   and a as seperate things. (notice a and a:link are equal)      if both are included in the style sheet then one of them is striked-  through  just like when it would be overridden by some other style.   However: they are not the same and should not be striked through. </pre>
