<title>Issue 35510 -   chromium -    Content Settings Feature - Disabling Javascript Exceptions Bypass - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: Windows 7  Chrome: 5.0.317.2 dev    Steps to reproduce:  1. Go to &quot;Content Settings&quot;.  2. Go to &quot;Javascript&quot; Tab. Don't change default settings which is &quot;Allow all   sites to run Javascript&quot;.  3. Click on exceptions.  4. Add securethoughts.com for host and Action &quot;block&quot;.   5. Click Close.  6. visit <a href="http://securethoughts.com/alert.html">http://securethoughts.com/alert.html</a> Result -&gt; Javascript is   blocked  7. visit <a href="http://www.securethoughts.com/alert.html">http://www.securethoughts.com/alert.html</a> Result -&gt; Javascript is   not blocked [FAIL]  8. visit <a href="http://test.securethoughts.com/alert.html">http://test.securethoughts.com/alert.html</a> Result -&gt; Javascript is   not blocked [FAIL]  9. visit http://securethoughts.com./alert.html Result -&gt; Javascript is not   blocked [FAIL]  10. I don't think exception filter supports wildcards  so when i tried   putting *.securethoughts.com  it didn't work as well.    I do think we should block javascript for entire site and all subdomains    because that is usually what user would want. also  we should consider   supporting wildcards. </pre>
