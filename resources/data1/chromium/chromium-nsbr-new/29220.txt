<title>Issue 29220 -   chromium -    Dragging upward on the location selection doesn't select the entire URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21 (Official Build 33275)    In firefox  I'm used to clicking on the rightmost character in the location   bar and dragging upward to select the entire URL.  In Chrome that doesn't   work  and I have to do a much longer drag to the left to select the entire   URL (especially for long URLs.) </pre>
