<title>Issue 25048 -   chromium -    Build with fortify - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Fedora builds with -Wp -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 .  This is a security feature   that helps protect against some sorts of buffer overflows  and it seems   likely it at least caught a double free in <a title="glibc assert in WebCore::CSSParser::~CSSParser() (double free) -- gcc 4.4-specific?" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23362"> issue 23362 </a> (though we haven't   quite figured out what went wrong there).  <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Features#Compile_Time_Buffer_Checks_">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Features#Compile_Time_Buffer_Checks_</a>.  28FORTIFY_SOURCE.29    Is there any reason to not always build with it ourselves?  It'd probably be   good to measure perf/memory for the different fortify options to make sure   nothing goes disastrously wrong.  Security folks  what do you think? </pre>
