<title>Issue 27617 -   chromium -    Hints on DevTools empty Profiles page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When opening the profiles tab  the screen is completely empty. Moreover  it   is not intuitive that in order to record a profile or take a snapshot you   need to use the buttons at the bottom of the window...    Hence I suggest extending the profile-view (right-hand side) with a bit of   HTML saying  e.g.    To start recording a CPU profile  use the record button (record.png) in the   lower left corner.  To take a snapshot of the heap  use the snapshot button (focus.png) also in   the lower left corner.    Whenever  there is a profile of snapshot - the hint should not be shown.  </pre>
