<title>Issue 38447 -   chromium -    memory corruption from media layout tests taking out webkit_tests at times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the fyi bots and main waterfall bots have been getting wedged for a while now.  not every time  but with some frequency.    Why running the media directory of webkit_tests  we get the following:    100317 07:22:32 test_shell_thread.py:94   DEBUG Previous test output extra lines after dump:  TestShell(74256 0xb034f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1b241780: double free  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  TestShell(74256 0xb034f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1abd1000: pointer being freed was not allocated  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  TestShell(74256 0xb034f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x3b94400: double free  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  TestShell(74256 0xb034f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1ac35000: pointer being freed was not allocated  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  TestShell(74256 0xb034f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1b2187c0: double free  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug      at that point the test thread in question never does anything more.  So either its wedged or the script can't handle the text.  But then things have to wait for the build bot timeout for no more output to   finally final and kill the test.    There's probably two bugs here  the corruption in the media tests but also the bug within the scripts such that things get stuck. </pre>
