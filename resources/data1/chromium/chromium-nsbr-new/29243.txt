<title>Issue 29243 -   chromium -    SharedWorker race condition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a race condition in WorkerService::CreateWorker()  if:    Two pages try to create a shared worker at once.  The worker starts up and exits before the second page's CreateWorker   happens.  A 3rd page creates the shared worker again.    In this situation  when the second page's CreateWorker finally shows up  it   will attach itself to the currently running shared worker  but won't add   itself to the worker's DocumentSet  so the worker can prematurely exit.    We need to copy over the SenderList from the pending instance when   creating a shared worker  then look for a matching sender in the list   before attaching to the new worker. </pre>
