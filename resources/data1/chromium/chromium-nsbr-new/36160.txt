<title>Issue 36160 -   chromium -    [FULLSCREEN-MODE]: Instead of fading in the menu-bar  the toolbar-Menus should be always visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.333.0 (39360)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): -  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): okay  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: -      1. SHIFT+CMD+F for fullscreenview  2. move the mouse cursor to the top of the screen    Result;  Tab-Bar  etc fade in. But there should not be the menu bar fading in. Instaed of this  the toolbar-  menus should be always visible in fullscreenmode. It would save the space over the Tab-Bar. (By   the way  the space over the Tab-Bar looks not very pretty)    Thanks and regards  Mehmet </pre>
