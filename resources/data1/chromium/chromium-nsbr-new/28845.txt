<title>Issue 28845 -   chromium -    Quicktime plugin tests timeout on official tests builder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://chrome-master.mtv:8010/builders/official%20release%20tests/builds/438/steps/webkit_tests/logs/stdio">http://chrome-master.mtv:8010/builders/official%20release%20tests/builds/438/steps/webkit_tests/logs/stdio</a>    On the official release test builder  the following tests timeout consistently:    Regressions: Unexpected timeouts (2):    LayoutTests/fast/dom/object-embed-plugin-scripting.html = TIMEOUT    LayoutTests/fast/dom/object-plugin-hides-properties.html = TIMEOUT    Both tests depend on QuickTime. I've updated to the latest version of QT  but it hasn't fixed the tests. Maybe the machine   needs a reboot after the upgrade?    I'm going to mark these as TIMEOUT in test_expectations.txt on the 249 branch so that the redness of the test step does not   hide new failures. </pre>
