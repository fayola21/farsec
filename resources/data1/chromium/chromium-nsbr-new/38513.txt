<title>Issue 38513 -   chromium -    Add new master_preferences preference for accelerating &quot;default browser infobar&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the &quot;Make Chrome/Chromium your default browser?&quot; infobar appears   on the second launch.  This should be configurable so that it will appear on   first launch  as in some channels it is more appropriate to show the first   time the browser launches.    This behavior would need to be turned into a preference that is propogated   through installerdata parameters to master_preferences. </pre>
