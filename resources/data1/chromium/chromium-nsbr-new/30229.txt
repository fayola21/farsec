<title>Issue 30229 -   chromium -    Clicking After Redirection Makes Chrome Forget the Previous URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27      1. Open a new tab.  2. Go to a page that has a link to a known redirector.  Let's call this   http://site1/  3. Click the link.  Let's call this a link to http://site2/ that responds   with a 302 site redirect to http://site3/  4. Now assume site3 has a link to site2.  Click on the link to site2.      Site1 and Site3 should now be listed in the Back button history.      Only Site1 is listed in the Back button history :O    Enjoy   Robert Chapin </pre>
