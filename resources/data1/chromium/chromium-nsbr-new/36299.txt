<title>Issue 36299 -   chromium -    No way to disable all extensions with one click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/    The chrome://extensions/ screen needs to provide an option to disable all   extensions in one click.      Perhaps have a button or link next to Developer Mode that says &quot;Disable All   Extensions&quot;.      No such button nor option exists. </pre>
