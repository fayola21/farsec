<title>Issue 42335 -   chromium -    Memory leak - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open browser  2. restore all my tabs  3. wait        Normal browsing        Guys. I see a memory leak. The memory foot print increases monotonously    and after a few hours the machine is swamper and I have to kill Chrome. I   have 4GB of RAM and appropriate swap size.    I constantly hold about ~ 30 open tabs. All the time. When ever I open the   browser I restore the previous tabs. Some are dynamic [like gmail] and some   are static and are pretty old on my browser. They can be several months   old.     Initial memory size is several hundreds of MB [which is fine with me].  Behavior was perfect till a few weeks ago; now  memory size keeps growing.    <b>Please provide
