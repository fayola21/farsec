<title>Issue 39368 -   chromium -    Make appcache work with workers. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are two parts to this  dedicated workers vs shared workers.    Dedicated Workers  * The worker resource itself (the script file) should be loaded thru the same   appcache as its parent.  * Subresource loads performed by the dedicated worker should also be loaded   thru the same appcache as its parent.  * The appcache scritpable interface need not be available in the decidated   worker context (although nothing says it can't be made available there too).    Shared Workers  * The worker resource should not be loaded thru the parents appcache. This case   is much more like a subframe navigation than a subresource load.  * Cache selection and the triggering of a cache update should be performed just   as it is for frame navigations.  * Subresource loads performed by the shared worker should go thru the selected   cache for that shared worker (again just like for frames).  * The scriptable interface needs to be available in the shared worker context. </pre>
