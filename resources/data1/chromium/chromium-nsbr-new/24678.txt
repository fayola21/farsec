<title>Issue 24678 -   chromium -    Ctrl + arrow keys have buggy interactions with auto-complete in the omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Exact repro steps are tricky  but here's the gist:    I have entries in my history for various ports on my machine  e.g.   &quot;localhost:1234&quot; and &quot;localhost:5678&quot;.    1) Open a new tab.  2) Type &quot;localhost&quot; into the omnibar. Chrome has auto-completed to   &quot;localhost:1234&quot; but I want to go to &quot;localhost:5678&quot;. Various other auto-  complete entries are still visible below the omnibar.  3) Press the &quot;end&quot; key or the right arrow key to go to the end of the auto-  completed &quot;localhost:1234&quot;.  4) Press &quot;ctrl shift left-arrow&quot; to attempt to highlight the port &quot;1234&quot;.  5) Upon either pressing or releasing the ctrl key  the text in the omnibar   is reset to &quot;localhost&quot;  namely to what I typed without any auto-complete.    Basically pressing and releasing the ctrl key changes which auto-complete   entry is being used  which interferes with the user using the ctrl key and   arrow keys to jump to a place in the url they want to edit.      If I open a new tab and start by typing &quot;aaaa&quot; and let it autocomplete to   &quot;aaaa:1111/aaaa&quot;  but I actually want to go to &quot;aaaa:2222/aaaa&quot;  so I hit   &quot;end&quot; and then &quot;ctrl+left&quot; a few times to move the cursor back word by   word  then when I let go of ctrl I get reset back to &quot;aaaa&quot;.              <b>Please provide
