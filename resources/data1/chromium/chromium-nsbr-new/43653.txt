<title>Issue 43653 -   chromium -    NSFileViewer ignored in OSX - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 6.0.399.0 (46782)  URLs : none  Other browsers tested:       Safari 4: OK          1. PathFinder installed  and configured as Default File Viewer  2. Download a file in Chromium  3. In the status bar  select the file and click on &quot;Show in Finder&quot; submenu (or maybe &quot;Reveal In   Finder&quot;. Sorry  not using english version)  4. Chromiun always opens Finder.app        Open the file viewer configured in the default NSFileViewer system property     For instance: If PathFinder (a finder alternative) is installed  it can be configured to be the default  file viewer. When that's done  in Safari 4.0 the menu &quot;Reveal in Finder&quot; opens the directory in   PathFinder instead of Finder.app          Even if the system default file viewer is another app  Finder.app is always used.      System Configuration: Mac OS X 10.6.3 on a iMac with 3 gigs of RAM; I use the Spanis-language   UI. </pre>
