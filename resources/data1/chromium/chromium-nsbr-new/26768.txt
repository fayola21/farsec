<title>Issue 26768 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Input fields lose focus on alert popups  regain it when popup closed - very bad if onFocus calls alert() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/undeadpopup.html">http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/undeadpopup.html</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x: OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Don't know      1. Click in a text field that has an onFocus handler that calls alert()  2. Dismiss the alert popup  3. Notice that the handler is called again  resulting in another popup...        The popup displays only once.        The popup is repeatedly displayed  preventing the tab from being closed  and even   from quitting the browser. The only escape is to click in some other text field before   dismissing the popup. Assuming  that is  that there is another input field to click in.    The problem appears to be that the input field loses focus to display the popup  or   more accurately  that it regains focus when the popup is dismissed. The popup   should not affect the focus state of the input fields of the tab contents  so that it   never loses the focus to begin with and the onFocus handler will be invoked only   once. </pre>
