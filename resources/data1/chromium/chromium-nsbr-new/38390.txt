<title>Issue 38390 -   chromium -    Cleartext password submit warning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  we don't warn users that a password field will be submitted in  cleartext.  Glen did a mock of a balloon warning we could show to warn  people http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/88_passwords/1/#password_warning.png    Suggested alternate text:    &quot;This password cannot be sent securely and will be viewable by others while  in transit.  You should not log in here if you're on public WiFi or any  network accessible to strangers.&quot; </pre>
