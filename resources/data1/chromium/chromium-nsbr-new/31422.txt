<title>Issue 31422 -   chromium -    Feature: Flash cross-scripting inside Chrome extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature: Flash cross-scripting inside Chrome extensions    It would be nice if flash content inside the extension would not be   restricted to same origin policy.    I wrote a bug at <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-3557">https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-3557</a> too.    Hope to see this in the future if there is collaboration between the Chrome   team and the Flash Player team.     </pre>
