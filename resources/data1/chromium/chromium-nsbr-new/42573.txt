<title>Issue 42573 -   chromium -    [Native Translator] Add link to URL for sharing translated page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac 5.0.375.17 (Official Build 45275) dev  Area-UI  Feature-Translate    Feature suggestion: Currently when you use the native translator for a web page  it doesn't   change the URL shown in the address bar  so I can't easily share the translation with a friend.    In contrast if you use the Google Translate bookmarklet  it gives you a new URL you can copy and   paste into an email to share.    It would be great if there was a &quot;Link&quot; link in the translate bar that would provide a   translate.google.com URL you could copy to the clipboard and paste into an email  e.g.   <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?">http://translate.google.com/translate?</a>  u=<a href="http://www.google.co.jp/&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8">http://www.google.co.jp/&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8</a>    This would be similar to the &quot;Link&quot; link on Maps. We shouldn't show the link if the page cannot be   translated using the web-based Google Translate (e.g. SSL  intranet pages).       </pre>
