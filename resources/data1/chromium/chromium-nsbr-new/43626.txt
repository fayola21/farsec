<title>Issue 43626 -   chromium -    Change in maps coordinate values in the URL shouldn't be captured in the history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to maps.google.com - It'll take me to   <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.0625 -95.677068&amp;spn=53.829089 79.013672&amp;z=4">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.0625 -95.677068&amp;spn=53.829089 79.013672&amp;z=4</a>  2. Zoom in/out of the map    What is the expected output?   History should just contain a single entry for maps.google.com    What do you see instead?  History gets filled up with all the of the URLs that have change in coordinates    Please see the attached image </pre>
