<title>Issue 24929 -   chromium -    Make it easier to change autoreload settings on buildbot waterfall. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Check in some code  then visit the buildbot page. If you care about seeing   updates (i.e. seeing if you broke something) auto-reload is actually useful   in this case.    It'd be cool if there were a link on the buildbot page like the collapse link   that turns on auto-reload and remembers this state in a cookie. The cookie   can expire after 2-3 hours. </pre>
