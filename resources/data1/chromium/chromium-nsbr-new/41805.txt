<title>Issue 41805 -   chromium -    SPDY unittests for compression and compression failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is an offshoot from this bug:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41803">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41803</a>    The unit test framework currently doesn't test with compression (for ease of   frame composition verification).  Need to update the tests to be able to run   with a compressed mode.    Also test the case where the Compressor fails in spdy_session::WriteSocket(). </pre>
