<title>Issue 41923 -   chromium -    Unexpected hover effect on window close/minimise/maximise when hovering on bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Open any new tab or web page  2. Enable the bookmarks bar to be permanently displayed  3. Ensure at least one bookmark is in the bookmarks bar  4. Hover over one of the bookmarks or folders in the bookmarks bar  5. Observe close/minimise/maximise buttons in top left of Chrome window      - a mouseover effect on the bookmark or bookmark folder that was hovered over      - in addition to the expected mouseover effect on the bookmark or folder hovered over  the hover   effect is displayed on the close/maximise/minimise buttons as well.   - I have not observed this happening when hovering over any area of the window other than the   buttons where it should happen and the bookmarks previously mentioned - even hovering over a   blank part of the bookmarks bar does not display this behaviour    (screenshot shows mouse hovering on Reader bookmark) </pre>
