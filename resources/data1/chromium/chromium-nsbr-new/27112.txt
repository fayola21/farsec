<title>Issue 27112 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't support any accessibility for web contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hit cmd-f5 to turn on voice over  2. Go to google.com  focus search box  3. Hit tab to move focus to search button.        Voice over should say &quot;Google seach box&quot; and then &quot;Search button&quot; or   similar. See e.g. Safari.        Chrome's web contents is a black hole for a11n. This makes chrome   unusable for people who depend on screen readers    cc'ing people who I've heard say &quot;a11n&quot; in the past.    Fixing this probably automatically fixes the services menu as well. </pre>
