<title>Issue 34155 -   chromium -    Zipped executable files are downloaded without a security warning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Description:  Like on Gmail  I expected Google Chrome to validate the contents of a  zipped file and show a security warning in case it has an executable file  before downloading it - as it happens if we try to download an executable  file directly.    Testing Environment:  Windows 7 Professional   Google Chrome 4.0.249.78    Pre-condition:  None.    Steps to Reproduce:  1. Open Google Chrome.  2. Try to download a zipped executable file.    Expected Results vs Results Obtained:  - No security warning is shown and malicious code can be executed  inadvertently.      </pre>
