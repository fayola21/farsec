The page with a picture should be opened.      The page is opened  but no picture and comments are loaded.      This issue happens with my chrome browser since I updated it to 4 version.   It happens on picasaweb.google.com and maps.google.com web sites.  You may find a screenshot in attachment.    The same problem occurs to all my colleagues who have Chrome 4 and above.    Please fix the issue so I could use my favorite Chrome with picasaweb and   google maps.    If you have any additional questions you can contact my via   bugaudin.ramazanov@gmail.com.    Thank you very much in advance.  Best regards   Bugaudin Ramazanov.     </pre>
