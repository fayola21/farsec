<title>Issue 38158 -   chromium -    Chromium 5.0.351 crashes at random moments of time (segfault in libsync.so) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Just to start /usr/bin/chromium-browser .        No crashes after starting up.        1. At the random moments of time (usually in few secs after start up  but  usually all seems well after these startup seconds) Chromium crashes;  2. It happened right after my recent upgrade from  chromium-5.0.330.0-0.1.20100218svn39394.fc11.1.x86_64 to  chromium-5.0.351.0-0.1.20100218svn39394.fc11.x86_64. I did not encounter  these problems before this upgrade.      <b>Please provide
