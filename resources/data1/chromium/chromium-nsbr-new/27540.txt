<title>Issue 27540 -   chromium -    Add an item to the web master FAQ about EOT - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Support sites using EOT fonts and font encoding with the on-the-fly transformation to Unicode"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14948">issue 14948</a> has a lot of dupes. Most of them are Indian web sites. There's   a long standing webkit bug to support them with the on-the-fly conversion   of 'font-hack-encoded' byte sequences to real Unicode.     However  we can also evangelize them away.    They use EOT fonts which are only supported by IE. A lot of them also offer   a free download of the corresponding TTF/OTF (EOT is a thin wrapper over   TTF/OTF).      They all have     @font-face {    font-family: Family Foo;    src: url(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot&quot;);">http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot&quot;);</a>  }    Then  they use 'Family Foo' in the rest of documents.     Because no other browser supports EOT while they do support straightforward   TTF/OTF. What web authors can do is (unless they don't want TTF/OTF   versions to be downloaded by visitors)  to use the following CSS snippet    instead:    @font-face {    font-family: Family Foo;    src: local(&quot;Family Foo)          url(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot">http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot</a>&quot; format(&quot;embedded-  opentype&quot;)          url(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/font/foo.ttf">http://www.example.com/font/foo.ttf</a>&quot; format(&quot;truetype&quot;)  }    What the above does is to ask a browser to look for a font family 'Family   Foo&quot; locally. If it's not available locally  it downloads it from the url   given in the second line if it (IE) supports EOT. Otherwise (chrome    safari  firefox  opera)  it downloads it from the url in the 3rd line.    In theory  the above snippet should work well. However  even some versions   of IE may not like comma separated fallback list of src field.     To avoid a potential problem with IE  what one can do is to detect a   browser and write a different output in JS.     if (isIE)      fontsrc = 'url(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot">http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot</a>&quot; format(&quot;embedded-  opentype&quot;)';  else      fontsrc = 'local(&quot;Family Foo&quot;)    url(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot">http://www.example.com/font/foo.eot</a>&quot; format(&quot;truetype&quot;)';    document.write('&lt;style&gt; @font-face....... src: ' + fontsrc + '} &lt;/style&gt;');    Alternatively  they can also use IE-hack noation in CSS directly.         Initially  I wanted to ask Johny to write up and add this to the web master   FAQ  but I ended up writing a rough draft. If you like adding this  I'll   finish and send it your way (if that's the way to add this to the FAQ. Or    should I send directly to Fiona with your blessing?)          </pre>
