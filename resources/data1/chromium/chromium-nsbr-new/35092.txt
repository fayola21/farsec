<title>Issue 35092 -   chromium -    When cookie prompt dialog is closed with details open  it's glitchy when next opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ...the dialog is the &quot;with details&quot; size but the &quot;without details&quot; content.    I believe Windows' standard behavior in this case is to always hide the   details  but I'll have to check to be sure. </pre>
