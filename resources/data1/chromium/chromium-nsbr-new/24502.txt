<title>Issue 24502 -   chromium -    No docking positions on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8  U    1.Drag a tab to a spot where a docking would be in Windows...  2....      Don't know if there are plans to implement this on Linux (or on the Mac  or   even if it already works on the Mac). But on Windows  I  for one  use and   love those docking positions. Or maybe you have more elaborate plans for   screen-space/tab management in the forthcoming os. </pre>
