<title>Issue 36558 -   chromium -    chrome eats 404 pages  doesn't show any custom messages to user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 beta          Firefox 3.x: OK    I'm trying to load a site on my intranet and it is coming back with a 404   error. In addition to the 404 HTTP status  I also happen to know that this   site returns content with an error message explaining what went wrong.    Unfortunately  chrome eats the 404 error and gives me a generic search page   instead. I had to switch to firefox to get around this.    This sucks for 2 reasons:  1. There appears to be no way to send both the correct HTTP status and a   user-visible message. So now I have to choose...do I return 200 with a   helpful message? or 404 without a message?  Terrible...this encourages web   page authors to mis-use HTTP.    2. Chrome's default 404 offers to do a google search which is rather   arrogant  especially when I'm loading a private site that google can't   possibly crawl.     </pre>
