<title>Issue 41864 -   chromium -    Trailing slash from copy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 44860  URLs (if applicable) : ANY  Other browsers tested: Since the change of removing &quot;http:// from the   Omnibar.      1. Type any web address  2. After the page loads  copy the URL.  3. Paste in another application.      The expected result should be  if I visited Google's main page would be   &quot;www.google.com/&quot;. However  the trailing slash seems a bit unbalanced  and   is visually unappealing. Removing &quot;http:// from the URL is fine  but the   trailing slash should also be picked up. &quot;www.google.com&quot; pasted from the   web object in the clipboard would be more satisfactory.   </pre>
