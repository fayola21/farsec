<title>Issue 39461 -   chromium -    Chrome beta 5.0.342.7 unpinned my tabs and lacks pin tab feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7    OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Updated to this version of chrome. At the time I had 4 pinned tabs  2. Close Chrome  3. Re-open Chrome      I should still have four pinned tabs.      My previously-pinned tabs are now normal tabs  and the pin tab option is gone from the tab   context menue    I know that this feature was disabled in the developer channel; I specifically downgraded to the   beta channel to retain it until the replacement was ready. Is there any way to re-enable it   somehow? </pre>
