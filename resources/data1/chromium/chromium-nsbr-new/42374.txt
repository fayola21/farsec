<title>Issue 42374 -   chromium -    ChromeTestSuite::ShutDown() deletes parent directory of user_data_dir  potentially leading to significant data loss - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run any chrome unit test  with a user_data_dir that is located within an   existing directory  that contains other files / subdirectories. For   example  run the following test from the command line:    src/chrome/debug/sync_integration_tests.exe  --sync-  url=http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; --sync-user-for-test=&lt;username&gt; --sync-password-  for-test=&lt;password&gt; --gtest_filter=SingleClientLiveBookmarksSyncTest.Sanity   --user-data-dir=&quot;C:Users&lt;username&gt;DocumentsChromium test data&quot;      After the test runs  only &quot;C:Users&lt;username&gt;DocumentsChromium test   data&quot; is deleted.      After the test runs  &quot;C:Users&lt;username&gt;Documents&quot; and all the other   files and directories within are also deleted. For an unsuspecting person   who runs a unit test for the first time  and chooses a directory within   their home directory or their &quot;my documents&quot; folder  this could lead to   significant data loss.    <b>Please provide
