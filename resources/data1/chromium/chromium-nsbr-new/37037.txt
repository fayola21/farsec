<title>Issue 37037 -   chromium -    Cookie checking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Oficjalna wersja 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://myih.eu/">http://myih.eu/</a> <a href="http://www.myih.eu/">http://www.myih.eu/</a>           Safari 4: NO TESTED    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: NO TESTED           IE 8: OK      1. Create cookie for domains: www.myih.eu and myih.eu  2. After logout script will delete cookie from domain myih.eu  3. In new page refresh - Chrome also checking cookie from www.myih.eu -   when it found cookie  it &quot;transfer&quot; on demand the cookie data to PHP   script  which tray to autologin user.  4. So script always have cookie  and cannot delete it from domain   www.myih.eu  so always user is login  and there is no method to logout   (expect manual delete cookie from domain www.myih.eu)      Not checking existing cookie from other domain  then it real is.   </pre>
