<title>Issue 26900 -   chromium -    Chrome hangs when a page wants to open several http auth sheets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.1    Some internal site wants to open several http auth sheets  which greatly   confuses chrome (== makes the browser process hang).    This is probably caused by a page requesting resources that also have WWW-  Authenticate set? The http sheets probably need to be kept in a queue  and   only one should be active at a time. How do the other platforms handle this? </pre>
