<title>Issue 30887 -   chromium -    flash pointer icon issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Google Chrome	4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)   WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.30 Safari/532.5    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.pastelportal.com/stories/game.php?">http://www.pastelportal.com/stories/game.php?</a>  id=10gnomes_02  and other games at pastelportal.com  but I'll stick to this one.      Firefox 3.5.6 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 OK  Safari v4.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 OK         1. Go to the website above and wait for the cute game to load.  2. Click &quot;play&quot; (bottom of game window  in the middle).  3. Attempt to play the game. The object is to search for ten hidden gnomes   in a &quot;maze&quot; of pictures. You navigate the maze by moving your mouse   around the picture  and the pointer should change from an arrow icon to a   hand icon when you're close to a &quot;new room&quot; into which you can move.        When the pointer is at a key area in the picture  the mouse icon should   change from an arrow to a hand  as it does in firefox and safari.        In Chrome  the change does not occur  making the game (and many of the   other flash games on the site  for example &quot;submachine&quot;) unplayable.    I'm afraid I can't attach a screenshot because I don't know how to include   the mouse icon in a screenshot! Command-Shift-3 doesn't work.    I contacted the author who said that he couldn't believe his code was at   fault because there was essentially &quot;nothing there to be wrong&quot;. I imagine   that it's the same version of flash running in all three browsers  so I figure   that this is a chrome issue.   </pre>
