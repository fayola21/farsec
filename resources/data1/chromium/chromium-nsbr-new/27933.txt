<title>Issue 27933 -   chromium -    Installer/updater change to support another official build option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to add an official build option that can be installed/updated side by   side with current Google Chrome and Chromium on user's machine.    Change in installer/updater:    - Install to different path.    - Make sure setting default browser handle the new branding correctly.    See <a title="Daily Auto-Updating Google Chrome Build"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22158">issue 22158</a> for more background.     </pre>
