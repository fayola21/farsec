<title>Issue 29954 -   chromium -    No way to remove Chrome app from Ubuntu app menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.266.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33992">r33992</a>)  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)        1. Page menu &gt; Create application shortcuts.  2. In &quot;Create Application Shortcuts&quot; dialog  make sure &quot;Applications Menu&quot;   is checked.  3. Hit &quot;Create&quot; button.  4. Note that menu item is created in Ubuntu Applications Menu under the   &quot;Internet&quot; sub-menu.    What is the expected output?    There should be a way to remove the Chrome application from the menu.    What do you see instead?    There is an &quot;Add/Remove&quot; item on the menu  but Chrome apps are not listed   there.  Chrome apps could be listed there ... there should be some way to   remove them.   </pre>
