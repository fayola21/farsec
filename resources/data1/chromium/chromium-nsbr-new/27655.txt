Create an extension and add   <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/inbox/recent/inbox/">https://www.google.com/voice/inbox/recent/inbox/</a> to the permissions.    Create a background page.  2. Have the background page download    <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/inbox/recent/inbox/">https://www.google.com/voice/inbox/recent/inbox/</a> using XMLHTTPRequest and   put up an alert() or something when it finishes.  3. Log in to Google Voice.  4. Restart your browser (strangely enough if you have visited Google Voice   during this browser session there is no problem  only if you are logged in   but haven't visited this session) and load the extension.

The XMLHTTPRequest will never trigger onreadystatechange past readyState ==       <b>Please provide
