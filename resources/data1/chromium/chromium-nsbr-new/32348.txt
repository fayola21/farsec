<title>Issue 32348 -   chromium -    selected:true closes browser action popup in windows  but not in linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using chrome.tabs.create or chrome.tabs.update with selected:true closes the   popup in Windows. This is so far maybe not a bug. If it wasn't for the fact   that this is not the case in Linux  where the popup stays open.    I recently started work on an extension in Linux  which I had to change   quite a bit after I tested it in Windows and noticed it doesn't work as   excepted. I suspect there might actually be a few extensions in the gallery    made by unsuspecting developers in Linux  affected by this problem.    Personally I prefer the popup to be not closed  but if it is then it should   be the same on all operating systems.    This was tested with 4.0.297.0 in Linux and 4.0.295.0 in Windows. </pre>
