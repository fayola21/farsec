<title>Issue 43148 -   chromium -    Mac: browser_tests failing to load MainMenu.nib ... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ... and consequently running without an app controller. Probably some other tests as well (ui_tests?   not sure).    It's amazing that these tests ostensibly &quot;work&quot; and pass.    I have a fix  but just fixing the nib loading makes browser_tests die horribly. I think I have a fix for   that as well. We'll see what the trybots say about it. </pre>
