<title>Issue 29632 -   chromium -    Download arrow should not show up for extension install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> UI team  please comment...    It is distracting to have the big download arrow flash  especially since many   times extensions download so fast you don't even see them.    There has been discussion about not showing the arrow if we can calculate   that it looks like it's going to take more than xxx ms  but I think that is   going to be hard  particularly since the arrow is supposed to start   immediately.    I think it would be simpler to just not show the arrow at all for extensions.  </pre>
