<title>Issue 30446 -   chromium -    Mouse pointer flickers instead of disappearing when watching a fullscreen flash video. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : Hulu  OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x: Mouse pointer disappears after a few seconds of   inactivity when watching a flash video.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Mouse pointer disappears after a few seconds of   inactivity when watching a flash video.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: I have not investigated this.      1.  Go to Hulu.com  2.  Click on a video to watch.  3.  Set the video to fullscreen.  4.  Let the mouse pointer sit idle for a few seconds.      The mouse pointer should disappear.      The mouse pointer flickers.    Note:  Sometimes the pointer does disappear.  Other times it does not.  I'm not   sure of the distinguishing factor between the two situations. </pre>
