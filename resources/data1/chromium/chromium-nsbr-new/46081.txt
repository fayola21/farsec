<title>Issue 46081 -   chromium -    Offline data type manager is very sensitive to syncer thread event cycle  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current data type manager design relies on several cues from the syncer  some of which have to occur in very specific orders. Rearranging the operating conditions of the syncer thread can cause the DTM to not properly start up when offline. This is because the DTM doesn't really consider offline login. We should refactor some of the dependencies so that there's less flaky event ordering going on.    The DTM requires a syncer pause  waits for syncer startup  and needs to watch the syncer go through a full cycle after completing a reconfigure. Since the syncer thread expects not to run unless there's a network connection  the particular ordering is extremely flaky.  </pre>
