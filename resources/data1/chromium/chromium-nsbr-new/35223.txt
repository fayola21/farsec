<title>Issue 35223 -   chromium -    Our callback implementation needs improvement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice if we were able to do something like:    Callback&lt;...&gt; callback = NewCallback(foo  Foo::MyMethod  a  b  c);  ...  callback-&gt;Run(d  e  f);    I believe our NewCallback() calls require all arguments to be supplied at   Run()-time  and NewRunnableMethod() calls require all arguments to be   supplied at construction time (although that's legit since tasks are always run   without arguments).    Perhaps there was a deliberate decision not to support this... </pre>
