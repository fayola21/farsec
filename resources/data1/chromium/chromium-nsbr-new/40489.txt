<title>Issue 40489 -   chromium -    Mac &quot;open the following pages&quot; does not update when sync occurs and dialog is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac &quot;open the following pages&quot; does not update when sync occurs and dialog is open.  This is due to us disabling a notification response sent from the prefs backend because it caused an   infinite loop.    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1549020/diff/3003/7001">http://codereview.chromium.org/1549020/diff/3003/7001</a>    See line 952. This causes a pref write when the event controller responds. </pre>
