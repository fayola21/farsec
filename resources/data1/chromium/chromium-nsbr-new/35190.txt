<title>Issue 35190 -   chromium -    Do not make the Webkit Linux valgrind layout bot turn red for layout test failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Dimitri tells me that he asked you to make it so that the valgrind bots   don't turn red for layout test failures when there aren't also memory   errors.&quot;      I'll do this after <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/598013/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/598013/show</a> lands so we   can pass the test module name ('layout') down to the code that checks the   test run results.    I believe for other tests  we want to make sure the test run succeeded. </pre>
