<title>Issue 30010 -   chromium -    TCMalloc should use lazy allocation of its meta-data for pagemap - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently use a 2-level radix tree on 32 bit platforms for providing   pagemap info in tcmalloc.  This can fragment virtual space as additional   leaves are allocated.  To avoid the fragmentation  TCMalloc currently pre-  allocates all meta-data for the pagemap once it reaches about 120M of   allocations.    This should be changed to use a flat map  reserved at startup (so that it   can't fragment memory)  and then lazilly commit the map as needed.    On windows  this is a tad complex  but on Linux  this should be very simple. </pre>
