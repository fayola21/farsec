<title>Issue 42379 -   chromium -    gtk_chrome_shrinkable_hbox does not always show children that should be visisble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> gtk_chrome_shrinkable_hbox does not show previously hidden children if a   child widget    1) shrinks   2) hides   3) is destroyed    and there is now enough room to show another child. It only unhides   children when its allocation widens.    This affects the browser actions toolbar. Install 3 browser actions. Drag   the container so that two are showing. Right click + disable one of the   two. The third action should take its place  and the bookmark chevron   should go away. </pre>
