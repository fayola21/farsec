<title>Issue 44210 -   chromium -    Copied HTML content does not resolve URL fragments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Select some text to copy; text should include links  2. Paste into external app which accepts text/html  3. Be pleasantly surprised that was copied with links intact; hover over   link to check it  4. Discover that links to URLs which do not include a host have been copied   verbatim  so that I'm sending text with a link to /wiki/Alcoholic_beverage        All links exist in a context and some subset of those links only have an   absolute value when resolved with information from that context; when   passing the links outside that context  such links should have the URLs   fully expanded.    So the text would have looked the same when pasted  but   /wiki/Alcoholic_beverage would become   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage</a> and still be working links   when pasted into my IM client.        URLs unmodified  so lose semantic information needed for the resolution  so   have links which have no handler.  Adds much potential for confusion.    <b>Please provide
