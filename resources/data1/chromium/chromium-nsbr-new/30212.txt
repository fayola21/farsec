<title>Issue 30212 -   chromium -    worker-cloneport.html fails on valgrind occasionally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe this is due to it being too slow (it is a slow test in general).    We need to move this layout test to a separate &quot;slow&quot; gtest and exclude that test from valgrind.     </pre>
