<title>Issue 27156 -   chromium -    Extensions &quot;Successful installation&quot; bubble should have a close box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an extension is installed  a bubble appears confirming the install.   Currently  clicking on the bubble doesn't dismiss it and the only way to get   rid of it is to click somewhere else. We should just add a close box to the   upper right corner of the bubble. </pre>
