<title>Issue 45300 -   chromium -    Chrome sometimes loses 'Always on Visible Workspace' preference because of calendar notification - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the original bug report email:  I set Gnome window preference for Chrome to 'Always on Visible  Workspace'. The moment I get a notification from Google calendar I  seem to lose this window preference.    From a follow up email (different person):  I never suspected calendar notifications and after doing a few tests I  can definitely say it doesn't happen on *every* calendar notification  - I did ~10 trials and had it happen once.  I tried different  combinations of (window open vs minimized) * (calendar tab selected or  another tab)  of course the time it happened i wasn't paying  attention  and wasn't able to reproduce it again...  so  I dunno.    Not sure what WM the original reporter is using (says not compiz and not metacity).  The second   reporter says he uses metacity.    Consistent repro steps would help tracking this down.  Here's a page with a sample notification if   someone wants to try to repro:  <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/samples/notifications/quick/">http://www.html5rocks.com/samples/notifications/quick/</a>   </pre>
