<title>Issue 43459 -   chromium -    please bind a key to &quot;last tab&quot; for easy toggling between frequently used tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta    Please provide a key binding that (at least) swaps to the most recently used   tab and (ideally) lets me cycle through all tabs in MRU order  the way Alt-  Tab works in Windows.    (I'd personally like it if we just redefined Ctrl-Tab to work this way    instead of just advancing to the next tab as a synonym for Ctrl-PgDn  but I'd   be happy with anything that's easy to type.)    Motivation:  I often find myself wanting to switch back and forth between two tabs.  For   example  I may be composing an email in tab #1 that provides feedback on some   UI mocks open in tab #12. My ideal answer would be &quot;&lt;key&gt; switches to the MRU   tab&quot;  so I could just hit it to toggle between my mail and the mocks. I   sometimes work around it by pulling the mocks out into a separate window  and   then just using the OS Alt-Tab behavior  but that's a hack. </pre>
