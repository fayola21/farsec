<title>Issue 44701 -   chromium -    Text overflow/overlap in care2.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.375.53 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47719">r47719</a>)  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04    IE7: OK  FF3.5: OK  Chrome/Windows: OK      --------------------------------------  1. Go to <a href="http://www.care2.com">http://www.care2.com</a>.  2. Notice where number of members is displayed: top-left underneath the top   menu.  3. Also notice text overlap in left-hand menu.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  1. Number of members should not overflow its containing box (Chrome/Windows   looks OK).  2. Text from one line in left-hand menu should not wrap to the next line.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  1. Number of members overflows its containing box.   2. Text from one line in left-hand menu wraps to the next line (&quot;favorite   school contest&quot; and &quot;free click to donate&quot;)  causing text overlap.    See attached picture.  Looks like a font-size issue.   </pre>
