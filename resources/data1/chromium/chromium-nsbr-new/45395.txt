<title>Issue 45395 -   chromium -    Problems and crashes with large image data URI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796) beta      Firefox 3.x: Usable although slow.     The data URI scheme provides a way to embed images inline in html code.  &lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64 ...&quot; /&gt;  When the image data is large (e.g. several megabytes)  chrome cannot handle   it well. With the attached html page  on my Windows 7 PC (AMD Athlon 64 X2   2.26G  3GB DDR2 667 RAM)  1. It takes about 5 seconds to load and display the image.   2. Memory usage is large. 100MB for the tab process. 180MB for the   inspector.  3. Right click on the image  the context menu never shows.  4. The Developer Tool becomes unresponsive.  5. Trying to use the inspector may cause the inspector and the tab process   to crash.  6. Dragging the image causes instant crash.    The issue affects extensions that support full page screen shot. A full   page screen shot is likely to produce a large image. </pre>
