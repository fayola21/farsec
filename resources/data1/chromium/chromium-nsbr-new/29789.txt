<title>Issue 29789 -   chromium -    Catch SIGILL to emulate LAHF on behalf of Flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See this code snippet for a clever workaround for a Flash bug.    <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=535548#22">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=535548#22</a>    Maybe we should implement this ourselves.    Mark added: &quot;Handling lahf in software when it's not available in hardware   doesn't seem harmful.  SIGILL caused by other illegal instructions will   still cause death  although I'd prefer to arrange to re-raise SIGILL or at   least _exit(SIGILL | (1 &lt;&lt; 7)) instead of exiting via abort().&quot;      Copying the code snippet below.  We should probably mail the author to ask   about copyrights before just grabbing it. </pre>
