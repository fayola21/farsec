<title>Issue 25563 -   chromium -    Windows: having bookmarks bar folder open when JavaScript closes window causes crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. ensure that the bookmarks bar is visible (Ctrl-B)  2. in a window with single tab  open test.html (attached  from   crbug.com/25462)  3. within 5 seconds  click on a bookmarks bar folder button (to display the   corresponding menu; an empty folder is fine); don't click on any item  4. wait until 5 seconds have elapsed (from step 2)      Probably the contents of the tab should be frozen while the menu is up  so   the window shouldn't disappear while the menu is up. Instead  it crashes. </pre>
