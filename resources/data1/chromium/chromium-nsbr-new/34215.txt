<title>Issue 34215 -   chromium -    ��_��_��_Q doesn't ask for confirmation that I want to close Incognito Mode windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev  OS version               : Leopard      1. Open a window.  2. Open a second window or tab.  3. Press ��_��_��_Q      Prompt to ask if I want to quit.      Quits without prompting.    This is especially annoying when I have a bunch of Incognito Mode tabs   open  since those can't be automatically re-opened. </pre>
