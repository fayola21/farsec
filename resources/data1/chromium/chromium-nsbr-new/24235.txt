<title>Issue 24235 -   chromium -    Make About dialog non-modal (so you can work while updating) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Official Build 27713)      1. Choose &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; from the wrench menu  2. If an update's available  click &quot;Update Now&quot;  3. Try to use the browser while the update is downloaded and installed in the   background    At this point you can't focus the main browser window  so Chrome is unusable   for the few seconds/minutes it takes to update.    Yes  I'm deliberately filing a duplicate of <a title="About dialog blocks parent window."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20361">Issue 20361</a>.  I am a bad person. </pre>
