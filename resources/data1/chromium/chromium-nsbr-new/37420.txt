<title>Issue 37420 -   chromium -    Add command-line flag to enable update-time experiments  disabled by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the toast picks up on several cues whether it should appear  and   only happens on an update.    However  since the toast shouldn't appear yet  and we also want the toast to   only happen at very specific releases  we should add a new flag to setup.exe   to trigger the toast.    I suspect adding it will be straightforward: the update logic will look for   this new parameter (preference) and only call LaunchUserExperiment if it is   present.    Perhaps it should be named --enable-experiment? </pre>
