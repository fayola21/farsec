<title>Issue 45903 -   chromium -    Place source URL of DownloadFile in extended attributes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As is already done on Mac OS X  I would be very happy if DownloadFile put   the source URL of a DownloadFile in the extended attributes of the file on   disk. I find it useful for scripts which categorize downloads. It seems very   easy to implement  and I have done so myself  but I can't get it to work for   me due to problems with building - besides  I think it would be a generally   useful feature which costs almost no time to implement. </pre>
