<title>Issue 39839 -   chromium -    chrome://bookmarks should be override-able - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See:  <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/override.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/override.html</a>    Since we have most of the APIs needed to make your own bookmark manager   replacement  we should consider adding chrome://bookmarks to the list of   pages that can be overridden (newtab today and history shortly).    There's a history change landing soon which will enforce only one override   per extension  so at a minimum I'd wait until that one lands before doing   anything here.   </pre>
