<title>Issue 31533 -   chromium -    Change &quot;Copy link address&quot; to &quot;Copy link URL&quot; in context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This coincides better with &quot;Copy image URL&quot; in the same menu and is easier to   find  for me anyway. Firefox uses &quot;Copy link location&quot; and IE uses &quot;Copy   Shortcut&quot; so there is no standard to adhere to.   </pre>
