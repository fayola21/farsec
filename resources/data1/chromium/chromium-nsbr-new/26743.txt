<title>Issue 26743 -   chromium -    Disable create application shortcuts for new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open  a new tab page  2. Go to page menu &gt; Create application shortcut (desktop or both)      In Windows  the dialog that specifies where to create the shortcut doesn't  show up.   At least  have it disabled if it's not supposed to do anything.    In Linux (4.0.229.1)  a new tab app shortcut is created. When you open the  app shortcut  and click on any of the thumbnails  the page is opened in  a  new tab.       </pre>
