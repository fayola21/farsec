<title>Issue 42829 -   chromium -    Omnibox still displaying https: on SSL-secured sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to an SSL-secured URL.  2.

The https: is not displayed  because it is also implicit and unnecessary--  Chromium already shows that the connection is SSL secured by using the   green padlock icon instead of the globe icon  and https is the normal   protocol for a secure web site.        The https: is displayed at the start of the URL  right next to the green   padlock icon. This is completely redundant.    <b>Please provide
