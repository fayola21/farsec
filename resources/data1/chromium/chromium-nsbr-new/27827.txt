<title>Issue 27827 -   chromium -    Font settings does not match other freetype/pango-based applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.247.0-alt1.<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32001">r32001</a>  OS + version : ALT Linux Sisyphus  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): i586  window manager : WindowMaker      1. In ~/.gtkrc-2.0 default_font set to &quot;Liberation Sans 9&quot; (works nice in   106x106 DPI).  2. Open Language and Font Preferences  try to select &quot;Liberation Sans&quot; that   would looks same.      &quot;Liberation Sans 9&quot; should match dialog font.      &quot;Liberation Sans 9&quot; is way too small  closest matching setting is   &quot;Liberation Sans 14&quot;.    I will not apologize for non-latin letters on screenshot since Chromium   ignores my LC_MESSAGES=C settings. </pre>
