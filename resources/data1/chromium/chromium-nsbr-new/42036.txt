<title>Issue 42036 -   chromium -    Extensions:  Browser-Action Popup not reporting size correctly via window DOM object during onload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Load the extension attached to this issue.  2.  Click on the browser-action button.  3.  Observe the size of the window.        The window should report a non-zero size  and top corner.        The window reports a size of (0 0)  and a corner position of (0 0).    This is because the window.{screenTop  screenLeft  outerWidth  and   outerHeight} properties do not return correct values during the onload   callback.    The same problem manifests itself when displaying the pop-up via the   experimental extension popup API.    <b>Please provide
