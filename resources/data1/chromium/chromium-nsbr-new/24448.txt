<title>Issue 24448 -   chromium -    12ms warm startup perf regression from static syncapi - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There was a 12ms regression in warm startup on the bots (see vista perf here:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/vista-release-dual-</a>  core/startup/report.html?history=125    ) with my change to static link syncapi (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28112">r28112</a>).    We expected a small perf hit  but 12ms is relatively massive for code that   shouldn't be getting executed.  My first hunch would be that we load   pthread.dll immediately without knowing it -- fortunately that DLL is on its   last legs.    Still  we should do an A/B startup perf comparison by compiling with and   without the sync feature enabled  and we should also inspect the code for any   statically initialized objects.  We could also look to see if the pthread-  elimination change causes a startup perf boost. </pre>
