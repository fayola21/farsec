<title>Issue 31472 -   chromium -    Can't save about:blank pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.289.0 (Build 35441) Ubuntu    <a href="https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagelinks.html#linked_images">https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagelinks.html#linked_images</a>      Firefox 3.5: OK      1. Visit a page with thumbnails linking to jpeg files.  2. Use the &quot;linked images&quot; bookmarklet (see url above).  3. The bookmarklet opens a page where thumbnails are expanded into full-size   pictures.  4. The page can't be saved.        The page is saved to disk.        The menu option to save the page is greyed out. Ctrl-S is unresponsive.  The page url is about:blank in both chromium and firefox. That doesn't   prevent firefox from saving the page.   </pre>
