<title>Issue 42584 -   chromium -    Should not allow background downloads. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 375.23    Filing this now  as this becomes ugly in Win-7.    As per <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3426&amp;#c8">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3426&amp;#c8</a>  we should   not allow background downloads.    -Download an exe.  -Even user don't respond to the dangerous confirmation bar  we actually start   downloading the file.    So with this behavior in Win7  the progress status shows up on Taskbar   button  which looks ugly. </pre>
