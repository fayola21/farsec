<title>Issue 35124 -   chromium -    Cannot resize pictures in Google &quot;my maps&quot; using mouse by clicking on picture. Need to edit html. Other browsers can do via mouse. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (36714)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.5.7 OK  IE 8.0.6001.18702          Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. Create a map in the My Maps section of Google Maps.  2. Add a placemark to the map.  3. Add a picture to the placemark (need to be in rich text mode)  4. Once image added  try to left click on it to resize the image.  Cannot  do so.  In other browsers such as IE  Firefox you can left click on the  image and resize it using the mouse.  5. Chrome seems only able to resize images using html edits. Not ideal.      Should be able to left click on the picture in order to resize the image.      The picture is not selected and the cursor is either before or after the  picture.  To edit the picture size  need to use html.    Thanks.   </pre>
