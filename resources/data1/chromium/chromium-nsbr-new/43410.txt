<title>Issue 43410 -   chromium -    Allow/disable embedding content scripts only for a given set of sites. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A feature request:    Allow/disable embedding content scripts only for a given set of sites. Just like you can allow/disable   executing JavaScript for some sites  I would like to disable some extensions from accessing my data   on pages.    For example  I do not want any extension  even with the &quot;https://*/* permission  to access my   GMail data. And I'm so paranoid  that I will never install any extension with the &quot;https://*/*   permission  unless you implement this feature. It would be also useful to allow/disable a particular   extension from accessing particular sites. So it would be great to have both of the choices: filters for   all extensions  and filters for a given extension.   </pre>
