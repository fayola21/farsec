<title>Issue 27552 -   chromium -    Add options to enable full logging in about:net-internals - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The net internals page passively captures data  and consequently enforces   conservative limits on how much data it will keep around.    For certain scenarios  this limit can be too small  and important data will   be lost.  We should have a mechanism to turn off the limits for these   situations:      - Instead of just keeping the most recent 25 requests  keep ALL requests    - Instead of keeping the last 100 events per request  keep ALL events.    - Enable finer granularity log entries (for example show warnings and error   codes inline in the log).   </pre>
