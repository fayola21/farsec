<title>Issue 27832 -   chromium -    Remove default OK button from ConfirmInfoBar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some infobars do not want a default OK button -- for example  the infobar   that notifies you that a theme has just been installed. The code for   ConfirmInfoBar  however  assumes that an OK button is required in every case;   it will create it and set it to be invisible if no label is provided.   Instead  we should not create the OK button in the first place.    See TODO(mirandac) in theme_installed_infobar_delegate.cc.   </pre>
