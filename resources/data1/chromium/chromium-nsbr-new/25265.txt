<title>Issue 25265 -   chromium -    TRANSIENT_ERROR needs to be wired more directly to exponential backoff detection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently rely on the return value of HasMoreToSync (formerly   ShouldSyncAgain) to completely determine whether or not to backoff.  I think   it would be *way* easier and more accurate if we could just check &quot;did I get   a batch full of transient errors last time I tried to commit&quot; explicitly. </pre>
