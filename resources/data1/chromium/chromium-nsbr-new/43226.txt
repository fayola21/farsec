<title>Issue 43226 -   chromium -    Navigating to chrome://bookmarks from an incognito tab shows error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a user types in &quot;chrome://bookmarks&quot; while on an incognito tab  we show an   error page.    I'm not sure how much we can do about this. Our strategy has been to force   the page to open in a new normal tab  but that may be difficult/weird if the   user explicitly types in the URL. </pre>
