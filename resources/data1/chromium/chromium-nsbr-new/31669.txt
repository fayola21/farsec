<title>Issue 31669 -   chromium -    WISHLIST: Tab Lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just a thought that recently occurred to me and most likely being posted in   the wrong place  in which case I apologise profoundly...     I'm a techy  however I feel this would be useful for others too. I often use   Chrome for specific research tasks and may browse a number a similar sites at   a time. It would be VERY useful if I could have an option to save/reopen a   list of tabs  rather than using book marks etc when starting Chrome up; with   the ability to remember sessions of chrome  rather than the last/most recent   session and using bookmarks and history to navigate back to my last   &quot;project&quot;.     Kind Regards   Paul Coomber </pre>
