<title>Issue 40581 -   chromium -    Doc: PageAction icons changing to 19x19 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Peter stopped by today and said that we are soon going to start using 19x19   images for the icons in the Omnibox. This means we no longer need a soft   limit on PageAction icons being 16x16.    Maybe Peter can block this bug on the bug he is working against  so Kathy   can change the docs to reflect this when that bug is closed? </pre>
