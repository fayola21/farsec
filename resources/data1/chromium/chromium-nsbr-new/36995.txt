<title>Issue 36995 -   chromium -    selected text using mouse dragging is incomplete when browser doesn't have focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)    Other browsers tested: firefox  IE        Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. open two non-overlapping chrome windows  2. open any webpage (e.g. <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>) in one window  3. select (focus) the other window  4. try to (quickly) select a line of text from unfocused chrome window by   dragging the mouse      Entire line should be selected.         The first part of the text you dragged over isn't selected (i.e. selection   starts in the middle of the line).     It's as if the click makes the browser receive focus  and the selection   starts at the position of the next &quot;mouse move&quot; event.    </pre>
