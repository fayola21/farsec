Whenever any site tries to set data -&gt; There shd be an alert box with 2   options saying:  &quot;www.msn.com wants to create a cookie on you computer :   i)Remember my choice for all cookies  ii) Ask me every time &quot;    What do you see instead?  No alert box pops up Instead we see that the cookie is blocked and the   cookie icon with an &quot;X&quot; appears on the omnibar  against the URL.      See attached screenshot   This option works correctly in windows build (tested on Vista also with   same build)   </pre>
