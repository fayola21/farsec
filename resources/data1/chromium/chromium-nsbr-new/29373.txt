<title>Issue 29373 -   chromium -    middle clicking on attachment-disposition tab does wrong thing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you middle click a link for which Content-Disposition is attachment  it   opens a blank new tab and downloads the file. The logical thing to do would   be to ignore the Content-Disposition header (assuming the file is viewable   in Chrome) and view it instead. If the file is not viewable  the new tab   should not be opened.    I figure it's not actually possible to avoid opening the tab  because in   general we want the new tab to open as quickly as possible  and the request   may take a while. We could close the new tab after we realize it's just   going to download  but that would look weird.    However  it should be possible to ignore the Content-Disposition for   middle-clicked links. After some poking around  it seems the easiest thing   to do (albeit a little hacky  but this code is already somewhat tangled)   would be to disallow downloads during the first request of any renderer.    It's worth noting safari has the same problem.    thoughts on this approach? +Evan because I remember him complaining about   this in the past. </pre>
