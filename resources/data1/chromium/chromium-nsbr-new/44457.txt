<title>Issue 44457 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.WorkerScriptError is flaky on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It started consistently failing @47507  but that change only touched gtk code. I'm marking flaky.    Here's the output:  [ RUN      ] WorkerTest.WorkerScriptError  [96911:263:3632128530832583:ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-dbg-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/browser/first_run.cc(180)] Not   implemented reached in static bool FirstRun::ProcessMasterPreferences(const FilePath&amp;  const FilePath&amp;    FirstRun::MasterPrefs*)  [96912:519:3632128653465792:ERROR:/b/slave/chromium-dbg-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/common/chrome_paths.cc(245)] Not   implemented reached in bool chrome::PathProvider(int  FilePath*)  Test: worker-script-error.html  Chromium(96911 0xb220f000) malloc: *** error for object 0x7a940c0: pointer being freed was not allocated  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  /b/slave/chromium-dbg-mac-builder/build/src/chrome/test/ui/ui_layout_test.cc:237: Failure  Value of: value.c_str()    Actual: &quot;  &quot;  Expected: expected_result_value.c_str()  Which is: &quot;Test Worker script error handling functionality.
