<title>Issue 24702 -   chromium -    Text selection in new bookmark popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5 (Developer Build 28702)  OS + version : Linux      1. Bookmark (star) a page  2. let's assume the page calls itself &quot;Foo Bar&quot; but you want to save it as   &quot;Bar&quot;  3. set the cursor in front of &quot;Bar&quot;  drag left to mark &quot;Foo&quot;  4. if you end the mouse press when directly in front of the &quot;F&quot; of &quot;Foo&quot;    things work  5. if however you draw further (e.g. out of the text entry) and release the   mouse there  the selection will not be done e.g. slowly moving the mouse back   right into the text entry will take away the selection again    Compare this weird behavior to how other GTK text entry fields work (including   those in chromium) </pre>
