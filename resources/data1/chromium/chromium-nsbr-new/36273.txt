<title>Issue 36273 -   chromium -    Status bubble does not resize when going fullscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Switch to fullscreen mode with the status bubble hidden.  Then mouseover a link and notice that   the status bubble has not resized properly.  It does resize correctly if you switch to fullscreen while   the bubble is showing.    Fix coming. </pre>
