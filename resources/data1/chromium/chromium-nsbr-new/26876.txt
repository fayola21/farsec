<title>Issue 26876 -   chromium -    Figure out the ownership model for web content &lt;select&gt; pop-up menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm fixing <a title="&quot;Chromium Helper&quot; orphan renderer processes remaining even with no tabs open after using a pop-up menu" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26311"> bug 26311 </a> in a way that everyone agrees could use some   improvement.    chrome/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.mm:      // From the renderer's perspective  the pop-up menu is represented by a    // RenderWidget.  The actual Mac implementation uses a native pop-up   menu    // and doesn't actually make use of the RenderWidgetHostViewCocoa that    // was allocated to own it in its constructor.  When the pop-up menu   goes    // away  shut down the RenderWidgetHost (and RenderWidget)  and then   free    // the RenderWidgetHostViewCocoa  which will result in the destruction of    // this object.    //    // TODO(mark): This is a little bit dirty.  Figure out a more proper    // ownership model.  <a href="http://crbug.com/xxxxx">http://crbug.com/xxxxx</a>    xxxxx will be this bug. </pre>
