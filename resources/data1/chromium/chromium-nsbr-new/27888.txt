<title>Issue 27888 -   chromium -    Dragging a thumbnail into omnibox positions thumbnail on top left of NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.249.0       1. Have a couple of thumbnails present in NTP  2. Drag the omnibox straight into the omnibox       What is the expected output?     What do you see instead?  While dragging  (holding down the mouse)  the thumbnail gets positioned on   the top left corner of the NTP.  In previous versions  this didn't happen. Have we changed the behavior   here?             </pre>
