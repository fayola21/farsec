<title>Issue 25935 -   chromium -    Should be able to pass command line flags via user defaults - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On windows it is possible to create persistent command line flags via   shortcuts. On mac you need to use the terminal to specify them.    At launch we should read through our user defaults and allow the command   line flags to be specified there. This will make it easier to debug some   options.    We can either allow them to be specified top level or create a &quot;launch   arguments&quot; key of some sort. </pre>
