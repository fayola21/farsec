<title>Issue 36620 -   chromium -    Flash mouseover fails when tab is dragged to second monitor. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/cafeworld">http://apps.facebook.com/cafeworld</a> (and others   probably)  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works correctly  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):  Did not try  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:  Did not try      1. Have two monitors.  (I am using a MPB with the laptop screen as the   primary monitor  and a HP LP3065 as the secondary monitor which is   &quot;logically positioned&quot; above the laptop screen  with their center-lines   roughly aligned)  2. Open a page on the primary monitor which uses flash and has mouse-  overs.  (I used the facebook cafeworld game...)  3. See that it works  and then tear off that tab and move it (in my case up)   to the secondary screen.  Note that the mouseovers stop working.      Mouseovers continue to work      Mouseovers do not continue to work   </pre>
