<title>Issue 39613 -   chromium -    Mac: clean up/unify/refactor reading/writing of URLs and similar to the pasteboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes we use the Mozilla code in NSPasteboard+Utils.*  which is a bit weird and broken (esp.   for file: URLs)  and causes us many problems (in reading too: for file: URLs  it omits the &quot;file://&quot; so   we have to hack around it in various places  IIRC). We should avoid this code.    We have other utility code designed for bookmarks in   browser/bookmarks/bookmark_pasteboard_helper_mac.*. In other places  we deal with the   pasteboard directly. It's a mess.    We should unify/refactor all this. (Note that the refactored version should ideally support lazy writes   to the pasteboard.) </pre>
