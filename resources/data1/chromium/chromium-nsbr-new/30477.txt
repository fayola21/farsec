<title>Issue 30477 -   chromium -    Image corruption in flash object. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33928">r33928</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04 (Linux 2.6.28-17 - i686)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit (32-bit OS)  window manager : Gnome  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/111570/mercy-">http://www.hulu.com/watch/111570/mercy-</a>  some-of-us-have-been-to-the-desert  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works fine.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Works fine.      1. Watch any video on hulu.  2. Seek to a place right before an ad.  3. Watch the add image in the upper right hand corner above the   video as the video transitions to the ad video.      An instant transition to the next ad image.      There's a brief (about 1 sec) moment where there is random stuff in   the ad box. It looks like bits of the screen. Sometimes I can see   portions of the tab headers or other little bits of text or something.    I'm including a screenshot. That should be an ad for a jeep or   something in that brownish grey area with a couple of white bars and   some text.    That's a flash object. It doesn't fill with random stuff for a second   if I use Mozilla (Linux) or the Windows chrome.     </pre>
