<title>Issue 35245 -   chromium -    Security: Extensions cause &quot;Some insecure content&quot; on all secure pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Official Build 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://gmail.com">https://gmail.com</a>  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4:    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7:           IE 8:    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Browse to a secure page. Page is reported secure  2. Install an extension that updates page content  I used the FlashBlock extension  3. Browse to a secure page. Page is reported insecure  4. Disable the extension  5. Browse to a secure page. Page is reported insecure    What is the expected result?  Page is reported to be secure.    What happens instead?  Browser displays: &quot;This page contains some insecure content&quot;    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  possible.  I found user complaints here:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=14f36fee7ceb964a&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=14f36fee7ceb964a&amp;hl=en</a>    &quot;Some insecure content&quot; is as useless as the typical Windows &quot;Error: Success&quot; dialogs. Don't   do that. The button popup must be expanded to show what exactly is the insecure content.   There must be a button 'reload showing only secure content' so there is a way out.    Overwarning the user is a security issue  because the next time when you really do have   something to warn about  the user will have learned to ignore your doomsday warnings. </pre>
