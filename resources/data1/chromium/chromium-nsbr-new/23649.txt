<title>Issue 23649 -   chromium -    FRUI shouldn't import search engine when specific preference set - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Set a different browser to be the default browser  set its search   engine to anything non-Google.  2.  Delete the First Run sentinel and Preferences file.  3.  Change (or create) the master_preferences file to read:    {    &quot;distribution&quot; : {      &quot;import_search_engine&quot; : false    }  }    4.  Run Chrome  accept all of the default options.    All options get imported  including the default browser's search engine   setting.    We should modify the import to not import the search engine if the   &quot;import_search_engine&quot; preference is present and set to &quot;false&quot;.     </pre>
