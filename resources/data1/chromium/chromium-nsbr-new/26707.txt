<title>Issue 26707 -   chromium -    Downloaded files open with Firefox (or any other undesired browser app) instead of using the proper applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.235.0 (30955)  OS + version : Arch Linux  window manager : Openbox  file manager : pcmanfm      How to reproduce:    Chromium uses the /usr/bin/xdg-open script open files which tries to   determine the desktop environment and its file opening app (eg. gnome-open    kde-open).     When using a window manager only  the open_generic function in this script   is called  using the first browser-like app it finds (in my case Firefox)   resulting in undesired behavior.      Manual fix:  Editing xdg-open and making it use my file manager had Chromium open the   files correctly. </pre>
