<title>Issue 42069 -   chromium -    Chrome changes URLs containing escaped '|' characters (as %7C) to literal '|'s which causes problems with signatures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?">http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?</a>  size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C48.138594 11.  57731&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=7ovYyYHuCmdIhygmn6x8M-w4gJk=                  1. Copy the URL above into the Chrome address bar and press enter. A static   map image is displayed.  2. Notice that the URL changed slightly in the address bar: the (according   to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=FC2396">RFC2396</a>) correctly escaped %7C now became the literal |!  3. To see what problem this causes  place your mouse in the address bar   again  or copy the link *from the address bar* into a new one. Press Enter   again!  4. Instead of a static map image you now get an error message.      The expected result would be that Chrome doesn't change the escaped | to a   literal one  and that it doesn't send an unescaped | to the server (at   least not when it was originally escaped).      Chrome sends the URL with an unescaped |. Since this URL also contains an   inline signature which doesn't match the rest of the URL anymore (it was   computed with an escaped | as %7C instead of a literal one)  the signature   does not match anymore  which causes an error.   </pre>
