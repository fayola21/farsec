<title>Issue 42463 -   chromium -    The back button is unable to return to the previous page in www.orkut.com.br - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.386.0 (45407) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : www.orkut.com.br           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: N/A        1. Open a new tab  2. Open the page and connect to www.orkut.com.br and visit many communities   and users' profiles  3. Push the back button (or alt + left) to try to get back to a page that   was immediately prior to viewing and see what happens        When navigating through the pages of orkut  when I click the back button or   alt + left  Chromium should return directly to the previous page  an   expected behavior. As expected behavior in any website        However  pressing the back button  the Chromium back to the first page of   the orkut open in the same tab. Example: My personal page on orkut. That   is  completely ignoring all the visits in orkut communities and profiles.   This is a very annoying problem and affects the usability on orkut.    To my knowledge  only the pages of Orkut has this problem  I tested it with   other pages and in these the back button works as expected. </pre>
