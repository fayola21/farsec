<title>Issue 23865 -   chromium -    content scripts should have a lighter-weight way to get a response - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a fair amount of confusion regarding content scripts  and how you   have to proxy requests to the extension API to a background page.  The   current API to do this is fairly confusing.  It involves setting up ports   on both sides  and adding listener functions  etc.  It would be cool if we   encapsulated this for content scripts in a way that was similar to our   other APIs.  For example:    chrome.extension.sendRequest(object message_data  function   response_callback);    Maybe on the background page there could be a convenience for listening to   the background page as well:    chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener(function(object request) {    //  });   </pre>
