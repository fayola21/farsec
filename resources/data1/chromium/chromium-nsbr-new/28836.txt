<title>Issue 28836 -   chromium -    JSON prefs serializer should eliminate entry directories/lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is technically dangerous since someone could interpret a present-but-  empty value as meaningful  but it's doubtful that actually happens.    Note that this should work for nested objects  too; e.g. this should be   eliminated:  {    a: {    }  }   </pre>
