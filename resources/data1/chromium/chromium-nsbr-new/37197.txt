<title>Issue 37197 -   chromium -    Reloading extension causes browser action icon to disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Start with no extensions installed  and load an unpacked extension with a   browser action icon.  2. Reload that extension from the chrome-extensions:// page  3. Notice that the browser actions area shrinks to size 0  and when the   extension loads up again it's browser action icon ends up in the overflow   menu.    This only seems to happen if you have 1 extension installed - if you have any   other extensions installed  even those without a browser action icon  the bug   doesn't show up.    This seems related to <a title="Extension icons vanish when reloading other Extensions" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25083"> Issue 25083 </a> but it's not clear to me if it's exactly   the same problem or not. </pre>
