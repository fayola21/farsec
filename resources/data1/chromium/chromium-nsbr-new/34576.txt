<title>Issue 34576 -   chromium -    Bug with logging into Gmail account - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open your Chrome (5.0.307.1 dev) browser  and go to   <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a> (tested upon Croatian location)  2. Type your (correct  of course) username &amp; password  3. Hit enter      With the correct Gmail username &amp; password  Chrome browser should log in to   your account.      You're not logged in into your account. The field with the password erases    it's blank (and there's no alert that there's been typed wrong password or   username). I've tested this for over 50 times  and it happens only when you   try to log in the first time. If you type your password the second time  it   will log in into your Gmail account normally  and from further on signing   in &amp; out into Gmail account will work normally  until you close Chrome   browser. After the browser has been closed  and you start it again  you   won't be able to sign in for the first time (with the correct username &amp;   password  of course). The second time when you type your password  it will   log in normally.      <b>Please provide
