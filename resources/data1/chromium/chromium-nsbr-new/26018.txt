<title>Issue 26018 -   chromium -    Update buttons on installed extensions page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Kansinee:    &quot;Cole suggested that we use custom button on this page instead of links as  we want it to look and feels more like part of Chrome than webpage.   <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~kansinee/_current_project/client/chrome/xtention/final_mocks/installed_items.png">http://www.corp.google.com/~kansinee/_current_project/client/chrome/xtention/final_mocks/installed_items.png</a>    I think there's a CSS and styleguide for the button here. One small  different is the radius corner. Chrome buttons are 4px rounded and other  properties are 2px.    <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/guig/controls/buttons/custom">https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/guig/controls/buttons/custom</a>    Please let me know your thought and if we can make this change to the page.    Thanks   -Kansinee&quot; </pre>
