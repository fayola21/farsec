<title>Issue 41211 -   chromium -    On Ubuntu 10.04  custom frame buttons don't match system theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Ubuntu 10.04 will change the default system theme to move the min/max/close buttons to the left   and to significantly change their graphical style. Chrome's custom frame still has them on the right.   At the very least  this should be theme-definable if its not already (I don't think it is) and perhaps   an official/semi-official Ubuntu theme could be made. </pre>
