<title>Issue 44414 -   chromium -    autofill has to support per-country format in &quot;Latin&quot; and the dominant languages in the region - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Address formats are different per country/region.     - order of address elements   - number and types of address elements    Whatever the UI language of Chrome is  a user needs to be able to have auto-fill records for   all the regionns/countries of the world. We can start with top 50 or some reasonable subset.       For each region/country  we need to support at least two languages/scripts : one or more   widely used in the region and English / Latin script.     For instance  a French Chrome user living in China has to have her shipping address in China   in two languages : Simplified Chinese to use for buying things at a Chinese shopping mall   and English address for buying things at  say  Google checkout vendors or Amazon.com    So  each language version of Chrome has to support all these combinations:    The number of countries/regions to support times 2+ languages (one of langs is the   language/script for 'domestic' sites and the other for overseas sites).     This is basically what address input widget Google does and Google has the address format   information for many of regions/countries in the world (along with translation of address   elements of those regions into many languages). We should leverage them somehow.      </pre>
