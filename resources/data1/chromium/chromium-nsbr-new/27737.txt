Click on the pull down menu.    3. Menu will pull down  but text is invisible.    NOTE:  clicking on different parts of the pulled down menu will select the   different available options.  Chrome obviously has no problem choosing the   options  but there is a problem displaying the text.  You can also use the   arrow keys to scroll up and down through options and it selects them just   fine.        pull down menu should appear  and text should be visible          pull down menu appears  but text is not visible      <b>Please provide
