<title>Issue 42645 -   chromium -    Sync NPAPI headers with new central repository - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should try to get our NPAPI headers as close as possible to the new reference copy at:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/npapi-headers/">http://code.google.com/p/npapi-headers/</a>    My current understanding is that WebKit also plans to move closer to those headers   (&lt;<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20784">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20784</a>&gt; being the first step); we probably want to wait   until that has happened before updating our copy (copies?) since ours are based on the WebKit   copy. </pre>
