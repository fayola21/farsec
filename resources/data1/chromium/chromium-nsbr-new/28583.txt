<title>Issue 28583 -   chromium -    NPAPI Plugins with no UI can't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.251.0 (32167)    CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): gentoo linux 64-bit  window manager :  awesomewm    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):  Plugin succeeds to load        1.  Navigate to page with NPAPI plugin with no UI  2.  Plugin attempts to load - fails when configuring 'windowing'    A plugin that I work on has no UI native to it  it exposes an API to   javascript that allows for the extended native operations and the   JavaScript manages UI.    This appears to be a mismatch in how NPAPI calls need to be handled...            Plugin gets created  and sticks around.         Plugin gets created  then immediately destroyed.   </pre>
