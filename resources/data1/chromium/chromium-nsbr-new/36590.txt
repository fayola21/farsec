<title>Issue 36590 -   chromium -    NetworkChangeNotifierHelper should use base/observer_list.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NetworkChangeNotifierHelper should use base/observer_list.h    Not doing so is potentially dangerous as it is hard to ensure that an   observer will not remove itself or another observer during a notification.      We've had numerous crashes in Chrome due to not using ObserverList when we   should have.   </pre>
