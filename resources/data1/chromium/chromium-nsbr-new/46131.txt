<title>Issue 46131 -   chromium -    Incognito mode should clear its clipboard contents on exit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse incognito  2. Copy something to the clipboard  3. Close browser  4. Forget to clear the clipboard      Chrome might suggest to clear the clipboard.      I might accidentally paste sensitive information somewhere.      One might even think about restricting the use of the clipboard in incognito mode in geenral (I don't have a properly formulated solution for this though). </pre>
