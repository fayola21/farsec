<title>Issue 26264 -   chromium -    Compact nav bar: disable back/forward button when at beginning/end of tab history list  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.3.20.1  Chrome: 4.0.227.0        1. Title bar icon menu &gt; Compact nav bar &gt; New window.   2. Navigate to other page(s) in the current tab to create some tab history.      What is the expected output?    Back/forward arrows should indicate enabled/disabled depending upon whether  you're at the beginning/end of tab history list.      What do you see instead?    Back/forward arrows always appear enabled  even when they are not. (They do  function correctly.)     </pre>
