<title>Issue 28932 -   chromium -    Full screen doesn't hide gnome-panel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chromium  2. Open 'Option' and 'Personal Stuff' and make sure the 'Hide system title   bars and use compact borders' radio button is selected.  3. Enter full screen mode (F11)      Browser hides menus and panels and fills the screen with the web page it is   displaying.      Browser hides everything except the gnome-panel  which overlays the   browser  making the lower part of the screen unusable.  Note that the   browser _has_ expanded to cover the whole screen  but that an unusable   _image_ of the gnome-panel overlays it.  The image can be dismissed by alt-  tabbing to another program and then returning to Chromium.    <b>Please provide
