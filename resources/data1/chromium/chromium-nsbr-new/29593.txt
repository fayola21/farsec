<title>Issue 29593 -   chromium -    Ctrl-K/Ctrl-E/Opt-Cmd-F should work properly with initial spaces followed by '?&lt;stuff&gt;&quot; in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Put &quot;?foo&quot; in the Omnibox. Ctrl-K (or whatever) just selects &quot;foo&quot;.  Put &quot;     ?foo&quot; in the Omnibox. Ctrl-K kills everything and puts in &quot;?&quot;  even   though you were already doing a search.    I'll take this  but I'll let it go through triage.... </pre>
