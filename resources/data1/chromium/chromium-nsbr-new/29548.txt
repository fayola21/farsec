<title>Issue 29548 -   chromium -    Batch extension autoupdate requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The autoupdate protocol allows for batching multiple extensions in one   manifest fetch  but currently we don't do this. Implementing it will reduce   Omaha server load considerably for the common case where most of a users   installed extensions are from the gallery and have the same autoupdate url.       </pre>
