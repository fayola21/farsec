<title>Issue 43054 -   chromium -    Saved passwords exist in Web Data but are not converted over to Login Data file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.395.0 (Developer Build 46200)      1. Update to latest developer build  2. Check Saved Passwords      I expected the Saved Passwords to be converted from the Web Data file to the Login   Data file.      Web Data file still exists with all my usernames and passwords but Login Data is   empty.    Are we safe to copy the whole Web Data file and save it as Login Data?    Thanks   James Hartig </pre>
