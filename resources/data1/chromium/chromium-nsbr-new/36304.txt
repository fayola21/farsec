<title>Issue 36304 -   chromium -    Translate UI should not pop back up on fragment identifier changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When typing in Gmail  the fragment identifier (#whatever) is frequently   changed as drafts are saved and who knows what else happens. Each time this   happens  the translate toolbar goes away and then comes right back  causing   the entire page to jump up and back down. It's driving me nuts. We should not   be doing anything when the fragment identifier changes IMO -- or at the very   least  gmail should not bounce up and down like a car driving on 101 near   880.    Steps to reproduce: Change your GMail UI to German (or French) and then try   using it to write a few emails. Feel pain. </pre>
