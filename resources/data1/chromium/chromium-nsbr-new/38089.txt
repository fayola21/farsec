<title>Issue 38089 -   chromium -    Truncation when pasting lots of text into a text area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Someone in IRC reported that &quot;When you paste a lot of text into a textarea it   gets truncated.&quot; The reporter was on ubuntu; no idea what version of Google   Chrome. Others in channel were unable to reproduce.    The reporter was unwilling to make an account to file a bug  so we have no   way of getting more information. If this doesn't turn out to be reproducible in   QA  please close. </pre>
