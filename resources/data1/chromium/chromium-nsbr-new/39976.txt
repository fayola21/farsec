<title>Issue 39976 -   chromium -    Gray Line in top right corner of Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.4 dev  URLs (if applicable) : every URL (happens in UI)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open Chrome        The UI is displayed correctly.        There is a gray line next to the top right corner reaching from the tab bar to the extension icons. If the window is moved or resized  the line also moves   but it stays sticked to Chrome. If Chrome is closed  the gray line disappears  so it's not someting on the monitor or caused by the OS. (I use WIN7). A   screenshot of the described area is attached below.   </pre>
