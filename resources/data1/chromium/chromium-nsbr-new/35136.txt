<title>Issue 35136 -   chromium -    Chromium tries to play Dirac/Ogg videos even without the decoder instead of fallback to other playable sources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page that uses the HTML5 video tag with multiple sources  and where the first source is a Dirac encoded Ogg Video for example:  &lt;video controls&gt;               &lt;source src=&quot;some_dirac_video_file.ogv&quot; type='video/ogg; codecs=&quot;dirac  vorbis&quot;' /&gt;               &lt;source src=&quot;some_theora_video_file.ogv&quot; type='video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora  vorbis&quot;' /&gt;               &lt;source src=&quot;some_mp4_video_file&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/video&gt;  2. Press Play        Since Chromium does not support the Dirac encoder yet(an issue for another bug)  it should check for the codecs string in the type attribute of a   source tag and skip that  and try the next one in the sequence. Displaying then a nice video :)        Chromium apparently ignores the codecs string hint and tries to open the first video source anyways  that results in a black frame without video and   only audio (since vorbis is supported). The correct behavior should be to use one of the other sources for which the browser has the decoder.    <b>Please provide
