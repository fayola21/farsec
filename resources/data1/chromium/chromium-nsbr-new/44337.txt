<title>Issue 44337 -   chromium -    Avoid fsync() and friends so as not to drain laptop batteries by keeping the hard disk spinning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using nightly chromium builds on Ubuntu 10.04.  While it is far better than   firefox  chromium still tends to touch the disk every minute or two  forcing   it to spin back up and wasting power.  I used libeatmydata to disable calls   to fsync() and friends for chromium and it put a stop to this  allowing the   disk to stay alseep for 10 minutes at a time and extending my battery life   from 3 to 4 hours.    Chromium must not force disk access but should let the OS worry about it  so   it can do proper power management.   </pre>
