<title>Issue 35608 -   chromium -    Support printing background colors and images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Firefox  there is an option (not checked by default) under File -&gt; Page   Setup -&gt; Print Background (color &amp; images). This is very useful  and without   it certain pages don't print as well  e.g. highlighting in google docs &quot;print   as webpage&quot;.    We should offer an option to include backgrounds in printouts. </pre>
