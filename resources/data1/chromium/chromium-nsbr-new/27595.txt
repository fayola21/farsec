<title>Issue 27595 -   chromium -    Cursor flickers during full-screen Flash video - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Watch any YouTube video in fullscreen mode.  Note how the cursor flickers   constantly.  Seems like Flash is setting the cursor  then we're setting it back    endlessly.    We had this problem for a while  then I thought it went away; but if it did it's   back. </pre>
