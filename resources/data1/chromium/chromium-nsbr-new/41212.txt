<title>Issue 41212 -   chromium -    Add a sample extension that overrides the history page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is no sample extension that overrides the history API.        A sample that searches history  by allowing a user to enter queries that use   chrome.history.search() and chrome.history.getVisits()  and see a table of   results  could demonstrate an override while making it clear how the search   functions work.   </pre>
