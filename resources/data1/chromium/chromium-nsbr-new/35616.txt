<title>Issue 35616 -   chromium -    Page down on a page full of images should bring the next image into frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev    <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/02/dance_around_the_world_part_ii.htm">http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/02/dance_around_the_world_part_ii.htm</a>  l                  Attempt to navigate the given page using the keyboard only. Notice that   using space or page down is not satisfactory  since images get out of sync   with the view pane. Up and down arrows are not fast enough.      Ideally  the browser would load the next partially off-screen image so that   the top of the image is at the top of the viewport. I'm requesting new   behaviour  so it may take some further elaboration of the business rules   before this can be acted upon.   </pre>
