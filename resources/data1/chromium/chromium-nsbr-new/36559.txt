<title>Issue 36559 -   chromium -    error: too much time spent in unload handler when not performing uload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)            Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. Using ExtJS and ASP.NET calling Ext.Window.show method after a postback          The dialogue is supposed to show up (it does in IE and FireFox)      Chrome quietly throws an error which can only be intercepted by putting a   try-catch around the .show call. Once the error is displayed it reads   &quot;error: too much time spent in unload handler&quot;.    The (development) page does have an unload handler but it's not supposed to   be executing the unload handler in this case at all. The dialog has a   'show' listener which will in turn load data for the dialog using ajax. The   onload handler is not supposed to be executed for ajax requests - the page   is not really attempting to unload ...     </pre>
