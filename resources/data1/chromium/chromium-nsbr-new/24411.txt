<title>Issue 24411 -   chromium -    We need in your face UI whenever the sandbox is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need in your face UI whenever the sandbox is disabled to help discourage   people from running with --disable-sandbox without knowing exactly what   they're doing.  We should make it easy for the user to learn why they're   getting these warnings in the hopes they'll decide to turn back on the   sandbox.    Some ideas for the UI (not my specialty):  1) Something like the incognito guy.  It'd be clickable and it'd have something   that conveys that things are not all right.  Maybe a caution sign or something?  2) A really annoying theme that can't be changed.  Maybe all red?  3) Big warnings on the new tab page.  (This probably would be in conjunction   with others). </pre>
