<title>Issue 34063 -   chromium -    Extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I installed some extensions  but all stopped working. The icon of them are   gone  and when I open the option EXTENSIONS in the browser  all extensions   are with the icon &quot;without images&quot;. The extensions do not charge more  unless   I download the again. It's happened twice. I'm using version 4. </pre>
