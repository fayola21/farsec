<title>Issue 30069 -   chromium -    Page Cycler Moz - HTTP jumped around r34149 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On 2009-12-09  around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34149">r34149</a>  the graph of Page Cycler Moz - HTTP  on Mac OS X 10.5 had a big jump:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/moz-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/moz-</a>  http/report.html?history=150    None of the checkins around that time seem related.  Although  thakis's <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34146">r34146</a> was a Mac-specific change  it was immediately  reverted in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34147">r34147</a>.    Also  Bloat - HTTP is showing a steady climb on Mac OS X 10.5  on 2009-12-09 and 2009-12-10:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/bloat-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-10.5/bloat-</a>  http/report.html?history=150 </pre>
