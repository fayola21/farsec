<title>Issue 42568 -   chromium -    Inability to acquire SingletonSocket leads to SIGKILL without diagnostic message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was trying to startup google-chrome.  Here's my profile dir:    willchan@penguin:~$ ls -al ~/.config/google-chrome/  total 25912  drwx------ 4 willchan eng     4096 Apr 26 11:43 .  drwxr-x--- 5 willchan eng     4096 Dec 21 18:04 ..  srwxr-x--- 1 willchan eng        0 Apr 23 13:47 .nfs0000000000e57b5800000001  -rw-r----- 1 willchan eng       32 Apr 26 11:43 Consent To Send Stats  drwx------ 8 willchan eng     4096 Apr 26 11:43 Default  drwx------ 2 willchan eng     4096 Jun 17  2009 Dictionaries  -rw-r----- 1 willchan eng        0 Jun 11  2009 First Run  -rw------- 1 willchan eng     3106 Apr 23 13:12 Local State  -rw-r----- 1 willchan eng 25184256 Apr 23 13:05 Safe Browsing Bloom  -rw------- 1 willchan eng  1264790 Mar 18 11:27 Safe Browsing Bloom Filter 2  srwxr-x--- 1 willchan eng        0 Apr 26 11:43 SingletonSocket    When google-chrome started up  it would just hang for awhile.  Eventually  it would die saying it was   killed:    willchan@penguin:~$ time google-chrome  Killed    real    0m20.076s  user    0m0.076s  sys     0m0.016s    Problems:  * Dies inexplicably  only saying Killed.  We should at least print something explaining why this happens.  * It takes 20 seconds to figure out it should die?  This seems excessively long. </pre>
