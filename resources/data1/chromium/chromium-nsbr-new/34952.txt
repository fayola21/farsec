Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Visit website with jquery background-position plugin (See URL)  2. Move over tabs/menus / Move in and out  3. The effects stall with an error instead of smoothly fading in and OUT!  This is the error in the javascript console:  &gt;&gt;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null  Please note  that I used an earlier build of chrome until recently  and   that this jquery plugin and this website worked flawlessly there!      Nice background-position animations.      Animations stall with an javascript error.   </pre>
