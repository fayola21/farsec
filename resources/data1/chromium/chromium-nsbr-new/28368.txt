<title>Issue 28368 -   chromium -    Thin bright line around address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.252.0 (Build Ubuntu build 32323)    There's a thin bright line around the whole address bar  this is particulary   visible when changing themes (dark themes  first of all)  and makes new   themes not as good as the default one.    I can suspect there's too much alpha level for this drawing  maybe reducing   it will fix it.   </pre>
