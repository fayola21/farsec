<title>Issue 46235 -   chromium -    Chromium debugger test TestStepIn expectations must be updated in chromium port in Webkit. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An update to the debugger in V8 has changed the line numbers where stepping through a function using the debugger stops.  These line numbers must be changed in the test expectations of the test testStepIn in chrome/browser/debugger/devtools_sanity_unittest.cc.  The file that must be changed in Webkit is WebKit/chromium/src/js/Tests.js.    The test had been disabled for now.  When this change is committed to webkit  then the test should be re-enabled in chrome/browser/debugger/devtools_sanity_unittest.cc.   </pre>
