<title>Issue 31132 -   chromium -    &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; pages don't load correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium version: 4.0.278.0 (Developer Build 35113)  Chromium OS version: 0.5.25.0 (Developer Build 4fcea544** - Mon Dec 21 22:52:51 UTC 2009 - )      1. Right-click on a link and choose &quot;Open link in new tab&quot;.      The page should load correctly in the new tab.  Instead  I end up with a   blank page.  Ctrl-U shows the page source  but it stays blank even after   clicking the Reload button.  Copying the page's location  creating a new   tab  pasting it  and hitting Enter results in the page loading correctly.    I see it in the main window that I was using for browsing  a new window   that I just created  and the incognito window that I'm using to file this   report (but interestingly  the links work in this incognito tab but not in   new tabs that I create in the same window).  Multiple sites seem to be   affected; I was testing by just using links on <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>. </pre>
