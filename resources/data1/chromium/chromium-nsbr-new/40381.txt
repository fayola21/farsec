<title>Issue 40381 -   chromium -    thusnelda videos give me issues  &quot;libtheora&quot; do not - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. create a large ogv video from ripping a DVD. I used Thoggen latest 0.7.1   and ripped such classics as &quot;Cars&quot;  &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;.  2. create a simple &lt;video src'path/to/large/ogv'&gt;no support&lt;/video&gt; type   markup  3. document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;video&quot;)[0].play        I'd expect Chrome to play the ogv much like any other.        I find that chrome is unhappy about these ogvs. Doesn't want to play them    doesn't enjoy seeking them.    <b>Please provide
