<title>Issue 27632 -   chromium -    Upper/lowercase in extensions management UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Kathy:    I just noticed that the Installed Extensions page  in Developer mode   uses 'Extension' incorrectly in buttons. It should use 'extension'   since buttons use sentence case and &quot;extension&quot; isn't preceded by  &quot;Google Chrome&quot;.    So we should have:    Load extension...  Pack extension...  Update extensions now    (It wouldn't have been so noticeable if it weren't for the lower case   &quot;now&quot;.)    Here's my understanding of what we use:    Google Chrome Extension (&quot;Google Chrome Extension&quot; is the only time  you capitalize Extension unless you're using title case)  extensions for Google Chrome  extension system </pre>
