<title>Issue 33070 -   chromium -    Fix model v. array indexes in tab strip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We continue to have issues where people forget to convert from model index   to tab array index in the tab strip. This mostly works  until you close a tab   and things get out of sync and go haywire.    We kicked around a plan that wraps the tab array index in a class to force an   explicit conversion between the two and have the items in the  tab array only   be accessible via this class. Hopefully that will make things a bit more explicit   and avoid the implicit int -&gt; int conversions that get us into trouble in the   first place. </pre>
