<title>Issue 26787 -   chromium -    Chromebot needs to track sandbox errors on OS X. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cocoa wasn't really built to be sandboxed - our current Sandbox implementation relies on   manual tests to identify places where the Sandbox is blocking something critical.    In such cases we either &quot;warm&quot; the relevant API by calling it during startup so the resource in   question is cached  or we poke a hole in the Sandbox.    The only way we can get good coverage of the browser code to make sure there are no   corners of the code that malfunction due to the Sandbox being blocked is if Chromebot runs   can report this issue.    What needs to be done:  * Chromebot needs to run Chrome with the --enable-sandbox-logging flag which causes   the OS X sandbox API to print out a warning to syslog each time an API is blocked.  * We need a mechanism to capture warning messages as they're printed and correlate them   back to specific web pages or groups of web pages.  Since the information is printed to   syslog an external process can do this.  * Bugs need to be filed for any new or unusual warnings that pop up and we need to examine   them manually and either suppress the warning or Chromebot or take action accordingly. </pre>
