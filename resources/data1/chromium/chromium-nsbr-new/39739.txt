<title>Issue 39739 -   chromium -    Spawning a new tab that has flash content from another doesn't block flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enable internal flash      1. Go to about:plugins and disable flash 10.1  2. Navigate to youtube.com  3. Click on the top banner ad that will spawn a new tab that navigates to   <a href="http://www.realwomenofphiladelphia.com/">http://www.realwomenofphiladelphia.com/</a>    What is the expected output?   The new tab shouldn't launch shockwave flash as it's blocked by the user    What do you see instead?  Shockwave flash is not being blocked in the new tab    Note: This is happening even when the user says &quot;Not for now&quot; on the EULA    This is happening only for this link though    Google Chrome	5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897)     </pre>
