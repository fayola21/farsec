<title>Issue 38386 -   chromium -    Inconsistent background color for filled password fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to gmail.com  2. Login  choose to remember the password when prompted  3. Log out  4. (Observe that the focus is in the password field  and its background is  white)  5. Click anywhere on the whitespace of the page      I expect all of the fields to have a yellow background and none (or  username) to have focus when I first arrive on the page.  Furthermore  I  expect to see the the password field's background turn back to its Yellow  color after clicking outside the field since it has not been modified  but  it remains white as if it's been changed.  Things get worse if I click in  the username field then onto the whitespace of the page: now the username  field is white and the password field is yellow.    I've verified this bug on Mac Dev 5.0.342.5 and Windows Beta 4.1.249.1036   </pre>
