<title>Issue 30376 -   chromium -    Making Ctrl+Shift in the Omnibox (to change text alignment) tab specific - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i had a discussion with a friend about text alignment in the Omnibox     specifically  when you change the Omnibox alignment in one tab using   Ctrl+Shift (for example to search for something more readable in a   different directionality)- the alignment is changed in all tabs    ...the URLs suddenly switch sides in all tabs  that's both annoying and   confusing    IMO it makes more sense to have the alignment-change tab specific.    the disadvantage is that a user wanting to change the alignment in all tabs   will have to change the UI language (to an RTL one)  i don't think this is unreasonable.    currently Chrome behaves the same way as IE8 &amp; FF  but since the general approach (as far as i know) is towards   autodirectionality  (see <a title="Omnibox should support autodirectionality on all platforms"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14239">Issue 14239</a> and <a title="Partial autodirectionality in the Omnibox"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30374">Issue 30374</a>) the alignment must be   tab specific </pre>
