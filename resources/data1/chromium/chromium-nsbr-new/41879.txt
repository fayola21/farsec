<title>Issue 41879 -   chromium -    button element rendered incorrectly/inconsistantly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045 (Official Build 42898)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK     Chrome Mac: OK      1. Button element using &quot;sliding door&quot; background image technique.   2. &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;        The button should render the same on both the Mac and Windows versions.        The Mac versions of Chrome  Safari 4  FF 3.5  FF 3.6 and the Windows version   of IE7  IE8  FF 3.0  3.5  3.6 all render the button element correctly and   consistently. Chrome build 42898 on Windows 7 does not. Screen shots   illustrate the problem.    I have attached the CSS file  background image file and the HTML file which   demonstrate the issue above including two screen captures  one from the Mac   version  one from the Windows version.    The Mac version is 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta FWIW and they are   both essentially virginal fresh installs. </pre>
