<title>Issue 39651 -   chromium -    Extensions page buttons in wrong position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Official Build 42309) dev    For the last two dev builds the buttons on the extensions page have been   shifted to below the extension listings. I am filing this bug to get the   buttons back to their original positions on the right side of the page.    The buttons in question are the enable  uninstall and options buttons. </pre>
