<title>Issue 38983 -   chromium -    Chromium Issue rendering form in Windows 7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (42279)    1. Just running the browser in Windows 7.  2. If the Extensions icon area is expanded or hidden  the glitch can still   be seen.      The Issue:  **********  I'm currently using Chromium version: 5.0.360.0 (42279)  but I've noticed this glitch for a while now (at least 2 months).    I've noticed a rendering issue with Chromium in Windows 7.  I assume that the issue I've noticed is caused since a non-standard form is   used for Chromium.    On the form header  for the application  a small vertical rectangular image   overlays over the main form and any Extension icons.    If the Extensions icon area is shrunk (hidden) the strange rectangle lines-  up with the Extension drag-bar.  It doesn't matter if the window is in full-screen or a smaller size.    **********        No rectangle should be present.        A rectangle is visible over-top of the form and other visible objects. </pre>
