<title>Issue 38828 -   chromium -    There could be options for grouping in windows 7 taskbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2    Just upgraded to this version from 342  found that instead of having each   window with an item in windows taskbar  each tab now has its item.    Although this also is the default behavior as of IE8 and Opera 10.50    however I like the original behavior in 342 instead. Is it possible for me   to make use of the old behavior?    The reason for me to use the old one is that when I have more than 20 tabs   I tend to have different windows to store different kinds of tabs (like   causal websites and others.) Now all those tabs  un-grouped  are now   flooding in the popup menu on my windows 7 taskbar. That is both annoying   and not very useful. As I am not able to specify certain version of chrome   to use  nor currently has the resources to build my own chromium custom   builds  please offer me some options for that regard. </pre>
