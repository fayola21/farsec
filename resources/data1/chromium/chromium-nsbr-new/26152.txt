<title>Issue 26152 -   chromium -    browser action contents flicker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    In my extension  I use a browser action with a pop up containing an   iframe that hosts the actual UI implementation from another web   server.     The first time I launch chrome and click on my button  it renders   properly  with no scroll bars. After I start to mouse over my UI    there is a period of severe flickering for several seconds. Once that   settles down  Chrome adds scroll bars to my browser action window    effectively hiding a small strip of my UI and making it ungainly.     When my UI was a toolstrip mole  the iframe behaved correctly.     When I create a simple demo using an iframe in my pop up to host  say    cnn.com  no scroll bars appear. So  it appears to be related to the   complexity of my UI. However  my UI does not change size during the   flickery mouse over phase.    The flicker is noticeable but not nearly as pronounced with a simple pop up that   uses an iframe to load  say  cnn.com. I've attached this as an example.    I could provide a sample with our actual extension if I am contacted directly by   someone on the Chrome extensions team. This will demonstrate the scroll bar   problem. </pre>
