<title>Issue 41867 -   chromium -    Form input persistence can sometimes fail and cause the tab to crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.378.0 (Developer Build 44604)    <a href="http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber">http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber</a>      1. Search for one or more tracking numbers at the attached URL. (At the   time of writing  these are valid tracking numbers: RB334598303HK and   RB332569295HK).  2. The resulting page shows results.  3. Close Chrome.  4. Reopen Chrome. If you do not have it set to automatically reopen your   tabs  click on the &quot;Recently closed&quot; entry for the tab group that contained   the results.  5. The resulting page has no tracking results. This is because the Canada   Post web site is really weird  and I don't consider this part to be a   Chrome bug.  6. We are technically on the &quot;Results&quot; page  and the search page where we   input the tracking numbers is still in the history. So  press Back to get   to it and reissue the search.        The page with the search input box should load  and  based on my prior   experience with Chrome  repopulated with the search that was previously   done.        The tab crashes. In my experience  if you click Back again to get to the   preceding navigation history item  whatever that was  and then Forward to   return to the search page once more  the second time around it works and   does repopulate the page with the search query  ready to be reissued.   </pre>
