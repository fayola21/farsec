<title>Issue 40858 -   chromium -    In Google Maps  &quot;Link&quot; &amp; &quot;Send&quot; functions are not working properly/at all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In Google Maps streetview  the LINK &amp; SEND functions are not behaving as   they should.  2. LINK does not work at all  3. SEND works  but it is hidden behind map (see attached pic)        Clicking LINK and/or SEND should display the pulldown window. Both work   fine in IE.          See attached pic/LINK funciton seems to not work at all    **It should be noted that I just installed the new beta version yesterday    however I also have a few of the Google Maps LABS enabled. I am not sure   which (if any) of these test features are causing an issue. In IE  problems   do not occur.     (There is also a problem with the frame  addressed in the attached pic)    <b>Please provide
