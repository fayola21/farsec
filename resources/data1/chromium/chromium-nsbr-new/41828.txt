<title>Issue 41828 -   chromium -    Build a sql.Statement interface to make it easier to bind columns. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now columns are bound by number.  When ordering or count are changed  it's easy to forgot   one.  It would be easier if you could do something like:      Bind(col0  col1  col2  col3  col4  ...);    It would also be helpful to make the default mode be that you have to bind all columns exactly   once.  That is the right thing in almost all cases  the few cases where it is wrong could explicitly   specify their needs. </pre>
