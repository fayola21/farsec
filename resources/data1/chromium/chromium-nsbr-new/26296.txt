<title>Issue 26296 -   chromium -    ExtensionApiTest.History is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test manipulates the database and then queries the database to test its   state.  The asynchronous nature of the history database is causing the tests   to be flaky on the Vista buildbot.    This is ultimately a timing issue between adding a URL to the history and   querying for it.  An easy solution is to add waits of significant length   between the writes and reads.  A better solution would be to propagate a   history event when the store has been updated. </pre>
