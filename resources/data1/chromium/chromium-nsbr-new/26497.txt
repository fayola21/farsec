<title>Issue 26497 -   chromium -    Watch expression of devtools gets in infinite loop when evaluation stops on breakpoint. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.232.0 (Developer Build 30696)      1. Open a function in some script (e.g. hue2rgb from colors.js from   <a href="https://artlebedev.ru">https://artlebedev.ru</a>)  2. put a breakpoint in its beginning  soon it will be hit  3. add new watch expression calling this function (e.g. &quot;hue2rgb()&quot;)      A. Devtools tries to evaluate expression  pauses on breakpoint and does not   attempt to evaluate it again.  B. Devtools does not stop on breakpoints when evaluating expressions (less   desirable)      Devtools starts to evaluate expression  pauses on breakpoint  gets   expression and starts to evaluate it all over again. It this cycle keeps   going forever performing pulsating update in UI.   </pre>
