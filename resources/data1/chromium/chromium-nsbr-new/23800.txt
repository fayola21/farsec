<title>Issue 23800 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame: &quot;chromeframe&quot; UA string not appended without restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.7                    1. Click &quot;Get Google Chrome Frame&quot; from   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/</a> in Internet Explorer.  2. Complete installer. Installer doesn't prompt for restart  so DO NOT   RESTART.  3. Visit a page that will report the User Agent string.      &quot;chromeframe&quot; should be appended to the User Agent string.      &quot;chromeframe&quot; is NOT appended to the User Agent string until after the   browser is restarted. This causes sites relying on Chrome Frame to fail   until the browser is restarted. The installer needs to prompt for a   restart. This has been tested using both IE6 and IE8 on Windows XP.   </pre>
