<title>Issue 40594 -   chromium -    Dragging off of &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder leaves folder highlighted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Drag from inside the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder on the bookmark bar to outside the folder and let   go.    What is the expected output? What do you see instead? It will go back to the normal unhighlighted   state  but instead it stays highlighted until i click it.         </pre>
