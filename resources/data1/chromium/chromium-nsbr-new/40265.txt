<title>Issue 40265 -   chromium -    Install from disk image followups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some followup work now that <a title="Offer to copy the application out of the disk image if run from there" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28986"> bug 28986 </a> is done:    1. Authenticate to install if there��_��_��_s no permission to install to /Applications.  And if the user   cancels authentication  maybe install to ~/Applications.  On a successful authenticated install    Keystone ticket promotion should occur.    2. Update from disk image.  If Chrome is already installed  and the installed version is older than   the running version  offer to update the installed version.  Some speculative strings for this were   checked in.    3. (If needed.)  Better control of who's running.  The relaunched installed process may want to   wait for the parent to exit early on in its main  before attempting to use the profile or anything.    4. (Maybe.)  Try to eject the disk image after relaunch? </pre>
