<title>Issue 28663 -   chromium -    omx_test doesn't compile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. make omx_test  2. omx_test does not name a target!  3. It's because omx_test.gyp is not in all.gyp      You should be able to build it.    Building omx_test requires linking to libOmxCore.so which is a system   library  so we skip including omx_test.gyp in all.gyp because we don't want   to build this target on the tree.  </pre>
