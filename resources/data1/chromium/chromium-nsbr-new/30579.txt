<title>Issue 30579 -   chromium -    DEP crash when closing windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0      1. Open a new window  2. Browse to a website  3. Close the window        No crash        DEP crash    It doesn't happen every time - I've been unable to determine a pattern.    This has been happening at least once a day since upgrading to v4.0.266.0.    Do I assume that Chrome has automatically sent you process dumps or do I   need to send you the ones from Vista's Problem Reports and Solutions? </pre>
