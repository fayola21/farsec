We need to provide a Chromium extension to user that does the following:    - Notify the user when a newer daily release is present so she can exit   browser and run updater.    - When user downloads and installs the extension  present Eula so user can   agree to send crash report to Google.    - Ideally we want the URL that crash reports are sent to configurable.    - See the mock done by hbridge for UI. </pre>
