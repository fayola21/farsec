<title>Issue 43238 -   chromium -    Compiling on windows  Visual Studio 2008 SP1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   I noticed a bug in while trying to build Chromium on Windows  using Visual   Studio 2008 SP1. The bug seems to be related to the .py scripts that build   the VS project  confing files  etc.    I noticed the ASCI character 0x0C (AKA FF=Form Feed AKA Page Break) in all of   the .vcproj files that failed to load. I wrote a c++ program to filter them   out and with a few additional steps  all of the projects loaded successfully.    The build process however failed  because there seem to be files with other   extensions containing that same character - see the screen shot.  So far I have discovered that files of these types are effected:  .mk .py .grd .rules .vcproj  As I used my program to fix all of them  more and more projects built   successfully.    I'm sure this is somehow related to the automated creation of those project   files. Some script is leaking the 0x0C character  that breaks the project   files. </pre>
