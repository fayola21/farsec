<title>Issue 30609 -   chromium -    Shouldn't promote Google Chrome to Mac OS 10.4 users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I observed this happening on my friend's mac book:    On the Google home page there was a promotion to download Google   Chrome.    So he follows the link  but once he reaches our download site he finds out it   can't actually be installed  since he must have 10.5 (and he is on 10.4).    Probably the promotion should not be shown if the product can't be installed    since that was confusing  and frustrated the user.    (You can tell from the user agent that the users is on 10.4 and decide not to   show it). </pre>
