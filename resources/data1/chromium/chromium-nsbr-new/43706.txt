<title>Issue 43706 -   chromium -    Flash Plugin triggers graphics switching on new MacBook Pro models - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Use a recent Apple MacBook Pro with on-demand graphics performance  switching (Intel i5/i7 based models)  2. Install GPUInfoMenu from  <a href="http://gpuinfomenu.dotstrosity.net/GPUInfoMenu.zip">http://gpuinfomenu.dotstrosity.net/GPUInfoMenu.zip</a> to see which GPU is  actually being used  3. Start any a Flash based animation or video in Chrome  4. Watch the system switch to the NVidia GPU        Chrome should use the integrated Intel GPU which consumes considerably less  power than the NVidia chip resulting in prolonged battery life.        Google Chrome makes the system switch to the NVidia GPU and stick with this  setting even if the Chrome tab containing the Flash animation is closed.  Only restarting Chrome will remedy the problem. This behavior has a very  negative impact on battery life on the affected machines. For me  personally  it is reason not to use Chrome as my default browser unless  this issue is resolved. (As a side note  I will keep using Chrome while on  power adapter because it is so freaking awesome.)    Please provide
