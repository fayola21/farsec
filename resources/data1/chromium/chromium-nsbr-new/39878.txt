<title>Issue 39878 -   chromium -    [Extension Gallery] No long description is saved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A while ago my extension lost its description and I have been unable to add   one back.    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cfkohgkpafhkpdcnfadadcibfboapgg">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cfkohgkpafhkpdcnfadadcibfboapgg</a>  i    This is annoying because I am unable to put my feature list up here  or put   my planned features or known bugs.  People keep e-mailing me about stuff I   put on the description.    Whenever I add a description back  it does not appear on the page  and the   description field is empty when I go back to the edit page.    It does not seem to be preserved on Save draft or Preview either.    Using Chrome 5.0.360.4 to access the gallery  but earlier versions still   had the problem and I don't think it broke when I upgraded Chrome at any   time. </pre>
