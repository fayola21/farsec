<title>Issue 39335 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Enabling extenion in incognito doesn't make the browser action button shown on incognito window immediately - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Enable your first browser action extension in incognito by checking  &quot;Allow this extension to run in incognito&quot;  this browser action will be  shown in incognito window at once.  2.Enable your second browser action extension in incognito      Now the second browser action is not shown in incognito window  but it  should be shown in incognito window immediately  just like the first  enabled extensions.    Another problem is  as you are enabling more extensions  the incognito  mode's browser action container's size doesn't change accordingly  it just  hide those browser actions. This behavior is inconsistent with the normal  mode  in normal mode as you are installing browser action extensions  the  browser action container expands automatically.    This issue happens both in Dev candidate 5.0.360.0 (Official Build 42309)  and trunk build 5.0.363.0 (Developer Build 42618)       </pre>
