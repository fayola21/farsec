<title>Issue 23760 -   chromium -    Adding last official revision to branch script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we do an official branch  commit a file into our internal svn   respository to store that version.  This will allow the script to look at the   &quot;last branch point&quot; and will give us the capability to auto-kick off the log   notes generation tool (also in the branch e-mail we can include a url w/ the   complete change set). </pre>
