<title>Issue 25355 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/editing/selection/editable-html-element.html only flaky on Chrome buildbots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test mysteriously only fails on our buildbots.  I tried looking into it   today since I broke another test and thought this one could be related.    WebKit bug:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30598">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30598</a>    I got some webkittens to look at it  and they provided some suggestions.    1) Maybe it's v8?  Do we still have a JSC build?    2) 16:38 &lt; ap&gt; evmar: you could check parsing by temporarily adding a   try/catch block around runTest()  and dumping   document.documentElement.innerHTML    3) 16:38 &lt; othermaciej&gt; thus my only guess is that it might be a problem   with the execution of the script  16:39 &lt; othermaciej&gt; ojan  evmar: another thing to try  add console.log() to   the inline scripts at the beginning  to see if they fail to log in those   cases where runTest() is undefined      The tricky part is that I can't repro this test locally at all  only on the   buildbots.  So I guess to test I'll need a layout test on our side that can   run through the buildbots.    Ojan wonders if this flakiness might be a symptom of flakiness elsewhere.  Assigning to dglazkov for triage. </pre>
