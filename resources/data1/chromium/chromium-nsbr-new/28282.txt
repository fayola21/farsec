<title>Issue 28282 -   chromium -    Support for SPNEGO authentication (standard KRB5  not only Windows NTLM/AD) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an example Kerberos 5 realm (optimally using MIT Kerberos 5   implementation which is the most widespread open implementation)  2. Using Apache  configure an example Kerberos-authenticated location:      LoadModule auth_kerb_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_kerb.so      ...      AuthType Kerberos    KrbServiceName HTTP    KrbMethodNegotiate on    Require valid-user    Krb5Keytab /var/lib/apache2/krb5/apache.keytab    KrbMethodK5Passwd on    3. Get a ticket granting ticket from KDC using kinit    4. Verify that the ticket is present using klist    5. Open the location in Chromium        The authentication is successful  the user is not prompted for any input.   Behing the scenes  the negotiation and ticket issuance has occured between   Chromium  web server  krb5 client library  and the Kerberos KDC.  Invoking klist shows an additional ticket issued for the HTTP service  in   addition to the krbtgt  in the user's ticket cache.        The user is prompted for login and password  if he supplies correct   credentials  authentication succeeds and the page at protected location is   returned.    <b>Please provide
