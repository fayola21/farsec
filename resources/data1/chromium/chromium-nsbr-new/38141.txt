<title>Issue 38141 -   chromium -    Youtube videos don't play with blocked cookies + exceptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS                              : MacOSX 10.6.2  Chrome Version      : 5.0.353.0 (Developer Build 41531)  URLs (if applicable) : Any youtube video      Firefox 3.6: OK      1. Block sites from setting cookies  2. Block all 3rd part cookies without exception  2. Add exceptions for www.youtube.com and s.ytimg.com  3. Try to watch a youtube video      It should be possible to watch the video.      Youtube shows the following message in the player area - &quot;An error occurred  please try again   later.&quot;  And this is (part of) the debug info got from the context menu -   &quot;error=%5BVideoErrorEvent%20type%3Derror%20text%3DNetStream%2EPlay%2EStreamNotFound&quot;    Additional information:  If I use &quot;Ask me when a site tries to set any data&quot; instead of the &quot;Block sites...&quot;  it works normally.   And it doesn't popup the dialog asking for confirmation because I already have the exceptions   (those from step 2). </pre>
