<title>Issue 43501 -   chromium -    &quot;bookmarks go here&quot; text doesn't go away when you add a bookmark! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Launch with a clean profile.  Open bookmark bar.  See &quot;bookmarks go here&quot;.  Add a bookmark by clicking on the STAR.    Problem: see bookmarks and &quot;bookmarks go here&quot; text overlap!  Should see: text go away and only get bookmarks.    Restarting Chrome &quot;fixes&quot; things.    You'll probably get the same problem when deleting the last bookmark (text doesn't reappear).    Cosmetically AWFUL. </pre>
