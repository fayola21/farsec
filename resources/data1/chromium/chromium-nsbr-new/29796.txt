<title>Issue 29796 -   chromium -    Expanding window on second monitor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. Maximize window on first monitor  2. Drag window to second monitor using title bar  3. Un maximize (don't minimize  just turn it into a window)      The window to go to window mode.      The entire window gets shifted up inside itself. The title bar dissappears    and you can no longer use the window or click on it. Unless you maximize it   with a hotkey.    Also  if i have the window maximised on my main monitor  it spills over   into the other one. By about 4 pixels. I know it doesn't seem like much    but it's a little annoying  i've attached a screenshot for that as well.   (googlechromebleed)  i've circled the part near the bottom taskbar on the   second monitor where you can see it spilling over. Both monitors are   different sizes and run at different resolutions.    That should be it  thanks for this amazingly fast browser.   </pre>
