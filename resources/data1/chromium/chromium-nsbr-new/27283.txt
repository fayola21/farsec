<title>Issue 27283 -   chromium -    report a bug dialog doesn't send consistent values for problem_type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> looks like we use the index of the menu for the problem type  if the window   was opened without a browser window  the indexes are different.  the values   should be normalized to always match on all platforms otherwise  looking at   the data is sorta challenging.    NOTE: you'll have to make an enum that matches windows for now because   the values windows uses are in a file we can't share.  I filed <a href="http://crbug.com/27281">http://crbug.com/27281</a> for that problem. </pre>
