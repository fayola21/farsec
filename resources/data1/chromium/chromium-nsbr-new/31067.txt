<title>Issue 31067 -   chromium -    Chrome Extensions: no access to theme images/styles. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As the subject says.  To code a 'chrome looking' extension I had to grab the sources and include   the theme images in my extension.  There should be a way just to include &quot;chrome://theme/blah.png&quot;  so if the   user changes the theme  the extension will follow.   </pre>
