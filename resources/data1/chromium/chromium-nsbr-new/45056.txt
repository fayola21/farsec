<title>Issue 45056 -   chromium -    RedirectTest.ClientCancelledByNewNavigationAfterProvisionalLoad is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> filing a bug for this just to track the issue.    // TODO(timsteele): This is disabled because our current testserver can't  // handle multiple requests in parallel  making it hang on the first request  // to /slow?60. It's unable to serve our second request for   files/title2.html  // until /slow? completes  which doesn't give the desired behavior. We could  // alternatively load the second page from disk  but we would need to start  // the browser for this testcase with --process-per-tab  and I don't think  // we can do this at test-case-level granularity at the moment.    perhaps the test should just be re-written? </pre>
