<title>Issue 39210 -   chromium -    Popup windows should not allow navigation via drops on their contents - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't allow the user to navigate a popup window by typing in the omnibox   or dropping things on it; it is read-only.  However  we do allow drops on the   content area to navigate the popup.  This is an oversight.  We shouldn't   allow these on popup windows. </pre>
