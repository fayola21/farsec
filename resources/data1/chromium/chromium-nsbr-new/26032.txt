<title>Issue 26032 -   chromium -    Security feature: add &quot;view in a sandbox&quot; option for SSL errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copying discussion from <a title="Allow mixed-content/&quot;bad SSL&quot; iframe warning to be bypassed via infobar"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25728">issue 25728</a>; Adam volunteered to investigate this a  bit more:    &quot;I think the whole model of interstitials / blocking is flawed  because it  (temporarily) stops people from doing what they wanted to based on a signal  that most of the time is a false positive (and with fairly convoluted  security consequences because of SOP and caching)  but offers them no  plausible alternative.    The only nice solution I can think of is offering a third alternative to  &quot;go back to disney.com&quot; and &quot;visit and be immediately owned&quot;. One  possibility is letting the user view a dangerous page in a separate  renderer (no DOM access) with a separate cache / cookie jar  essentially a  rebranded incognito mode - with a red browser frame and other window chrome  prominently indicating that the page is not safe  and the user should not  log in or enter sensitive information.    [...] I'd love seeing it done one day  somewhere... since it could  essentially reuse the incognito mode and existing separation models of  Chrome  there is very little downside?&quot;     </pre>
