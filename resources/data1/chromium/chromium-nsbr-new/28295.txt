<title>Issue 28295 -   chromium -    html5 video crashes the renderer when the window is maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested on Hardy with 64-bit Google Chrome 4.0.249.0. This bug does not  occur on 32-bit. I'm running with TwinView at 3840x1200 if that helps.    Maximize the browser window and visit the html5 version of Youtube -&gt;  instant renderer crash. Sample crash:  http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=354aa2f7f404d624    I will get try to get a stack trace... marking as private for now because I  don't know if youtube + html5 is public yet. </pre>
