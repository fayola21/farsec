<title>Issue 24495 -   chromium -    Status bubble needs delays and fades - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac status bubble shows up instantaneously on mouseover  and   disappears instantaneously on mouseout.  This is wrong.    Steps to reproduce: mouse over anything.  Expect: delays and fades.  Observe: the status bubble shows up and disappears immediately  without   delay or fade.    <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/user-experience/status-">http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/user-experience/status-</a>  bubble    The status bubble should fade in and fade out.  There should also be a   delay before fading a bubble in and before fading a bubble out.  This is   supposed to reduce flicker.  It's also probably supposed to reduce jank  but   I don't really know what jank means.    See <a title="Make status bubbles fade in and out" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17491"> bug 17491 </a> for GTK (fades).    The timings used on Windows   (chrome/browser/views/status_bubble_views.cc) are:    kShowDelay = 80 (ms to wait before showing a bubble when hidden)  kHideDelay = 250 (ms to wait before hiding a bubble when shown)  kShowFadeDurationMS = 120 (ms to play the fade-in transition)  kHideFadeDurationMS = 200 (ms to play the fade-out transition)    In chrome/browser/cocoa/status_bubble_mac.mm  I see   kShowFadeDuration (0.12) and kHideFadeDuration (0.2) and both seem to   be used  so I'm not sure what's missing here  but I'm certainly not seeing   any fading.    In that file  I also see:    // TODO(avi):  // - do display delay    so Avi gets a Cc here. </pre>
