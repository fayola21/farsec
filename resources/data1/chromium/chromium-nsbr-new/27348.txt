<title>Issue 27348 -   chromium -    New window does not become active if opened from taskbar while another app is active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Pin the Google Chrome shortcut on taskbar (also if its just open)  2. Right click on shortcut and select either &quot;new window' or 'new incognito   window' (doesnt matter if chrome window is in focus or not)      Chrome should open with the focus being on the omni bar to be able to start   typing straight away      the window is often fully not in focus therefore you cannot type into the   omni box before clicking into it.  seems to happen every second time you select to open a new window from the   taskbar      <b>Please provide
