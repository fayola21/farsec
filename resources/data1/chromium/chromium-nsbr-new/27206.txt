<title>Issue 27206 -   chromium -    Mac: theme colors inconsistent between content area and native UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Compare the colors in the screenshots in the themes gallery to those that   actually result when a theme is applied. I suggest &quot;Lilly Pulitzer&quot; (look at   the greens) and &quot;Tory Burch&quot; (look at the oranges). Also compare the   colors in the content area in the new tab page (they match the screenshot)   to those in the native UI (e.g.  the tab/tab strip/title bar area). For example    the color of the &quot;Recently closed&quot; bubble in the NTP should match the color   of the tab in &quot;Lilly Pulitzer&quot;  but they don't.    Everything is consistent in Windows. My general impression on the Mac is   that the images in the content area looks over-saturated  while those in   the native UI look under-saturated. I'm not convinced that the correct   colors are being displayed in either area  though that's hard to tell.    (Has anyone double-checked to make sure that colors are being correctly   interpreted in Win Chrome for that matter?) </pre>
