Sign in to a Google Apps email account.  2. Click on an email message to read.    What is the expected result? Email should be displayed almost instantly.      What happens instead? Request hangs and results in the attached error message.    Additional details: I use Gmail for my personal email  and it works fine in Chrome.  I also use   Google Apps email for my site Watch Report  and this is the one that's having problems.  This is   reproducible 100% of the time both from work and home (two different connections).  This does   not occur in any other browser (Safari or Firefox). </pre>
