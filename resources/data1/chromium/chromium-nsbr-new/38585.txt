<title>Issue 38585 -   chromium -    Can't enter characters using character palette - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta    OS version               : 10.5.8 (but I've also seen the problem in 10.6)      1. In System Preferences  use International|Input menu to enable the   character palette in the status bar. (Unless your system is already   configured with the character palette enabled.)  2. Open the character palette.  3. Put the cursor in any Chrome input field  such as the one I'm typing in   now.  4. Select any character from the character palette  and click 'Insert'.      The selected character should appear in the input field I'm typing in. This   works correctly on all other Mac browsers I've tried.      Nothing. No character appears.    </pre>
