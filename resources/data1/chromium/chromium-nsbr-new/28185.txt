<title>Issue 28185 -   chromium -    Focus/border sticks when removing a thumbnail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open NTP  - click X on a thumbnail to remove it from NTP    expected:  - new thumb replaces it  moving mouse hides thumbnail border    actual:  - border &quot;sticks&quot; in that it won't go away as you mouse over other   thumbnails. You have to click on the page to get it to go away.    This appears to be mac-only (miranda couldn't repro with her recent   Chrome binary) and is a regression. Targeting investigation for M4 since   it's visible.    Krisr: Can we get some binary search love to nail down the regression   build? </pre>
