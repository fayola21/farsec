<title>Issue 34837 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar completely broken on 'New Tab page' under Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new window of Chromium  2. Open a second blank tab in that window (Make sure your home page is set to &quot;New Tab Page&quot;    and that you do not have the bookmark bar set to display all the time)  3. Attempt to click on any of your bookmarks or bookmark folders that are displayed at the top.      If I am clicking on a bookmark  I expect for the browser to redirect me.  If I am clicking on a bookmark folder  I expect for that bookmark folder to open and display   its contents.      Nothing. The bookmarks do not become highlighted when I hover over them with my mouse  nor does   clicking on them do anything. The folders likewise do not open when clicked on.    When playing around with it to try to find out more  I noticed that the bookmark bar works   properly in the original tab opened whenever I start Chromium. However  if I create a second   tab in that same window  it does not. Even stranger still: If I then tear that second tab away   from the first window so that it is now in its own window  the bookmark bar works for that new   window (but only until I create a second tab on that new window  at which point it stops   working again).    Please provide
