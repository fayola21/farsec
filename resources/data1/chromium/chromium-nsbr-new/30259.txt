<title>Issue 30259 -   chromium -    Crash if download location is set to non-accessible hard drive (or perhaps location) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In options  set default downloads location to a folder in a drive which   can have it's drive letter removed. Checking the box to ask where to save   every time does not seem to matter.  2. Close Chrome. From Disk Management  remove the drive letter to the disk   where Downloads folder is located.  3. Launch Chrome. Try to download a file  access options menu/under the   hood (to correct the download folder  e.g.)  close the browser  restart the   browser. All of these will result in a crash.      When trying to download a file  a pop-out window would ask where to place   the downloaded file  even if the option is not selected  as the default   folder is not accessible (for example  Firefox simply does nothing if &quot;ask   every time&quot; is not selected). When trying to access &quot;under the hood&quot;  it   should be accessible. Browser should be able to close  and behave in a   stable manner otherwise.      Chrome crashes upon trying execute any of the above steps  or sometimes   even randomly  especially if restarted after a crash. I believe it tries to   create the Download folder (which I understand it tries to do every time in   the background even if nothing is being downloaded)  and then crashes.    <b>Please provide
