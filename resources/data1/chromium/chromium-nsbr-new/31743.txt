<title>Issue 31743 -   chromium -    Extensions don't found Icon128.png file.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On linux machines (tested on Ubunto and Gentoo)  my extension doesn't work.  We get a message: &quot;��_��_Could not load extension icon 'icon128.png'.�_&quot;    I understand that it's because my extension contain &quot;Icon128.png&quot;.  We rename it to &quot;icon128.png&quot; and it's worked.    Before the rename  it was work on Microsoft machines  but not on Linux   machines.    My extension URL:  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki</a>  ----  fileName.toLowerCase(); </pre>
