Launched Chromium.app        Expected: normal start page with bookmark bar  Actual: normal start page with bookmark bar  but the bookmark bar was transparent.  See attached   screenshot.  Clicking on bookmark buttons worked normally  but clicking in the background   brought the window behind the browser to the front. </pre>
