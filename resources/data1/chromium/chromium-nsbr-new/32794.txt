<title>Issue 32794 -   chromium -    Bookmark Bar Drag and Drop is too sensitive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click and hold on a bookmark on the bookmark bar  2. Drop it into a folder    This is hard to describe but the bookmark bar seems to be a little too sensitive to the mouse button   when I try to click on a folder.     When browsing for a specific bookmark in a folder on the bookmark bar sometimes I might click too   long and instead of opening the folder it drags it and then the animation brings the folders on the   bar together and then I think &quot;whoops  I don't want to drag this&quot; and when I drop the folder it falls   into one of the folders that got slid underneath it.        Not sure  either have a bookmark not be so sensitive to being picked up or don't have the other   bookmarks arrange underneath it I think? Or maybe a delay after the click?        I end up accidentally dropping a folder in another folder and it looks like my original folder   disappeared until I realized I was accidentally dropping it in another folder. Since there's no real   animation when arranging them it's difficult to figure out exactly what just happened.    <b>Please provide
