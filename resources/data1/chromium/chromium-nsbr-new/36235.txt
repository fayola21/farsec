<title>Issue 36235 -   chromium -    Extensions Should be Exempt from getImageData() Domain Restrictions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : Extension Content Scripts  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): NA  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Unknown  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Same      1. Create an extension that attempts to manipulate images in the page using the &lt;canvas&gt;   tag (see attached code)  2. Load a webpage that contains images from another domain and try to access the image's   pixel data with getImageData on a canvas tag. (such as ebay.com)  3. The extension is not allowed to access the pixel data to perform a transformation.      That the extension is able to access the image if the domain it lies on is in the manifest (eg   we can do HTTP requests to the domain with the extension)      Uncaught Error: SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18    -------------------------    I'm looking at enhancing images in a page using the canvas tag unfortunately I'm running   into the problem that most websites use a CDN to serve their images so the pixel data is not   available (since it's not coming from the same domain).    Attached is a sample content script that turns images grayscale; as you'll not it only works   when the images on the page are from the same domain as the page.  For example  it works   on the Google homepage but not on eBay.com because eBay uses pics.ebaystatic.com to   serve their images. </pre>
