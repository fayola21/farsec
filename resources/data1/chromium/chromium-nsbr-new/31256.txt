<title>Issue 31256 -   chromium -    Delicious Post Bookmark Window always has scrollbars - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Get the Post Bookmark link from <a href="http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets">http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets</a>  2. Login to a Delicious Account  3. Click the Post Bookmark Link      A small window comes up that allows you to post a bookmark to Delicious  and   shouldn't have scrollbars anywhere on it.      Chrome renders the window with scrollbars Even though no content is big   enough to merit displaying scrollbars. To get rid of the horizontal scrollbar you   have to stretch the window to over 3x it's original width  I don't even have a big   enough monitor/resolution to stretch the window vertically enough for it to get   rid of the vertical scrollbar.    Safari renders the same window correctly without scrollbars.    <b>Please provide
