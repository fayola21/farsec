<title>Issue 40856 -   chromium -    Installing a theme twice makes it so that 'Undo' on the infobar doesn't do anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install a theme (e.g. ). Wait for the infobar to show up  but don't dismiss it.  2. Install the theme again.  Wait a few seconds.  3. Click 'Undo' on the infobar.        'Undo' should change the theme to the original (pre-step 1) theme.  Instead  it remains on the new   theme.   </pre>
