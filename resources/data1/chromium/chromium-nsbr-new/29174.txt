<title>Issue 29174 -   chromium -    Cancel download window needs to be improved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.260.0 (Developer Build 33308)  OS + version : Linux      1. start a download  2. close the chrome window    =&gt; the confirmation window needs to be improved    - add a warning sign /! icon  - alert windows should not have a window name (see GNOME HIG)  - space between elements is too big  space to the window borders also needs   some love  - the &quot;headline&quot; should use a slightly larger font size  - generally  I think the dialog should be phrased differently  something   like:    Wait for X downloads to finish?  If you close now  your downloads will be cancelled.  [Close and cancel downloads] [Wait]    (The point of this alert is to give a choice to step back from the   potentially destructive action  so the button on the right should be the   &quot;save&quot; default option.)    A lot of useful information regarding alert window design can be found   here:  <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/windows-alert.html.en">http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/windows-alert.html.en</a> </pre>
