<title>Issue 36682 -   chromium -    show &quot;Translating...&quot; in after-translate infobar when translation is triggered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open a page that will show the translate infobar  e.g. spiegel.de in   english chrome.  2. click &quot;Translate&quot; button to trigger translation.  3. after page is translated  modify the target language to trigger another   translation.    Expected:  infobar should show &quot;Translating...&quot; while page is waiting for translation   to complete.    Actual:  infobar remains the same.  for slow connections  user might not know   translation has already been triggered.   </pre>
