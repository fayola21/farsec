<title>Issue 39710 -   chromium -    All tabs crash when /dev/shm isn't writable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) sudo chmod o-w /dev/shm    2) google-chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/newprofile .  It prints  [6790:6790:517879221104:ERROR:/usr/local/google/b/slave/chrome-official-  linux-64/build/src/base/shared_memory_posix.cc(194)] This is frequently   caused by incorrect permissions on /dev/shm.  Try 'sudo chmod 777 /dev/shm'   to fix.    3) try to load any tabs.  all crash.    We detect and warn about this on the console  but apparently something has   changed such that we now can't start up a renderer at all when we're in   this state.  (Perhaps tcmalloc?)  We should either fix the fallback   mechanism or be more aggressive about informing the user of this error. </pre>
