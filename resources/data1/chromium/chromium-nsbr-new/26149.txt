<title>Issue 26149 -   chromium -    extension updates should ignore unexpected extensions mentioned in the update manifest - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Start with extensions A and B installed  both at version 1.0  each with   different update urls.     2) Imagine that in the update manifest for extension A  there is also an   &lt;app&gt; tag with an id matching extension B's id and a version &gt; 1.0. This   should be ignored  but the current code will go and fetch the .crx file (it   will fail to install if it's not properly signed  but we still should not   fetch it).     (See also <a title="Need tests for an extension update being improperly signed" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19403"> Issue 19403 </a> which was slightly related)       </pre>
