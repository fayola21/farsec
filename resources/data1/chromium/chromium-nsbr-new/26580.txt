<title>Issue 26580 -   chromium -    Opening the context menu disables left mouse click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29900">r29900</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): i686 (32-bit)  window manager : KDE  URLs (if applicable) : Happens on all web sites  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): didn't check      1. Open any web site  <a href="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</a> for example.  2. Right click on the page to get the context menu.  3. Close the context menu by any means: select an option like &quot;Save as&quot; or   press Esc key to cancel the menu.      context menu goes away and the page is as usable as it was before the menu   popped up.      context menu goes away but the page doesn't let me click anywhere: I cannot   click on buttons/link  enter text in text fields  select text.  Only way to   get the page working again is to refresh.  However  I'm able to scroll the   page and right-click seems to bring the context menu as usual.  The page   also responds to key presses.     </pre>
