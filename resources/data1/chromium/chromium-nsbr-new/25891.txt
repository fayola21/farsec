<title>Issue 25891 -   chromium -    ResourceBundle code can be shared more between Mac and Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> app/resource_bundle_linux.cc and app/resource_bundle_mac.mm have a   bunch of code in common.  We should have a single implementation of the   common code (resource_bundle_posix.cc?  example GetRawDataResource)   and keep the truly platform-specific bits (examples GetPixbufNamed    GetNSImageNamed) in the platform-specific files. </pre>
