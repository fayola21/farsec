<title>Issue 32861 -   chromium -    Use GStreamer as a media backend - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : chromium-4.0.285.0-0.1.20091230svn35370.fc12.x86_64   (builds from Tom 'Spot' Callaway)  OS + version : Fedora 12  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86-64  window manager : N/A  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">http://www.youtube.com/html5</a>          1. Try to watch a video via HTML5 on YouTube      Video plays      Get told (rightfully) that my browser doesn't support the video codecs in   question    Currently  chromium uses ffmpeg directly for HTML5 video playback. This   means that  depending on the flags passed to chromium's configure  there   will be more or less support for videos.    The problems are:  - Fedora (and a number of other distributions) can not ship with MPEG-4   video support builtin because of patent problems  making the code   essentially &quot;non-free&quot;  - ffmpeg does not support plugins  thus making it impossible to split out   the support for MPEG-4 (and allow users to get just that part from   third-parties)    I already have support for MPEG-4 videos on my systems through additional   GStreamer plugins (whether based on ffmpeg or proprietary software   provided by Fluendo  or handled through my computer's GPU).    If Chromium used GStreamer  then I could add plugins to extend my browser   without modifying the distribution (or Google) provided packages.    A few data points to run this home:  - Webkit-GTK uses GStreamer  - Songbird uses GStreamer on MacOS X/Windows/Linux:  <a href="http://blog.songbirdnest.com/2009/03/03/gstreamer-for-all/">http://blog.songbirdnest.com/2009/03/03/gstreamer-for-all/</a>  - Firefox (Fennec) is working on using GStreamer:  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=422540">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=422540</a> </pre>
