<title>Issue 27675 -   chromium -    1366x768 mp4 video crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this video crashes chrome 3 and 4 (aww snap)  <a href="http://fbarchard-kir.ad.corp.google.com/mediatests/runthrough.mp4">http://fbarchard-kir.ad.corp.google.com/mediatests/runthrough.mp4</a> file.  it works okay in safari and mplayer.  it decodes okay in media_bench as well.    the video is 1366 wide which is not a multiple of 16.  a 1280x720 version of the same video is okay.  it was encoded with adobe media encoder    the problem is likely a memory overflow. </pre>
