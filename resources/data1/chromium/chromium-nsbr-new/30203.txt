<title>Issue 30203 -   chromium -    At times in ChromeFrame IE full tab mode HTTPS sessions don't get established - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This can be reproduced in sites like <a href="https://webbranch.techcu.com">https://webbranch.techcu.com</a>    <a href="http://www.citibank.com">http://www.citibank.com</a>  etc.    At times this works the first time in IE. If we logoff and try again the   logon attempts just timeout.    This typically happens when the initial logon attempt redirects to an   intermediate page. We abort this attempt in IE and rely on ChromeFrame to   follow the redirect. While that does work correctly from Chrome  in IE   inspite of returning E_ABORT from our IBindStatusCallback::OnProgress   implementation and aborting the binding urlmon continues to attempt to   establish a connection with the redirected url. This can be seen by calls   to IHttpNegotiate::BeginningTransaction.   </pre>
