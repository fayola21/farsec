A drop-down appears displaying three lines which read 'one'  'two'   'three'. Can click on one of the lines to choose that value for the select  control.      A plain white rectangle appears. It behaves as if it is displaying the  three lines  but they are rendered in white text on a white background. Can  click within the white area to choose a value for the select control  but  can't see exactly which line you are selecting.      <b>Please provide
