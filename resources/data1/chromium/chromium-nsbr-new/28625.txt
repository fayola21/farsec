<title>Issue 28625 -   chromium -    HTML dialogs flashes sad tab page on browser quit (OS X) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start chromium with --enable-sync on OS X  2. Open sync setup wizard (wrench menu  &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot;)  3. Open a few more browser windows so that quitting isn't instantanous.  4. Hit Command-Q to quit Chromium.        The sad tab page flashes briefly in the open HTML dialog before the window is   closed.    I suspect it's because the Profile object is getting deleted before the HTML   dialog window is closed. </pre>
