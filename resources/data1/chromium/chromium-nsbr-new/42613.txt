Go to a web page in Google Chrome  2.  Click and hold on the globe at the left end of the URL bar  3.  Drag the globe to a &quot;Stack&quot; representation of a folder in the Mac OS-X dock      A webloc file will be created in the folder that is in the dock      Nothing    The strange thing about this bug...
