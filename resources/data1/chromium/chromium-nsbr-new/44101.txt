<title>Issue 44101 -   chromium -    After a long up-time in Windows 7  can't switch input language any more - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After a long up-time of the browser (any version I tested so far) in Windows 7    I can't change the input language anymore  until I restart the OS.  Got the same feedback from about 10 other people (which all had this   problem for Hebrew  but I believe it will happen with other languages as well)      1. Use Chrome on Windows 7 for a few hours  2. Try to change the input language and see it gets stuck.      Change the input language when I press alt+shift...      It get's stuck on either Hebrew or English. </pre>
