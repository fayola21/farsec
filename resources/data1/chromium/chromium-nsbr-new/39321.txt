<title>Issue 39321 -   chromium -    Mouse pointer  disappears: security fail linked with flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed it happens on sites that have Flash banners swapping the mouse  pointer. Mostly you can get the pointer back by rolling over the Flash banner  once more.  I have 5.0.356.2 dev and flash 10.1 beta 3  I've added a video of the problem </pre>
