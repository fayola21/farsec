<title>Issue 27266 -   chromium -    Flash Based applications hanging whole system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Flash (plug-in) based application from the browser  2. Depending on the usage  system CPU consumption for that chrome.exe goes high  3. And if you still use this flash based game  whole system hangs  wont  respond for any key/mouse events. I will have to hard reboot the system.  This behavior is not consistent  there were days when my laptop hung 3  times a day.      If it is the issue with that paricular flash based application/page  then  only that page/window should hang and not the whole system [thats what  google chrome claims]  This happens with Firefox too  the behavior with both firefox and chrome is  absolutely same.        At times  whole system hangs [when I use flash based games]  wont respond  for any key/mouse events. I will have to hard reboot the system.    <b>Please provide
