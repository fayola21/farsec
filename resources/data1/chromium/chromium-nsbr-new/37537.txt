<title>Issue 37537 -   chromium -    Offline Gmail Crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com    My gmail is supposed to download offline emails  however  currently  I   receive the Windows &quot;the following program has stopped responding  send error   report blah blah blah&quot;...  It also occurs with Calendar.  This is due to a   recent update because on another computer I rarely use  it updated earlier   today and when I restarted the computer  I had the problem of Gmail &amp; Google   Calendar crashing.  This is possibly related to <a title="Google Chrome Crashes when trying to open Calendar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37483"> issue 37483 </a>.  Gmail will load fine by selecting &quot;load with offline disabled&quot;. </pre>
