<title>Issue 37789 -   chromium -    Need UI input for warning when enabling extensions in incognito - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You can now individually enable extensions in incognito. Since we don't have   any controls over what the extension does in incognito  it might save your   incognito data to disk. So we warn the user with a dialog when they try to   enable an  extension in incognito.    I've attached a screenshot showing what the dialog currently looks like. I'm   looking for feedback on the dialog text and the approach in general. </pre>
