<title>Issue 41933 -   chromium -    Flash behaves incorrectly if webpage is zoomed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/">http://www.cnn.com/video/</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3            1.Goto <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/">http://www.cnn.com/video/</a>  2.Zoom in on the page  3.Try to play any videos      I would expect flash to be scaled as well or at least not break functionality      The Flash content does not seem to zoom with the rest of the page.  As a result  the flash   controllers on the video become corrupted.  If you try to click on  any buttons  it does not seem   to register correctly...it almost seems that the button position where it expects a click matches   the zoomed out proportions but the actual button graphics do not rescale to the new location. </pre>
