<title>Issue 34522 -   chromium -    Mac: deletion of bookmark with bookmark button context menu up or while dragging button can crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is similar to <a title="Mac: Deletion of bookmark with bookmark bubble up can crash" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34513"> issue 34513 </a> -- create a bookmark (&quot;Foo&quot;) and set up sync   on two computers. Or  maybe easier  write an extension that'll delete the   bookmark after a delay. But now  on computer #1 (a Mac):    1. Right click the &quot;Foo&quot; button.  2. Then  with that menu still up  delete &quot;Foo&quot; on computer #2.  3. When the bookmark disappears  click  say  &quot;Edit...&quot;.    Or:    1. Click and drag the &quot;Foo&quot; button on computer #1. Hold it down.  2. With your other hand  delete &quot;Foo&quot; on computer #2.  3. After a while  (on computer #1  with hand #1) release it somewhere   (maybe elsewhere on the bookmark bar; it probably doesn't matter so   much).    Neither of these crash on Win Chrome.    I'll write an extension to make these repros easier soon.... </pre>
