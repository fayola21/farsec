<title>Issue 36625 -   chromium -    UnZiping Chrome OS image.zip file fails due to corrupted binary download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.323.0 (Official Build 38551) dev  WebKit	533.1  V8	2.1.0  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.1  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.323.0 Safari/533.1        0. Open Chrome Browser.  1. From Chrome OS Waterfall builds - download any latest image.zip file  locally.  eg:   <a href="http://codg163.jail.google.com/archive/x86-new-image-rel/0.5.31.0-r716c6e75-b187/">http://codg163.jail.google.com/archive/x86-new-image-rel/0.5.31.0-r716c6e75-b187/</a>    2. Try to Unzip the file        It should unzip the file properly . Instead unzip throws an error.    Note  -  On Firefox  downloading the same binary and unziping works fine without any  errors. Issue is consistently reproable on 2 machines.
