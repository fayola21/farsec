<title>Issue 46034 -   chromium -    Consider rate-limiting paint flush callbacks for invisible plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some plugins may do update loops for painting in response to flush events. Some programmers are likely to not realize they should check for visibility before doing animations  and just always run their update loop. If the plugin scrolls out of view  it will still eat almost as much CPU just updating the backing store.    We may want to send the Flush callbacks more slowly in the case that the plugin is not visible or if the device is not bound to a plugin instance. This could be as simple as putting a ~1 second delay on the special &quot;offscreen_fluch_callbacks_&quot; we maintain.    Doing this may cause a glitch as the plugin scrolls into view since it will wait up until that period before updating. We can also special case the expose and update pending offscreen flushes faster if we have them. </pre>
