<title>Issue 42984 -   chromium -    Chrome breaks Windows 7's display of Unicode  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome          All Unicode in Windows 7 should display as normal      Windows 7's display of unicode is mucked up and everything shows as blocks   even on the OS level. This is recurrent after closing chrome as well.    Note that I have isolated this to chrome and windows 7 combination only.   All dev versions since 4 have shown this behavior  I've only recently   isolated it.      <b>Please provide
