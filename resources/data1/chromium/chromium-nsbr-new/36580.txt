<title>Issue 36580 -   chromium -    SPDY spec needs to be clear about URL escaping in new header fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The SPDY spec needs to be clear about whether X-Subresource   X-Associated-Content and path header URLs should be URL-escaped.    Additionally  the Chrome SPDY stack may need modification to ensure that  incorrectly escaped URLs are correctly matched up  e.g. between HTTP GET  URLs and the 'path' header of stream pushes. I discovered this as a problem  when benchmarking SPDY - some URLs were differently escaped  and the server  push streams would not get picked up by the client  which caused additional  (illegal) GETs to be sent to the server to request resources that had  already been pushed. This consumed extra bandwidth unnecessarily  and  impaired the performance of server push compared to server hint. </pre>
