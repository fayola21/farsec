<title>Issue 30638 -   chromium -    inspector tests are very slow on win-debug bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I noticed that these tests each take 6-7 seconds on the debug Windows bot and &lt;1 second on the release bot. They're currently skipped on mac/linux. So  these 14 tests alone add   20-30 seconds to the debug cycle time. My guess is that there's just a dcheck or something that needs to be made one of V8's slow checks. If someone has time to take a quick   look  that'd be much appreciated.
