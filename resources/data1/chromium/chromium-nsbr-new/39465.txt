<title>Issue 39465 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.create({&quot;url&quot;:null}) causes extension process to be killed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create an extension with tabs permission and a background page  and in the   background page notice that calling chrome.tabs.create({&quot;url&quot;:null}) causes   the extension process to be killed.    While we do have some valid reasons for killing the extension process when we   get malformed IPCs or API requests  this one should probably not be an   offense punishable by process death.       </pre>
