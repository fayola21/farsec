<title>Issue 30997 -   chromium -    Disable video loop filtering for low performing machines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For some video codecs we can disable loop filtering which sacrifices  quality in exchange for (potentially) playing back at full speed.    We could either do all the time  automatically based on inspecting the host  system  or a command line flag  or an #ifdef.    Since this is sacrificing quality we should punt on the decision until  deemed absolutely necessary (i.e.  lets try to fix our rendering issues first). </pre>
