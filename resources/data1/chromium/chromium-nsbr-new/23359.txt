<title>Issue 23359 -   chromium -    Crash when &quot;Edit search engines&quot; and close Incognito window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an Incognito window.  2. Right-click in Omnibox  select &quot;Edit search engines...&quot;  3. Close the Incognito window.  4. Double-click to edit something in &quot;Search Engines&quot; window.        KeywordEditorView has a global window which references the profile it was initialized with.  If   initialized with the Incognito profile  it can end up with a stale reference.  If you open from a   regular profile and then close it while you have an Incognito window open  this doesn't happen   because the Incognito profile retains a reference to the main profile (I think).   </pre>
