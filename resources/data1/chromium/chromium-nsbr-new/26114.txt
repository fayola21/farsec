<title>Issue 26114 -   chromium -    Can drag and drop Chrome window so that title bar is hidden (Ubuntu) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)  Chrome: 4.0.227.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30303">r30303</a>)        1. Click on the title bar (near the bottom of the bar) and drag the Chrome  window upwards so that the title bar slides under the Ubuntu menu bar.  2. Drop the Chrome window at that position.    What is the expected output?     Should not be able to move the Chrome window to a position where the title  bar is hidden.    What do you see instead?    The Chrome title bar is hidden under the Ubuntu menu bar  so you can't drag  it back.  So it's basically stuck there.   </pre>
