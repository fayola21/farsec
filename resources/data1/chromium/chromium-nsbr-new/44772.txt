<title>Issue 44772 -   chromium -    Some preferences values should be merged in model association - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the preferences model association will always take the server's value of a preference   during model association.  This makes sense for single valued preferences  but in the case of certain   list or dict preferences  we can merge them instead.    Right now the preferences that I think we should merge are:  - list of startup pages  - content setting exception lists -- if there are conflicting rules with the same pattern  take the   server's version.   </pre>
