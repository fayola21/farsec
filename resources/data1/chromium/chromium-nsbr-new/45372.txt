<title>Issue 45372 -   chromium -    NativeTextField differs differs on GTK from Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a discrepancy in how GTK and Windows send notifications about   textfields changing value.    The NativeTextFieldWin implementation doesn't send ContentsChanged if the   contents of the textbox is set to the same value it had before. The GTK    however  sends it on every write to the textfield.    This makes it hard for people relying on this event to write code that works   on both Windows and ChromeOS because the event means ContentsChanged on   Windows but ContentsOverwritten (so to speak) on ChromeOS.    Shouldn't this event work the same on both platforms?    CC-ing knowledgeable people and people who have been changing these files for   comments ... </pre>
