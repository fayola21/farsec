<title>Issue 40329 -   chromium -    Browser action container doesn't remember its width across browser restarts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2 (Official Build 43280) dev (Windows)    Resize the browser action container  close chrome  restart chrome  the   container returns to 0-width showing the chevrons.  I would expect it to   remember its last size and restore it.    Order of browser actions is preserved  just not width of container. </pre>
