<title>Issue 28544 -   chromium -    Loss in responsiveness on a remote NX session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.249.4 (Official Build 32475)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.12  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.4 Safari/532.5              Firefox 3.x:OK          1. Connect to a linux host using a NX session.  2. Start chrome in the Nx session  3. Flipping tabs or scrolling down a page is very laggy - 3-5 seconds for   page scroll down.    Firefox is quite responsive. I have seen this on a 6mbps/2mbps connection.  Note that without NX chrome is fine on a native X session or on NX on LAN.  NX host - ubuntu hardy with chrome  NX client - ubuntu karmic with nx client.     This essentially makes chrome unusable over NX.   </pre>
