<title>Issue 44941 -   chromium -    Extensions using Google Analytics async crash on Mac (and Debian) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Add Google Analytics to your extension's background page (you can even  use the snippet from here:  <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tut_analytics.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tut_analytics.html</a>)  2. Install the extension on Mac dev builds (I've also heard reports that  this breaks on Debian too  but haven't confirmed).      Extension and Google Analytics should work. This works fine on Ubuntu and  Windows.       - Extension consumes 100% CPU and blows up to 500-600 MB of memory.   - Extension pages (options  browser actions) can't be loaded.   - Extension either crashes or you need to disable it.    <b>Please provide
