<title>Issue 27295 -   chromium -    Inspector taskbar icons are blacked out sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to a webpage  2. Launch inspector  Ctrl+Shift+I  3. Reload inspector using the reload option in menu    What is the expected output?   The first two icons should not be blacked out    What do you see instead?  They will be blacked out but they still work. Most of the times this   happens when we reload the inspector.    Eventually reload will be gone  but sometimes it might happen for initial   load as well.    Google Chrome	4.0.241.0 (Official Build 31417) </pre>
