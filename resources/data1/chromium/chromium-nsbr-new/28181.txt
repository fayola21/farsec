<title>Issue 28181 -   chromium -    Can't play crazy taxi  on facebook - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/mindjolt/games/crazy-cabbie">http://apps.facebook.com/mindjolt/games/crazy-cabbie</a>  2. Start the game and try to play - Up arrow is used to move forward and Space to jump  3. Press up arrow key and then press spacebar    What is the expected output?   Car should jump    What do you see instead?  Car jumps but lags so much that it's not possible to play the game.     I've tried it on Linux 4.0.249.0 and it works fine. Looks like Chrome OS is the one that has this issue.    Google Chrome OS	0.3.22.2 (Official Build 242)  Google Chrome	4.0.245.0 (Official Build 31763) </pre>
