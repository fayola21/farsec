<title>Issue 23568 -   chromium -    HTMLMediaElement::percentLoaded() does not return 1.0 despite being loaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load up a file:// source in &lt;video&gt;  2. Set a breakpoint to inspect percentLoaded()  3. Notice that it's slightly under 1.0f    Reason being WebMediaPlayerImpl::buffered_ is slightly smaller than   WebMediaPlayerImpl::duration_    We can probably modify LayoutTests/media/video-buffered.html to include   checking this condition.    This has an impact on player UIs wishing to use buffered attribute (also   applies to our default UI). </pre>
