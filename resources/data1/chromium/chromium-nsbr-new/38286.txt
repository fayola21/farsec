<title>Issue 38286 -   chromium -    Bad and missing Translatebar functionallity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 beta (41514)    Provide the translation bar with the same option as the taskbar in Windows   with options always visible - hide automatically - always hide (in extra -   advanced options).    1.This saves a lot of annoyance for many users because the nuisance   translation bar is always visible and proposes a translation.    In the hidden mode moving the cursor over the edge where the bar is  the   bar will be shown for some seconds to make use of it.    You dont want as stated sometimes to shut off the bar. The user does not   want to translate every page necessarily  but a specific page in the   proposed language. This will keep the speed of loading pages without having   them to translate first and the bar is hidden but accesable.     This option setting should be in the settings area of the browser for   example advanced options.    2. The bar option never &quot;language&quot; translate is useless because the pages   will be loaded and shown default in their own language except when the user   desides otherwise.    the bar option never translate &quot;this site&quot; is very handy incase the user   desides to translate every specified language except this specific page.   Reason for example is that lots of times the expression of the language is   different then the users language and the user wants to read it in the   original language.    3. Important functionallity Add: also the option in the bar &quot;Always load   this page translated in ......(language).....&quot;  </pre>
