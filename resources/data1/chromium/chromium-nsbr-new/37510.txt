<title>Issue 37510 -   chromium -    Switch all geolocation timestamps to use Time::Now - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently geolocation wifi cell &amp; location structs store their timestamp in an   internal (gears-compatible) format. Instead they should be based off   base/time.h Time.  ToInternalValue() can be used if needed to externalize into int64 struct   members where needed. </pre>
