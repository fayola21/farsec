<title>Issue 29457 -   chromium -    Implement NPN_ConvertPoint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to support NPN_ConvertPoint  which was introduced with the Cocoa event model.    It's unfortunately not really documented anywhere  but  <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/generic/nsPluginUtilsOSX.mm#139">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/generic/nsPluginUtilsOSX.mm#139</a>  gives a clear indication of how it's supposed to work (at least on the Mac; the API is unfortunately   pretty Mac-centric  and Gecko hasn't implemented it on other platforms yet either). </pre>
