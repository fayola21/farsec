<title>Issue 33697 -   chromium -    Can't see Options window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	5.0.307.0 (Developer Build 37223) Ubuntu      Hi! I am a ubuntu linux user on my netbook (ASUS eeePC 1005). I have a   1024x600px display resolution. And when I do this steps:     1. Click on Wrench icon  2. Choose 'Option'    I see a big window which don't get in my screen.   If I resize it  I can't see all parts of Option window (below 'Default   browser' on first tab  text below 'Appearance' on second tab  text below   'Downloads' on third tab)    See screenshot in the attachment.      </pre>
