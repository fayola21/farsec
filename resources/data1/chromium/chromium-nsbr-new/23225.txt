<title>Issue 23225 -   chromium -    moving text from one input to another - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/signup/">http://en.wordpress.com/signup/</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK      1. Enter some text in the Username input  2. Select the text (all text or partial text  it doesn't matter)  3. Drag text to the Email Address input      The selected text is moved or copied to the Email Address input. IE moves    FF copies  any of the two would be OK for me.      The text is not copied or moved.  The caret does appear in the destination   input when the mouse is over it but when you release the mouse button   nothing happens.  This occurs on numerous other sites.   </pre>
