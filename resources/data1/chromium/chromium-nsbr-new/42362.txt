<title>Issue 42362 -   chromium -    JavaScriptCore symbols are getting dllexport'd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Due to <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/57917">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/57917</a> we are now marking a bunch of   AtomicString symbols as dllexport.  This causes a bunch of LNK4049 warnings   and can defeat compiler optimizations.  We need to make sure that our   config.h doesn't export symbols declared with JS_EXPORTDATA </pre>
