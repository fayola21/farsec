<title>Issue 42541 -   chromium -    I Can't find the title of the websites I'm on! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have like 20 tabs open. I usually have this many open  just because i have   lots of things running  ie: 2 emails  ebay  facebook  twitter  ping.fm    myspace  youtube  forum posts  etc...     I can't see any of the titles of the websites. Is my chrome buggy? I try to   scroll through the different forum tabs that I have opened  and have no idea   which freakin tab to close... How am I supposed to tell without the title   bar?    My Chrome is hardly usable without being able to see the title of the   website. Where is the option to just see the title of the website? Please   HELP!!! </pre>
