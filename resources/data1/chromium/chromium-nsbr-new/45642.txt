<title>Issue 45642 -   chromium -    Favicons take two attempts to load in &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Favicons show up when first selected in Bookmarks Pane  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Favicons show up in Other Bookmarks when first selected      1. Open Chrome with fresh startup  2. Go to Other bookmarks and mouse over sub-menu  3. Favicons don't show up  4. Move away from this sub-menu by scrolling up or down through Other Bookmarks  5. Go back to initial sub-menu  6. Favicons have now loaded    Now for that session  favicons will show up for that sub-menu. If  however  you then quit   Chrome and re-start it  you'll have to go through these steps again to get the Favicons to show   up.        Favicons show up first time when browsing though Other Bookmark menus.        On first mouse-over of a sub-menu in Other Bookmarks  favicons don't show up. Scroll though   Other Bookmarks then come back to that sub-menu and favicons have now loaded. Favicons   should load straight-away without the need to scroll away  then back to menu.    I have noticed this behaviour now on two separate Macs running Chrome  so I don't know if this   problem is widespread. Favicons show up fine in Bookmarks main menu. The problem is confined   to Other Bookmarks. </pre>
