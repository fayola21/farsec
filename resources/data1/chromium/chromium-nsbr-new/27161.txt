<title>Issue 27161 -   chromium -    add a more visible (non-promotional) way to access chrome://extensions and gallery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a product review:  The menu alone is too obscure of a way for users to get to extensions.  While   we have plans for new-tab promotions (peel-back  tips service)  those aren't   access points either.    The current suggestion was some additional button or UI surface in the NTP    although Brian expressed concerns about this approach.   </pre>
