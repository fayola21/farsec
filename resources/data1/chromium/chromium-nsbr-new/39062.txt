<title>Issue 39062 -   chromium -    websocket/tests/long-invalid-header.html failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test began failing on the canaries as soon as it was added (   <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/56380">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/56380</a> ).    There are two diffs between our results and the upstream expected results.    1. We log a &quot;WebSocket is open&quot; that other ports don't.  This may be a bug on   their end.  2. We don't log a console message for the bad header.  I assume we should    but I don't understand the test well enough to be sure.    I don't know enough about websockets to be sure whether these are actual   issues or not  so I'm going to add to test_expectations for now. </pre>
