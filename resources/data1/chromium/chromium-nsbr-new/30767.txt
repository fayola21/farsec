<title>Issue 30767 -   chromium -    Provide an option to disable missing image placeholder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium shows an icon for images that does not exist. But its visually   distracting. Both Internet Explorer &amp; Firefox provides an option to disable   this placeholder.    It would be nice if Chromium provided an option for this too.   </pre>
