<title>Issue 36470 -   chromium -    Windows Vista Crash with Multiple Tabs open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open some tabs with HTML  PDF (with Foxit Reader as my PDF reader) and   Youtube ;  2. At some point  when I was reading the PDF  the computer just froze.  3. I waited about 2 minutes and after I rebooted my computer with the reset   button  my keyboard wasn't answering.      I expect to be able to read my PDF on my tab with a Youtube video running   at the same time.      My computer froze.    <b>Please provide
