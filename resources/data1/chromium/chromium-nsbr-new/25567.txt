Click on the logo to return to index.php. You are still connected.  6. Repeat this operation 2-3 times (clic)  7. You are disconnected (WTF?)      You should stay logged in!  On any others web browsers there is no problem. Why Chrome is doing that??  Is this only on the linux version?    NB: chrome or chromium do the same thing.
