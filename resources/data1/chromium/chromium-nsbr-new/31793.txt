<title>Issue 31793 -   chromium -    ExtensionS gallery: Update not push to users  when the developer didn't click on publish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Add new extension and upload a zip file.  2. Make changes to the extension and upload it again.  3. After you upload leave the extension gallery (without click on publish)  4. Go to chrome://extensions/  click &quot;Update extensions now&quot;    5. BUG: You don't get the new version of the extension  because the developer   didn't click on publish after upload the new version!    6. Go back to the developer dashboard  click &quot;publish&quot; on the extension.  7. Now go to  chrome://extensions/  click &quot;Update extensions now&quot;.  8. Just now you get the new version.      I except to get the new version after step 4 </pre>
