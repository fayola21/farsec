<title>Issue 35817 -   chromium -    Selection and the selection buffer need a tighter binding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Select text in a web page  2. Switch tabs  3. Select text on some other web page  4. Switch back to the first tab      The original selection should be gone  since the second tab has its   selection in the selection buffer now.
