Open another tab and navigate to a website.  3. Try to close the pinned tab.      The pinned tab should close.      The pinned tab fades and Chrome switches to the next tab. Then  if you   click on the pinned tab again  the page is reloaded. Also  if you try to   close the tab while it is &quot;faded&quot; it works. Also if the pinned tab is   &quot;faded&quot; and you close the normal tab with no other tabs open  Chrome   closes.    <b>Please provide
