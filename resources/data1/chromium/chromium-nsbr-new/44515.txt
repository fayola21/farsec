<title>Issue 44515 -   chromium -    Websites in Chrome no longer change language depending on system setting. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : brizzly.com  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Website is displayed in language selected in preferences  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A - Language is dependant on Firefox locale  not system   preference.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not able to test      1. Set main system language in OS X to Japanese.  2. Visit brizzly.com or other locale-aware site like youtube.com      The website should be displayed in the primary language selected in system preferences.      Website is displayed in English.    If I remember correctly this worked in Chrome up until recently. It still works in Safari where the   website automatically changes to the primary language  but in Chrome it just displays it in   English  and unlike the Windows version there is no way to change the language settings in   Chrome on the Mac other than through system preferences. </pre>
