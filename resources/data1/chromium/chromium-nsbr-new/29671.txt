<title>Issue 29671 -   chromium -    Sync Bookmarks: Allow option to only import bookmarks for public PCs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using a public PC  it tend to have bookmarks of its own (My college PCs   do). So there should be an option to allow to sync the bookmarks but only   import (not export. I don't want those bookmarks).     Also  an option to delete the bookmarks in the public PC (don't need them). </pre>
