<title>Issue 40804 -   chromium -    inspector tabs are initially drawn in the undocked style even for docked inspectors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.0    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. make sure inspector is in docked mode.  2. right click  inspect an element. the tabs (elements  resources  scripts) appear to be drawn as if   the inspector was opened in the undocked mode. that is to say that the icons are larger and   appear above the label. after loading  the tabs are then redrawn in the docked style. (smaller   icons to the left of labels). this effect is jarring.        the tabs should be drawn for docked mode.      they don't. i shed a small ironic tear. then i move on with my life.   </pre>
