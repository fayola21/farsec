<title>Issue 44984 -   chromium -    Disable navigator.registerProtocolHandler until Chromium implementation is complete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://peter.sh/files/html5-">http://peter.sh/files/html5-</a>  registerprotocolhandler.html  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Invoke either navigator.registerProtocolHandler or   navigator.registerContentHandler      A confirmation dialog asking whether the handler may be registered (<a title="Implement navigator.registerProtocolHandler() and registerContentHandler()"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11359">bug   11359</a>)  after which the browser will handle it appropriately.      Nothing. Given arguments are being parsed and validated  proper exceptions   are being thrown when required  however  nothing happens.    I believe the two functions should be disabled  possibly via a compile-time   flag  as this is killing feature-detection on webpages. </pre>
