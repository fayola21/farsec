<title>Issue 23317 -   chromium -    setup.exe   has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)        Unknown.  This has only happened twice; I conjecture it may be an out-of-  memory error  but do not know.  Following mal's suggestion  I've saved the   setup.exe and patch files in ~ehg/chromeupdate.zip.  My Vista laptop pops   up a dialog from Visual C++ Runtime Library:    Runtime Error  Program:  c:usersehgappdatalocaltempcr_109D.tmpsetup.exe    This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual   way.  Please contact the application's support team for more information. </pre>
