<title>Issue 38046 -   chromium -    GetWindowTextA security bug(Get window title) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This vulnerability is available in any web browser.    I possible to use the GetWindowText function to get the current window title   for example the title of the window at gmail starts with &quot;Gmail:&quot;  this can  be exploited using a keylogger.    Note that keyloggers need the title of the window first to start logging.    Well  there is no keylogger blocker in any browser!!!    Note keylogger in one of more dangerous ways of getting user credentials.    Sorry for my english.    Good work.    Faizal Cab��_��_ </pre>
