<title>Issue 26147 -   chromium -    add explicit animation API to browser actions and page actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's possible to manually animate browser action and page action APIs from a   background page with setTimeout  etc.  However  if the browser's IO thread is   busy  the messages will be delivered at an erratic rate leading to jumpy   animation.  We should add an API to be more explicit about animating a   sequence of images so that the browser can manage a smooth frame rate.   </pre>
