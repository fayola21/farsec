<title>Issue 29833 -   chromium -    Default chrome fonts are too large - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  OS + version : Fedora 10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : metacity  URLs (if applicable) : washingtonpost.com (and others)    Default fonts in chrome are too large.  See attached screenshot  (chrome-shot1) showing firefox and chrome.  This is with the default  settings of chrome.  Note the following:    1. Text along navigation bar on top (news  politics  opinions  etc.) leaks  out of the boxes in chrome (&quot;Arts &amp; Living&quot; and &quot;Going Out Guide&quot;)  2. Search line &quot;Web: Results by&quot; does not fit on one line in chrome.  3. Headline &quot;Senate tentatively agrees to remove public option&quot; stretches  to fill 3 lines with chrome instead of the intended 2.  4. etc.    I now wish to change the default font settings for chrome to fix the issue.   I take the following steps:    1. Open &quot;Under the Hood&quot; -&gt; &quot;Fonts and Languages&quot;  2. I see Times New Roman 16 as the Serif font and Arial 16 as the  Sans-Serif font.  3. I click the serif font.  4. Dialog &quot;Pick a Font&quot; pops up.  However  &quot;Times New Roman&quot; is _not_  selected and does _not_ appear in the list of families.  Font &quot;Sans&quot; 12 is  selected from the list.  5. I change this to Serif 12  as I do not wants &quot;Sans&quot; as my serif Font.  5. I click &quot;OK&quot;.  6. Dialog &quot;Fonts and Languages&quot; now shows Serif 12 as the Serif font and  Arial 12 as the sans-serif font.  7. Result: rendering is even worse now.  See screenshot chrome-shot2.png.    Note the following for chrome-shot2.png:    1. _All_ text in chrome is now rendered in serif font  despite the  preferences encoded in CSS.  2. Although some text has gotten smaller  other text such as the navigation  bar (&quot;News&quot;  &quot;Politics&quot;  &quot;Opinions&quot;  etc.) remains too large and leaks out  of its space. </pre>
