CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: Metacity (GNOME)      1. On Chrome  open the Google Chrome Options.  2. Titles and options  are not in order.      Windows and Mac have the titles to the left  and the config options to the   right  but on Linux are not in order: titles  text boxes  check boxes  all   on one space.    In &quot;Basics&quot;  &quot;Personal Stuff&quot; and &quot;Under the Hood&quot; is the same  the titles   and the options are not in order compare to Windows and Mac.      I Attach a screenshot of Linux (Ubuntu 9.10 with GNOME)  Windows  and Mac   to compare.  (Sorry for the Spanish languaje of the screenshot on Linux)   </pre>
