<title>Issue 37045 -   chromium -    Icons not displaying correctly on application shortcuts &amp; bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an application shortcut of gmail or a gmail shortcut in bookmark   bar  2. After close and reopen  you'll notice the icon is just a blank white   page icon  low quality.         Before a recent update it would correctly save a high quality icon. Gmail   for example would have the red envelope as the icon  same that is in the   start menu when this shortcut is saved. However  now the shortcuts and some   book marks don't save correctly. This applies to multiple different   bookmarks and &quot;save as application&quot; shortcuts when they open.       Default white bookmark icon rather than correct bookmark icon that used to   be there.     <b>Please provide
