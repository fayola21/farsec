<title>Issue 25858 -   chromium -    rebaseline tool should work with git - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For text dump results we don't need to check in different results for all   platforms.  Specifically  linux will first try chromium-win  and if the   results match  it never looks in chromium-linux.  So we only need to create   the -expected.txt file for win and mac in this case.    This logic used to be supported in run_webkit_tests.sh --new-baseline  but   doesn't seem to be in rebaseline.sh.    Also  it would be nice to check with the upstream results to see if we can   remove a baseline.  I think this is what happened:  1) rebaseline a test for chromium-mac  2) test changes upstream  3) our chromium-mac results match the upstream results  but the rebaseline   tool goes ahead and checks in new results into our tree   </pre>
