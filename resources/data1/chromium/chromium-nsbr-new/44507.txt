<title>Issue 44507 -   chromium -    Chat window won't close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I'm not sure - this has happened to me twice (where a chat window I had open refused to close   when I tried to close it in mail).  It has never happened to me in Safari or Firefox.  The time I was   using Chrome OS I was talking to caitlink; the time I was using Chrome I was talking to   papakipos.                  <b>Please provide
