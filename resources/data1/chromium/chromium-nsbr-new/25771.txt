<title>Issue 25771 -   chromium -    Quotes should be smart and curly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of our strings have straight quotes in them.  These are ugly to me.    Mac UI strings are supposed to use curly quotes.    Here's an example of a dialog that we have that uses quotes:    <a href="http://andybons.com/chrome/new_extension_install.png">http://andybons.com/chrome/new_extension_install.png</a>    The options are to fix our strings up where we define them  which is nice   but it might not be right for all platforms.  (Can we use curly quotes on   Windows and GTK?  Should we?)  The other option is to fix up the strings   when we load them  which is a per-platform job.  We already map ... (three   periods) to ��_��__ (ellipsis) on the Mac.    How do we want to do this?  Do we want to change all of the straight   quotes to curlies in the strings files (after they're unfrozen) and make   things prettier on all platforms  or do we want to try to do this   programmatically? </pre>
