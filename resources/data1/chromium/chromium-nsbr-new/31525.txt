<title>Issue 31525 -   chromium -    Extension API feature request: Per-window key and mouse event actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Any extension that wants to implement mouse gestures or alternate   keymappings (for example  vimium) are limited to the fact that the only   place one can capture keyboard and mouse events is in a content script  and   these are limited to only function in http:// and https:// pages -&gt; Never   chrome:// or view-source:  This makes it impossible to implement a new   keystroke that will navigate through the open tabs.  As soon as you enter   any sort of non-content-scriptable tab  the mapping disappears.    My suggestion is to create some new events in the chrome.window.* API that   would allow extensions to receive keyboard and mouse events  or perhaps just   a single new function chrome.window.addEventListener() which basically   functions identically to document.addEventListener() </pre>
