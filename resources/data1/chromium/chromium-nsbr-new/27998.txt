<title>Issue 27998 -   chromium -    Sync Setup Wizard size is wrong on OS X and high-DPI Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set the DPI in windows to high from the control panel (144 DPI)  2. Start Chrome  and then trigger the sync setup wizard        The dialog size is bigger than it should be  leading to unsightly blank space.    This problem is hacked around in OS X  but the dialog size isn't completely   correct there  either. </pre>
