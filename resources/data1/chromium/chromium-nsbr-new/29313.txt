<title>Issue 29313 -   chromium -    Avoid deprecated char*-to-AtomicString conversion in WebKit glue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Over in WebKit  I'm working on a patch that removes the implicit conversion from char* to   WebCore::AtomicString (because the conversion is expensive  but it looks very innocent to just type   in a string literal.)    There is one usage of this implicit conversion in the Chromium repo  in webkit_glue.cc. It's trivial to   fix since there is an existing AtomicString constant that can be used instead. I need to get this   patch into Chromium before I can land my WebKit patch  otherwise it'll break the build. </pre>
