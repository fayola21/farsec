<title>Issue 35388 -   chromium -    Combining unicode characters displayed incorrectly. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Combining unicode characters are displayed incorrectly when used with some   other unicode characters. For instance  the combining overline character   (0x0305) displays correctly when used in combination with a latin-1 X   (0x0058)  but not when used in combination with a greek Chi (0x03A7): in   the later case  the overline is offset to the right. This happens with   various combining chars and greek characters  not just these two. I've not   investigated exactly which character combinations are affected  but suspect   there are many more.    This also affects all other browsers I tested (MSIE 8.0  FF3.6  Opera   10.10  Safari 4.0) which hints that this is not a bug in Chromium  but a   bug or feature of unicode and/or the OS (Windows Vista x64 sp2 en-us).     Sample HTML file:  &lt;BODY&gt;X&amp;#x0305; &amp;Chi;&amp;#x0305;&lt;/BODY&gt;  Expected output: two characters  both with an overline exactly above them.  Actual output: two characters  both with an overline  the left one having   the overline exactly above it  right one having the overline offset to the   right.    Can somebody with expertise in this area let me know that there is nothing   we are doing wrong and that the OS is responsible? I will file a bug with   MS as soon as I get confirmation that the OS is responsible. If you have a   Mac or Linux build  please let me know if you experience the same issue or   not.   </pre>
