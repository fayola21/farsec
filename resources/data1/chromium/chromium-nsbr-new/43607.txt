<title>Issue 43607 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Quickly maximizing a newly opened window when navigating from the new tab page does not resize the content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 Dev  5.0.396.0 Dev  (Since a month or so ago)      1. Ctrl+N.  2. Start typing something and press Enter.  3. Maximize.  Note - all of this should be done pretty quickly. The other page should not   load before the window is maximized.      The content should match the size of the window.      The content stays within the same bounds as the formerly not maximized   window. </pre>
