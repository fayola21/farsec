<title>Issue 25187 -   chromium -    Chrome needs warning that tabs are being closed when Chrome is being closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox(and apparently IE) has a warning when the user clicks the &quot;x&quot; to   close the program that multiple tabs are being closed. A similar feature   would be good on Chrome.    Chrome has the opportunity not just to catch-up  but to get it right. The   default on Firefox is to save the tabs and quit. Having the warning is   enough. The default should be what most people do  which is to just quit. The   extra keystroke should only be used when the user also wants to save. </pre>
