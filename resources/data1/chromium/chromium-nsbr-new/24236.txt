<title>Issue 24236 -   chromium -    The JavaScript function &quot;getElementsByTagName&quot; doesn't return elements in order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using      var elms = document.getElementsByTagName('input');    which  in Firefox  returns the elements in the order as in the HTML source.  In Chrome 4.0.221.6 on Windows Vista on the other hand I'm getting a couple  of input=&quot;checkbox&quot; elements before the input=&quot;text&quot; elements  even though  the text elements precede the checkboxes in the HTML source. (I'm using  some positioning via CSS  too.)    (Not 100% sure what the DOM guidelines demand here  but Firefox's handling  seems more intuitive. As I have an auto-form handling script passing  parameters in order  Chrome's handling breaks the app...) </pre>
