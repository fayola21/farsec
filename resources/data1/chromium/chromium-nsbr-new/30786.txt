<title>Issue 30786 -   chromium -    Can't delete cookies with JavaScript and chromeframe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  WebKit: 532.6  V8: 2.0.31  IE8 Vista    Related URL(s): <a href="http://telparia.com/chromeframeDeleteCookieTest/">http://telparia.com/chromeframeDeleteCookieTest/</a>      1. Set a cookie server side with PHP or JSP  2. Delete the cookie with JavaScript  3. Read the cookie with JavaScript      You should get 'null' since the cookie has been deleted.      You see the value of the cookie.      If a cookie is set server side  you cannot delete the cookie with  JavaScript when running chromeframe.    Works in every other browser  including chrome and IE.    <a href="http://telparia.com/chromeframeDeleteCookieTest/">http://telparia.com/chromeframeDeleteCookieTest/</a>    I've attached a sample index.php file and a index.jsp file  either one can  be used to reproduce the test along with the URL mentioned above. </pre>
