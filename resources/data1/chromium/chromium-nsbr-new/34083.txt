<title>Issue 34083 -   chromium -    Create a status notifier on buildbot to push data to app engine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In an effort to remove the load on the buildbot status page  we will be   sending all the status to app engine  and the users will be consuming those   instead of connecting directly to the buildbot.    The first step is to create this buildbot master-side script to push the data   to app engine.   </pre>
