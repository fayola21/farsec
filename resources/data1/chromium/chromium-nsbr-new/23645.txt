<title>Issue 23645 -   chromium -    Starting a specific .app bundle with an incompatible --type should bail out - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've got the main browser .app bundle and a helper .app bundle.  In the   future  we may split the helper up further  at least to break out the plug-in   process into its own bundle.    Right now  it's still possible to start any of these bundles with a --type other   than what it expects  which can lead to problems.  For example  if you launch   the helper .app bundle without any flags  it'll start up a bizarro browser.    In each specific .app  we should check that the --type is compatible and bail   out if it's not. </pre>
