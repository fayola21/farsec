<title>Issue 25021 -   chromium -    profile_sync_service_unittest broken on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Due to a mistake in chrome.gyp  profile_sync_service_unittest.cc has been   excluded from the build for what seems like a week or two  at least.  As a   result  it hasn't been run: it builds  but it crashes.    The first crashes have to do with null RequestContext pointers.    We need to have these tests pass before beta. </pre>
