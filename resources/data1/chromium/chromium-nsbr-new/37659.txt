<title>Issue 37659 -   chromium -    The function of sorting extension icons by dragging is NOT available on &quot;5.0.342.2 dev&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 dev      1. Use the mouse to drag the icon of extensions in order to sort them by   user-self.        The sequence should be changed by drag operation.      Now the icon can't be dragged. Pls check attachment.    Note: this issue happens on the latest version.        The previous dev version works well on this function.    Thanks    </pre>
