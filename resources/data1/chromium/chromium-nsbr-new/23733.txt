<title>Issue 23733 -   chromium -    Cannot close a window on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Official Build 27713)  OS + version : hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : Gnome          Often  a last tab in a window is uncloseable. Ctrl+F4  Alt+F4  clicking &quot;x&quot;   don't close it. Full exit from Chrome (wrench-&gt;Exit) leaves such windows   unclosed. Only kill closes them.    The renderer closes apparently (therefore blue background  not white).    This is Linux specific.    This issue was around for a few weeks now.    see a screenshot. </pre>
