<title>Issue 36309 -   chromium -    Page action preview bubble doesn't close on esc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Adding a cancel: action like in bookmark_bubble_controller probably fixes   this.    Maybe I'll fix this accidentally over the next 3 days. Filing this bug so that we   don't forget about it if I don't get around to it. </pre>
