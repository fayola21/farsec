Open content settings add exception blocking images/ javascript add specifically    &quot; www.bing.com &quot;  2. open bing.com   observer images and scripts are blocked.  3. Click on the omnibox -image blocking icon and on the bubble click select   allow images for   bing.con and click done.  4. refresh the page.     What is the expected output?  Images should be allowed   as use has selected in the bubble and refresh the page.  The preference should be update with the new rule in exceptions.     What do you see instead?  Images are still blocked and in exceptions list 2 rules are added one for allow and one for block   for bing com.        </pre>
