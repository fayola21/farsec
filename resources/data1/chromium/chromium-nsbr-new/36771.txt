<title>Issue 36771 -   chromium -    dragging bookmark causes crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  2. Go to a webpage and bookmark it (does not matter what page  just make   sure you have at least one bookmark so it shows up on the Chrome homepage   in the blue bar at the top of the home page)  3. Left click the bookmark  hold it and drag it.  It should crash Crhome.      I have no idea what the expected result is.  I just figured I would drag it   and see what would happen - and it crashed.      Chrome crashes.    <b>Please provide
