<title>Issue 27262 -   chromium -    The setup project doesn't always correctly regenerate registered_dlls.h. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Got a report from pkasting about a build failure due to building npchrome_tab   and not rebuilding setup. *Re*building setup shouldn't be necessary as the   scan script should run on every build and just do nothing if the file   contents should not be changed. Looks like that isn't happening. </pre>
