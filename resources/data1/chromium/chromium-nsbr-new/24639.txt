<title>Issue 24639 -   chromium -    The Demise of the Toolstrip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apparently it has been decided to rid Chrome of the toolstrip bar (as stated   on <a title="Toolstrip background repeating x and y." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23028"> Issue 23028 </a> and <a title="Create a context menu for toolstrips" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22382"> Issue 22382 </a>).    I would like to contest this.    Toolstrips serve a much greater purpose than just buttons with context menus   and notification badges.    Take the Time extension (<a href="http://bit.ly/5nZFm">http://bit.ly/5nZFm</a>) as a very simple example.  Will there be any way to replicate this kind of functionality with   <a title="Proposal for Implementation of Browser Actions" href="/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">BrowserActions</a>?  And how about the dynamic-ism and versatility of toolstrips?    I think completely removing the toolstrip functionality will bring a great   loss to the extension system. </pre>
