<title>Issue 25871 -   chromium -    Maybe it should be possible to conditionally show browser action popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now extension developers need to decide whether their browser action   will show a popup at package time.    Some developers would like to decide at runtime whether to show the popup.   For example  if the user is logged out  clicking the browser action might   open a login tab. Otherwise  it opens a popup.    At the same time  we don't want to allow developer to show the popup   whenever they want.    So perhaps the chrome.browserAction.onClicked() function should allow the   developer to return a value indicating whether the popup should be shown?   This would require a round-trip through the extension  but we are already   taking quite awhile to render popups  so maybe this increase is not a   problem. </pre>
