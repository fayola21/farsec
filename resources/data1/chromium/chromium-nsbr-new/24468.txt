<title>Issue 24468 -   chromium -    Tune V8 instance in ProxyResolver to use as little memory as possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to a conversation I just had with Jim and Mike  the V8 instance in   the proxy resolver can eat a lot of memory (~30 MB  they said).  We should   tune this instance to have as little footprint as possible (Mike said it   could get down to 1 MB?)  even at the cost of some perf  since the perf hit   here is not really going to be noticeable.   </pre>
