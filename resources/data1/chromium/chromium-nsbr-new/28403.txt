<title>Issue 28403 -   chromium -    Find bar doesn't work properly after switching tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4  OS                   : Windows XP Pro SP3      1. Hit Ctrl+f  2. Type a few letters  3. Switch tabs  4. Come back to original tab  5. Click inside Find bar      Find bar should still work properly.      When you click the Find bar after returning from a different tab  you can   no longer edit the text in it  and sometimes it becomes transparent where   you click. Keep clicking on it for some strange results (sometimes a grey   bar).    Note: I couldn't reproduce this on the NTP.    Btw  sorry for the whitespace in the attached photos. WinXP's Paint program   doesn't crop... </pre>
