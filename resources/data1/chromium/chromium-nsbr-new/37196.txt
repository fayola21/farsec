<title>Issue 37196 -   chromium -    Disable support for Geolocation in extension background pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The geolocation privacy design is founded on the page UI being available for   infobar prompt &amp; location bar icon (for review/revoke UI)  Background pages have neither of these  so for the initial geolocaiton impl.   we should disable usage from extensions.  In future one option might be to add a manifest permission to selectively   enable it in extensions. </pre>
