<title>Issue 36544 -   chromium -    Chromium's cache ignores Vary and headers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a website that  depending on the X-Requested-With header  serves   either the full webpage or just a tiny snippet (when requested from AJAX). As   the same URI is used each time  Chromium will use whatever value it cached   first returning either the snippet or the full version  no matter what the   current headers are.    Headers generated by the server:    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8  Date: Tue  23 Feb 2010 12:59:30 GMT  Server: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.6.4  Vary: Cookie  X-Requested-With </pre>
