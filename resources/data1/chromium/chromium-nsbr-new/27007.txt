<title>Issue 27007 -   chromium -    XHR from content scrips stopped working between 4.0.223.11 and 4.0.237.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0             Safari 4: n/a    Firefox 3.x: OK          Opera: OK           IE 7: n/a           IE 8: n/a      I have a Greasemonkey user script that i am porting onto Chrome  making it  a content script extension. The script uses XHR to fetch additional pages  (from the domain it matched  so should be allowed to).  At some point I updated to 237.0 and it stopped working. I see &quot;XHR  finished loading &lt;my url&gt;&quot; in the log but callback never gets delivered. It  worked on the previous dev channel release (223.11)  it doesn't work on the  current one. This same code continues to work in Firefox and Opera.    If it's not immediately apparent what's wrong  i can spend some time and  try to create a minimal extension that reproduces the problem. let me know  if this is required. </pre>
