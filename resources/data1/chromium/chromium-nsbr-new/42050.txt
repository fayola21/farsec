<title>Issue 42050 -   chromium -    web socket tests hosed on the webkit linux perf canary - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/waterfall?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/waterfall?</a>  builder=Linux%20Perf%20(webkit.org)    A pair of web socket tests have been consistently failing for a while.  The   same tests do not fail on the main waterfall so it looks like a bot issue.    I believe nsylvain is looking into this  filing this bug to track the issue. </pre>
