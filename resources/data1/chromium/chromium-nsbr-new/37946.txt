<title>Issue 37946 -   chromium -    no anti-censorship support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are alot of countries that have internet censorship where the   government blocks legal websites like political sites and youtube and   wikipedia. Once these websites are blocked the government can track the ip   address of the user who visited it. This is a security issue.    Chromium should help people in these countries out by integrating   something like TOR(onion routing) software into the browser. It could be   disabled by default but users can enable it if they want to. Because some   people may accidently enable this which would be a security risk if they   do internet banking because TOR is not 100% secure  whenever a user closes   the Chrome browser TOR should be automatically disabled so next time a   user loads the Chrome browser they will have to enable it again. There   should be no &quot;always enable TOR&quot; button.    All of this should be done in secret so governments cannot block the   Chrome browser:    1)Release Chrome browser with TOR integrated but don't announce TOR is in   it.    2)After 30 days of Chrome browser being installed on a user's PC  the TOR   feature will be visible in the Chrome browser's settings. </pre>
