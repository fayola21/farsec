<title>Issue 24631 -   chromium -    Omnibox needs to properly receive drag-and-drops - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a tab and load a url into it (cnn.com  for example)  - drag a url from another app (mail  colloquy  etc) and drop it into the   omnibox     expected:  - url replaces existing contents    actual:  - url is appended on end of contents  leaving an invalid url.    I think it should probably load the url as well  but we can debate that. </pre>
