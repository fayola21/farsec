<title>Issue 44951 -   chromium -    Context menu shouldn't appear on right click in upper left corner - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right click on the upper left corner where Windows would normally have a   hotspot icon for the application's context menu.    What is the expected output?    That hotspot is disabled  since we are painting over it.    What do you see instead?    That hotspot is enabled and the context menu appears. </pre>
