<title>Issue 24015 -   chromium -    'Recently closed' section should not depend on how the window is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.221.6 (Official Build 28091)    -Have a window with a single tab.  -Ctl+W/middle click on the tabstrip to close the tab (obviously to close  the window)  -Go to NNTP and click on the link in  'Recently closed' section to undo the  tab close/Window.    Result:  The tab is opened in the same window instead of in a new window.    PS:  If step2 is performed with Alt+F4  then I will get expected behavior.    Erik/Glen feel free to close this  if this is intended to work  but it  looks like a odd behavior for me.   </pre>
