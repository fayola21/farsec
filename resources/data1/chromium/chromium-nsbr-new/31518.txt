<title>Issue 31518 -   chromium -    Crash when dragging tab out quickly to the left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open a new window with two tabs in it.  Drag the leftmost tab out to the left.  You will see the   overlay flicker and then disappear.  If you release the mouse quickly enough (perhaps before the   overlay window disappears)  you will sometimes see a crash:    [46353:2067:2080150088044376:FATAL:/Volumes/Code/Leopard/emma/src/chrome/browser/co  coa/tab_strip_controller.mm(1317)] Check failed: [[notification object] isKindOfClass:[TabView   class]].       This is a bit harder to reproduce in the debugger  which makes me think it's a race condition. </pre>
