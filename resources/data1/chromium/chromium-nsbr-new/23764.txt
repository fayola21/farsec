<title>Issue 23764 -   chromium -    Tab-to-search flakily broken on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From an email:    Today  on Linux 4.0.213.1  [tab-to-search] doesn't work any more. If I press   &lt;tab&gt; after &quot;wiki&quot;  I tab onto the first thumbnail (?!?!?). I need to write   full &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; for it to work  or select it in the drop down. The   behavior is different between work and home. Even worse  the 911tabs.com   search doesn't appear in the drop down until I spell it entirely  so I can't   even select it. </pre>
