<title>Issue 36775 -   chromium -    Option-clicking a link should bypass &quot;Save As&quot; dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.335.0 dev  OS version: OS X 10.6.2      Option-clicking a link downloads the resource without opening up a save-as dialog      Firefox also downloads an option-clicked link without a save-as dialog.      1. Click on a link with the option key activated.      On other OS X browsers  pressing option when clicking a link forces download of the resource   with no confirmation  enabling the user to quickly download lists of resources.      On Google Chrome  option-clicking a link brings up a &quot;Save as&quot; dialog  which is extremely slow    and also duplicates the function of the &quot;Save Link As...&quot; contextual menu item.   </pre>
