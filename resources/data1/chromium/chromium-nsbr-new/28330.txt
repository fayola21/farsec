<title>Issue 28330 -   chromium -    Add variable support to CSS files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we have a lot of repeating values in our CSS files. This is getting   hard to maintain.    At one point WebKit added support for CSS variables but it was turned off   because the web standard people did not like it.    We could maybe turn on CSS variables for DOM UI but that seems hard and   might break one day.    Another option is to implement a simple preprocesser pass for DOM UI files   or just CSS files. We could do this at runtime or we could do something at   compile time with Grit. </pre>
