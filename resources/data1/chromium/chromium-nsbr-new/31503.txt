<title>Issue 31503 -   chromium -    Timeout on loading webpages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/">http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/</a>         Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: -           IE 8: -          Opera: OK      1. Start Chrome  2. Open &quot;<a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/">http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/</a>&quot;  3. Wait until &quot;This webpage is not available.&quot; error occurs.      The website should be loaded immediately.      A timeout error occurs (This webpage is not available)    The above website works  i.e. it's loaded immediately with other browsers   like Opera and Firefox. After some tries (e.g. 5 or so) the website loads   as expected. Some minutes later it cannot be loaded again (timeout error).   I also do have this problem with other websites  e.g. on my e-banking   website. I don't think this issue is connection-related since the failing   websites work with other browsers.  If there are any logs you need please let me know.  I can even record a screen movie if needed. </pre>
