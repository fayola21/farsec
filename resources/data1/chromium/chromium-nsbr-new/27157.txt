<title>Issue 27157 -   chromium -    no international characters in tab titles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 4.0.237.0 (win xp)    <a href="http://www.aozora.gr.jp/">http://www.aozora.gr.jp/</a>    I would attach a screen shot but my keyboard lacks the necessary keys.    The tab title contains a bunch of boxes but there are many kana and kanji   displayed correctly in the page.   </pre>
