<title>Issue 25865 -   chromium -    Cannot check locale from within the utility process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Whenever I try to install an extension  the renderer NOTREACHes (sad tab). I   tracked it down to the fact that we now check the locale when validating the   extension.     The functions under the hood do a GetFileAttributes on the local DLL (en-  US.dll)  which we don't have access to from within the sandbox (utility   process). Therefore we get ACCESS_DENIED and Chrome thinks no locale is   installed and NOTREACHes() on l10n_util:482.     </pre>
