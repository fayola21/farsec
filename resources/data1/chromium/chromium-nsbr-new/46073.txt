<title>Issue 46073 -   chromium -    Authentication info used between Incognito windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0 dev    Have a local website use HTTP authentication available (I used both Basic and Integrated Security on Windows XP IIS webserver).      1. Make sure Chrome always prompt for username/password (in IE  select Tools-&gt;Internet Options; Security TAB; Local intranet zone; Custom settings; check User Authentication  Login  Prompt for username and password [at the very bottom])  2. Open an incognito window  and surf to the local website with HTTP authentication;  3. Enter the username and password  4. The page should be available  5. Open a new Incognito window (either from the &quot;normal&quot; window  or from the already opened incognito window)  6. Surf to the same local website with HTTP authentication;      Chrome should open an username/password dialog.      Chrome reuses the authentication information.     Incognito window doesn't share cookies  and I would expect also no WWW-Authenticate headers. </pre>
