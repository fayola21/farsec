<title>Issue 39986 -   chromium -    EULA outer frame should pick up language from newer system keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Set the system localeName to a specific language in these registry   keys:     HKEY_USERS.DEFAULTControl PanelInternationalLocaleName   HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl PanelInternationalLocaleName    to &quot;de&quot;    2.  Install Chrome via a standalone installer with the &quot;eula_required&quot;   installerdata parameter set to &quot;true&quot;.  3.  Run Chrome.  EULA appears but outer frame is in English but inner frame   is in German.    Both the outer and inner frames should be in German.    Instead of getting the locale via GetThreadLocale()  we may want to pull   this directly with the win32 GetDefaultUserLocaleName() (preferred method   on Vista/Win7) or even defer to Omaha's lang key in some cases. </pre>
