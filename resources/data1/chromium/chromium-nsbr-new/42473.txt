<title>Issue 42473 -   chromium -    Resource viewer does not show XML content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.383    When a web page loads an XML document asynchronously   the resource viewer   does not show the content for such a response.  This also may be happening   for other content types (such as JSON) but I have not tested for those.    Steps to reproduce:    1. Load website that loads XML externally  2. View resources in developer tools  3. Find XML document loaded  4. Click &quot;Content&quot; tab for that document    What happens:  Content tab shows &quot;No content available&quot;    What should happen:  Content tab should show XML content for text/xml or   application/xml  preferably with colored syntax.           </pre>
