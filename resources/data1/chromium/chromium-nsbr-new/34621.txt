<title>Issue 34621 -   chromium -    asserts in test runs don't cause failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Change code to cause an assert to fire.  Run ui_tests.  Note that the tests pass even though the asserts fired.    This may cause bad issues to be missed and is really bad. (afaik  on windows   asserts cause crashes  so this causes test failures.)     </pre>
