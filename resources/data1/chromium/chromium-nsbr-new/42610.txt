<title>Issue 42610 -   chromium -    One of my tabs is inexplicably invisible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.342.9 (Official Build  43360) beta  Is this the most recent version: As far as I know  OS + version: Ubuntu  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit  Window manager: Gnome?  URLs (if relevant): maybe not relevant but  consumerist.com is the tab that  is invisible  Behavior in Linux Firefox: It's not a website issue  it's a browser quirk   so N/A.  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Again  seems N/A.      I opened several websites at once into new tabs  including consumerist.com      All the tabs being visible.      One of them was invisible.  I could grab it  or click into it.  I can get  to it via ctrl+tab.  I could drag the other tabs around it.    After moving from one window to the next  and minimizing that window  I  brought it back up and the tab reappeared. </pre>
