<title>Issue 27669 -   chromium -    SysTreeView of 'Cookies and Website permissions' should get keyboard focus after deleting a cookie. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT (r 31913)    User should be able to delete all the cookies one by one continuously  with  out clicking on the tree view of the Cookies and Website permissions of the  dialog.    Right now  after deleting a cookie  focus is no where and if you click on  'Remove' button again nothing happens. You have to first click on the tree  view and then click on 'Remove button'.    We should behave here we do in Win. </pre>
