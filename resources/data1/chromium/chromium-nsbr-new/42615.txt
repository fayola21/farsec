<title>Issue 42615 -   chromium -    file://xxx/proxy.pac always resolves to DIRECT by googleupdate.exe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome's proxy settings (i.e. Internet Properties-&gt;Connections-&gt;LAN Settings...)  2. Set [x] Use automatic configuration script to file://c:/some/path/proxy.pac  Where proxy.pac might contain something like:  function FindProxyForURL(url  host) { return &quot;PROXY &lt;your_proxy&gt;:&lt;your_proxy_port&gt;&quot;; }  3. Reboot to allow the &quot;Google Update&quot; (GoogleUpdate.exe /c) startup entry to run  or more   easily  select &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; under Chrome's Alt-F menu.  4.

If a script cannot be supported  at least fallback to the settings in &quot;[x] Use a   proxy server for your LAN&quot;. (Which currently gets ignored when it's used together with &quot;Use   automatic configuration script&quot;.)      1-3 instances of googleupdate.exe will repeatedly attempt and fail to make outbound   connections for ten or so minutes.  The Event Log gets filled with a &quot;Google Update&quot; error   entries of one or two every hour.  (Though this is probably from the tasks scheduled for   Google Update.)    <b>Please provide
