Log in to GMail.  2. Type in a text area. (Including a message  receipents  or even the   search field at the top.  3. Press the Windows context menu button. (To those who don't know what I'm   talking about: Windows keyboards ship with two special buttons  &quot;Start&quot; and   &quot;Context Menu&quot;.)        A context window for the text area will open up. (Allowing  for example  to   fix misspellings.)        The context menu for the entire window opens up.   </pre>
