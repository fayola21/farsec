<title>Issue 26521 -   chromium -    Add better error handling to seccomp sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;add better error handling. Right now  if anything goes wrong   during the initial configuration of the sandbox  chances are we just   terminate the process. We need to have some code to safely test whether we   can enable the seccomp sandbox  and if not we need to fall back on running   without it. I suspect  the easiest solution will involve forking a temporary   process and checking whether it can enable the sandbox. This can probably be   done at the start of the zygote.&quot; </pre>
