<title>Issue 44104 -   chromium -    Deadlock when plugin calls NPN_GetValue(instance  NPNVWindowNPObject or NPNVPuginElementNPObject) from NPP_SetWindow function on Windows XP. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064         Firefox 3.x:OK       Plugin��_��_��_s process deadlocks in Chrome on Windows XP when calling   NPN_GetValue(instance  NPNVWindowNPObject or NPNVPuginElementNPObject)   from NPP_SetWindow.    We have not attempted building Chrome from its source  but API trace shows   that WaitForMultipleObjects() in WaitableEvent::WaitMany() never returns.   Attached is a simple plugin and test HTML page.  It is important that   JavaScript on the HTML page calls into the plugin; without that call    crash does not happen. It appears that due to the JavaScript call into the   plugin  plugin process calls NPP_GetValue while waiting for NPN_GetValue   to return in NPP_SetWindow.    Regsvr32 can be used to register the simple plugin  and regsvr32 ��_��_��_u can be   used to unregister the plugin.    Please note that to recreate the problem you may need to reload the test   page about 15-20 times. Deadlock happens more often when using debug   version of the  plugin. Zip file also has plugin crash screen shot. Let me   know if you need anything else.     </pre>
