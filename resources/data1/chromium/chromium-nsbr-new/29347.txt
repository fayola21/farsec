<title>Issue 29347 -   chromium -    Partial download should have a different filetype - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A file being downloaded should not have the final filename/type until it's complete  since it's not a   valid file of its type  and should not be opened by the user or scanned by tools like Spotlight or AV.    For example  a download of foobar.png should not be named &quot;foobar.png&quot; until complete. It should   be &quot;foobar.crdownload&quot; or &quot;foobar.png.crdownload&quot; or something like that.    By using a special filetype bound to Chrome  we can show a custom icon like a broken document    and double-clicking the file can be made to resume an aborted download (when that feature's   implemented).    Safari already does this  using a &quot;.download&quot; filetype. </pre>
