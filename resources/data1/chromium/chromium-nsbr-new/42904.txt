<title>Issue 42904 -   chromium -    Warn when the return value of scoped_ptr&lt;&gt;::release() is ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes  people accidentally .release() a scoped_ptr&lt;&gt; when they mean to .reset() it. .release()   returns the raw pointer and gives the caller ownership. .reset() deletes the owned object and sets   the pointer to NULL. It��_��_��_s rare to .release() and not do something with the return value.    Similar protection may be added to other classes  such as scoped_cftyperef  scoped_nsobject  and   scoped_authorizationref. </pre>
