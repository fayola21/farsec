<title>Issue 41871 -   chromium -    Rewriting url in adressbar to display without &quot;http://&quot; - Bad usability - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev    Since 5.0.375 the content of the adressbar is rewritten to exclude &quot;http:// at the beginning. This   breaks workflows:    - When viewing &quot;view-source:...&quot; you always have to add http:// to the url when changing one   parameter of the url for testing purposes.  - When copying adressbar content for IM-Chat or similar the http:// is missing every time.    So please add at least an option to disable this behaviour to let developers get rid of it. </pre>
