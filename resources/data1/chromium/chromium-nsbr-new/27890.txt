<title>Issue 27890 -   chromium -    Update depot_tools .zip and .tar.gz - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary: Update depot_tools .zip and .tar.gz.    Previous depot_tools .zip and .tar.gz are getting old.  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32100">r32100</a> appears pretty   stable and will soon take changes that could destabilize it.  Snapshot the   depot_tools directory while things are stable. </pre>
