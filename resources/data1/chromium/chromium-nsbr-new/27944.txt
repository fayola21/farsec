<title>Issue 27944 -   chromium -    PostTask from object's constructor is not safe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is because the posted task may execute before the constructor returns    which leads to the object being deleted before a reference to it can be   grabbed.  This leads to memory corruption.    I added DCHECKs and caught 4 instances of this.  The fix should definitely be   merged to 4.0. </pre>
