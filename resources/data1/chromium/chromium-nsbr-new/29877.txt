<title>Issue 29877 -   chromium -    &quot;Show password&quot; button a huge security hole - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a laptop is stolen  there isn't much that can be done about sites with   passwords that are saved.  However  the fact that the user can click the   &quot;Show password&quot; button could give the thief knowledge about what the   passwords are.  They can see if the same password is being used for multiple   sites  tendencies  etc possibly allowing them to guess the user's passwords   on other sites.     </pre>
