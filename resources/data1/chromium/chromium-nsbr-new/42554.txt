<title>Issue 42554 -   chromium -    Crash in Search Engine Experiment - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user is importing data from another browser  but does *not* have an   empty Chrome user data directory (either because the user is changing   &quot;channels&quot; (from  say  dev to stable)  or because of a forced import with the   --first-run flag)  the search engine experiment will crash *if* the total   number of search engines listed in both the import browser and the user's   Chrome profile add up to less than 3.    This will happen if  for example  the user has gone in by hand and removed   all the search engines listed in IE and Chrome (except for the required   defaults)  AND is not installing with a fresh profile.   </pre>
