<title>Issue 36576 -   chromium -    Feature request: being able to load the extension in a &quot;bottom bar&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Some extensions needs a lot of UI space  and currently there's no way to load   an extension in a &quot;bottom bar&quot;.    I know that extensions should use a minimal ammount of UI space  letting the   browser viewport as clean as possible  but for some cases  like Firebug Lite    we simply need lots of space  because there's a lot of information to   visualize.    This issue was already discussed in other threads (&quot;toolstrips&quot;/&quot;moles&quot;):  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/msg/89509aff351da657">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/msg/89509aff351da657</a>  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/msg/3ada893ffc081c08">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/msg/3ada893ffc081c08</a>          Is expected to being able to load the extension in a &quot;bottom bar&quot; like   Firebug for Firefox  or Developer Tools for Chrome.      <b>Please provide
