<title>Issue 42114 -   chromium -    Resolving proxy Chrome slowness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.open Chrome and type &quot;PALM&quot; or &quot;Veco&quot; (or many other single-word search   queries)  2.It literally takes Chrome 20 seconds to do &quot;Resolving proxy&quot; before it   returns the appropriate google search. I can do 5 times better by going to   google com and typing my query there.        do a google search within 1 second  since this is obviously not a URL (no   &quot;.com&quot; or anything)      Chrome eventually does the right thing  but it takes 20 seconds. This seems   very consistent  so it looks like there is a trigger to send the query as a   google search after 20 seconds. This should be 2-3 seconds max  though...   Since Chrome shows &quot;Resolving proxy...&quot; the whole 20 seconds  it seems to be   thinking that what I typed is a url  although these are clearly search   queries.        <b>Please provide
