<title>Issue 29189 -   chromium -    CANT PRINT INVOICES USING THIS BROWSER - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order for any business person to be able to use your browser to print   their invoices *that  by the way includes MILLIONS of us* we need to be   able to removed unsightly headers and footers.  It is impossible to do that with the current version.  I have complained  many others have complained  but I have been told that   it is a higher priority to have lots of &quot;themes&quot;.    Great  it will look really cool  but you still cant USE it.  I have been waiting literally for MONTHS for this fix  but nothing.  I dont understand what the point is to having a browser that wont even do   the simplest of things.  EVERY other browser out there has this option.  EVERY one.  You are  by not fixing this simple problem  excluding the entire online   business community from your user base.   </pre>
