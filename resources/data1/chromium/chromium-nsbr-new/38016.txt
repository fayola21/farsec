<title>Issue 38016 -   chromium -    Can not navigate to files listed under non-ASCII characters named folder using FTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome:	5.0.335.1 (Official Build 39691)  IE: OK  FF: Failed  Safari: Failed      1.launch CHrome  2.navigate to FTP site with non-ASCII named file folders  e.g:  ftp://61.185.32.191/    3.click any Chinese named folders to navigate to the child directory      should navigate to the child directory page with a list of files    instead I got webpage not found error.    per Jungshik's comment:  That's because we turn an FTP directory listing to   an html page in UTF-8 and FTP urls are stored in UTF-8 (path and   everything). When we make a request  we have to convert that back to the   detected encoding.        </pre>
