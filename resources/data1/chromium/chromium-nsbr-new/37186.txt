<title>Issue 37186 -   chromium -    Version string should include build type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Problem: We get bug reports that include the version string  but we currently   do not know which build the reporter tested it on unless they specifically   mention this.    Solution: &quot;about:version&quot; and the &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; dialog box display   the version and build of Chrome/Chromium. This should include an indicator of   what OS the build is for: Windows  Linux or Mac.    I suggest appending one character to the version string: 'W' for Windows  'L'   for Linux and 'M' for Mac. </pre>
