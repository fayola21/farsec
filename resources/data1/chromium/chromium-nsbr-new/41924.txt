<title>Issue 41924 -   chromium -    Chrome should do GMail-like shift+click to select multiple checkboxes on all &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt; forms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome should provide a feature so that when I do:      1. Click to select (or unselect) a checkbox    2. Hold down shift and click on another checkbox    Then:      All checkboxes between checkbox 1 and 2 should be ticket (on unticked)   too.    This is what happens in GMail with checkboxes. Implemntation-wise this  should probably not cross &lt;form&gt; boundaries  e.g. if you have:            &lt;form&gt;        I have a bike:        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;vehicle&quot; value=&quot;Bike&quot; /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;        I have a car:        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;vehicle&quot; value=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;        I have an airplane:        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;vehicle&quot; value=&quot;Airplane&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;    And        &lt;form&gt;        I have something else:        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;vehicle&quot; value=&quot;Something&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;    Clicking on Bike and then shift-clicking on Airplane should select  Bike Car Airplane  but clicking on Bike and then shift-clicking on  Something should only select Bike and Something. </pre>
