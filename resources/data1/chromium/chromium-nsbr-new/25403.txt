<title>Issue 25403 -   chromium -    Need a better affordance for exit full screen mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac doesn't have an easy way to exit full screen. Currently you need to choose full screen from the   menu again. I suggest the following:    When in full screen mode  we add a button to the top level menu bar (is this possible?) or a new   menu Called &quot;Full screen&quot; with an item that lets you exit. </pre>
