<title>Issue 44213 -   chromium -    Screen saver disabled when extension panel open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open an extension's panel thing  2. Wait the appropriate amount of idle time for your screen saver to come   on.      Expected: Screen saver comes on  and eventually monitors turn off  per your   system settings  Actual: Screen stays on and unsaved.    Additionally (although this will presumably be fixed if the above is fixed)    3. After waiting: Click outside panel to close it.    Expected: Nothing  Actual: Screen saver immediately comes on. During the fade to black in the   default Ubuntu screen saver  no amount of irritated clicking/keyboard   hitting will make it stop  and you must wait until the screen saver is   totally active before you can dismiss it. More likely a bug Ubuntu-side  or   even a &quot;feature&quot; (for people who use screen locking).    Ubuntu 10.04  also saw it in 9.10. </pre>
