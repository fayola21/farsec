<title>Issue 34711 -   chromium -    Please add extension profiling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have installed a number of Chrome extensions in Chromium and I swear my   browser is several times slower at page loading now.  However I have no   idea which extension is causing this (and I realize it could be different   extensions causing this problem on different pages).    Please can you extend the Chrome profiling tools to give a simple way to   see what percentage of page load slowdown is due to which extension on   each webpage visited?  (i.e what percentage of the time loading a page is   spent executing code in each extension)    There are probably also extensions that slow down interactions with web   pages after load  this profiling info would be useful too but is less   important than initial load time profiling IMO.   </pre>
