<title>Issue 42685 -   chromium -    Don't populate file URLs in WebDropData - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Test case at <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38019">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38019</a>    This has been partially addressed by crbug.com/42391  but in an incomplete   manner--rather than not populating file URLs  we strip them out in   ClipboardChromium. </pre>
