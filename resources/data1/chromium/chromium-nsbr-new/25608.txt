<title>Issue 25608 -   chromium -    Chrome hanging on Win 7 Ultimate 32-bit  using a SSD - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigating to any web page--I can not stress 'any' enough--regardless   of how long the browser has been open          Normal navigation to a webpage.        The browser hangs at almost timed intervals.  There are short spurts where   it performs at the 'normal' speed of operation it used to back when I was   using Vista.  But  these short spurts of normal operation are broken up by   random hangs in operation where the browser seems to just stop   responding.  If I press the enter key after typing in any URL  sometimes   the browser will simply hang: the rings on the tab that rotate to   indicate &quot;upload&quot; or &quot;download&quot; keep moving  but the browser displays   nothing  nor does it send or receive any packets during this time (if any   packets are sent or received  they are very few in number).  However  this   is not limited to uploads or downloads.  Sometimes I will be scrolling   down a page and the browser will hang; and sometimes when I am typing   something in  the browser will also hang.      <b>Please provide
