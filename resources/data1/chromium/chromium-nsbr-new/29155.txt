<title>Issue 29155 -   chromium -    window.top and parent not working from events raised by content script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.257.0 (32990)    Other browsers tested:  N/A -- Chrome extensions issue      1.  Install the attached repro extension (or get it from here:  <a href="http://www.blackfishsoftware.com/bugs/parentbug/parentbug.zip">http://www.blackfishsoftware.com/bugs/parentbug/parentbug.zip</a>)  2.  Click the browser action button.  3.  Watch the alerts.  See that window.parent is an OBJECT in the first  call  but undefined on the second call.  The only difference is the scope  from which they are being called.      window.parent can be accessed from the script of the page that was able to  access it before.      window.parent is undefined in the second alert  when it is accessed from  the DOM event handler.   </pre>
