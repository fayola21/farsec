<title>Issue 26959 -   chromium -    Top half of the title bar turns white - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version     :  4.0.235.0 (Developer Build 30964)  Platform: Chrome OS      1. Boot  2. Open some tabs  including the NNTP  3. start ctrl-Tabbing through the tabs    What I expect: The tabs change focus  redraw nicely  and everything looks good  What happens: after I tab to and then away from the NNTP  a white bar  appears across the top half of   the title bar.  Things that redraw after that look fine  but anything  that's not redrawn in half-obscured.    I'm happy to show it to you (Don't know how to take a screen shot on  CHromeOS :-))   </pre>
