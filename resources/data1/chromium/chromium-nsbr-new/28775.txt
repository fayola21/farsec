<title>Issue 28775 -   chromium -    RFE: When downloading files  the Save / Discard buttons have no shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33  ...        ALT+S to Save  ALT+D to Discard.  Along the same lines  holding down ALT   should make underlines beneath the 'S' in Save and 'D' in Discard visible.        Nothing happens.     </pre>
