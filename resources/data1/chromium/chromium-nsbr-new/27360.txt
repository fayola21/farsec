<title>Issue 27360 -   chromium -    Implement i18n for extension manifests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is already partly implemented  but this bug is to implement it   according to the new plan outlined here:    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/78f661ff16fc8f6a    Basically  we need to localize the manifest on install and store it   localized in the prefs. We'll also need to relocalize when the UI language   changes.    The fields that need to be localizable are:    * name  * description  * browser_action.default_title  * browser_action.default_badge_text  * page_action.name  * page_action.default_title    I think that currently we support special catalog entries like   &quot;chrome.extension_name&quot; or something. I can't remember what my argument for   these was  but thinking about it now  it makes less sense. I think we   should just support the __MSG_* macros in these fields  and developers can   do whatever they want. </pre>
