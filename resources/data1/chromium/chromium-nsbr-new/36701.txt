<title>Issue 36701 -   chromium -    Rename &quot;Browsing data&quot; section in Options &gt; Personal Stuff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.0 dev        1. Go to Options &gt; Personal Stuff  2. &quot;Browsing data&quot; section has only one button now (Import) since &quot;clear  browsing data&quot; was moved to Under the Hood.       I don't think people would expect to find Import under a section called  &quot;Browsing data.&quot; It would be more clear to call the section &quot;Import  settings&quot; unless we have plans to add something else here.     </pre>
