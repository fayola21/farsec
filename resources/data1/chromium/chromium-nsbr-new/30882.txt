<title>Issue 30882 -   chromium -    Incomplete display of repeated background-image for body element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38  URLs (if applicable) : see below            Safari 4.0.4: OK       Firefox 3.5.6: OK                IE 7: OK                IE 8: OK      When the body element is styled with a repeated background-image   the image is SOMETIMES repeated only to the height of the taller  div element on the page.    Two window-captures are provided here:  <a href="http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/chrome/x.jpg">http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/chrome/x.jpg</a>  <a href="http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/chrome/xii.jpg">http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/chrome/xii.jpg</a>    The incomplete background was first discovered while rapidly cycling  through all pages on the site and checking for any missing content.  A method with fewer page loads was later found and is described below.  A few to several attempts may be required to reproduce the display quirk.    First clear the cache  and maybe restart Chrome;  then load either of these pages:    <a href="http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/x/index.html">http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/x/index.html</a>  <a href="http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/xii/index.html">http://www.sertechlabs.com/stellar/xii/index.html</a>    Both contain a set of (6) links: &quot;Description&quot; ... &quot;Photo Gallery&quot;    Select one of the earlier links as a starting point  then in a  rapid sequence: click each named link quickly followed by  clicking the BACK button  eg:    Description  BACK  Features  BACK  Testimonials  BACK  Specifications  BACK  Finishes &amp; Prices  BACK  Photo Gallery (done  no back)    When accessed from either index page  the last item &quot;Photo Gallery&quot;  (or photos.html) are the ones that Chrome sometimes renders with an  incomplete background.  Loading either photos page directly has  reproduced the display quirk  though much less often.    A shorter  simpler test case is not yet known;  maybe there's a timing issue (?)    ------------    [Notes]  Both photos.html pages specify strict !DOCTYPE  and both pass W3C  validation.  The body element is styled from a common stylesheet with:    	background: #333333 url(&quot;images/stars.gif&quot;) repeat fixed top left;    The background-image is an ordinary gif  size 326 x 271    Chrome rev 3.0.195.38 plus the two prior releases  WinXP with SP3  and screen resolution 1024 x 768  'net connected with a router and  DSL or Cable modem.   </pre>
