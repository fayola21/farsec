<title>Issue 40217 -   chromium -    Sync crashes on sign-in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In my Vista laptop (Chrome Beta)  Chrome crashes whenever I try to sign in to   sync my bookmarks.  I tried re-installing chrome and deleting my profile  but   that didn't help.  Crash dump attached.    Notes:  1) Bookmark sync seems to be working fine on my Macs (Dev channel).  2) Bookmark sync used to work on this machine at some time in the past.  3) I've edited the crash dump to remove my password.  Hopefully I didn't bork   the file.   </pre>
