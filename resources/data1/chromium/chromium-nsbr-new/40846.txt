<title>Issue 40846 -   chromium -    Content scripts should be able to run on file://localhost/&lt;path&gt; URLs on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version  ======  5.0.366.0 dev - Mac OSX    Description  ========  When dragging a file onto the browser window in OSX  the file loads at      file://localhost/&lt;path/to/file&gt;    If opening using Cmd+O  the file loads at      file:///&lt;path/to/file&gt;    Currently  content scripts only appear to run on file:/// URLs.  Either Chrome for Mac should   open dropped files using file:/// or a way to match file://localhost should be supported for   extension content script match patterns.    Sample  =====  manifest.json  ----------  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Test file://localhost/&lt;path&gt; contentscripts&quot;     &quot;version&quot; : &quot;1.0.0&quot;     &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Test&quot;     &quot;content_scripts&quot; : [{      &quot;matches&quot; : [&quot;file://*/*&quot;  &quot;file:///*&quot;]       &quot;js&quot; : [&quot;test.js&quot;]    }]  }      test.js  -----  alert('I ran.');    Steps to reproduce  ============  Drag an html file onto a copy of Mac Chrome - the URL loaded should be   file://localhost/&lt;path/to/file&gt;.  No alert box is shown.    Edit the url to remove the &quot;localhost&quot; (resulting in file:///&lt;path/to/file&gt;) and press enter.  The   alert box is shown.    Notes  ====  Dragging a file onto Chrome for Linux opens the file using the file:/// address.   </pre>
