<title>Issue 40196 -   chromium -    Search suggestion service only works with supplied search engines - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2 (Official Build 43280) beta      1. Search using i.e. the default Yahoo or Google search from the Omnibar  2. Notice that suggestions come up (assuming suggestion service is enabled)  3. Now take the same search engine string and create a new search engine  4. Using this new search engine (with the same exact url!) no suggestions   come up (tested on Mac 10.6.3 and Windows 7 64bit)      Suggestion service should work for a search engine regardless if it is a   default  supplied with the build  search engine or not.      No suggestions appear  even using the same exact url as the default   engines.    Note: this issue has also been raised by people trying to change the   default google search to be a different locale (creating a new search   engine manually loses suggestion feature)  see   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8395">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8395</a> </pre>
