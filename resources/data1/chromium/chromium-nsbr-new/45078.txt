<title>Issue 45078 -   chromium -    Chrome fails to refresh iframe content even if cache is cleared. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have website that uses CKEditor in it's CMS admin. CKEditor replaces the textarea field with an   iframe where the website can be edited. Contents of the iframe include css stylesheet in header of   the included page. When I update the css-stylesheet and reload chrome (cmd+r or cmd+shift+r)   chrome fails to recognize that the file has changed and still reloads it from the cache. If I open the   file as direct url in the browser window  chrome recognizes that the file has changed and displays   the updated file. Even if I use &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; the iframe contents are still retrieved from   cache.     Chrome Version       :  6.0.401.1 dev         Safari 4: Ok    Firefox 3.6: Ok   </pre>
