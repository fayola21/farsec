<title>Issue 31960 -   chromium -    Support AppleDisplayScaleFactor in web content area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should plumb the AppleDisplayScaleFactor down into WebCore so that as   our UI scales  the web content scales as well.    Not sure if we already have a bug for this  filing a new one. Would be nice not   just for resolution independence  but also for accessibility. </pre>
