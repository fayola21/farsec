<title>Issue 28722 -   chromium -    Browser action documentation should mention background pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not really a bug  more a usability problem.    When trying to convert my toolstrip extension to a browser action  it was not   immediately clear to me where I'm supposed to call   chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(). It would be helpful if the   documentation would say something like &quot;This is usually called from a   background page&quot;.    (For toolstrips  it was clear that functions like this would be called from the   toolstrip html file  but for browser actions no html file exists).    I guess the same is true for page actions. </pre>
