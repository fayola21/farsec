<title>Issue 25417 -   chromium -    Chrome frame navigations needs to observable by DNS prefetch system - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The DNS prefetch system counts on hearing about all navigations in order to   populate a tree of &quot;subresources&quot; for each page.  There is currently an   observer instance that monitors network step fetches of HTTP requests in   Chromium  and this needs to be supported in Chrome Frame.    (the current guess is that we observe chrome HTTP transactions... but Chrome   frame may not be sending requests down that path  as it tries to use IE's   infrastructure to obtain content). </pre>
