<title>Issue 36854 -   chromium -    DEPS update to pick up v8 changes broke extensions management page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using  build-bisect.py I just tracked down breakage of the Extensions   Management page (chrome://extensions) to your update to DEPS for v8:    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/660029">http://codereview.chromium.org/660029</a>    I'll work on adding a test to help catch these regressions in the future; in   the mean time it would be great if we can get this fixed ASAP since we use it   a lot during development of extensions features.   </pre>
