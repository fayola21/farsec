<title>Issue 46137 -   chromium -    Chrome changes my active desktop in Mac OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It seems that Chrome  when it finishes loading a web site  will change my active desktop in Mac OS X to the desktop where that Chrome is running. Some pages may trigger this event several times (they have frames maybe?) which is really infuriating:    1- open chrome in desktop 1  2- open web site in chrome in desktop 1  3- move to desktop 2 to do something  4- forcefully moved back to desktop 1  5- move to desktop 2 again  6- moved back to 1 by chrome  7- and so on. </pre>
