<title>Issue 33077 -   chromium -    Task Manager: Popup processes should get auto selected on selection of its main tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.2 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36665">r36665</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34        1. Go to www.popuptest.com and click on &quot;Multi-popup test&quot; link  2. Allow all popups  3. Open &quot;Task Manager&quot; and select the main tab process page &quot;www.popuptest.com&quot; ( Tab: Popup Test 1 test you popup kill software )  - Please view the screen shot   attached for clear reference.     Actual:  ====  Mac: Task manager selects only the process page of the root window. But when performed &quot;End process&quot; on it  It kills all its popup's which were not shown as selected in   the task manager  process list. ( On &quot;End process&quot; the main tab and popup's all will be cleared from the task manager list )    Windows: On Selection of any process in the list of having popup's ( either main tab or popup's )  They get &quot;select-all&quot; in showing as single process and on performing &quot;End   process&quot; - all the process gets killed away.    Expected: As similar to windows  Make the popup processes to get auto selected when clicked on the main tab page. So that end user knows via from selection  that all of   its  popups also will gets killed away.    Note: This applies even for &quot;Duplicate&quot; tabs. ( when the real tab gets killed duplicate should get selected.)     </pre>
