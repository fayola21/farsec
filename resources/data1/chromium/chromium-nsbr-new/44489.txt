<title>Issue 44489 -   chromium -    Investigation: Why are some users getting ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED for well known hosts? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some users are reporting sporadic failures  where domains like www.google.com fail to DNS resolve.    My working theory is that the host resolver (getaddrinfo()) is returning some flaky error code other   than &quot;name not resolved&quot;  and we simply map it to ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED and give up (when   perhaps we should be re-trying). </pre>
