Highlighting the section i want to print and press Ctrl-P  in the   Printing Options  I've chosen print selection  2. nothing happened  nothing printed  or prompted  3. In the same particular tab  Print dialog box was failed to be called   out  i.e. no response when Ctrl-P was hit. That particular tab need to be   closed in order to call out the printing option.      Print out the selected Content of the page      No print out at all. Then google chrome can't call out the printing dialog     </pre>
