<title>Issue 31945 -   chromium -    WebSocket Handshake WebSocket-Location String change  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pre version 4.0.249.43 when using a URL of ws://host:port/context?  param=value  the returning header value WebSocket-Location used to validate against   ws://host:port/context    now it seams that it wants to validate against the parameters as well.  For example  this is an extract from the JavaScript console whilst trying to   connect to a web socket that used to work on previous builds.    Error during WebSocket handshake: location mismatch:   ws://localhost:8080/diffusion?topic=Trade !=   ws://localhost:8080/diffusion    I don't care which method is used to validate  as long as there is   consistency  right now it is impossible to have web sockets working across   the two different builds.     </pre>
