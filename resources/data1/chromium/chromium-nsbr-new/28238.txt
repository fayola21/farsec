<title>Issue 28238 -   chromium -    Selected text color doesn't respect the GTK+ theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0        Firefox 3.5: OK      1. In Options-&gt;Personal Stuff  click &quot;Use GTK+ Theme&quot;  2. Select text in the current page    The color should match those specified by the GTK+ theme  and be consistent   with applications like GEdit. For example  with a default Ubuntu theme  the   background is brown.    Instead  the selected text is always black with a blue background. It's   inconsistent with the desktop and consequently visually less pleasing.    See the attached screenshots: Firefox matches the color of GEdit for the   selected text  but Chrome always has the same &quot;black on blue&quot; colors.   </pre>
