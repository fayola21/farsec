<title>Issue 30122 -   chromium -    Antifeature: Tab glow follows mouse pointer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)  URLs (if applicable) : Any  Other browsers tested: No other browsers have this antifeature  Operating System: Mac OS 10.5.8    Chrome's tabs light up when you point at them.  Unfortunately (a) they light   up to become just as bright as the currently focused tab  which creates   confusion about which tab is focused; and (b) the glow moves around as you   move the mouse pointer  which is distracting and serves no useful purpose.    Please remove this antifeature.  Keep Chrome simple  elegant  and focused on   the content.   </pre>
