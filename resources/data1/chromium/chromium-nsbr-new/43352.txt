<title>Issue 43352 -   chromium -    Location tracking info-bar should allow copy+paste - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">http://www.google.com/ig</a> (although you won't get the same info-bar   unless you've got latitude enabled and haven't given it permission yet)  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Get an info-bar with a long URL.  2. Try to search for the URL to see what it actually refers to.        Copy the url from the info-bar into a google search or into the url bar.      Realize you have to re-type the url because the info-bar doesn't support copy+paste. :( </pre>
