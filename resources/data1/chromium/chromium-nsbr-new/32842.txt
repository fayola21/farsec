Launch chrome with few tabs  2. &quot;Open File&quot; (cmd+o)   3. Minimize chrome. (cmd+m)  4. Quit chrome    Actual: Renderer crash on all the tabs   &quot;Sad face&quot; favicon is shown on all the tabstrip favicons. But the tabs body body   doesnt show the sad face page. They go dark greyish.  ( Screenshot attached for reference )  - Unable to quit the browser even after canceling the modal  Only work around is to close all the opened tabs manually.
