<title>Issue 42952 -   chromium -    Flash website doesn't load properly in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 (45554)  OS: XP SP3  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/sx4j/characters/">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/sx4j/characters/</a>      Firefox 3.6: OK    The website loads  except for the background music and one layer which is an   animation. Clicking on buttons doesn't work.    This is only in incognito mode. I also tried Chromium 46071 and it's the same   problem. Internal Flash 10.1 RC2 or normal 10.0 doesn't make a difference. </pre>
