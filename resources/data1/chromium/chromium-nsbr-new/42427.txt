<title>Issue 42427 -   chromium -    Random 404 errors when loading pages. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.387.0 (Developer Build 45450)  URLs (if applicable) : Any           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Chromium has been randomly spitting out a 404 error when reloading pages   multiple times or just going to a page. It appears to have unpredictable   moods that last about 1 minute in which I cannot load any pages  I only get   a 404. I originally thought this was a DNS issue as I use Google's DNS   servers however I have been able to load the page in Firefox and not   Chromium. This is incredible annoying and I would appreciate a fix ASAP.    Screenshot attached.   </pre>
