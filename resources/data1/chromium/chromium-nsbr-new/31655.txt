<title>Issue 31655 -   chromium -    Document external extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    I quickly searched your bug list  and found <a title="Allow Chrome to install with a custom theme or preinstall an extension" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20502"> Issue 20502 </a> which may or may   not be related to this request.    Chrome should support the programmatic installation of extensions (.crx   files) via an installer or other application.  In certain instances  it's   very useful for an installer to trigger the installation of browser   extensions.  Ideally  an installer could simply &quot;drop&quot; a Chrome .crx   extension file into a defined directory.  The next time Chrome is started    it scans this directory looking for valid .crx files  and if any are found   Chrome should ask the user if they wish to install them.  Once installed    Chrome deletes the .crx files.    Additionally  if an extension with a given ID is already installed  and   Chrome discovers a .crx file with that ID  it should treat this   installation as an upgrade.  In this case  it unpacks and overwrites the   current extension with the one that was just delivered in the .crx file.    Other browsers  like Mozilla Firefox  already fully support this feature.    This is especially important in certain deployments where:    1) the extension developer does not want to submit their extension to the   extension Gallery for whatever reason (e.g.  it might be a private   extension for internal only use with an organization)    2) it's unreasonable to ask thousands of users to open Chrome  press Ctrl-  O  select the .crx file on their computer  click Continue  install the   extension  etc. (the installer should be able to do this work for them and   interact with Chrome indirectly by placing a .crx file to install somewhere   on the disk)    3) an installer may only be able to install the extension into Chrome if   the user consents  or allows it to actually do so (e.g.  during the   install  the user might have the option to say &quot;no  don't touch my Chrome   and don't install any other extensions&quot;)    As documented in src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc I tried using   Chrome's &quot;--load-extension&quot; option to load an extension from a specified   directory.  This doesn't work for me because the --load-extension switch   expects a directory with a manifest.json file in it  not a packaged .crx   file.  Further  --load-extension does not work if Chrome is already   running; if Chrome is already open  and you attempt to spawn chrome again   with --load-extension Chrome simply opens another window and does nothing   with the --load-extension switch.    If there is another  clearly undocumented  way to install a Chrome .crx   packaged extension into the browser via an installer or other application   please let me know.    If this request is a duplicate of another issue already submitted (20502?)    please mark this as a dup and refer me to the correct Issue to star.    Regards   Mark </pre>
