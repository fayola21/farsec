<title>Issue 25090 -   chromium -    BASE tag ignored if original page URL contains http://some/other/url in the query string - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Fetch a page from localhost:port/whatever?url=QUERYPARAMURL  where the   QUERYPARAMURL contains &quot;<a href="http://some.web.server/path/here">http://some.web.server/path/here</a>&quot;.  Note that in the   query parameter  the colon and slashes are NOT escaped into %3A and %2F.  2. Page load works fine.  Localhost server returns a page that contains a   &lt;BASE HREF=&quot;<a href="http://some.other.domain/some/other/path">http://some.other.domain/some/other/path</a>&quot;&gt; tag.      Because of the &lt;BASE&gt; tag  the browser ought to resolve all relative URLs   in the page as being relative to some.other.domain/some/other/path      Chrome resolves all relative URLs in the page as being relative to   localhost:... instead.  Chrome appears to ignore the &lt;BASE&gt; tag.    <b>Please provide
