<title>Issue 29218 -   chromium -    Typing in a URL requires fighting autocompletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21 (Official Build 33275)  URLs (if applicable) : http://b    If I type b in the location bar (&quot;b&quot; is a valid domain where I work)    autocomplete assumes I mean <a href="http://boingboing.net">http://boingboing.net</a> and automatically fills   that in.  Even if I type http://b it assumes the first autocomplete   result.    That means that I have to watch the bar to see what it's going to complete   to  then figure out how to delete the autocompleted value  even when I've   explicitly typed what in other browsers would be a fully qualified URL.    Chrome would be less frustrating to use if I could use the convention I'm   used to in firefox  where I can hit &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt; to get the first   autocomplete value.  It's fast to type and does what I want  whereas in   Chrome I'm always playing hide-and-seek with the URL I want. </pre>
