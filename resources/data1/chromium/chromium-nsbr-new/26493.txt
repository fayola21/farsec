<title>Issue 26493 -   chromium -    Bunch of leaks in Sync code after adding UI/IO ChromeThreads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30687">r30687</a>  tasks that previously might not have been run because the   thread isn't there in unit_tests now execute.  This is in-line with our new   philosophy of not making production code check for existence of key threads    since if they weren't available on users' machines (say on shutdown) we might   have bad bugs like data corruption etc (more on this later when I send an   email to chromium-dev).    Now a bunch of leaks come up in the sync code on Linux Valgrind.  I'm not   familiar with that code  so I was hoping that someone from the sync team can   look into them.  Tim: can you triage this? </pre>
