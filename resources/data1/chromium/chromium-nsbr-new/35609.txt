<title>Issue 35609 -   chromium -    [Content Settings] Chrome built-in features should not be affected by the options in Content Settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the options in Content Settings also affect many chrome built-in  features like Extensions  Inspector(Developer Tools)  about pages with  prefix &quot;about:&quot;(e.g. about:version)  built-in pages with prefix  &quot;chrome://&quot;(chrome://history)  this causes many issues like  those pages  could not be displayed  crashes  etc.    Content Settings feature should not have conflict with those existing  features  in other words those existing chrome built-in features should not  be affected by the options in Content Settings  otherwise many problems  would happen.   </pre>
