<title>Issue 23274 -   chromium -    Move event handler method bodies from widget_win.h to widget_win.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While investigating <a href="http://crbug.com/21921">http://crbug.com/21921</a>   debugging was greatly simplified   by moving the event handler method bodies (On*) from the header file to the   .cc file  because many files depend directly or indirectly on this header    and changes to it require long rebuilds. This refactoring should be done to   simplify future debugging.   </pre>
