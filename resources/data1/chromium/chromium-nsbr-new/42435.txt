<title>Issue 42435 -   chromium -    Race condition in 302 redirect when using embed or object tag  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Chrome should be using a lot of the CPU before the test. E.g. open 10 and play YouTube videos.  2. Go to <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/redirect_test">http://www.theyrule.net/redirect_test</a>  3. Refresh the page repeatedly.       The embedded swf displays the _url property.  It should display: &quot;_url: <a href="http://theyrule.net/redirect_test/redirect_test.swf">http://theyrule.net/redirect_test/redirect_test.swf</a>&quot;      Intermittently it displays: &quot;_url: <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/redirect_test/fail.swf">http://www.theyrule.net/redirect_test/fail.swf</a>&quot; in red. The failure   rate seems to correlate with Chrome's CPU utilization.    <b>Please provide
