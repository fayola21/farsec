<title>Issue 41033 -   chromium -    Flash Downstream Caching / Variable Initialization  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com">http://www.thedailyshow.com</a>  Other browsers tested: YES         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Continue to reload <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com">http://www.thedailyshow.com</a> until you see a &quot;No Config URL&quot; message  4. If it cannot be reproduced  open multiple tabs each with a flash plugin that consumes roughly 100 000k of   memory. (youtube hd)  6. When you can reproduce the bug  clear the browser cache and on the next page load video playback will work   properly.     -------------------------------------------------      1. SWF Embeds can initialize variables using any/all of following methods:   - Through a FlashVars attribute also exposed in an embed/object tag.  - As a query string derived from URL source of an embed/object tag.   - When the URL source responds with a 302 to another URL that another query string.     2. These variable initialization techniques should work regardless of downstream cache declarations on swfs.     For example the following markup:     &lt;embed src=&quot;<a href="http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:cms:video:comedycentral.com:263920?a=one&amp;b=two">http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:cms:video:comedycentral.com:263920?a=one&amp;b=two</a>&quot;      flashVars=&quot;c=three&amp;d=four&quot;      width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;    Where the embed src responded with a 302 to URL below    <a href="http://media.mtvnservices.com/player/loader/?e=five&amp;f=six">http://media.mtvnservices.com/player/loader/?e=five&amp;f=six</a>    Would initialize the following variables in a flash plugin.     a = one    b = two    c = three    d = four    e = five    f = six    -------------------------------------------------      When a swf is embedded within a page  and the embed src responds with a 302  and that 302 points to a swf with   it's downstream cache set to expire in 2/3 days  additional requests (by reloading the page or navigating to   another page that contains the same swf resource) will often drop url query strings that are expected to be initialized within the flash plugin.     - Occurs frequently on pages with 150 or more url requests  - This issue effects both Mac/PC Browsers.          </pre>
