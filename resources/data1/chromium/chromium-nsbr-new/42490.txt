<title>Issue 42490 -   chromium -    Mac plugins should always report keypresses as handled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STR  0. Have Silverlight 4 installed  1. Go to <a href="http://silverlight.net/content/samples/sl2/silverlightcontrols/run/default.html">http://silverlight.net/content/samples/sl2/silverlightcontrols/run/default.html</a>  2. Select the Text Box sample  3. Type in a text box    Keypresses are being handled by the page as well as the plugin; this is especially noticeable with   delete and space bar.    The problem is that we are still treating the return value of HandleEvent for keypresses as   meaningful; no other Mac browser does that. I'll need to mak sure I don't regress command keys   though. </pre>
