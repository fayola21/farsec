<title>Issue 40168 -   chromium -    [Geolocation] Allow/Deny in location tracking info-bar should just allow/deny the location tracking action for the given time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make sure &quot;Ask me when a site tries to track my physical location&quot;  option is checked  2. Go to <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a> and click on &quot;Show my location&quot; button  3. On the location tracking prompt info-bar  click Allow or Deny  4. Relaunch the browser and then try step #2 again      The location tracking prompt info-bar should show up every time when the  site tries to track location  but now google map gets the location info  successfully without any prompt.    It seems the first time Allow/Deny takes effect permanently  but it  shouldn't be.       </pre>
