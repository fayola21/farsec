<title>Issue 38896 -   chromium -    Fix 'extensions were disabled' experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a feature right now where we disable extensions if they autoupdate and require   significantly more permission than they did before.    We let the user know that they need to reapprove  but do so in the form of an infobar. This   causes the problem that if the user navigates for any reason (eg session restore  <a title="Infobars dismissed when restoring tabs after crash" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38848"> bug 38848 </a>)  the   infobar is lost.    Also  a separate issue is that after we tell the user about this situation once  we never do again    so it is easy for these disabled extensions to get lost. As a result  developers are incentivized to   request all available permissions in case they ever need them  or else to go to use hacky   workarounds to avoid requesting additional permissions.    It would be cool if we could use a more passive solution. For example  just letting the   unauthorized APIs fail until the user authorizes them. </pre>
