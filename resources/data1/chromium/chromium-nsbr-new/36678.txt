<title>Issue 36678 -   chromium -    Should not acquire locks between fork() / exec() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> process_util_posix.cc's LaunchApp() uses dynamic memory calls in between the   fork() and execvp() calls.  Memory allocators can use locks  so this is   unsafe  since a non-forking thread may be holding onto a lock at the time of   the fork()  but it will die after the fork()  so acquiring the same lock in   the child process on the forked thread will lead to deadlock.    I don't think anyone &quot;owns&quot; this code  so I'll just cc some random people   who've touched this area in case they're interested in taking a look. </pre>
