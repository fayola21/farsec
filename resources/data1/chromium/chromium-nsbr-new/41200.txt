<title>Issue 41200 -   chromium -    browser_pid set differently for ChromeMain on posix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc ~ lines 503-516    Windows set browser_pid to the browser process  and in now browsers pulls it from an argument.    Posix it skips this and just takes the pid of the current process.  The value is then used for a stats   table.    Not sure if this is a problem or not  just something I found looking at other things and hence   logging.  If it's by design  might be worth adding a comment that the difference is intended. </pre>
