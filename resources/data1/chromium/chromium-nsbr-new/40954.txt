<title>Issue 40954 -   chromium -    Find-in-Page does not match a partial syllable for Korean - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B9%84%ED%8B%80%EC%A6%88">http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B9%84%ED%8B%80%EC%A6%88</a>  2. Press Ctrl-F  3. Switch to Korean IME - 2set (default)(I'm assuming en-US QWERTY KBD   below)  4      a. Type 'q' (for '��_��_��_')  : '��_��_��_' is in the FiP box    b. Type 'l' (for '��_��') :  '��__��_' is shown in the FiP box    c. Type 'x' (for '��_��') : '��__��_' is in the FiP box    d. Type 'm' (for '��_��') : '��__��_��__��_' is in the FiP box  What is the expected output?     In 4a  all the syllables starting with '��_��_��_' have to be matched  but none is   matched.    In 4b  there are 141 matches (as of today)  which is as expected.    In 4c  no match is found. It has to match either any word starting with '��__��_  ��_��' or '��__��_'. There is no word starting with '��__��_' in the page. So  the match   count goes to 0. However  there are many '��__��_�ʕ�_��___' (Beatles transcribed  in   Korean Hangul) in the page that starts with '��__����'.    In 4d  no match is found. It has to match any word starting with '��__��_��__��_' or   '��__��_��__��_' followed by any final consonant that will get combined with '��__��_' to   form a syllable (e.g. '�ʕ�_').      4c is a known issue and it's not a regression (although it's annoying to   see the match count go down and up as you type). We need to add a search   collator to ICU that does not distinguish between leading and final   consonants. I think I've already filed a bug on this.     4a and 4d are a regression (on Windows)  I'm afraid (unless I was   hallucinating :-)) This report is about 4a/4d.       Mac OS and Linux have a different issue. I'll file it separately.                  </pre>
