<title>Issue 26141 -   chromium -    Bookmark Sync : Get rid of the use of GetNodeByID in model associator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In model_associator.cc  we use the methdo BookmarkModel::GetNodeByID in   ModelAssociator::GetBookmarkNodeFromSyncId.    GetNodeByID is very inefficient: it walks the bookmark tree hierarchy to find   a node by the given ID. Instead  we should just keep bookmark node pointers   in our ID maps to avoid finding node by IDs.   </pre>
