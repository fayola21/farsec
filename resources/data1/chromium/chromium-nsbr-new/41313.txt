<title>Issue 41313 -   chromium -    Can't initiate a connection using the WebSocket API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome version: 5.0.342.9 beta  Operating System: Ubuntu 9.10 32bit      1. start a localhost listener on port ABCD (netcat or somesuch)  2. initiate a connection to localhost:ABCD using the WebSocket API    Sample code to initiate a connection:      var ws = new WebSocket(&quot;ws://localhost:ABCD/&quot;);      ws.onopen = function() { ...notify user somehow... };      A connection between the two sockets is established. Chromium sends the   WebSocket protocol handshake.      No connection is established. (Which means no handshake is exchanged   either.)    Either the WebSocket API changed  or this is a bug. (Or I'm doing something   very wrong.) I've created a small na��_��_ve WebSocket server three-or-so months   ago and it worked perfectly fine with the Chromium version of that time.   Three months later  the *same* code no longer works with the current   Chromium version.    I've tried listening with netcat  my past websocket-server and even a new   quickie Lisp script. I've concluded that no connection ever takes place.    The JavaScript console doesn't seem to report any errors. </pre>
