<title>Issue 36435 -   chromium -    When database.open access is blocked  we don't display the blocked content icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When database.open access is blocked  we don't display the blocked content   icon.  Since we handle the blocking at the VFS openFile layer (which is   triggered by a control message) it'll be hard to know which view to apply this   to.  I'm not sure whether or not the approach we use in DOM Storage would   work (see renderer_webstoragearea_impl.cc's setItem).    There's a good chance this is something we can punt to mstone5  but I'm   opening it under 4.1 until someone confirms this isn't a must have feature. </pre>
