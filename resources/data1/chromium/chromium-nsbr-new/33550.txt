<title>Issue 33550 -   chromium -    Security: Password Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This isn't so much a bug as it is an issue with a feature. In the Options -&gt;   Personal Stuff -&gt; &quot;Show Saved Passwords&quot; to view your passwords requires a   single click of a button.    Should someone steal for example a users laptop and open Chrome  not only do   they have a comprehensive list of emails on which sites the user visited    they also contain the Passwords which a cyber attacker may use to commit any   number of offences. (Think Ebay  gmail  PayPal etc)    I simply propose that a Master password be put in place to view all of these   passwords. I know the point of these passwords is not to remind you should   you forget and having a password to view passwords does not seem like a   clever move  but it is a more secure one. </pre>
