<title>Issue 39355 -   chromium -    alert() windows appear *under* extension popup; can appear to lock up X server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an extension with a browser or page action popup containing the   following content:      &lt;div style=&quot;width: 500px; height: 500px&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('')&quot;&gt;click   me&lt;/div&gt;  2. Run the extension  open the popup  and click on &quot;click me&quot;.  3. If your X server appears to stop accepting input  press space bar to get   it back.        - A visible alert window should appear and the user should be able to click   it to close it.  - The user should be able to interact with other (non-chrome) windows   without first closing the alert window.        - *Sometimes* the alert window appears directly under the popup where it   cannot be seen.  (Sometimes it appears elsewhere; I'm not sure what   determines this.)  - Because the extension's popup is active  Chrome grabs all input away from   other X windows  presumably so that it can close the popup when the user   clicks elsewhere.  - But within Chrome  the alert() window is stealing all input  so the popup   does not close when the user clicks.    The combination of these three problems can lead the user to believe that   their X server has stopped accepting input.  They are unlikely to realize   that an alert window is displayed  and that pressing space bar (or one of   many other keys) will dismiss it.    <b>Please provide
