<title>Issue 23426 -   chromium -    Bookmarks should support option to always open in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)  WebKit  Version      : 	532.1  V8	 Version     :  1.3.13.2  Other browsers tested: not possible  new feature    Safari 3:  Firefox 3:        1. You got a website  you want always open in new tab             The URL can be defined as &quot;new-tab-only&quot;-url  so everytime the url is   opened from bookmarks folder (or from bookmark bar) - the page should   always open in new tab.        The page always opens in the current tab  which is kinda annoying   sometimes. Fro example I want google-reader or google-mail always open in   new tab as i used to with google-toolbar(FF extension).     Known workaround?    Ctrl + Mouse click or through context menu (Open in new tab). It's annoying    and user unfriendly.    </pre>
