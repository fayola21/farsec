<title>Issue 35470 -   chromium -    no way to restore 'open application' dialog trying to call a third party using UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2    if you open a link that calls a protocol from a thirdy party (e.g. sopcast)   you have an interface that asks you to remember your action. if you choose   'never open links like this' and 'remember my action' there are no way to   revert your choice from UI. I felt in this problem browsing www.myp2p.eu and   calling from a link sopcast. I made the wrong choice for rush and now I   haven't found a way to revert! </pre>
