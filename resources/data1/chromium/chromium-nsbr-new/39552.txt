<title>Issue 39552 -   chromium -    Hide  show and arrange extensions omnibar icon and toolbar button icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 (Official Build 42060)    I would like for chrome to control how the extensions icons are displayed. Some extension doesn't provide option to   hide its icon  some of them will hide/show up whenever they need to while the toolbar icon usually cannot be hide.    I think its better to control the icon appearances in one place  probably in chrome://extensions/  and provide   options to show them as a toolbar button or as an icon inside the omnibar.  Another option in extension tab is to set the icon to always show  always hide or follow the extensions settings if   the extension have some settings to only show its icon at specific condition.
