<title>Issue 23654 -   chromium -    HistoryContentsProvider should sort results by typed count  not visit time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've been hitting a bunch of cases lately where I repeatedly use   HistoryContentsProvider results  by typing in some keyword from a previous   page and wanting it.  It drives me crazy that right now these results are   basically sorted  in chronological order instead of by typed count/visit   count like the HistoryURLProvider; I have a particular URL in mind I keep   trying to get to but other more recent pages keep popping up instead.    The sorting and relevance calculation code in the provider is weird.  It   marks relevance (based on the order in which we get the results) before it   compares matches by visit time.  Somebody needs to take a hard look at it and   clean it up. </pre>
