<title>Issue 37529 -   chromium -    &quot;Search Google for&quot; shouldn't do Omnibox interpretation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. On a web page  select some text that starts with the name of a page known to   have a search box.  For example  if Omnibox knows that http://search/ has a   search box (i.e.  in the Omnibox you can type &quot;search foo&quot; to do a search for   foo on http://search/ then select the text &quot;search options&quot; at the top of a   Gmail page.  2. Right click and select the search command.  In this example  it is &quot;Search   Google for 'search options'&quot;.      As suggested by the name of the command I invoked  I should get a page that has   Google search results for the selected text.      I get the behavior I would expect if I typed the selected text into the   Omnibox: I get the http://search/ results page for &quot;options&quot;.    In case this behavior doesn't seem totally wrong  consider that the actual case   I hit was an innocuous word that happens to name an internal website that   happens to have a site-specific search box I never use. </pre>
