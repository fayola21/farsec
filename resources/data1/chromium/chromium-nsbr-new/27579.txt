<title>Issue 27579 -   chromium -    Flash 10.0 crash under _pthread_start @+0x0033[0-4]*** (doing file I/O) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many of the _pthread_start Flash crashes are doing file I/O  and have a stack   like:  0x0508afaa [Flash Player +�_0x00331faa]  0x0508b9aa [Flash Player +�_0x003329aa]  0x05036aee [Flash Player +�_0x002ddaee]  ...  (sometimes with one more or less frame at the top). It appears to be an I/O   thread  doing file operations at the time of the crash.    Sample crash: http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=63dc63e16119c326    There's a pretty good chance that this is actually a plugin bug  not our bug    but filing so we can at least get numbers  and maybe coordinate with Adobe. </pre>
