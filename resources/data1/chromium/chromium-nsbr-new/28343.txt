<title>Issue 28343 -   chromium -    FRAME element noResize property not working as it should - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Compila��__��_��_o oficial 31639)                   IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Create a frameset with 2 frames allowing user to resize  2. With javascript set one of the FRAMEs element noResize property to True   (or 1). Resize is now disabled. All good.  3. Now try to revert then resize status by setting the noResize property   back to False (or 0) with Javascript. The noResize property remains set to   True until you reload the page.      FRAME element shou accept [FRAME Element].noResize=false (or 'false'    or '0'  or ''  or whatever) and allow user to resize.      The noResize property remains set to True.     </pre>
