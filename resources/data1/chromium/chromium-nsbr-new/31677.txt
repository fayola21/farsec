<title>Issue 31677 -   chromium -    Some QuickTime videos don't play - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> QuickTime videos that caused crashes in <a title="[Quicktime plugin] Crash -[OOPVideoRenderer positionFrame:movie:controller:mcFlags:]" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29357"> bug 29357 </a> (those that use Cocoa+CG) now just don't play   correctly (on 10.6). The video loads  and shows the first frame  but then doesn't do anything. If you   scrub to a later part  you get that frame and a second or two of audio  then it stops again; it feels   like maybe they aren't getting some callback they expect.    Marking as a regression  since beta branch worked (due to only allowing Carbon+QD for   QuickTime). </pre>
