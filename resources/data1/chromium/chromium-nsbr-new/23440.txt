<title>Issue 23440 -   chromium -    Wrong text-shadow blur rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK       Opera 10: OK    The text-shadow blur effect is rendered differently from other browsers. I  didn't read the spec so I'm not sure who is doing it wrong  but it needs to  be fixed in Chrome ASAP. Other browsers do them in consistent way (WebKit  included)  see attached image.    Code used:    text-shadow: 0 0 5px #00ff00;    (ClearType/Windows) </pre>
