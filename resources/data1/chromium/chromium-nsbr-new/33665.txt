<title>Issue 33665 -   chromium -    command-tab to other apps kills command-L shortcut to address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use Chrome for a while  2. Use command-Tab to toggle to any other app  3. Use command-Tab to get back to Chrome  4. Use command-L to enter an new site  5. Wreck your keyboard because now you have to use the friggin' mouse.      The address bar should immediately highlight and you should be able to   enter a URL without having to grope around from the friggin' mouse.        The address bar NEVER highlights  even though the rest of the window   clearly has focus - the close  minimize  and maximize buttons are all light   up and the window is on top.    You have to either open up a new window or use the mouse to click in the   address bar to force focus. It should have already focused.    It's a really minor tweak  but it creates MONSTER FRUSTRATION  particularly   for experienced users who really like Chrome because it's otherwise really   fast and responsive compared to all other  bloated browsers.    <b>Please provide
