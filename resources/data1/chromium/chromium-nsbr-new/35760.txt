<title>Issue 35760 -   chromium -    gperf build step has extra output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Super low priority  but it's been bugging me.  :)        When building  I get:      RULE generate_files_generate_gperf_0   out/Debug/obj/gen/third_party/yasm/x86cpu.c  found distinct (A B) on attempt 3  built perfect hash table of size 128    RULE generate_files_generate_gperf_1   out/Debug/obj/gen/third_party/yasm/x86regtmod.c  found distinct (A B) on attempt 1  built perfect hash table of size 128    RULE yasm_generate_gperf_0   out/Debug/obj.host/geni/third_party/yasm/x86insn_nasm.c    RULE yasm_generate_gperf_1   out/Debug/obj.host/geni/third_party/yasm/x86insn_gas.c  found distinct (A B) on attempt 19  built perfect hash table of size 512    LINK(target) out/Debug/ncdecode_tablegen    ACTION v8_snapshot_run_mksnapshot out/Debug/obj.target/geni/snapshot.cc    TOUCH out/Debug/obj.host/third_party/yasm/generate_files.stamp  found distinct (A B) on attempt 349  built perfect hash table of size 512      It would be nice if it didn't produce the extra output (&quot;found distinct&quot;   bits).  From looking at the source that is the output sent to stdout    whereas errors would show up on stderr.  Perhaps we could redirect stdout   to /dev/null or something. </pre>
