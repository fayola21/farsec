Ctrl+RightShift in the Omnibox to make it RTL  2. Type something which brings suggestions  3. Navigate the suggestions using the arrows  4. Ctrl+LeftShift in the Omnibox to make it LTR  5. Delete the string entered in the Omnibox using the Backspace key  6. Type something else with suggestions...  7. Navigate the suggestions using the arrow keys      The selected suggestion appears in the Omnibox RTLed instead of LTRed      This is the normal case  the edge case which also fails is skipping steps   5&amp;6 </pre>
