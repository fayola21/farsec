<title>Issue 45684 -   chromium -    &quot;close tab&quot; does not equate &quot;make phantom tab&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.pin a tab  2.right-click on it  3.choose 'close tab'      The tab should go away.      If the tab is active  another tab will be selected  only the tab favicon will stay on the tab bar. OK... if you say so.  If the tab is inactive  nothing seems to happen (&lt;--is there a bug report on this?)  but the tab will reload when activated.   I am a naive user I am confused.    <b>Please provide
