<title>Issue 23787 -   chromium -    Context menu for app shortcut applications is too long - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make something into an application shortcut  run the shortcut  and right-  click on the taskbar entry.    The context menu is utterly  ridiculously long.  We have basically crammed   every item in all of our menus into it.  It takes my entire screen height. </pre>
