<title>Issue 45299 -   chromium -    Font choice for mixed Chinese/roman character URLs in omnibox suboptimal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev    <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB/+albums">http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB/+albums</a>                  1. Go to a URL that includes some Chinese characters followed by some roman   characters  such as   &lt;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB/+albums">http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB/+albums</a>&gt;.      A consistent font should be used for the roman characters.      A different font is used for the &quot;www.last.fm/music/&quot; and &quot;/+albums&quot; parts    which looks kind of ugly.   </pre>
