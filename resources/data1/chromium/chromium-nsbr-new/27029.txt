<title>Issue 27029 -   chromium -    Some pages cause flickering throbber and slow-responding tab closure with Cmd-W - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a mailing list  I wrote:    --------------------------------------------------  On Sat  Nov 7  2009 [...]  Dan [...] wrote:  &gt; <a href="http://www.sriraminhell.com/2008/09/review-of-google-chrome-slow-and.html">http://www.sriraminhell.com/2008/09/review-of-google-chrome-slow-and.html</a>    What I find interesting is that this page is awful on Mac Chrome  (haven't checked other platforms yet)  both the 4.0.223.11 dev channel  and a ToT. Not only does it suck up more than one CPU (in all -- 90%  of one  15% of the other)  but the favicon in the tab strip flickers  like crazy (between the page's favicon and the throbber  I think). Tab  closure using Cmd-W is very slow to respond. Scrolling is super-janky  at first  but gets better after a bit. [I'm pretty sure that at least  some of these issues aren't Mac-specific.]    Safari works much better  remaining responsive throughout and  helpfully (?) informing me that the page is loading with 64 of  3000-some-and-rising items completed.  --------------------------------------------------    Let me mark this as OS:Mac until I confirm badness on other platforms.... </pre>
