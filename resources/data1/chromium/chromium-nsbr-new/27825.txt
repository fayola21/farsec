<title>Issue 27825 -   chromium -    Some rounded corners not antialiased - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This page has lots of rounded corners.  <a href="http://www.curvycorners.net/">http://www.curvycorners.net/</a>  With dev channel builds  you get antialiasing on them and they look nice.   But the main box's rounded corners don't have antialiasing  neither does   the &quot;Comments&quot; box.    If you click somewhere else on the site like here:  <a href="http://www.curvycorners.net/demos/">http://www.curvycorners.net/demos/</a>  you'll see all the corners are now antialiased.    Something weird is happening in a few isolated places on this site causing   us to not antialias these corners.    It would be great if somebody could generate a reduced testcase (hence   HelpWanted). </pre>
