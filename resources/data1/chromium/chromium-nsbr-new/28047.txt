<title>Issue 28047 -   chromium -    UI feedback on extensions promo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some feedback on the extensions promo from Linus:  * the yellow text promo should not touch the bottom of the NTP  it should be slightly higher  * the puzzle piece should never overlap with the NTP content. For small screens  we should have a   scrollbar instead.    CC'ing the UI team so they can confirm. </pre>
