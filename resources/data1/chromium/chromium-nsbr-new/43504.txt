<title>Issue 43504 -   chromium -    Graphic bug on the UI : too sharp colors separation (no more &quot;fade&quot; effect) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.396.0 dev (and on the latest build of Chromium too)    What steps will reproduce the problem ?  1. Open Google Chrome (on Windows XP SP3)  2. Look at the UI with the bookmarks bar activated.  3. Shades of gray are abruptly separated without any fading effect.    What is the expected result ?  The colors (here  the shades of gray) should  as before  be separated by a   &quot;smooth fading effect&quot;.      There is an ugly separation between colors along the entire length of the   UI.        </pre>
