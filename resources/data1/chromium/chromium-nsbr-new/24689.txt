<title>Issue 24689 -   chromium -    3gb download truncated halfway (when computer went to sleep?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On windows vista home 64 bit  with 3.0.195.25  downloading the   90 day trial of visual c++ 2008 started fine  so I let it download  while I did something else.  When I came back  the computer  was asleep.  I woke it up  and when it came up  it thought  the download was done... but the file was only 1.7GB instead  of the promised 3.3GB  so it ended a little more than halfway  through.    (Did the computer go to sleep in the middle of a download?   Or did the download end early  and then the computer went to sleep?  I don't know.  I'll rerun the fetch with sleep turned off.)    The file I was grabbing can be downloaded from  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=83c3a1ec-ed72-">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=83c3a1ec-ed72-</a>  4a79-8961-25635db0192b </pre>
