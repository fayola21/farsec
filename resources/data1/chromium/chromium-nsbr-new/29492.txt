<title>Issue 29492 -   chromium -    Crash NotificationService::Notify(NotificationType  NotificationSource const&amp;  NotificationDetails const&amp;)  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.27  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Be running 4.0.249.22  2. AU kicks in for 4.0.249.27  3. 5 seconds later 4.0.249.22 crashes      No crash      Crash    Note: I had Hardware Growler installed.  It's part of the BSD-licensed Growl   package from <a href="http://growl.info/">http://growl.info/</a> which shows me when volumes get   mounted (even anonymously as happens for the Chrome AU mechanism)   and so I knew immediately when the AU happened since I got notified the   Chrome volume was being mounted.  5 seconds after it unmounted  just   after the AU completed  the crash happened. </pre>
