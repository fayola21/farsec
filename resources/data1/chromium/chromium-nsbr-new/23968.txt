<title>Issue 23968 -   chromium -    Chrome auto-complete works briefly and then disappears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a Chromium tab and enter a URL  e.g.  reddit.com.  2. Go to another URL in the same tab  e.g.  cnn.com.  3. Start to type in the first URL again  and watch for it to auto-complete   (to reddit.com again in this case).  4. When you have typed &quot;redd&quot; and see reddit.com in the text box  stop   typing and try to hit enter to go to reddit.com.  5. You probably will end up doing a Google search for &quot;redd&quot; instead    effectively making the auto-completion useless.    This bug is far more annoying with long URLs that have many slashes in   them. For instance  if I try to browse to   www.foobar/cat/dog/monkey/bird/pegasus.html (assuming I have it in my   history)  it will repeatedly show me the whole URL  but whenever I pause   typing to hit enter and go there  the rest of the URL will disappear  so   it's kind of a tease. :)    I don't think this bug happens all the time  but today it's happening   repeatedly  so I'm reporting it.                  <b>Please provide
