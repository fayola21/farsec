<title>Issue 39140 -   chromium -    Cookies which are on the Expections list with Allow need to override the &quot;Clear cookies and other site data when I close my browser&quot; option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing for a friend that is too concerned about privacy to post themselves.   I can act as a go between to collect more information.    <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/03/stable-channel-update.html">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/03/stable-channel-update.html</a>  The latest Stable release has some better cookie handling features  but   they are still not enough to create the right default cookie handling. This   is the problem:    Cookies which are on the Expections list with Allow need to override the   &quot;Clear cookies and other site data when I close my browser&quot; option. Right   now  the &quot;Clear...&quot; option is paramount and it deletes everything.    Without the behavior I mentioned above  it is impossible to setup an   environment which is very easy to do in IE8 and Firefox--cookies which are   allowed for the session only unless they are explicitly Allowed to persist   through the Exceptions dialog.    Without this capability  I cannot switch to Chrome as my default browser.   </pre>
