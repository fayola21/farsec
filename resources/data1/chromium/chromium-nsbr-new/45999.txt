<title>Issue 45999 -   chromium -    Fixed with  right-aligned html select problem on Chrome for PC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I have a fixed width  right aligned html select with some really long options. These options   expand beyond the browser and the right side of the screen. In Chrome for Mac it behaves as I   would expect and actually repositions the options menu so that it's right justified with the select   (meaning I see all the options). In Chrome for PC the options are not repositioned and they get   cut off by the edge of the screen.      Ability to see all options in the select menu without being cut off on Chrome for PC      Options are cut off on Chrome for PC    <b>Please provide
