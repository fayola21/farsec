Scroll to the bottom of the doc in the page (The embedded doc gets the   focus by default)  3. Click on any blank space outside the doc (so that the focus shifts to the   page and you can scroll the page)  4. Try scrolling to the bottom of the page.    Expected:  We should be able to scroll through to the bottom or top of the webpage.    Actual:  We cannot scroll through the page  until you click on the scroll bar.      Windows Chrome works as expected.   </pre>
