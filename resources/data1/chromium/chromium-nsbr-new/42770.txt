<title>Issue 42770 -   chromium -    Ensure Bookmark manager (and others) work correctly during a linux upgrade - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently if you update linux the bookmark manager (and anything else using the shared   resources) will stop working  similar to the inspector.    Some possible solutions can be found in the comments here:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1564034/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/1564034/show</a>    - We are going to have to address the issue of upgrading on Linux.  These files  aren't in a .pak file so they will change during an upgrade and possibly break  currently running Chrome instances.  We should put them in a pak file and have a  mapping between URLs and resource IDs.  This will have the side benefit of being  not touching disk as much.  This can happen in a follow up change.    -It might also be possible to do some automapping between filenames and resource  ids.  We do something like that for theme resources.  We can modify grit to  generate a header file with the mapping.     </pre>
