<title>Issue 32442 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager: Replace placeholder icons with real ones - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The toolbar icons (add / remove / show-in-folder) in the Mac bookmark manager window are just   placeholders. I need to replace them with some real ones.    Cole suggested using capsule-style buttons; that would imply not having there be a regular   toolbar  but just leaving space at the top for the buttons and search field. I'm fine with that. Will get   to this ASAP. </pre>
