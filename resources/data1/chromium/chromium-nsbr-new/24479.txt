<title>Issue 24479 -   chromium -    Need to map keys before checking if they're accelerators - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See comment 46 in <a title="Figure out how to deal with sluggish renderers blocking accelerators" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5496"> issue 5496 </a>.  Copied from that bug:    1. Switch keyboard layout to Russian or other similar layouts.  2. Open <a href="http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html">http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html</a>  3. Uncheck all suppress check boxes and try if keys like ctrl-t  ctrl-w work.  4. Check suppress keydown check box and try these keys again. You may find   these keys   stop working. They will still work if the keyboard layout is US. </pre>
