<title>Issue 24295 -   chromium -    Cached DNS NXDOMAIN entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following problem may be non-solveable.  But I believe this has   happened to me before and today I was able to trace it cleanly.    a) I tried to access an internal website in chrome  b) I kept getting DNS error pages.  This continued for about 1-2 minutes.  c) I ran ipconfig /displaydns     It showed:               myserver               -----------------------------------               Name does not exist.  d) I ran ipconfig /flushdns  e) Chrome now loaded the page instantly.    So the OS seems to have cached a bogus NXDOMAIN entry for the server.  As a   user  I probably could have waited a few minutes.  But in the meantime  I   was cursing at chrome.    Could we:     - have chrome (in the case of NXDOMAIN) try twice if the user repeatedly   presses reload or attempts to access the same host? </pre>
