<title>Issue 28929 -   chromium -    Chrome running for a long period of time on OS X renders System unstable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12 (Official Build 32876)    OS version               : 10.6.2 (32-bit Machine)    Apologies for the vagueness of this issue -- I have not been able to   hypothesize why this is happening  but it has been a serious issue for me   and I am consistently having to hard-reboot my machine as a result.      1. Open Chrome.app  2. Open various tabs. &quot;Normal usage&quot; for several hours: e.g. one or two   webmail (Gmail) windows + Reader + half a dozen other web pages or   apps.        Browsing should continue normally.        The system after a period of time becomes &quot;unstable&quot;. By this I mean    unable to launch new processes. Examples of how this manifests itself:    - Copying a file in Finder.app does not complete: the progress bar just   &quot;hangs&quot;.  - Opening a new Terminal.app window no longer logs the user into a   Terminal session. Instead I see the &quot;password:&quot; prompt and entering the   correct password does not authenticate.  - Opening a new Textmate session from the Terminal as an example &quot;mate   .&quot;  I see &quot;Abort Trap&quot;.  - Apps do not launch by clicking on them in the dock.  - I cannot restart: the system will display the restart dialog  but will not   restart. The typeface used by the Force Quit Applications dialog and the   buttons on &quot;Are you sure you want to shut down your computer now?&quot;   dialog is unusual.    guess is I am getting fork failures.. possibly zombie processes?    Snippets of my system log are also attached.     </pre>
