<title>Issue 23591 -   chromium -    Crash in [TabController inRapidClosureMode] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copying a stack trace from <a title="Browser crash in TabView MouseDragged - obj_msgSend" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22538"> Issue 22538 </a>  because I think this bug has a separate root cause.    #0  0x953bd688 in objc_msgSend ()  #1  0x05bfffba in -[TabController inRapidClosureMode] (self=0x21ccf40   _cmd=0x724f650) at  /Users/vtl/dev/google/cr-git2/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/tab_controller.mm:243  #2  0x05c07aee in -[TabView mouseDown:] (self=0x189ca0  _cmd=0x953f2918   theEvent=0x21cb210) at  /Users/vtl/dev/google/cr-git2/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/tab_view.mm:254  #3  0x94095af7 in -[NSWindow sendEvent:] ()  #4  0x940626a5 in -[NSApplication sendEvent:] ()  #5  0x93fbffe7 in -[NSApplication run] ()      Reproduce with:  1) Open a window with two tabs in it.  2) Drag one tab out into its own window  3) Grab that same tab and drag it around.  While dragging  right-click.    BOOM!    The second drag operation does something to delete the Browser object and create a new one.    As part of this process  we destroy the TabStripController  but TabController still hangs on to a   pointer.  Not sure why things aren't getting reparented correctly. </pre>
