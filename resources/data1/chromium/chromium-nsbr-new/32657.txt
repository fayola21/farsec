<title>Issue 32657 -   chromium -    Figure out a way to avoid an extra navigation entry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently when we detect the cf meta tag in an html page  we reissue the   navigation in order to shift it over to chrome.  This causes two identical   navigational entries to be added to the travel log whereas there should be   only one.  To work around this we delete the previous entry from the log   after starting the CF navigation (see DeletePreviousNavigationEntry in   bho.cc).    We should figure out a way to avoid the duplicate navigation entry in the   first place. </pre>
