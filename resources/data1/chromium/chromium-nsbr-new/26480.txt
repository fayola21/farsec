<title>Issue 26480 -   chromium -    Rendering artifacts on rotated element in Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://thatnotebookthing.com/temp/artifacts.html">http://thatnotebookthing.com/temp/artifacts.html</a>           Safari 4: n/a    Firefox 3.x: n/a           IE 7: n/a           IE 8: n/a      1.  View the document located at the address above.  2.  Hover over the circular element on the page.  3.  Notice the odd rendering artifacts above the element.      No rendering artifacts.      Strange rendering artifacts.    This seems to only be a problem in Linux. It happens for me in Jaunty and   Karmic.     </pre>
