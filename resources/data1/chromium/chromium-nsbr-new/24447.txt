<title>Issue 24447 -   chromium -    Swap process on cross-site rel=noreferrer links to new windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Click on a cross-site link with both rel=noreferrer and target=_blank   specified  2. See if the resulting page is loaded in a different renderer process        The new page should be loaded in a different renderer process    corresponding to the SiteInstance of the new page  not the old one.    Currently  we load the page in the same process.  In general  we do this   because there could be script interactions between windows that we do not   want to break  even if the pages are from different sites.    Right now  we only swap processes if the user navigates to a cross-site   URL via the browser process (e.g.  via the location bar or bookmark).  We   also swap if the navigation matches a particular heuristic (e.g.  as used by   Gmail): if the page calls window.open()  then sets window.opener to null in   the new window  and then navigates the window to a cross-site URL  we'll   swap to a new process.    In the case of rel=noreferrer  the site is indicating its desire to be isolated   from the page that's about to load.  If the link also opens in a new window    the HTML5 spec also says that window.opener will not be set.  This implies   that it is safe to load the link in a new process.    (Note: we could choose to also swap processes on noreferrer links that   don't open in a new window  but this might break script interactions   between the new page and other pages in the same BrowsingInstance.  It's   unclear if we should care about that  because the noreferrer attribute   suggests there's some intent to load the new page in a separate context.)    This is currently blocked on WebKit <a title="Offer to copy the application out of the disk image if run from there" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28986"> bug 28986 </a>  which adds rel=noreferrer   support to WebKit. </pre>
