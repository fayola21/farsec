<title>Issue 28873 -   chromium -    Chrome sometimes does not return to to last scroll postion when using back button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.255.0 (32765)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://reddit.com">http://reddit.com</a>  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): returns user to previous page at   same scroll position on back button use  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):returns user to previous page at same   scroll position on back button use    1. go to reddit.com  2. click on a link  3.click back button      User will get reddit.com page scrolled to the same scroll position as   previous      User gets reddit.com page scrolled to the top of the page    I'm not sure exactly which pages this happens on.  At first I thought it was   mainly pages that had cgi arguments like ?a=b&amp;c=d  but it looks like the   bug affects the main reddit page too  so I'm not sure exactly when this bug   fires and when it doesn't.  Sometimes the behavior is right. </pre>
