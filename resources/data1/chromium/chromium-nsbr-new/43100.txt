<title>Issue 43100 -   chromium -    [NSString isValidURI] not strict enough - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> isValidURI uses NSURL to try to validate that a string is a valid URL.   Unfortunately  it also parses URLs as relative URLs per RFC 1808  which   means a lot of strings you wouldn't expect to valid URIs (e.g. 'abc') are   actually valid according to NSURL. </pre>
