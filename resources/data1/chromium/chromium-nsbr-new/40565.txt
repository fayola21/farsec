<title>Issue 40565 -   chromium -    Change bookmarks bookmark and manager keyboard shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the keyboard shortcut for showing and hiding the bookmarks bar is   ctrl+b. Since this is a commonly-used keyboard shortcut in text areas  users   often accidentally trigger this  causing their bookmarks toolbar to   mysteriously disappear. To solve this problem  we'd like to make the keyboard   short cut less easy to accidentally trigger.    Here are the changes we'd like:  -remove ctrl+b as a shortcut in Chrome  -change ctrl+shift+b to toggle bookmarks bar  -remove shortcut for bookmarks manager  </pre>
