<title>Issue 23596 -   chromium -    browser actions: implement popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Browser and page actions should support HTML popups.  These popups would   allow a single action to contain multiple sub-actions  or provide a way of   showing some inline detailed status (buildbot  weather  tweets  etc.).    If a popup is specified  you'd show the popup rather than firing an action.    This should have menu-like focus/dismiss semantics:  - it gets focus right away  - when it loses focus  it should dismiss  - ideally  you could click and drag into the popup  have an event fire and   then dismiss (bonus feature)    Glen's original mock is attached. </pre>
