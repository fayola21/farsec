<title>Issue 35508 -   chromium -    Odd autocomplete behavior in general - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.324.0 (38745) and forward (possibly before)  URLs (if applicable) : any  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: UNKNOWN      1. Try typing the first few characters into an input field where you've   entered text before. Say before you typed &quot;Option + Click...&quot;  2. Deviate from what is in the autocomplete  such as &quot;Odd autocomplete&quot;    so after the &quot;O&quot; it starts to autocomplete the old text  but you're trying to   type something new.      You continue typing in the input box with no issues.      Watch as Chromium drops letters from the the text you type. You have to   be persistent to get out the first character from where you deviate from   the autocomplete text  typing it twice or more to clear the autocomplete   text  and keep typing what you wanted to type. </pre>
