Launch Chrome  2. Install any theme  3. Visit few webpages  4. Open new tab page  5. Delete any thumbnail on ntp    What is the expected output?   no issue seen    What do you see instead?  That thumbnail gets deleted but last thumbnail is seen twice after   deleting. On refreshing the ntp  that inactive second thumbnail is not   seen.  Issue only seen :  -if you have less than 8 thumbnails on ntp  and/or no thumbnail to replace   the deleted one  -if you have clean/new profile and only few webpages in history - no   thumbnail to replace the deleted one.  -if you have any theme installed.      Screenshot : Last thumbnail (chrome themes gallery) is seen twice. </pre>
