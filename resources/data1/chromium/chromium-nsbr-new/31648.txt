<title>Issue 31648 -   chromium -    Should fail a favicon load request if the server requests HTTP authentication. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I go to Coverity's website to download our a new  license file for Coverity:      <a href="https://www.coverity.com/FOOBAR">https://www.coverity.com/FOOBAR</a>  where FOOBAR is a path specific to us  the server  requests HTTP Basic authentication.  I enter the  username and password that Coverity gave me.  Then   Chrome requests <a href="https://www.coverity.com/favicon.ico">https://www.coverity.com/favicon.ico</a> .  The server also requests HTTP Basic authentication for  the favicon  but I don't have the username and password  (it's not the username and password for  <a href="https://www.coverity.com/FOOBAR">https://www.coverity.com/FOOBAR</a>)  so Chrome keeps popping  up the login dialog for the favicon.    Since favicon is optional  Chrome should give up if the  server requests HTTP authentication for the favicon.  We may be able to just load favicon with  the LOAD_DO_NOT_SEND_AUTH_DATA flag even though that load  flag was originally added for a different purpose.    IE and Firefox do not have this problem. </pre>
