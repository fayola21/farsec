<title>Issue 29453 -   chromium -    Layout test failures for 2 SVG gradient tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run either of the two layout tests:      LayoutTests/svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/pservers-grad-13-b.svg    LayoutTests/svg/custom/radial-gradient-with-outstanding-focalPoint.svg    Look at the produced images.  On the pservers-grad-13-b test  on the 4x4   grid of outputs:    a b c d    e f g h    i j k l    m n o p    The three times  l  o  and p do not render any blue flares at all. The   others all seem to render the blue flares slightly differently.    On radial-gradient-with-outstanding-focalPoint  the produced image shows   some diagonal stripes instead of the blue square with a white flare. </pre>
