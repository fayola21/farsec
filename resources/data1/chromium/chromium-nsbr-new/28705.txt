<title>Issue 28705 -   chromium -    &quot;Extension download&quot; warning chopped off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open <a href="http://blog.arpitnext.com/get-gpdf/gPDF.crx">http://blog.arpitnext.com/get-gpdf/gPDF.crx</a>  2. Look at &quot;Do you really want to install?&quot; warning in download shelf        Should look ok.        A few pixels on the right are chopped off.    I guess that's because |-setStateFromDownload:| changes the text on the   buttons for extensions  but doesn't adjust the size of the view (see   |buttonTweaker_| in |-awakeFromNib|).    This is pretty visible and ugly.    Andy  you wrote the code that changes the button text. Thomas  you are   very familiar with this width-based tweaking stuff. Could one of you take a   look? </pre>
