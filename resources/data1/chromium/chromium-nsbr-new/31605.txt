<title>Issue 31605 -   chromium -    Add an option to open links at the end of the tab list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature/Enhancement Request    Google and Safari handle opening new tabs differently.  Safari opens them at   the end of the tab list  and Google inserts the new tab directly to the right of   the active tab.    In general  I like the way that Chrome handles tabs  but sometimes I want to   open tabs at the end of the tab list.  Therefore  I propose the following:    - command + click: open in tab to the right of the active tab (current   behavior).  - shift + click: open tab in new window (current behavior).  - shift + command + click: open tab at the end of the tab list (like in Safari). </pre>
