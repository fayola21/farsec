<title>Issue 28689 -   chromium -    CPU profiling can't be controlled when page loops endlessly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I a web page had something like infinite loop or some very heavy calculation    the renderer is busy for all the times. And it's not possible to profile it well   since profiler needs renderer thread to do some work. </pre>
