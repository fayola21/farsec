<title>Issue 43443 -   chromium -    Add option to disable URL bar autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A                Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like   Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.29 Safari/533.4      1. Visit some site  say xkcd.com  2. Leave that site  3. Hit CTRL+L to get to the URL bar  4. Type 'x'  then enter    (Note: I have already turned off auto-search)      Go to http://x/      Goes to <a href="http://xkcd.com/">http://xkcd.com/</a>  (or whatever other site is in my history)    There should be an option to disable this behavior   thus going where I type  then allowing me to indicate  that I want the suggestion  for example by hitting  the down arrow key to specifically select the suggestion.  (Though  I can see why this option would be off by default.)  It is incredibly annoying when suggestions take precedence  over what I am actually typing. </pre>
