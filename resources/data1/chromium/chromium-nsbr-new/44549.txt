<title>Issue 44549 -   chromium -    Produce a replacement for FRIEND_TEST that would work for FLAKY  DISABLED  and FAILS tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It happens quite often that when we change the test prefixes  FRIEND_TEST declarations need to be   changed  and it causes build failures and makes the tree more red - which is the exact opposite of   what we want.    I think that making a FRIEND_TEST replacement that would friend the test with all possible prefixes   would be helpful here. </pre>
