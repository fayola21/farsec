<title>Issue 26106 -   chromium -    reorganize and clean up extension samples - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The code in test/data/extensions/samples is a mix of sample code and test   code.  We should move (and clean up) the real samples and put them in   common/extensions/samples (or common/extensions/docs/samples) and move the   tests up a directory and delete the samples dir. </pre>
