<title>Issue 34792 -   chromium -    Do not upgrade the extensions automatically! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. The old version of an extension worked perfectly.  2. The author of the extension released a new version.  3. Chrome auto-upgraded the extension without even telling me.  4. The new version is broken  totally unusable.    I've encountered this thing three times!     The user should be informed and should have a choice. If there is an update    tell me and let me decide whether to upgrade or not. Don't decide it for me   without telling me!     </pre>
