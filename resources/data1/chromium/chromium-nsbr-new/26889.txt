<title>Issue 26889 -   chromium -    Clicking on a tab without a close button closes tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.1      1. Open enough tabs so that the close button on the background tabs   disappears  2. Open 3 more tabs  3. Close foreground tab by clicking its close button  keep mouse over tab   strip (so it doesn't resize the tabs to match the width yet)  4. Mouse over a background tab (still without leaving the tabstrip) and   click its right side        Tab should activate  since it displays no close button.        The background tab is closed. </pre>
