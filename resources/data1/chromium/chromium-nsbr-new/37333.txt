<title>Issue 37333 -   chromium -    Pinned tab throbbing (when document.title changes) is way too subtle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pinned tab throbbing (when document.title changes) is way too subtle    I _never_ notice it throbbing.  For a long time I thought the feature hadn't   been ported over to the new pinned tab implementation!    When I have gmail as a pinned tab  I never notice that someone is IM'ing me.    Now  this can be a nice feature on some days  but often it is just too   problematic.  I need to know if someone is chatting with me.    Can we make this throbbing more pronounced?  It seems like it should be just   as pronounced as text changing in a normal tab.    Observed in 5.0.344.0 (Developer Build 40519) on Windows 7 (default theme). </pre>
