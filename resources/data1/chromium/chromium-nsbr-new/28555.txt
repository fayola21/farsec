<title>Issue 28555 -   chromium -    After watching fullscreen video  first Esc press is ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is fickle  so I don't have solid steps to reproduce.    After watching a fullscreen Flash video for a while  when I hit Esc to return to   normal mode  nothing happens.  Hitting Esc again works.    I can't repro by just going into fullscreen mode and immediately hitting Esc -  - that seems to work OK.  Perhaps there is some combo of pause/resumes I'm   doing that helps trigger this  but if so I haven't figured it out.  Or maybe I just   have to have watched for &gt; 20 minutes straight?  I dunno.    I've seen this on YouTube  but lately I've been watching lots of videos at   gomtv.net/classics2/vod/ and I see it there pretty frequently.  I can't recall   seeing this before quite recently  so I think it's a regression. </pre>
