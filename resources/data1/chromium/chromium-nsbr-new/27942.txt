<title>Issue 27942 -   chromium -    Pop up runs despite not opening the window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0  URLs (if applicable) : Any popup window with sound      Popups  despite being blocked  will still run in the background as if they   were open even if it does not open up into the front of the screen.  Open   up page that has a popup with music running in the background (the easiest   I have come across is <a href="http://www.klove.com/listen/">http://www.klove.com/listen/</a> just because the player   launches in a new window and is always treated as a popup).    If your speakers are on  there is music playing in the background (you may   need to configure your preferences the first time  but if you return to the   page  it will start playing).  Isn't the purpose of popup blockers to not   just prevent them from showing up but preventing them from running as well?     This occurs with flash videos and other embedded items. </pre>
