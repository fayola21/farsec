<title>Issue 42663 -   chromium -    licenses.py generates two entries for &quot;Network Security Services (NSS)&quot; in about_credits.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a minor issue.  Please feel free to mark it WonFix if  it's not worth fixing.    There are two entries for &quot;Network Security Services (NSS)&quot; in  the about:credits page (src/chrome/browser/resources/about_credits.html).  I think this is because there are two &quot;third_party/nss&quot; directories  with README.chromium and LICENSE files in our source tree:    src/base/third_party/nss    src/net/third_party/nss    Note: on Windows we also pull    src/third_party/nss  from the src/DEPS file  but that directory doesn't have a  LICENSE file.    I wonder if licenses.py can eliminate duplicates.  The  about_credits.html page is (partially) sorted  so I think this  can be done.  Alternatively  I can modify the README.chromium  files to have more specific names for each subset of NSS.    Evan  what do you suggest? </pre>
