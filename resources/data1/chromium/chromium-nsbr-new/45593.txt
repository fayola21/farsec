<title>Issue 45593 -   chromium -    IO thread blocks on loading gears.dll during browser start up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cut paste from in line comments in resource_dispatcher_host.cc:      // Ensure the Chrome plugins are loaded  as they may intercept network    // requests.  Does nothing if they are already loaded.    // TODO(mpcomplete): This takes 200 ms!  Investigate parallelizing this by    // starting the load earlier in a BG thread.    Based on one disk tracing file I analyzed  the time could be much longer when   we do session restore where disk contention exists.   </pre>
