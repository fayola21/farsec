<title>Issue 26092 -   chromium -    Client side library to emulate GLES2 on top of GLES2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Part of GL-based command buffers:    Client side library to emulate GLES2 on top of GLES2 command buffers so   client code does not have to be aware command buffers exist or shared memory.
