<title>Issue 42861 -   chromium -    &lt;audio&gt; does not support floating point formats - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> wmapro is always decoded as float.  As a step toward supporting wmapro  floating point audio needs to be supported.    The highest quality solution is to add the float type and pass it thru to  the driver.  Various buffers need to copy the correct number of bytes.  ola would need to resample with sample aware blending.  If the hardware driver fails (wave out) a fall back is needed.    floating point audio uses the range -1.0 to 1.0.   0 is centered (silence)  Some decoders will be inaccurate and produces values out of range.  If the  samples are converted to integers  clamping is required.    formats that support float audio include  wmapro and pcm in wav  mov &amp; avi </pre>
