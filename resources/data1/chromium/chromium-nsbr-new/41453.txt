<title>Issue 41453 -   chromium -    When selecting a file from the hard drive to upload  Chrome should default to the last opened folder FOR THAT PAGE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    This is a feature request  not a bug report.    I upload many files to many different web apps at work.  We use OpenX for   ad serving  Expression Engine for content management  Bronto for email   distribution  Vidego for video distribution  and many  many more web   applications for various aspects of website administration.  Each of these   is housed at a different domain or subdomain  but it gets annoying when I   go to upload an email list in Bronto  and the windows explorer dialog   starts out on our local network ad storage file server  or when I go to   upload an ad  and the dialog starts out on in our local video file server.    I can certainly see the reasoning behind it  but it especially gets   annoying when I upload an ad in one application  then a mailing list in   bronto  and then want to upload another ad on the ad server and I have to   re-navigate to the ad storage file server.  It seems that there would be   more pros than cons to have Chrome remember where the last folder was  for   a specific domain.  For instance  if I was on the ad server in one tab    then on a video server in another tab  as long as I was staying in a   certain domain  chrome would have the windows explorer dialog revert to the   last open folder for that domain.   </pre>
