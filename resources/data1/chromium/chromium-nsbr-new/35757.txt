<title>Issue 35757 -   chromium -    Resource links in the console should provide a hint to developers if the resources panel is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today  if you have an XHR request loaded in JS  a message shows up in the   console  and it includes the URL of the resource.    Trouble is  if the resources panel isn't enabled  the link won't lead anywhere.   Instead  the developer will be left wondering what had happened.    Ideally  we should fix it. </pre>
