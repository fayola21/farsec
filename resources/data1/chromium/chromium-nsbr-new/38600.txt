<title>Issue 38600 -   chromium -    Support side-by-side install on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to add support for side-by-side installs  so users can run multiple   channels.    On Windows we have added a SxS install channel ( <a title="Add side by side distribution" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35574"> issue 35574 </a> ). The SxS   channel uses the same build as Dev release  but it is installed to different   path  has different default user profile  and runs separately with current   stable/beta/dev releases.    We want to provide similar SxS package on Mac.   </pre>
