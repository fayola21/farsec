<title>Issue 42635 -   chromium -    build signing and dmg creation is a split world - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For the same reason we got a lot of the build script controls (what's collected  etc.) out of the   buildbot dir  we have similar issues with the build signing and dmg building.  Mark got the   codesigning out into the tree  but the dmg building (naming  assets  etc.) also should be moved so   things can change between releases without having to make the scripts really complex.  Best   approach is probably to but them in src-internal  and have the build collect them similar to what   linux does for their packaging. </pre>
