<title>Issue 39399 -   chromium -    dataTransfer.dropEffect not properly set on dragEnter  dragOver  drop  dragEnd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-</a>  work/multipage/dnd.html#dndevents  dropEffect should be set to certain   initial values during drag and drop processing.    Win32 trunk  Always set to none  except in dragEnd  where &quot;copy&quot; is always incorrectly   set.    Mac beta  Always set to none  except in drop  where dropEffect is correctly set (from   my limited testing).    Linux beta  Always set to none.    Other browsers:  Win32 Firefox: test page does not work.  Win32 Safari: doesn't even bother setting (dropEffect property is always   undefined) </pre>
