<title>Issue 44669 -   chromium -    Inactive user toast show n for active users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some users are being 'toasted' even though they are active chrome users.    This is because the experiment logic looks only at the last-modified-time of   the folder for the *default* profile.    In the cases I know the users are using an alternate profile via --user-data-  dir.     </pre>
