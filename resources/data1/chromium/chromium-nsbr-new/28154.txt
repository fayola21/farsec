<title>Issue 28154 -   chromium -    Mac: interaction of pinned tabs and dragging needs work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (This issue supersedes 25481. Copying over its Mstone and assigning to   myself.) From the <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32384">r32384</a> commit message:    Still to do:  - dragging/dropping tabs needs visual feedback to indicate how pinned state   will change (need input from UI team)  - on Windows  you can pin a tab by dragging it slightly to the right of the   rightmost pinned tab; this needs to be done </pre>
