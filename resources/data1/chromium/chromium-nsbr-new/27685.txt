<title>Issue 27685 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Pack extension with no manifest file should fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Create a folder  2. Go to chrome extensions management page  3. Try to Pack that folder        Since the folder is not a valid extension folder(without manifest.json  file)  chrome should prompt user with an appropriate error. Currently it  just packs the folder without any error alert..   </pre>
