<title>Issue 31859 -   chromium -    Mouse pointer hides while typing in Omnibox and bringing BMB's context menu. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is tricky to reproduce.    -Have a bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.  -Keep keyboard focus on Omnibox and keep mouse pointer on a bookmark on   the BMB.  -Type a letter in the Omnibox and then immediately click the mouse right   button ( right click should be very immediate after typing a letter in the   Omnibox)    Result:  Both Navsuggest drop-down list and BMB context menu shows up. As a result    mouse pinter hides ( not visible). If you move the keyboard focus out of   the current window  then you can notice the mouse pointer or if you   dismiss the BMB context menu  then pointer is back again.    PS: It's not a regression. </pre>
