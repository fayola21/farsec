<title>Issue 39795 -   chromium -    When double-clicking to select a word  only the word should be selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199)  5.0.364.0 (Developer   Build 42899)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.6: FAIL           IE 7: Varying  mostly FAIL           IE 8: ?      1. Double click on any word (but not a link)  2. Notice that depending on word context and underlying HTML source  you   might get either just the word  the word + one space  or the word + a line   break.  3. Optional bonus step: Copy &amp; paste  and notice you need to stay alert to   whether you get a space  newline or nothing at all.      Mark only the word and nothing more. That way the user can choose to hit   space if the word is to be part of a text. Safari 4 does like this.    Also  a user that might like a space (but never new lines?) copied might be   helped by typing their essays in a word processing software that takes care   of magic adding of spaces at the end of pasted words  like for instance MS   Word.        You sometimes get a space  and sometimes get something that looked like a   space but turns out to be a new line after you copy and paste it.
