<title>Issue 26201 -   chromium -    Missing C++ headers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : svn30269  OS + version : Fedora 11+    When compiling Fedora packages based on svn30269  I hit multiple issues  related to missing C++ headers. gcc44 is far stricter about using proper  header defines  rather than inheriting them. The attached patch resolves  all of the issues that I hit during compilation of chromium. </pre>
