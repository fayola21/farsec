<title>Issue 29139 -   chromium -    WorkerService and WorkerProcessHost need to unify SharedWorker and DedicatedWorker lifecycles for nested workers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The WebWorkers specification defines the same lifecycle criteria for all   types of workers.    Currently WorkerService and WorkerProcessHost handle the lifecycle for   shared workers and dedicated workers differently (shared workers   shutdown when their document set is empty  while dedicated workers use   a combination of pending activity notifications and checking for the sender   array to be empty).    This works fine for now  but won't work when we support nested workers   (workers will shutdown prematurely  and since dedicated workers don't   currently have a document set  they won't be able to provide a document   set to shared workers).    So we need to have all types of workers maintain a document set and use   that for their lifecycle determination before we can support nested workers. </pre>
