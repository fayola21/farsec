<title>Issue 46103 -   chromium -    Autofill: On save  do not modify and truncate phone/fax numbers  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REPRO STEPS  1. In Options -&gt; Form AutoFill -&gt; [Show AutoFill profiles] create a new profile and type in 1234567890ABCDEFGH in both the 'phone' and the 'fax' fields;    2. Click [Apply]  [Ok] and then reopen the same pop-up.    ACTUAL RESULTS  In both fields the input is truncated to 2345678.    EXPECTED RESULTS  Expected that user input will NOT be modified. Since phone/fax entries might be handled differently on different sites  maybe more sophisticated handling of these is needed. Or at least set expectations with some sort of  notification of what exactly format the data fields will be saved as.     ADDITIONAL INFO  Plain text is removed entirely. Is this desired (thinking of extensions  keypad equivalents that might constitute valid entry)? </pre>
