<title>Issue 24050 -   chromium -    Saving a page twice quickly can cause  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. save a page twice  quickly (it helps to put a sleep in   Browser::OnSavePage  although conceptually it could also happen due to a   laggy renderer)  2. browser hits multiple dchecks in BaseShellDialogImpl::~BaseShellDialogImpl()    I recently fixed this for linux: <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/243117/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/243117/show</a>    One simple fix might be to head off the second SavePage action in   TabContents::OnSavePage  but this seems to leave the opportunity for similar   bugs to creep up in the future. That is why it is not the fix I chose for   Linux. </pre>
