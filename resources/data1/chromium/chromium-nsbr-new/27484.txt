<title>Issue 27484 -   chromium -    Get rid of all app-modal dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Existing app-modal dialog boxes should be converted to tab-modal.    Now that we have notifications  the pestilence that is app modal dialog boxes   can finally be expunged.    This requires:  - creating the concept of tab modality (blocking the renderer)  - dealing with a queue of modal dialogs on a tab level  - converting all the dialogs.    Darin and I discussed this a while back. Talk to us if you want to work on   this one. </pre>
