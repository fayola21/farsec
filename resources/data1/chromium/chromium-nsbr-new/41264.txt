<title>Issue 41264 -   chromium -    about:version should include the webkit revision - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Navigate to about:version    For webkit  we have &quot;WebKit: 533.3&quot;.  It would be nice if in parentheses we included the webkit   revision that was included.    This might not be feasible since on release branches we sometimes cherry pick fixes from webkit   trunk  but the branch revision seems like it would be better than nothing (and it would be accurate   for dev channel builds).      cc-ing mentovai since I think he might have tried to do this before? </pre>
