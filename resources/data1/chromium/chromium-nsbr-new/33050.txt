<title>Issue 33050 -   chromium -    Remove ParseFTPList from credits? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3 (Official Build 36935) dev      1. Show the credits of the browser from the About dialog.      Since Chrome now uses its own FTP parsing code  I guesse ParseFTPList should   be removed from the credits.      The credits contains the licence of ParseFTPList. Is it working as intended?   Maybe still some code is used by Chrome? ;-)   </pre>
