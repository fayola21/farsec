<title>Issue 24651 -   chromium -    Window manager behavior messed up (ignores KDE theme  resize doesn't work  takes full screen) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8  Linux            Firefox 3.x: OK            I'm using KDE + IceWM + custom pixmap theme (http://www-  plan.cs.colorado.edu/henkel/stuff/2pixel/)  in case it matters. Upon   starting google-chrome  it takes over the whole screen so that I can't see   the taskbar or anything else at the bottom of the screen. There's no resize   button in the upper right  just a maximize button. Clicking this does   nothing - it stays maximized. Clicking minimized works. The theme that I'm   using is getting ignored  and instead  the ugly KDE default theme is   getting displayed - this is a minor thing. Switching to Firefox   temporarily. Sorry  this one is unusable for me  since I have to minimize   the window to access the task bar and can't have another window (e.g. a   terminal) adjacent to Firefox. </pre>
