<title>Issue 35705 -   chromium -    Extend XmlHttpRequest with getAsBinary() and sendAsBinary() methods  like in FF3 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great if the XmlHttpRequest object in Chromium could be   extended with getAsBinary() and sendAsBinary() methods  like in FF3.    This would greatly help the development of extensions that can fetch and   upload binary file from/to web services (like Google App Engine Blobstore for   example).     </pre>
