<title>Issue 30597 -   chromium -    Tab contents are not deleted when dragging a detached tab that an extension deletes on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Load the attached extension.  2.Drag and detach the newly created tab and do not release.  3.Wait 5s.      EXPECTED: The tab is deleted and the contents disappear.  ACTUAL: The tab is deleted  by the contents are still shown and can be   dragged around.      This is similar to 30595  except the tab does get deleted on mac. </pre>
