<title>Issue 42936 -   chromium -    border-radius / rounded corners redraw results in graphic artifact - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit <a href="http://flyingsaucers.butlerpc.net/Products/Colorful-Colanders_2/">http://flyingsaucers.butlerpc.net/Products/Colorful-Colanders_2/</a>  OR any page containing a DIV with -webkit-border-radius  the content of   which is loaded after the page is initially drawn (i.e. images).   2.  If the image does not have a width &amp; height attribute  the div with   rounded corners will change height forcing the browser to redraw it.  3. During the redraw of rounded corner DIV  some of the old pixels are not   erased  resulting in a graphical glitch until the user resizes the window    selects text around the glitch  or otherwise causes the screen to redraw   itself.      The entire bounds of the div should be redrawn to erase the old rendered   pixels of the DIV.      Part of the old (i.e. smaller) DIV is displayed resulting in jagged edges.    <b>Please provide
