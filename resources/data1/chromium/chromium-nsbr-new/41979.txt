<title>Issue 41979 -   chromium -    Make Mac Omnibox CnP work more like DnD - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Comment from shess in  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1671001:">http://codereview.chromium.org/1671001:</a>    Please enter a bug for someone to make AutocompleteEditViewMac::OnCopy() work  like drag-and-drop copy from other nearby places  such as the location-bar icon  or bookmark bar.  If nobody else is going to use these wacked-out routines on  Mac  omnibox shouldn't be the holdout.    (The relevant code is in the Mac Omnibox). </pre>
