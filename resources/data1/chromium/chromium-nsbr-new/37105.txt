<title>Issue 37105 -   chromium -    Provide ability to inject content scripts into chrome:// pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://newtab    I understand that the Chrome team is very careful about enabling content   scripts on chrome:// URLs; however  it allows certain chrome: URLs to be   completely replaced with extension content.  (As of this writing  newtab and   perhaps history are eligible for replacement).  I propose that extensions be   allowed to include chrome:* in their 'matches' parameters  and that this   causes Chrome to inject the content script into any chrome: URL that is   determined to be safe for modification via extension. </pre>
