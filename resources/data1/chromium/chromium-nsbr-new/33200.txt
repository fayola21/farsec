<title>Issue 33200 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame should allow beforeunload handlers on pages rendered in Chrome to cancel user initiated navigations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Webpages can have onbeforeunload handlers which can cancel user initiated   navigations.    An example is here:-  <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/demos/OnBeforeUnloadDemo1.htm">http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/demos/OnBeforeUnloadDemo1.htm</a>    Navigations are initiated in IEFRAME  which in turn invokes mshtml to   complete the navigation. mshtml invokes beforeunload and unload handlers on   the page before initiating the new navigation. The same behavior is   exhibited by Chrome where it first invokes onbeforeunload/unload handlers   before going ahead with the new navigation.    For ChromeFrame this is tricky because IE would first tear down the   existing navigation and then initiate a new navigation.    I don't think this needs to be a beta blocker though.    The original unload handler related bug is   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31853">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31853</a>     </pre>
