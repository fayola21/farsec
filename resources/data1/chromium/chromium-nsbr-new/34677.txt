<title>Issue 34677 -   chromium -    About Downloads of Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     The total is 200K/s for my connection to the Internet  when I download a   file with other download softwares like XunLei  the speed decreases. That is   not the problem  but when I close XunLei  the speed never increases as   expected. I have to find the link again  and download it again. </pre>
