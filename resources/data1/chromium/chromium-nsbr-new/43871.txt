<title>Issue 43871 -   chromium -    Cpu usage stays at 100% after a new-tab download is finished - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38    OS version               : 10.6.3            1. Open a link that triggers a download (like a pdf or a zip file) in a new tab (cmd-click  but many   links open in a new tab by default).      Chrome opens a blank page  starts the download  and keeps the about:blank tab opened.      The cpu usage of Google Chrome stays at 100%  until you close the about:blank tab that has   been opened when you started the download. </pre>
