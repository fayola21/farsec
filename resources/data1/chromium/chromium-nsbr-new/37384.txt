<title>Issue 37384 -   chromium -    Javascript: &quot;this&quot; context is lost when eval'd from external script - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   The following script passes when it executes directly within a &lt;script&gt; tag   in an HTML document  but it fails if it executes within a .js file that is   src=&quot;..&quot; referenced.    function runTest() {  var fn = function() {  window.eval('if (this == window) { alert(&quot;Context was NOT retained:  FAIL&quot;); } else { alert(&quot;Context was retained: PASS&quot;); } '); } fn.call('not   window'); } runTest();        The &quot;this&quot; context object should be retained when eval'd from an external   script  as it is when eval'd directly within a &lt;script&gt; tag.      The &quot;this&quot; context object reverts to the window object.    <b>Please provide
