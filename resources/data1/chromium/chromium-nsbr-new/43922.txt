<title>Issue 43922 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame fails to switch to chrome at times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was able to reproduce this with OptinUrls set to *. This is unrelated to   the actual problem though.     Scenario as below:-  1. Navigate to <a href="https://webbranch.techcu.com">https://webbranch.techcu.com</a>  2. Login.  3. This then takes you to an intermediate page which requests additional   info which then completes the login.    Step 2 initiates a form post request which initiates a page transition. In   the meantime chrome also sends over an open url request to the new URL   which chrome frame handles by invoking IWebBrowser2::Navigate. The BHO sets   the top level url in the navigation manager in this context.    The top level url in the navigation manager is used by the moniker patch to   decide whether to wrap the callback or not. The post request mentioned in   Step 2 also sends over the transition info to chrome which then is sent to   chrome frame to update the navigation state. Here we also have code to set   the URL in the navigation manager.    The problem occurs if the transition info is sent over after the navigation   request which overwrites the URL in the navigation manager. This causes us   to not wrap the callback thus causing us to not switch.   </pre>
