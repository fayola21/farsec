<title>Issue 37373 -   chromium -    Syncer should loop through DOWNLOAD_UPDATES until all types have no more updates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This would happen when we converge to a state where all the datatypes  are in agreement about their timestamp.  We might want to compare  the set of sync types in the routing_info with a bitmap of sync types  where we record each type that's seen a zero-update count. </pre>
