<title>Issue 44581 -   chromium -    Clearing Cookies doesn't respect exceptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.13          Hello awesome coders!  I know this is not technically a bug and more of a feature request.  kill it    but perhaps you should realize this as a new security feature.    Currently Chrome offers the following options for Cookie management:  --&gt;allow  ask  block (with exceptions)  --&gt;block all without exception  --&gt;Clear cookies and other site data when I close my browser    Why not make the removal of the Clear cookies option respect an Exception list?  Why not allow   users to add sites to the exception list.  This would allow people to by-default permit cookies    but at the end of the session it would clear them from any non-whitelisted sites.    As an example  I am an American living in Holland.  I always want Google to remember my   cookies otherwise Google will default to google.nl.  However  there is no way I can keep my   Google cookies without keeping everyone elses!  That's sorta dumb isn't it?    This seems like a oft-overlooked  old problem from the origins of cookies and mozilla and   websites.  This type of feature is lacking from all browsers.    Sure there could be an addon that does this  but this seems sorta integral to safer browsing   habits... </pre>
