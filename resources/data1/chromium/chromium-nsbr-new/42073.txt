<title>Issue 42073 -   chromium -    Chrome interaction with smart cards in Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.382.0 (Developer Build   44999) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Ubuntu Karmic Koala (9.10)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: Gnome    Behavior in Linux Firefox: OK  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): OK      1. Enter a website which requests a user certificate (which I have stored   in a PKCS#11 compliant smart card)      The browser asks you for the pin of the smart card and the authentication   is successful.      The browser does not ask for the pin and the authentication fails.    Some background and debugging...    1. I have configured NSS adding the corresponding PKCS#11 modules. Attached   the output (modutil-output.txt) of the command &quot;modutil -list -dbdir   .pki/nssdb&quot; which lists the crypto modules installed. You can see the &quot;3.   DNI-e PKCS#11 Module&quot; which is the one used by firefox to make my card   work. So NSS is configured correctly in principle.    2. When I try to list the certificates through NSS I use the following   command:   Command: certutil -L -d .pki/nssdb/   Output:  certutil-BAD-output.txt     This command shows the certificates stored in the database... As you can   see  the output is empty (no certificates returned).    3. I try to list the certificates through NSS specifying a specific crypto   token (instead of the default which is &quot;internal&quot;) with the option -h:    Command: certutil -L -d .pki/nssdb/ -h &quot;all&quot;  Output:  certutil-OK-output.txt    This command shows the certificates stored in the database specifying the   token to look at. As you can see  NOW the certutil command asks for the pin   of my smartcard and shows the certificates stored in there.    I guess chrome asks for the default token to NSS and  as it does not return   any certificate  the authentication fails.    If you need any more information which could point you to the right   direction  I would be happy to provide it. </pre>
