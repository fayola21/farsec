<title>Issue 23345 -   chromium -    Delicious.com Bookmarklet in bookmarks bar does not launch new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt; 4.0.212.1    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt; 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: correct      1. Visit <a href="http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets#chrome">http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets#chrome</a>  2. Drag &quot;Bookmark on Delicious&quot; link to the Bookmarks Bar in Chrome Mac.  3. Visit a webpage  and then click that bookmarklet you've just placed in the bookmarks bar.      The JS should launch a popup window for adding the site to Delicious.com  just as it does with   the Windows version of Chrome.      It reuses the same page instead of launching a new popup window.    This is the bookmarklet JS:    javascript:(function(){location.href='<a href="http://delicious.com/save?">http://delicious.com/save?</a>  url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)+'&amp;title='+encodeURIComponent(document.tit  le)+'&amp;v=5&amp;jump=yes'})() </pre>
