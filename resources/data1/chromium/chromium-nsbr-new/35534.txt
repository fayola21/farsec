<title>Issue 35534 -   chromium -    CSS transform upscaling issue with &lt;video&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.307.7        Safari 4: OK      Firefox 3.5: OK      Firefox 3.6: OK    Chrome seems to have an issue when upscaling (a downscaled) &lt;video&gt; element using CSS transform:   if the &lt;video&gt; element is initially downscaled (by setting smaller width/height attributes) Chrome takes the   downscaled version as base for the upscale transform (instead of the larger/original size)  the result is a   pixelated/low-quality upscaled video...    I wrote a very simple html test file that shows the issue (see attached file)  try to open it on Chrome and then   on Safari.     </pre>
