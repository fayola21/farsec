<title>Issue 40796 -   chromium -    AddressList::GetCanonicalName should walk through list to find ai_canonname - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GetCanonicalName currently only looks at the first addrinfo entry. It might   need to iterate down the list. It's unclear what behavior should be if   different entries in the addrinfo chain have different ai_canonname values.    In tests on my machine  ai_canonname was always set on the first element but   it's unclear if this behavior is always true. </pre>
