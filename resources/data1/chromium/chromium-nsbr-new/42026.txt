<title>Issue 42026 -   chromium -    Mac BMB UI review: m5 tasks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Did UI review with Cole of the bookmark bar (and folders et al).  Here are the M5 &quot;must do&quot; items.  - no border on the (empty) item when a folder is empty  - arrow icons for folders (like a menu --&gt; means &quot;there is more&quot;)  - arrow icons at top/bottom for scrolling when the menu needs to scroll  - arrow keys to change selection of a bookmark when a folder is open  - don't leak scroll wheel events to the main browser; eat them in the bookmark folder  - grow left once we hit the right side of the screen  not just &quot;pop left enuf&quot;     </pre>
