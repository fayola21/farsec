<title>Issue 36733 -   chromium -    Textarea overflow-y:hidden causes word-wrap issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a textarea with a fixed width of 470px  any height  and overflow-  y: hidden  2. Fill of the content of the textarea with a paragraph of text (first   paragraph of Lorum ipsum will do)  3. Create another textarea with the same dimensions and content  however    change overflow-y to auto      You would not expect overflow-y to affect word wrapping at all.      The textarea word wraps to the next line sooner with overflow-y:hidden    than with overflow-y: auto. The word wrapping as a result of overflow-  y:hidden leaves very large gaps  words should be able to fit there  but   they wrap for some unknown reason instead.    <b>Please provide
