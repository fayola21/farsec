<title>Issue 44223 -   chromium -    CertVerifier calls a singleton from WorkerPool thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WorkerPool threads are not joined on process shutdown.  Therefore  the   singleton may already have been deleted by the time the thread tries to   access it.  This is broken.  In particular  it looks like the singleton is   caching the MessageLoop for the IO thread.  The IO thread may have already   stopped by the time this happens  so this may crash on shutdown. </pre>
