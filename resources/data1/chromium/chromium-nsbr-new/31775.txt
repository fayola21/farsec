<title>Issue 31775 -   chromium -    Autofill classes should use return-by-const-ref for accessors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The autofill classes pervasively use a pattern like this:    class Foo {   public:    string16 member() { return member_; }     private:    string16 member_;  };    This is inefficient in code size and time compared to having member()   return a const string16&amp;.    Member accessors should return const refs where possible.  You should   continue to return by value in &quot;synthetic&quot; accessors which construct and   return temporary strings.    Note that in some cases  there are functions that may need to return an   empty string  e.g. Address::GetFieldText().  These can still be changed to   return a const ref; use EmptyString16() in place of string16() for the   empty return value. </pre>
