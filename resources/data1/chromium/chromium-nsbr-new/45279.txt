<title>Issue 45279 -   chromium -    In the Interests of your Google Chrome Service. Please Read and Respond: - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> *URGENT ATTENTION PLEASE FROM GOOGLE*    This is on going issue and can not be rectified. I have reviewed all the   same situations and comments from other GC users on your website here.    ERROR 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED)  Unable to connect to Browser. Have tried Google Chrome and Internet   Explorer 8. No Way will either work!    I have attempted many avenues to repair. My attempts last only until the   next occasion I start my computer again and then the same issue.  I have read all the comments from other GC users on your site and its the   same old story.     Hundreds of people have this problem.  Be a good provider Google and take better care of the service you provide.   GC has been good up to 20 May when this first started on my computer but it   has only got far worse and if its not going to work properly then I may as   well move over to Firefox.    I can be contacted by email to my preferred email address of:  g.shar@yahoo.co.uk    Thank you for your earliest attention and response.    Regards     Shaza Grainger.       </pre>
