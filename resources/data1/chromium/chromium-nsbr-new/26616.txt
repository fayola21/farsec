<title>Issue 26616 -   chromium -    Status bubble does not scurry out of the way of mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open a google spreadsheet with multiple sheets.  Try to click on the sheet selector at the bottom while the status bubble is   still saying &quot;Waiting for spreadsheets.google.com&quot;    Note that you can't because the status bubble is blocking them. On Windows    the status bubble moves out of the way of the mouse.    ReleaseBlock-Beta since this makes some spreadsheets unusable for long   periods. </pre>
