<title>Issue 44218 -   chromium -    Windows should be opened at their final size on Chrome OS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a new Chrome window is created on Chrome OS  there's a visible redraw   of the window's contents that appears to be caused by Chrome using a too-  small size at first.  Chrome should track the _NET_WORKAREA property on the   root window (see <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-">http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-</a>  latest.html#id2550792) and use its width and height when choosing the   initial size for new windows.    I just sent <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/2117007/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/2117007/show</a> for review to make   the WM subtract the area used by panel docks from the property. </pre>
