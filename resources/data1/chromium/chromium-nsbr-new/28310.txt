<title>Issue 28310 -   chromium -    Typing &quot;theme&quot; into the omnibox should launch the themes gallery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now it takes a few steps to get a new theme.  Typing &quot;theme&quot; into the   omnibox should have a shortcut to the themes gallery as one of the options.    Otherwise you have to do a google search  and firefox themes are the first   result.    The same applies for &quot;extensions&quot;.  Right now the suggested result is firefox   extensions. </pre>
