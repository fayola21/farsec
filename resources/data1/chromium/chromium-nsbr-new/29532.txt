<title>Issue 29532 -   chromium -    keyboard shortcut for &quot;inspect&quot; button in DevTools  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.264.0 (Ubuntu build 33819)    Currently inspect button is rather small and located in lower left corver -   that's not really convinient comparing to Firebug. But instead of just making   more bigger button I find it much more usefull to have keyboard shortcut like   ctrl+shift+f or smth.     </pre>
