<title>Issue 28758 -   chromium -    devtools should show a stack trace when an exception is thrown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you throw an exception in your javascript  the web inspector console just   prints out the description of the extension and doesn't give the stack trace.    This is particularly unhelpful if the exception is being thrown in a library   many levels removed from the source of the error in your code. </pre>
