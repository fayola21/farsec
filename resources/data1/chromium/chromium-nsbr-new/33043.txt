<title>Issue 33043 -   chromium -    Reopening a new browser session should always give the option to load previous tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.306.0 (Developer Build 36982)        Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Have a browser window open with some tabs (lets say 8). Close the   window.  2. Open a new Chrome window. On the &quot;Recently closed&quot; there is an option to   open the 8 previously closed tabs at the same time (&quot;8 tabs&quot;). Do nothing   and close the window again.  3. Open a new Chrome window. The option to reopen the 8 closed tabs is   gone.      The option to open the 8 previously closed tabs should be there.      The option to reopen the 8 closed tabs is gone.      This may not be considered a bug  since Firefox does not do it. However  it   would certainly be an improvement.   </pre>
