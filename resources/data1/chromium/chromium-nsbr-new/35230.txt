<title>Issue 35230 -   chromium -    Add timestamp list to AutofillEntry - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A single autofill entry in the web database also includes a list of  timestamps (autofill_dates table) that gets added to whenever the entry is  used on a form.  We need to add this list to AutofillEntry as  vector&lt;base::Time&gt; and populate this data in  WebDatabase::GetAllAutofillEntries().   </pre>
