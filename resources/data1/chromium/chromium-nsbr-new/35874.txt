<title>Issue 35874 -   chromium -    Need a way to make CF send full dumps when QA is testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When QA finds a crash  we only get a partial minidump.  It would make huge   difference for us if we could somehow tweak QA's environment such that CF and   Chrome send full dumps instead of a stripped down minidump.    One idea is to support an environment variable (maybe this is already   supported?) that QA could set to indicate that to breakpad that a full dump   should be sent.  There's also some function somewhere called &quot;IsHeadlessMode&quot;   that suggests that there might be support for this already but nobody knows   about it. </pre>
