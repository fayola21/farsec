<title>Issue 30615 -   chromium -    Change the way NPAPI test plugins are deployed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The plugin tests are inconsistent about how the two test plugins get into place; one is copied into   plugins (or TestShell's PlugIns directory on Mac) as part of its build step  the other is copied on   demand by the tests themselves into the appropriate location. We can't always do the former on the   Mac because the plugin needs to end up in the bundle running the tests  which would create bad   dependencies if done in the build process  so we probably want to do the latter to be consistent   everywhere.    See <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/503029">http://codereview.chromium.org/503029</a> for some background/discussion.    It wouldn't hurt to do some refactoring for getting the plugin directory as part of that  so we don't   have duplicate path construction code (which varies between Mac and Windows/Linux). </pre>
