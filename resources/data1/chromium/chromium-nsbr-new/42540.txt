<title>Issue 42540 -   chromium -    UI improvement: Add items to tab context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6 (Official Build 44316) dev      1. Create multiple tabs on various websites  2. Right-click (or control-click on mac) on a tab    A context menu appears with various actions.  The two I would most like aren't there and have to   be done in a way that is a bit awkward with multiple windows that take up nearly the whole   screen...    Please add the following to the context menu  &quot;Tear off this tab into its own window&quot;  And add a submenu &quot;Move this tab to window -&gt;&quot; and list the title of the active tab for each open   window.    Thanks for considering the request. </pre>
