<title>Issue 28311 -   chromium -    Hover states for &quot;new tab&quot; and &quot;close tab&quot; buttons in tab strip should be disabled while a window sheet is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0      1. Open a window-modal sheet (e.g. by doing Chrome-&gt;Import   Bookmarks and Settings)  2. Hover &quot;New Tab&quot; or &quot;Close Tab&quot; button        Since clicks on these buttons are ignored while the sheet is up  they should   show no hover state.        They do.    M5 P3 I guess? </pre>
