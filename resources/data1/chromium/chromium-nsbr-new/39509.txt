<title>Issue 39509 -   chromium -    Flash player 10.1 supported by IE not Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome browser does not seem to support flash 10.1.  I tested IE8 and it does   support 1080p flash acceleration with Flash 10.1.  This mainly affects lower   end graphic card such as intel GM4500.  I would like to continue use Chrome   to browse 1080p youtube contents  but need someone to look into this issue.    Thanks.   </pre>
