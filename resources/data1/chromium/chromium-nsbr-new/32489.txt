<title>Issue 32489 -   chromium -    captureVisibleTab: please support PNG - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello   I developed A WebPage screenshot extensions   (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki</a>  )    My users  writes a comments about low quality of the screenshots.  for example:(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/webpageextension/issues/detail?id=4">http://code.google.com/p/webpageextension/issues/detail?id=4</a>)    The reasons it because chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab function save the data   as a compressed JPG (low quality).  Can you change it to save it as PNG?    Also  toDataURL function of canvas element support only PNG.     Why captureVisibleTab function save the data only as JPG  and on the other   hand the function toDataURL save the data only as PNG?    Thank you.   </pre>
