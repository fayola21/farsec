<title>Issue 42419 -   chromium -    Context menus on bookmarks and bookmark bar are broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev      1. Right-click on the right-most bookmark or on the bookmark bar to the right of the rightmost   bookmark        Context menu.        Nothing.    This happens only in my chrome profile and not in my chromium profile (maybe it's a branch-  only problem?).    Does this happen to anyone else? Maybe it's clear from code inspection what could go wrong? </pre>
