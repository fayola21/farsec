<title>Issue 31087 -   chromium -    Enable FIPS support for Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Did some quick digging and it looks like Chromium/Chrome does not   currently support a FIPS compliant configuration.     Please consider adding this to one of the milestones.    Also consider adding a master password functionality to the password   manager as part of this request.  </pre>
