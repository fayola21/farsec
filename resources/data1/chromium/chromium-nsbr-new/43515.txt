<title>Issue 43515 -   chromium -    View Page Source reloads HTML rather than displaying original - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version:    Chromium      5.0.386.0 (Developer Build 45407) Ubuntu  WebKit        533.6  V8            2.2.4.2  User Agent    Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.6  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.386.0 Safari/533.6  Command Line  /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser        Firefox 3.5.5: OK      1. Open a web page whose contents will likely be different upon reloading  (e.g. a page with ads)  2. Find a snippet of text in an ad that will probably not be there if you  reload the page  3. Right-click  select View Page Source  and search for that text.        View Page Source should display the source of the currently-open page  exactly as it was fetched.        View Page Source reloads the page  meaning the content shown could be  different than what was originally retrieved.    Rationale for my expected result:    When a problem occurs on a web page at random  one may need to view the  source (the current source) to diagnose the problem.  If View Page Source  reloads the page content  it defeats the purpose.  Worse  &quot;Save As&quot; reloads  the page content as well.  In other words  if a fluke shows up in the  browser  it stays in the browser.  That's not how it should be. </pre>
