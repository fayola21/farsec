<title>Issue 29283 -   chromium -    Custom toJSON method in prototype.js library crashes Chrome extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;      I have made a zip of my extension - try to run it and press the   BrowserAction icon to bring up the BrowserAction popup. Press on  e.g.   gmail  to open it. Then press the same item in the popup again.  When you already have the page (gmail  reader  wave) open  it will not   launch a new  but instead use chrome.tabs.update to select the already   opened tab.      It will use chrome.tabs.update to make the tab selected.      The extension crashes and takes chrome down with it.    I have discovered that if i move the openURL function to another page (like   background.html) and call it with   chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage().openURL(this) it works perfectly  so i   believe it's something with popup.html that breaks chrome.tabs.update   somehow. </pre>
