<title>Issue 42222 -   chromium -    Make GenerateAuthToken asynchronous for Negotiate (possibly NTLM) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GenerateAuthToken is run on the main IO thread in a synchronous fashion.    Unfortunately  the methods it calls (such as InitializeSecurityContext)   appear to take around 250ms on my desktop  due to lots of kerberos round   trips which are issued underneath the function. My guess is the same will   happen with gssapi's init_sec_context. This may be worse for other users as   well.    Unfortunately  there's no async interfaces to the SSPI/GSSAPI calls  so   we'll likely need to establish a HostResolver style thread pool to prevent   these calls from blocking the main thread.  </pre>
