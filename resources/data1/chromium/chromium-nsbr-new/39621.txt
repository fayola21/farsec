<title>Issue 39621 -   chromium -    location.hash not working as expected on previously used anchor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.8 beta (windows)    Works in: IE8  Firefox 3.6.2  Opera 10.51  Do not work in Safari (win):4.0.5 (531.22.7)      If you have an anchor in the page... e.g. &quot;theAnchor&quot;    Then after the page has loaded you excute this javascript:    location.hash = &quot;theAnchor&quot;;    Then it works only first time in Chrome and Safari  If you by some reason want to use location.hash on an anchor that is allready set  then   it does not work.     Currently I have to use a workaround to make it work in Chrome and Safari  like this:    location.hash = &quot;&quot;; // fix to workaround bug in Chrome and Safari  location.hash = &quot;theAnchor&quot;;   </pre>
