<title>Issue 42612 -   chromium -    Simplify first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We'd like to look at dramatically simplifying the first run experience so that users   have to make less choices and they get the right things more of the time.    * move default browser checkbox on download page  * always automatically create shortcuts (they're easy to delete)  * automatically import passwords and other settings and show a &quot;Chrome has imported   your settings from $browser [OK][Clear imported settings]&quot; notification when it   completes (Do we need to block startup? If so  we'll need to do something special to   show progress)  * When there are no bookmarks  add a prominent promo to the NTP as in   http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/94_launcher/1/#01_default.png (sorry  internal only).   The promo should point to something like   http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/92_bookmarks/1/#bookmarkssync_03_import_visibility_opt  ion.png  * First run UI is reduced to the (experimental) search engine selection screen with   a prominent &quot;Welcome/install successful&quot; message on the top of the screen.    Note that this is just a sketch of a plan  please talk to chrome-ui-leads to work   through the rest of the details. </pre>
