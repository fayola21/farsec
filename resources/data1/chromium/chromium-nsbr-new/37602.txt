<title>Issue 37602 -   chromium -    Feature request: &quot;View Text Only&quot; on crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: &lt;from gcf:about:version&gt;    Related URL(s): none    Hello all     I'm here to ask to Chromium developers to add an option in the error   windows on crash.    ***Now it looks like:    (o) Chromium has stopped working  Windows can check online for a solution to the problem    -&gt; Check online for a solution and close the program  -&gt; Close the program  -&gt; Debug the program    ^ View problem details    *** I ask if it can looks like:    (o) Chromium has stopped working  Windows can check online for a solution to the problem    -&gt; Check online for a solution and close the program  -&gt; Close the program  -&gt; Try to execute in Text Only Mode  -&gt; Debug the program    ^ View problem details      *** I'm asking that because so much time important pages crash for Flash or   other reasons but I only want to get some information.    My solution for now is to open Internet Explorer and to go to the important   page  but can we figure out a temporary option for the actual page to be   open in text only  or to disable temporary the applet and application of   the page?    Thank you </pre>
