<title>Issue 35807 -   chromium -    Google chrome helper is spawning at a massive rate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : 5.0.322.2 dev mac  Other browsers tested: none      1. Starting up application  2. Using application  3. etc.    Problem:    Google chrome helper has multiple threads open (see attachments)  causes   computer to run relatively hotter than normal. I've been attempting to   figure out the root of the heat problem and I believe  since no other   applications were open and it was running very hot still  that the google   chrome helpers are causing this. What is the reasoning behind having more   than 2 helpers on at any given time?  There are two pictures because that's   how many google chrome helpers are open. </pre>
