Chrome should indicate focus on checkbox and radio buttons.       Chrome doesn't indicate focus on checkbox and radio input elements.    Note: I'm participating from two years In WebKit project  filed many bug reports  reviewed many   other bug reports  contributed bug fixes to this project and now - I'm surprised that in a   Chromium project I'm not able to reopen incorrectly closed bug report. Closed without any   confirmation or denying from other contributors. </pre>
