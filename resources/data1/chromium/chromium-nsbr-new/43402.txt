<title>Issue 43402 -   chromium -    Cannot set google.com by default when search from omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I'm in ch  I search for something from omnibar - get redirected to   google.ch  2. I click that I want google.com in English  3. Search again - still get redirected to google.ch      Have a means to specify that I prefer google.com and in English ALWAYS.  E.g. in options-&gt;basics-&gt;default search-&gt;edit-&gt;URL  but it is read-only.      I can't avoid redirecting to google.ch  it used to work before with   cookies  but no more. I think it should be a clear option not a voodoo set   of clicks.    <b>Please provide
