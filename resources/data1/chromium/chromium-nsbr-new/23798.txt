<title>Issue 23798 -   chromium -    theme toolbar image from Dots theme has two rows of alpha at the bottom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.3 (27950)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_dots.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_dots.html</a>    To see the problem:  1) Launch the Mac version  2) Apply the dots.theme from the theme gallery at   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_dots.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_dots.html</a>.  3) resize the window a bit  4) notice the black line that flies by on the download shelf as you resize. (See attached &quot;picture   6&quot;).    Cause of the problem:  Take a look at the dots.crx theme toolbar image   (agxjaHJvbWV0aGVtZXNyDAsSBEZpbGUYtsACDA). Notice that it has two lines of alpha at the   bottom of it. These alpha lines shouldn't be there. In fact this pattern is a bad pattern as the top   doesn't line up with the bottom if you were to pattern it. I have attached the bad toolbar image as   well.   </pre>
