<title>Issue 36052 -   chromium -    Crash when opening inspector on JS-disabled page while &quot;Send from Gmail&quot; is installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Javascript&quot; -&gt; &quot;Do not allow any site to run  Javascript&quot;  2. Access a web page and then launch Inspector/development tool      Though Javascript is blocked  but since Inspector is a Chrome built-in  tool  then it should work properly  this means it should show the source  code of page  but currently it shows blank.    Issue happens in Beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069). It is  even worse in latest trunk 5.0.331.0 (Developer Build 39220)  it crashes  the inspected page when in latest trunk.       </pre>
