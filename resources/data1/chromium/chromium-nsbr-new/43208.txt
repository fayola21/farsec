<title>Issue 43208 -   chromium -    Main parent Chrome process hung on first run of new Chrome beta  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta  URLs (if applicable) : was restoring abouts 35 tabs      1. Closed Chrome with about 35 tabs open  2. Installed new Chrome beta  3. When Chrome re-launched  the 35 tabs started opening (35 processes   started) but the main Chrome process was in a CPU bound loop forever.    I even clicked the close window button to shut down Chrome and while all   the tab processes exitted  the main parent process remained in the CPU   bound loop.    I used Procdump (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-</a>  us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx) to make a process dump (again  there was no   exception or crash) and uploaded the dump to:    <a href="http://www.adrive.com/public/a7886561e7ae80212426b5421d38863abadd64318e39cf">http://www.adrive.com/public/a7886561e7ae80212426b5421d38863abadd64318e39cf</a>  8c9641fce3a64ec76d.html    Please let me know when you have it so I can delete it.    NOTE: when I re-started Chrome again it all worked fine (all tabs   reopened). So this was not reproducible.  But maybe from the dump file you   can determine why it was stuck.    Thanks   </pre>
