<title>Issue 35070 -   chromium -    Matching mime-types in content scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78     Im am openig this ticket as requested in  <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/a9dae4e08c3ebee8/">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/a9dae4e08c3ebee8/</a>      Looking at a number of Chromium extensions  it seems to be a standard use  case to &quot;register&quot; an extension for a specific content-type (e.g.  application/atom+xml  or application/json). Currently it seems that content  scripts can only match a certain URL scheme and then analyse the content   which is from a performance perspective not optimal.    I am not an expert in the Chromium architecture  but I could imagine  several options:  - Extending the &quot;matches&quot; part for content scipts to also include the mime-type  - Giving extensions in general access to the response metadata including  headers.
