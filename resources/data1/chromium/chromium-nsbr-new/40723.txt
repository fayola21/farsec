<title>Issue 40723 -   chromium -    download on new win7 machine goes to the wrong directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Chrome 4.1 on a new win7 machine  I downloaded a file and it put it in   &quot;C:UserserikkayMy DocumentsDownloads&quot; instead of &quot;Downloads&quot;.  When I   checked the Under the Hood options it claimed it was actually set to   &quot;C:UserserikkayDocumentsDownloads&quot;.  However  neither of those   directories is correct.  The right directory is &quot;C:UserserikkayDownloads&quot;.   </pre>
