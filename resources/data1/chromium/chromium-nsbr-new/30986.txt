<title>Issue 30986 -   chromium -    Using space to select from drop down does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0    Other browsers tested: Firefox  Epiphany        Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Go to a URL that contains a drop down that contains a selection that has   space (i.e. a full name)  2. Start typing on the drop down.      The choice that contains the space should be selected when typing it   including the space.      When you get to the space character  the drop down just drops down instead   of selecting your choice. </pre>
