<title>Issue 44700 -   chromium -    Silverlight plugin_test fails on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the Silverlight plugin_test enabled locally  it's hitting NOTREACHED() in NPNVPluginElementNPObject. It's odd that it's failing  since we don't know of any problems like this   with Silverlight content in the wild. </pre>
