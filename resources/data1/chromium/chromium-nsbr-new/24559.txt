<title>Issue 24559 -   chromium -    When caret is in omnibox  switching tab selects all text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8      1. Start typing a query into the omnibox  2. Switch to another tab to look up a word that you want to search for  3. Switch back to first tab and type that final word you just looked up and   hit enter        chrome should search for the whole query.          After 3  the whole text in the omnibox is selected  so that the start of the   query is overwritten.    This feels like an unintended change caused by the &quot;single click selects all&quot;   change? </pre>
