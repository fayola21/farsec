<title>Issue 34993 -   chromium -    page_cycler_moz and page_cycler_intl1 bot failing on mac official builder due to timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pulling in the folks from <a title="Mac startup perf regression" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34926"> bug 34926 </a>    Recently the builds on the mac official builder started failing via timeout the   page_cycler_moz and page_cycler_intl1 tests.  Given the perf issues we're also   seeing on Chromium builds  I'm hoping it's something related.  But something   has slowed things down to cause these tests to fail. </pre>
