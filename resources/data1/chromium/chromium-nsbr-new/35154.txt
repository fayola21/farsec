<title>Issue 35154 -   chromium -    page_cycler tests don't always paint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you watch the page cycler tests  especially on a slower machine (2 cores)    it's clear we don't actually get enough cycles to paint the browser window.   this sorta makes our timing data questionable.  We should be forcing the   bitmap all the way to the screen instead of just doing an inval and letting the   event loop cycle back around. </pre>
