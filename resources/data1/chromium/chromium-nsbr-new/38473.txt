<title>Issue 38473 -   chromium -    Crashed plugin infobar should go away for all tabs after user dismisses it in one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Let's say I have 4 tabs open  all using Flash.  If Flash crashes  I don't   want to have to close the infobar in all tabs.  It seems that closing it in   one should close it in all others.    Glen/Glenn: what do you think? </pre>
