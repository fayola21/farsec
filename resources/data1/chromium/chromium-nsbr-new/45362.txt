<title>Issue 45362 -   chromium -    Please use CFAllocatorGetContext instead of mucking around in private state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The issue fixed in <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/2131010">http://codereview.chromium.org/2131010</a> (CFAllocator changing between OS   releases and breaking the direct access of its ivars) is pretty much certain to occur again in future OS   releases.    This puts people working on CF in the very uncomfortable situation of deciding between progress   for the OS as a whole  and not breaking Chrome. Please use API? :D    The relevant file is <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/base/process_util_mac.mm?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/base/process_util_mac.mm?</a>  view=markup </pre>
