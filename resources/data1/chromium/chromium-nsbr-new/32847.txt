<title>Issue 32847 -   chromium -    Text + icon notifications should more gracefully handle large titles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am trying to display the source of a chat message in a notification (i.e.   &quot;Chat from atwilson@chromium.org&quot;. If the source is long (e.g. &quot;atwilson-is-  super-great@chromium-is-the-best-browser.org&quot;) the title overlaps the body    text making it illegible.   </pre>
