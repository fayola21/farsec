<title>Issue 31227 -   chromium -    Please add support for vertical tabbing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL    Hi     One of the hottest features of Firefox right now is the tab sidebar (see   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6535">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6535</a>). It is also present on   Omniview browser for Mac.    This create a list of tabs with a preview image on the left of the browser.     Allow me to make my case:    Nowadays most (if not all) new laptops have a widescreen. This means that   vertical space is precious and there is horizontal space to spare.   By keeping the list of tabs on the left (or right)  there is considerable   space saving on the top bar.     Keep in mind that if you are web browsing on a widescreen which has more   than 1024 pixels of width  you either:  a) have 2 big stripes of whitespace at each side (see www.facebook.com)  b) have very wide lines which make reading on the screen very tiring    forcing the user to reduce window width (see www.wikipedia.com)  c) have no problem  since the website is designed for widescreens  -   currently still a pity minority on the web (see www.w3.org)    This is a killer application for anyone with a widescreen  especially if on   a low resolution one with little vertical space.     ... and the only major issue keeping me from dumping Firefox completely.    Regards and thank you for your patience     </pre>
