<title>Issue 30202 -   chromium -    Loading an unpacked extension from a path with non roman characters fails or crashes the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version - 4.0.266.0  Platform - Windows Vista Home Premium SP 1 (Classic theme).      1. Put an unpacked extension in c:_��_someextension  2. Try to load it using the &quot;Load unpacked extension...&quot; in   chrome://extensions.      The extension will load.      ---------------------------  Extension error  ---------------------------  Could not load extension from 'C:_��_someextension'. Manifest file is   missing or unreadable.  ---------------------------  OK  ---------------------------    In a few cases (when I changed the manifest in some unknown ways that   cannot be reproduced currently)  it crashed instead.      In my case  I simply tried to put it in the directory of Chrome and it was   under the user profile with Hebrew letters in the name.  The same will happen if you put the extension in the Desktop folder under   this profile. </pre>
