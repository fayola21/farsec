<title>Issue 23915 -   chromium -    System font &quot;Fixedsys&quot; won't load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version  4.0.220.1    &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    On Windows (at least Vista)  create a basic HTML page and include the  following CSS definition:  font-family: fixedsys  arial  monospace;    &gt; What is the expected result?    Fixedsys should be used  as it is installed on this machine. Browsers like  Firefox handle this fine.    &gt; What happens instead?    Chrome uses the fallback font Arial (I just included arial for sample  purposes here). Perhaps it being a special system font confuses Chrome.  Chrome also doesn't have the font in their monospace font preferences  options dialog. </pre>
