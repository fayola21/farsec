<title>Issue 26801 -   chromium -    User scripts not installed depending on download settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User scripts will not be installed  if &quot;Ask where to save each file before   downloading&quot; is checked at Options &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Downloads.    In that case  confirmation of install is not displayed on the Download shelf   and the *.user.js file is just downloaded as a file.  Tested with Developer Build 31081 on WinXP. </pre>
