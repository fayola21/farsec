<title>Issue 34808 -   chromium -    Auto-updating extensions should not convert to internal extensions on update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install an external extension (ie. v1.0) that has an update_url (updates   from a server).  2. Trigger an update to (v1.1).    The extension is now no longer an external extension  I suspect (although I   haven't looked too closely) because ExtensionsService::UpdateExtension is   calling CrxInstaller::Start with a hard-coded location of   Extension::INTERNAL  whereas it could instead ask the extension for the   location before the update and pass that in.    This might also cause the extension (v1.0) to reinstall after the user has   uninstalled it  since the external extension definition is still there.    This also needs a unit test. </pre>
