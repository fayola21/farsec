<title>Issue 25850 -   chromium -    Group extensions on chrome://extensions page  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the chrome://extensions page  we currently list extensions  alphabetically. I think we should split them into three groups:    * unpacked extensions at the top (in active development)  * other active extensions next  * disabled extensions at the bottom    We should also add section headers to distinguish these (ask Kansinee for  mocks). This will make the list more usable for both developers and users. </pre>
