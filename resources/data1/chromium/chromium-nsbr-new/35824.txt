<title>Issue 35824 -   chromium -    Bad Debian package dependencies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.322.2-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38810">r38810</a>    This Debian package update added a dependency on the &quot;lsb&quot; package  which is   a metapackage and overkill for Chrome's needs and leads to installation of a   vast number of packages that I don't need such as Qt3 and Qt4.    I think you probably meant lsb-graphics or something similar. </pre>
