<title>Issue 44980 -   chromium -    Browser is frozen when showing the HTTP POST repeat warning and no mouse is used. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Offizieller Build 47796) beta        Firefox 1...3: OK         IE 4...8: OK     Opera 8...10: OK      1. Go to a website that submits an HTTP POST form and doesn't redirect in   its response. (Some login or search sites may work.)  2. Press F5 or the reload button to reload the page.  3. The HTTP POST repeat warning message appears over a darkened web page.        While I can click the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; buttons with the mouse  I cannot use   *any* keyboard hotkey in this situation. Neither Enter nor Escape    Left/Right  Tab  not even Alt+F4 or Alt+Space are functional now. In case   you don't have a mouse available  you're lost then. And even with a mouse   it would be extremely helpful to be able to just hit some keyboard button   to continue  like in any other browser.   </pre>
