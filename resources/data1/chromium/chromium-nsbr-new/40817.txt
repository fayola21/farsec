<title>Issue 40817 -   chromium -    HTML notifications placed offscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps to reproduce:    1) Go to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/samples/notifications/quick/">http://www.html5rocks.com/samples/notifications/quick/</a>  2) (Click the &quot;Set notification permissions for this page&quot; button near the   end of the page to make sure the page can display notifications)  3) Click Example 1  &quot;Show HTML Notification&quot;.  4) Note that the notification isn't visible on the screen.  5) Type a twitter name in Example 2  (ie &quot;mikepinkerton&quot; or &quot;bengoodger&quot;)   and click &quot;Show tweets&quot;  6) Note that the simple notifications display. Sometimes the HTML   notification shows  too.    I can repro this on both Windows and Linux  so OS-All. This worked last   week before I went on vacation so I think this is a fairly recent   regression. </pre>
