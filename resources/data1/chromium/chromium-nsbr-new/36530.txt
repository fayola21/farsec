<title>Issue 36530 -   chromium -    URL input absorbs japanese input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome dev 5.0.322.2  URLs (if applicable) : any  OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.2      1. put cursor on URL   2. type any Japanese letters    * What is the expected result?  being able to type japanese and change it to kanji chars.    * What happens instead?  typed japanese chars vanishes before changing them into kanji chars.  Looks like it's trying to auto complete inputs. </pre>
