<title>Issue 24170 -   chromium -    Text input do not use windows look and feel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. This is most obvious on Windows Vista or Windows 7 since text fields don't   have hover nor focus state in XP  2. Go to a page that has a textarea or an input[type=text]  3. Hover the text field  4. Focus the text field    What is the expected output?     The border colors of the text field should be blue. Focused but not hovered   should be a slightly darker blue.    What do you see instead?    No change in the visual representation   </pre>
