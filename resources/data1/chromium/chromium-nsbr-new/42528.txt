<title>Issue 42528 -   chromium -    Chrome/Chromium caches negative DNS responses and ignores changes to /etc/resolv.conf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.19 (Official Build   45417) dev  Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Ubuntu luvid  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: GNOME  URLs (if relevant): none  Behavior in Linux Firefox: never tested  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): irrelevant    It seems that Chrome/Chromium    a). Caches negative DNS responses. Repro:  1. My network didn't work  2. I tried to open a wikipedia page - DNS name couldn't be resolved   (DNS::Not resolved error or sth similar)  3. I reestablished IP connectivity  4. I tried to open wikipedia page - the error was the same - DNS problem  5. I restarted chrome  everything was back to normal    b). Caches /etc/resolv.conf file. Repro:  1. I sometimes establish a VPN connection with a tool which changes   /etc/resolv.conf file  2. When the /etc/resolv.conf has been change  chrome keeps sending DNS   requests to old DNS servers. As the VPN has been activated (or deactivated)   DNS servers cannot be reached  the web browsing doesn't work    I believe that it is an UNIX standard to read and evaluate /etc/resolv.conf   each time a DNS request is made. Caching /etc/resolv.conf content is a   disputable practice  leading to problems as described above. </pre>
