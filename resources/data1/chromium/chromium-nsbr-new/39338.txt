<title>Issue 39338 -   chromium -    &quot;Connect with Facebook&quot; causes popup window to continuously grow horizontally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Chrome version info at the bottom)    When going to a website that implements Facebook Connect  such as digg.com    the windows that pops up allowing you to enter your Facebook credentials   continuously grows horizontally until it reaches the edge of the screen and   then stops.    Steps to reproduce:  1) First  make sure you are logged out of Facebook. No facebook cookies   should exist.  2) Go to www.digg.com  3) Click &quot;Connect with Facebook&quot; at the top of the page next to the Digg   logo.  4) Sometimes an intermediate window will pop up with another &quot;Connect with   Facebook&quot; button  click this if it appears  otherwise proceed to #5  5) The facebook login prompt will pop up in a new  smaller window  and will   continuously grow horizontally until it hits the edge of the screen.    Expected behavior:  The pop up window should not resize automatically over time. It should   remain at its initial size until manually resized by the user.
