<title>Issue 33209 -   chromium -    Extensions directory emptied - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3 (Official Build 36935) dev                    I'm not sure how to reproduce it  or if it was a one off problem.  3 things   happened and I don't remember in which order:  - I updated to the latest Chrome.  - I cleared all my cookies.  - My XP PC crashed.  After those 3 events  my extensions directory was empty.  The icon space   was still reserved (but without icons) and I had to reinstall all my   extensions.    I'm filing this more to keep track of it and see if others are having   similar issues.   </pre>
