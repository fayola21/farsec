<title>Issue 24600 -   chromium -    Move visited link methods on WebView into the WebKit API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Move visited link methods on WebView into the WebKit API    This involves finding a home for these methods in the WebKit API:      WebView::UpdateVisitedLinkState    WebView::ResetVisitedLinkState    This could either be accomplished by moving these into WebKit.h  or we could   transfer them to WebView.h.  Since other visited link related methods exist   on WebKitClient  it might be best for these to be on WebKit.h.  However  it   sucks to add more clutter to that file.  Hmm... </pre>
