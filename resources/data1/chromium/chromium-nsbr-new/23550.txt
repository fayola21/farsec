<title>Issue 23550 -   chromium -    clean up grd files and some GRIT issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The IDS_* value has no meaning when things go the the TC.    The desc=* goes to the TC as something readable  but it doesn't go into   the hashed id that TC uses.    we have a bunch of strings that all have the same value (eg- Close)  but   different IDS_ and desc= values  so the intent was there to provide a   &quot;context&quot; so things could be translated differently as needed.  But the truth   is they end up hashing as a single value on the TC  so we only support one   value (and who know which description goes with it).    This bug serves to capture this  and hopefully hang future clean up bugs   off off.  Things we should look at doing as tasks after this release:  - Collapse the number of &quot;Close&quot;  &quot;Cancel&quot;  &quot;OK&quot;  strings down to have   common ones and only provide new ones where really needed.  - See about making GRIT catch/report when it's collapsing strings because   odds are it's not what was intended.   </pre>
