<title>Issue 25255 -   chromium -    Gogo Wi-Fi (used by Virgin America) should list Chrome as one of the supported browsers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Virgin America uses Gogo for its in-flight Wi-Fi.    On this page   <a href="http://www.gogoinflight.com/jahia/Jahia/site/gogo/cache/offonce/customerCare/">http://www.gogoinflight.com/jahia/Jahia/site/gogo/cache/offonce/customerCare/</a>  deviceMatrix;jsessionid=1B73E8A13394FEC518C1BFC8A002BC53.jvm2    it currently only lists IE  FF  and Safari as &quot;supported laptop browsers&quot;.      (The Wi-Fi works fine with Chrome  I tried it on my last flight.) </pre>
