<title>Issue 25285 -   chromium -    Track memory usage of extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A few team meetings ago  we suggested that it'd be good to add some perf  tests that measure the memory consumption over time of a few extensions  (empty one  simple one  etc.). This would make sure we caught any  regression in this.    I'm adding this to the beta release blocker list so we make sure to look at  it  but I'm fine with it not being on there. </pre>
