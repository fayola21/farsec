The window is now blank.  8.  Re-sizing the window will display the PDF.    Similar issue when left clicking on the link or right clicking a selecting   open in a new tab.  The only difference is that the screen is not refreshed   (the original web site is still visible) until the Chrome Window is re-  sized.      The PDF document should be immediately displayed after loading or   refreshing.      The PDF is not displayed.  Either a blank window is shown  or the original   web site is shown.    <b>Please provide
