<title>Issue 27400 -   chromium -    Long lived connections are being dropped by some network setups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug has been forked from <a title="some http requests take many seconds or minutes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16367"> issue 16367 </a>.  Refer to that bug for historical   information.    Summary:  If the server supports HTTP keep alive  then Chromium will keep around an   idle socket for up to 10 minutes.  After the first HTTP response completes   and the socket goes idle  the server sends TCP keep alive packets  which the   host OS will ACK.  It appears that in certain network setups (the Google   Reston office for example)  after a certain period of time (128~ seconds at   Reston) the network will start dropping all packets for the connection.    Wireshark dumps indicate that the client does not receive anymore packets   from the server for this TCP connection.  If Chromium tries to send any more   data over this TCP connection (if the user browses to the same host again and   requests non-cached data)  the TCP packets do not seem to make it out to the   server.  We conclude this because the server replies with neither ACKs nor   RSTs.  The host OS tries a number of TCP retransmits before sending a TCP RST   and closing the socket connection.  At this point  the OS sends an error to   the application (Chromium)  and the Chromium network stack will open a new   socket connection to handle the request and that will succeed.  User visible   symptoms are a spinning throbber for a few minutes until the OS gives up on   the TCP connection and returns an error to Chromium  after which a new   connection will be opened and Chromium will successfully download and display   the page.    TODO:  Compare Chromium network behavior to Firefox &amp; Safari using wireshark.    Determine if there's a way we can prevent the network from killing long lived   TCP connections (perhaps with client-side TCP keepalives?).  Otherwise    consider keeping idle sockets for a shorter amount of time  although we   should run A/B experiments to make sure performance isn't adversely affected. </pre>
