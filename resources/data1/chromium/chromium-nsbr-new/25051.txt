<title>Issue 25051 -   chromium -    possible cookie or redirect problem on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version = 4.0.222.5 (mac)    1. log in to the corp network using vpn  2. go to a page protected by the &quot;Many internal apps. Another login page.&quot;   roadblock (I tried to get to perf/)  3. type in correct password    At this point you are taken back to that page. I can't get to the site I need   to get to. If I type in the wrong password  I end up at that page with the   expected &quot;Password not recognized.&quot; error message in red.    Safari and Firefox work properly.    I suspect some problem with cookies or redirects. I saw a few open bugs   on related issues. I'm not sure if this is related or not. </pre>
