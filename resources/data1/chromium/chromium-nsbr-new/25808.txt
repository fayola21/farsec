<title>Issue 25808 -   chromium -    Scrolling affects multiple windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  4.0.223.8    OS version               : 10.5.8      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't run Chrome for Windows.      1. Open two windows to any page with more than one screen of content.  2. Stack the windows.  3. Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys to scroll.  4. Note that when scrolling quickly that the bottom window scrolls too    even though it doesn't have focus.        Only the top window should scroll.        Both windows scroll.   </pre>
