<title>Issue 23967 -   chromium -    NNTP: Recent Activites drop-down list should be closed  after window is opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.221.6 (Official Build 28091)    Looks like the <a title="NNTP: Recent Activites drop-down list should be closed  after window is opened." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15503"> issue 15503 </a> is back !    Filing this as a new issue  as it has slightly different repro steps than  the previous one.    -Open two windows with more than one tab each and exit chrome.  -Relaunch Chrome.  -Click on the first entry of the 'Recently Closed' section.    Result:  New window is opened  but the drop-down list of the next entry(of 'Recently  closed') in the NNTP of the first window is shown.    PS: If Step 3 is performed with return key  then the issue is not reproducible.   </pre>
