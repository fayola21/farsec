<title>Issue 27816 -   chromium -    Reduce image sizes in extensions debugging tutorial - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of the images in   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/tut_debugging.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/tut_debugging.html</a> are   very wide and take too long to download. I need to either scale them to 300 or   500 pixels wide  or take other steps (cropping or reformatting) to reduce their   width and file size. </pre>
