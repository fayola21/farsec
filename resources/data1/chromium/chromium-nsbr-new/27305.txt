<title>Issue 27305 -   chromium -    Really bad scrolling performance on 24ways.org - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29903)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://24ways.org/">http://24ways.org/</a> (any page on this site)      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open <a href="http://24ways.org/">http://24ways.org/</a>  2. Scroll  with the mouse or keyboard or scrollbar      Scrolling in real time      The page doesn't scroll for 2-3 seconds  and the CPU usage goes way up   while presumably trying to render the viewport.     IIRC this page uses lots of transparent elements  and the blending (in   skia?) might be a possible cause. </pre>
