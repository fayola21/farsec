<title>Issue 33185 -   chromium -    SDCH recover/reload message should be more descriptive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a site claims to support SDCH content encoding  but then sends a non-  SDCH payload (from the supported path)  then Chromium disables SDCH to that   site to some extent  and does a meta-refresh reload.      That meta-refresh includes a message telling the user merely that:    &quot;An error occurred. This page will be reloaded shortly. Or press the   &quot;reload&quot; button now to reload it immediately.&quot;    Usually  the user can't see this message  as it vanishes so quickly with a   reload.  In some cases  when the content is marked as cacheable  the   message remains visible.    The message should be enhanced to clearly state that the cause was a   problematic load of SDCH encoded content.  It should indicate why it was   expecting SDCH encoded content  by reporting:    a) What applicable dictionary was being suggested as available.  b) What the requisite path was for using the dictionary.  c) What the requisite domain was for the dictionary.      I need to also look at the recovery algorithm  and see if this case can be   detected  and better handled (as I'm writing this bug  it seems a bit   strange to me that reload didn't work  even if the content was cacheble  as   the reload should have been placed with SDCH support  and the message   should not have shown for the reload.... hmm).    In any case  this bug's resolution with a more descriptive message (when   all else fails) will help users and webmasters diagnose the problem more   swiftly. </pre>
