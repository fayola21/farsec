<title>Issue 35202 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Self notify extension when the extension is installed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev                  Feature: A way for an extension to tell if it was just installed.    Use cases:   1. To open an instructions page when the extension is first installed.   2. To initialize default values in localStorage.    Workaround:  1. On extension load  run initialisation code and set a flag in  localStorage. The flag tells the extension to not run the initialisation  code on subsequent runs. Problem is that the flag gets cleared on deleting  cookies (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33019">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33019</a>)   </pre>
