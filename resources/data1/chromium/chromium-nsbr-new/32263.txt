<title>Issue 32263 -   chromium -    Regression: Keyboard shortcuts stopped working with e.g. the Hiragana layout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36221">r36221</a> (past 4.0.2881)      1. Switch to the Hiragana layout  2. Hit cmd-t        Tab should open.        It doesn't.    Works fine in the current dev channel (288.1).    I didn't touch the keyboard code in quite a while. Does anybody have an   idea where this might come from? </pre>
