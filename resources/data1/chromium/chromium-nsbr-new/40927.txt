<title>Issue 40927 -   chromium -    Not all tabs shown in taskbar preview windows in Windows 7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev            Firefox 3.x: FAIL             IE 8: OK      1. Hovering over the Chrome icon in the Windows 7 taksbar.      When hovering over the Chrome icon in the Windows 7 taskbar  the preview   window should contain previews of all the tabs opened (as it did in version   5.0.366.2).      It shows previews of only the current tab of the opened window(s) and not   of all the tabs (in all the windows). </pre>
