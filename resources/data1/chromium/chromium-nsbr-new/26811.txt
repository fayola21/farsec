<title>Issue 26811 -   chromium -    positioning of context menu is weird - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> when you press the menu button it pops up the context menu in a weird   location. Windows: top left of render view. Linux: next to mouse. Instead it   should show it by the focused element. </pre>
