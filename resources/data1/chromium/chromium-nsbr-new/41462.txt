<title>Issue 41462 -   chromium -    Mac Chrome will not send loseFocusEvents to NPAPI plugins using the Carbon event model - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  5.0.373.0 (44080)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK    Run a classic NPAPI plugin using the Carbon event model. Click on the plugin. Chrome will send it a   getFocusEvent. Click on the URL bar. Chrome should now send a loseFocusEvent to the plugin but   no event is sent. At Unity  we use these events to implement our own input handling. If we don't get   them  input is still processed  when the plugin does not have focus. This is annoying at best  when   the user types into the URL bar  and the plugin responds to his keystrokes  and a security issue at   worst  as somebody could abuse this to  write a key logger. </pre>
