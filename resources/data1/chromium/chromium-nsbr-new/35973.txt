<title>Issue 35973 -   chromium -    Menu bar should be visible if a non-fullscreen (non-popup) window is frontmost  even if a fullscreen window is in the background - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go fullscreen  2. Cmd-N        Menu bar visible.        Menu bar hidden.    This is also important because of spaces. It's weird if you have a normal   window and no menu bar just because there's a fullscreen window on a   different space.
