<title>Issue 34093 -   chromium -    Thumbnails not rendering properly when coming out of zoom state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:  ------  5.0.307.1 dev        1.Open chrome browser  2. from the current page menu select zoom option - larger (couple of times.)  3. Ensure it zooms the current page view.  4. From the zoom menu - select zoom -normal         It should zoom out of the view and thumnbnails should be rendered properly.  Instead thumbnails overlap with each other.    Note: For some reasons . the issue doesnt happens when we zoom in /out  using key board shortcuts  but only happens when we perform above steps  from current page menu.        please refer to the screenshot   </pre>
