<title>Issue 42440 -   chromium -    [mac] notifications bring chrome to the foreground on a click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. On Mac  create a desktop notification  2. Switch to a different process than chrome.  The notification will still  be on top.  3. Click on the notification.        You would expect not to return to the Chrome process  but instead you do  return to it by clicking on the notification.     </pre>
