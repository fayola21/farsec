<title>Issue 44687 -   chromium -    Need to improve keyboard input for RenderViewTests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following tests need better support for different keyboard layouts on   Linux in order to get full usefulness out of them:    RenderViewTest.OnHandleKeyboardEvent  RenderViewTest.InsertCharacters    This will be hard though  because AFAICT GTK doesn't allow you to change the   keyboard layout for a single program (you must change it for the whole   screen)  which could have interesting side effects on the machine running   the test (be it a buildbot or local dev machine)  and would bring in   additional language pack dependencies. In light of this  the bug may not be   actionable  but I have opened it to track the issue. </pre>
