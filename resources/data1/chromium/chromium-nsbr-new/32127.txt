<title>Issue 32127 -   chromium -    Chrome sometimes gets stuck thinking that it's focused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In 4.0.294.0  I'm seeing issues with panel titlebars sometimes remaining in   &quot;focused&quot; state (i.e. bold text and blue background) even after they've lost   the focus.  I see this when I open a panel  switch to an xterm  and then   click on the panel (to focus it) and the xterm (to focus it instead) -- the   panel titlebar doesn't get updated.      I think I see the (tiny) problem  so I'll send you a patch after I test it    Dave.  This probably affects non-Chrome-OS Linux builds as well (in the form   of the custom frame not getting updated if you focus a different app). </pre>
