<title>Issue 43482 -   chromium -    sad-tab showing briefly on startup  particularly cold start - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 6.0.397.0      1. Ensure that GCF is starting cold  helps if disk is slow (e.g.  in a VM)  2. Start IE  3. Visit a page known to use GCF  e.g. vimeo.com        GCF should display a blank white screen while startup is in progress.        A brief flashing of the sad-tab background  followed quickly by page   content. </pre>
