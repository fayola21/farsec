<title>Issue 27451 -   chromium -    tinyprints.com doesn't support chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> trying to personalize your order  you get a &quot;browser is not supported&quot;   warning.    Click on any product category (e.g.  the holiday card set)  then a product  and   then click on the big &quot;personalize&quot; button in the top right corner.    I actually know the eng mgr at this company and hassled him about this; he   said it's on their to-do list to certify us. </pre>
