<title>Issue 24085 -   chromium -    External protocol dialog should have &quot;remember my choice&quot; checkbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> IDS_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL_CHECKBOX_TEXT defines the text for the &quot;remember my  choice&quot; checkbox for the external protocol dialog. As of yesterday (when I  implemented the Mac version) the Windows and Linux/GTK versions of that  dialog do not have that checkbox. They should. </pre>
