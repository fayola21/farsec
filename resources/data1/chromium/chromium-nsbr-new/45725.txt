<title>Issue 45725 -   chromium -    Tabs resize after closing too quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: ?    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: ?           IE 8: ?     Chrome 4.x: OK      1. Open too many tabs to fit into the top bar without resizing  2. Close one around the middle      Tabs shuffle down but dont resize so you can keep clicking to close   multiple without having to find the new 'X' button each time. They then   resize after ~1 second. This is what has always happened in previous   versions of Chrome.      Tabs move down and resize instantly  meaning you have to find the next 'X'   button each time  vastly slowing the process.   </pre>
