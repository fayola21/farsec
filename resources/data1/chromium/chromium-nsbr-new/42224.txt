<title>Issue 42224 -   chromium -    Omnibox stops working properly if homedir temporarily goes away - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use Chrome on NFS  have NFS cut out and then restore  2. type some text into omnibox      Expected: inline autocomplete.  Actual: &quot;Things I type into my Omnibar always run as a search. It may flash   the auto-complete domain for a second or so  but changes immediately to   search&quot;    Affects many Googlers.  I think we can fix this if we can repro it.  It might be sufficient to just   move the profile to the side while running.  If not  maybe we can play   tricks with a loopback file system. </pre>
