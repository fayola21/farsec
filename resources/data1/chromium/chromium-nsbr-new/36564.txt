<title>Issue 36564 -   chromium -    Got 8 extension permission warnings after I restart my chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   none      I haven't restart my chrome for a while  but after I restarted  I noticed I   got 8 warnings from different extensions about the permission immediately.   Shouldn't the auto update happen when the chrome is running? It is strange   that 8 extensions pop-out warnings at the same time? Wasn't is because the   update was stuck in my old browser?    My browser version is: linux  5.0.307.9 beta      Let me know if you need some extra info from my machine. </pre>
