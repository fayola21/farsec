<title>Issue 41583 -   chromium -    Sandbox host message is larger than kMaxFontFamilyLength - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.376.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/br407/">http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/br407/</a>                  1. Scroll down to BASKING_RIDGE_NJ's comment thread (&quot;a house for that   creature&quot;).  2. Scroll a little bit more.      I expect to be able to scroll through the rest of the page.      The tab freezes and stops scrolling. </pre>
