<title>Issue 29135 -   chromium -    About:version is not restored properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.22 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33427">r33427</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open about:version in Chrome in a new Tab.  2. Close the tab.  3. Open an new tab.    Expected:  about:version should not be in the recently closed list since clicking on it   will just open a blank tab.    Actual:  about:version is in the recently closed list and opens a blank page.   </pre>
