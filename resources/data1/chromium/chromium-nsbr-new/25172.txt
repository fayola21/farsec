<title>Issue 25172 -   chromium -    Debugger fails to report what the error is that caused it to stop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open JavaScript console in Chrome.  2. Open attached error1.html or error2.html.        Expected:  Debugger stops and reports error message in console.    Actual:  Debugger stops but does not report error message in console.    For both test cases  Safari's debugger properly reports the errors.   </pre>
