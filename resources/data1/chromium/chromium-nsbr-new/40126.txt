<title>Issue 40126 -   chromium -    Tint omnibox drop-down colors to match theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See screenshot.  We correctly make the star and reload buttons orange and   get the text highlight right; we should be able to use the same color scheme   for the omnibox drop-down.    I think we didn't do this in the past due to the green text.  I have no good   suggestions for what to do there. </pre>
