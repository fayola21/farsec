<title>Issue 39083 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager page is 404 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I downloaded the Mac build 42365 from build.chromium.org.    - go to &quot;bookmarks &gt; Bookmark Manager&quot;    &quot;This webpage is not found&quot;    chrome-extension://eemcgdkfn....../main.html    Seems bad. Could it be a packaging issue with the builder bots? </pre>
