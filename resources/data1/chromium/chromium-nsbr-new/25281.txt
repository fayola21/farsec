<title>Issue 25281 -   chromium -    Installer: IE plugin wasn't installed if chrome installer downloaded using Firefox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I downloaded the chrome install from Firefox and ran it but couldn't work  out why there was no plugin in IE6. It seems that the plugin only gets  installed if you use IE to download and run the installer.    Perhaps it should be an option as part of the installation process?    Chrome Version       : 4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)   </pre>
