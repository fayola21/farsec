<title>Issue 30501 -   chromium -    linux build bots hanging frequently during ui_tests and browser_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After the tests complete  the waterfall seems to hang.  This seems to   suggest that the process hasn't quit  but I'm not sure why the bot doesn't   kill the process and keep going.  Here's some sample output:    Note: Google Test filter = AutocompleteBrowserTest.YOU HAVE 4 FLAKY TESTS  [==========] Running 0 tests from 0 test cases.  [==========] 0 tests from 0 test cases ran. (0 ms total)  [  PASSED  ] 0 tests.    YOU HAVE 4 FLAKY TESTS    97 tests run  1 test failed  Failing tests:  SSLUITest.TestUnsafeContentsInWorker  Handling SIGHUP.  Check failed: rv &gt;= 0  Handling SIGHUP.  Successfully wrote to shutdown pipe  resetting signal handler.    command timed out: 600 seconds without output </pre>
