<title>Issue 37486 -   chromium -    Flickering of window when dragging tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta    OS version               : 10.6.2      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not known      1. <a href="http://collison.ie/chrome-bug.mov">http://collison.ie/chrome-bug.mov</a> (sorry it's so high res)      1. When a tab from a single-tab window is dragged  it shouldn't flicker.  2. When a tab is dropped into another window  to merge the tab with the   window  it shouldn't flicker. (It appears momentarily in the leftmost position    before returning to the correct position.)    Both of these behaviours are clearer in the above movie.      See movie. </pre>
