<title>Issue 41216 -   chromium -    Copying with middle mouse button doesn't extend URL with http://  https://  etc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>           What is the expected result? Select URL in the address line then try to   copy selected with middle mouse button. The copied URL should begin with   protocol specification (http:// https:// etc). But copying with CTRL+C    CTRL+V do the trick.    What happens instead? They made URL to be shew without http:// https://   etc in the prefix  and the copied URL doesn't begin from protocol   specification.    Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V still works  but using shortcuts in the browser is quite   unproductive since most of actions is doing using a mouse. IMO  you should   returh protocol specification back  URL looks silly without it.    <b>Please provide
