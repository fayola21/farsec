<title>Issue 24759 -   chromium -    why do we need a tick mark for Resume in download shelf ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   -Start downloading a big file and pause the download.  -Click on the drop down button of the download shelf.    As shown in the screenshot  the 'Resume' is marked tick. I don't know what  is the reason behind it.    Expected:  As we do with Pause  it should not be marked.   </pre>
