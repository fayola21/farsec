<title>Issue 41738 -   chromium -    PgDn/PgUp does not work in textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a> and fill the   Description textarea with more than 2 pages of content (e.g. 35 lines of   text).  2. Place cursor at the beginning/first row of the content   3. Press PgDn (Page Down) once      The textarea content is scrolled 1 page down with cursor moved to the new   top row.  Same is expected when composing large e-mails with gmail.com.      The textarea is not scrolled at all (or the main document is scrolled   instead).  For gmail.com: Text is scrolled 1 page but with cursor position unchanged   and when continuing to move down with Down Arrow the page is scrolled back   up to the top of the document. This is really annoying and works with other   browsers!    <b>Please provide
