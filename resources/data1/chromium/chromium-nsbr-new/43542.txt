<title>Issue 43542 -   chromium -    Put a &quot;Never offer to translate pages&quot; option to Options menu in translate infobar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev    I think a &quot;Never offer to translate pages&quot; option must be in Options menu in   translate infobar.  Yes I know an option exist in advanced options in wrench-&gt;options-&gt;under the   hood.. but many people don't think of that. And if there's a Options menu in   infobar this option must be in it. </pre>
