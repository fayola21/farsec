<title>Issue 24722 -   chromium -    file_util::TrimTrailingSeparator is deprecated and broken and should be removed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A recent bug was found in file_util::GetTempDir (<a title="Can't install any .crx by &quot;Could not create directory for unzipping.&quot;" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23911"> issue 23911 </a>) that was caused   by TrimTrailingSeparator. This function has been deprecated in favor of   FilePath::StripTrailingSeparators  and it has a few obvious bugs (C: turns   into C:  it doesn't remove multiple trailing separators  etc.).  It should be   removed to avoid future problems.   </pre>
