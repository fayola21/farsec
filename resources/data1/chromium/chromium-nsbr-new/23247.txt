<title>Issue 23247 -   chromium -    Tabs are not joined together in the Recently Closed list after a Chrome Crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21 (Official Build 26042)    When I have like 12 tabs open and close the Chrome window  then later open it   again. The Recently Closed section says something like: &quot;12 tabs&quot;. If I click   on it  Chrome very intelligently opens all of the tabs. But when a crash   occurs - Chrome dies  etc. - the Recently Closed section lists all the tabs   that were open  but I have to click them one by one to open them again. This   is a major pain in the a**.        After a Chrome crash  group the tabs together and let the user open them in   one click. </pre>
