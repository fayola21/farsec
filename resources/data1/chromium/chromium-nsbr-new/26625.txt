<title>Issue 26625 -   chromium -    Build all code with -fPIC on 64-bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus suggests that building with -fPIC for all code on 64-bit might   improve performance  as we won't need to relocate any code on startup and   there isn't as much register pressure.    It'll definitely fix <a title="Linux problems building .so's on 64-bit (fPIC)." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18337"> issue 18337 </a> at least.  :)  I'd like to see a perf test before we blindly flipped the switch  though.    CC'ing some people who had discussed this. </pre>
