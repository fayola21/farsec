<title>Issue 32199 -   chromium -    Trying to attach a file in gmail brings up the file dialog behind the current window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch new Chrome session  2. Go to gmail  3. Compose message  click on &quot;attach a file&quot;      I expect to see the file dialog. Instead  the file dialog is brought up behind the current window  and   i can't interact with the current window (can't click in the window). If I move the window  I can see   the dialog behind it and can then interact with it.       </pre>
