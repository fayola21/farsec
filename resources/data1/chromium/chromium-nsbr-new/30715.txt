<title>Issue 30715 -   chromium -    Use debugallocation for debug builds. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Requires tcmalloc.  Should primarily be gyp changes and fixing some existing   bugs.  First step is Linux.  Then perhaps windows.  I think there are some   issues because webkit's fastMalloc allocates with new but frees with free()   or something  which causes debugallocation to whine about mismatched   new/delete.  Meh. </pre>
