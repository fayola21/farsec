<title>Issue 28995 -   chromium -    tab title text is clipped on chromium os - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> it seems the tab title text is clipped incorrectly on chromium os. Letters like g and y have their bottoms cut   off.  The favicons also appear to be clipped slightly incorrectly. I don't know how to take a screenshot with   chromium os.    version is 4.0.227.0 </pre>
