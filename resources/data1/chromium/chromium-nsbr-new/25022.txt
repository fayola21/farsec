Click on the trailer (standard or HD)        The trailer to open and play in Quick Time Player          Nothing  but a message that says Quick Time is needed  but I already have   Quick Time installed on my Mac (QT 7 and QT X). This message appears   when I try to play a trailer in standard definition. If I click on an HD   version  nothing happens at all  no message  no attempt to open  nothing.    It appears that Chrome for Mac just is not Quick time savvy at this point   and I don't know how to enable Quick Time in Chrome.      <b>Please provide
