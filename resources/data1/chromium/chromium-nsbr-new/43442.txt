<title>Issue 43442 -   chromium -    Duplicate bookmark created when pasting URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome: 5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) dev      1. Visit: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKGhvKyjgLY#t=20m13s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKGhvKyjgLY#t=20m13s</a>  2. Click on the location bar and copy URL  3. Open Bookmark Manager  4. Right-click &gt; Add page...  5. Paste url in the URL field      The URL should be pasted      The URL is pasted and a 2nd bookmark is created    Note - I can only make this happen when copying the URL from the youtube page. If I copy from   a text-file  it doesn't happen. Is a hidden character being appended onto the URL?   </pre>
