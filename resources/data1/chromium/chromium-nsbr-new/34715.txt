<title>Issue 34715 -   chromium -    Unpacked extensions do not load after start of browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.318.0 (38188)        1. Loading unpacked extension works fine.  2. When closing and staring chrome all the installed unpacked extensions   disappear.      Loading unpacked extension and when closing and staring chrome all the   installed unpacked extensions keep installed.      Unpacked extensions are not loaded after closing browser    Loading unpacked extension form file system works fine.   When closing and staring chrome all the installed unpacked extensions   disappear.    If added unpacked  extensions do not get loaded on browser restart.    Have tested it on chrome stable and beta version  chromium stable and beta   verstion - all the same behavior.    Im realy sad of this feature  because the extension framework of is realy   great. I'm trying to develop some extensions in my spare time. But when   after every start of chromium or chrome a manual reload of unpacked   extension is necessary that isn't a feature that extension developer look   for.    Maybe there are some options to set  but haven't found one. </pre>
