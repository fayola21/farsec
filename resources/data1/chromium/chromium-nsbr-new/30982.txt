<title>Issue 30982 -   chromium -    Preventing textInput event can't prevent the IME from inputting text. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the attached html file.  2. Check textInput checkbox  3. Input something with IME in the first input element.      Nothing should be inputted. But instead  some selected text is inputted.        The reason of this issue:  When inputting with IME  the textInput event is generated when confirming   the composition text  but before that  the text is already inputted into the   input element as composition text (selected text). So if textInput is   prevented  then the composition text will never be confirmed.    The correct behavior should be: if textInput is prevented  all pending   composition text should be discarded.
