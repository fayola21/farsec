<title>Issue 23383 -   chromium -    AcceleratorHandler on Windows should not dispatch the KEYUP messages eaten by the FocusManager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In accelerator_handler_win.cc  the accelerator gets a crack at the messages   before they are translated and dispatched.  It looks at WM_KEYDOWN and does not dispatch the message if the focus manager   consumed it. But it then translate and dispatch the associated WM_KEYUP.  It should eat it as well. </pre>
