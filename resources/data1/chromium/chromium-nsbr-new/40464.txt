<title>Issue 40464 -   chromium -    Feature request: Receive informations about Chrome crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi  for now when Chrome crashes I know by terminal message on linux that   some information about the crash is sent to Google. I think users should be   informed about the crash  like:   1- Is a known crash by Google team?  2- How many crashes like this happened on Chrome  3- The crash happens on stable  beta or dev? or just on dev...  4- Prevision to be fixed?  5- When be fixed be notified by email.   </pre>
