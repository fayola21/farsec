<title>Issue 39150 -   chromium -    inspector audits never completing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> using Chromium ToT (ubuntu builds)  the &quot;Audits&quot; feature of inspector is   unusable.    Once I hit &quot;Run&quot;  it never ends  the spinner runs forever waiting for one   more thing  whatever the page. So it's not possible to get results.    First tried on my own projects  then google.com  then many other sites  i   always get &quot;Loading (n-1 of n)&quot;. </pre>
