<title>Issue 43466 -   chromium -    Fraudentulent use of Google name??? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Hi I received an e-mail claiming to be from Google I believe in the Uk. I   believe it is a fraud and that I am reporting it as such. I will attempt to   attach the file to this report. I would appreciate a confirmation or denial   whatever. I am a very poor 71 year old man living on a pension and still   supporting my wife and 2 kids. Obviously I don't have any extra money. You   don't know how much I want this to be true but I am sure it is just a scam   like many others I have received but they are using Googles good name for   this scam.  Joseph   </pre>
