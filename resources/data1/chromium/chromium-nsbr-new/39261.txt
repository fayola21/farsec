<title>Issue 39261 -   chromium -    GPU Process failure on Chrome Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GPU process  hangs  allocating memory until it reaches 1GB  then crashes.      The machine is a Google Pentium 4  HP xw4300 Workstation  Linux version  2.6.24-gg804006-generic (nataliep@bizarre.smo.corp.google.com) (gcc version  4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)) #1 SMP Tue Dec 22 15:27:33 PST 2009  &quot;gHardy&quot;    Chrome is built from Chromium ToT  from 24 March 2010  Run chrome as: ./out/Debug/chrome --internal-nacl --enable-gpu-plugin  --nosandbox  Open nativeclient/scons-out/nacl-x86-32/staging/pepper_plugin.html    This pepper tests shows 2D  and events working  but 3D does not work. In  the Chrome task manager (and in top) you can see the GPU process growing  its memory footprint. It crashes when it reaches 1GB  out of memory error.    From glxinfo  &quot;Open GL version string: 2.1.2 NVIDIA 180.60&quot;      A spinning cube should appear. It should not run out of memory nor crash.   </pre>
