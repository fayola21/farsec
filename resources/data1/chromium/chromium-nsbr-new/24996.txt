<title>Issue 24996 -   chromium -    Notifications sent out after commit failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Put an account into a state where the server has throttled it.  Submitting   ~2000 changes in a short period of time will cause the server to do this.  2. Set up two browser instances to syncing using this throttled account.  3. Make sure that each browser instance has at least one unsynced   modification (about:sync should show a nonzero &quot;Unsynced Count&quot;).  4. Pay attention to the &quot;Notifications Sent&quot; and &quot;Notifications Received&quot;   counters.    The expected behavior is that these clients (which should receive only  commit errors from the server) should not be sending notifications.  However    on my machine  they were sending a storm of messages back and forth. </pre>
