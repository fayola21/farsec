<title>Issue 27542 -   chromium -    Print or Page Layout panels break -controlTextDidBeginEditing: assumptions. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> AutocompleteEditViewMac (Mac Omnibox) makes assumptions about how Cocoa works which are   broken when the Print or Page Layout panels are loaded.  There seems to be a bundle they load   which adds a category on NSTextFieldCell which overrides a method which accomplishes this magic.    See <a title="Mac: DCHECK() failure in AutocompleteEditViewMac::OnWillBeginEditing()" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19116"> Issue 19116 </a> is this kind of talk interests you.    <a title="Mac: DCHECK() failure in AutocompleteEditViewMac::OnWillBeginEditing()" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19116"> Issue 19116 </a> and <a title="On gmail  focus unexpectedly jumps to the location bar every now and then and location bar is focussed on every tab swit..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17803"> Issue 17803 </a> are being fixed by a compact change which detects this case and   short-circuits it.  I have a much more principled fix which is more intrusive  but makes this work   right without even trying.  This is a tracking bug for that fix. </pre>
