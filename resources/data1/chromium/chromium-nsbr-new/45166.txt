<title>Issue 45166 -   chromium -    [ Mac - Green Zoom Button ] On some websites zooming (green zoom button) doesn't work correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.417.0 (48303)    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Camino 2.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: -      1. Deactivate your Adblocker + Flashblocker  2. go to <a href="http://www.finanzen.net/">http://www.finanzen.net/</a>  3. make the Window very small (with the right corner at the bottom)  4. Now click on the green-zoom-button for &quot;best fit&quot;       The Window should zoom to best fit (no scroll-bar at the bottom should be visible).      Zooming (best fit) ignores the Ad at the right side. The blue scroll-bar at the bottom is even to   see.    In CAMINO and SAFARI it zooms correctly !!!    If you need more example-websites  please let me know !    Thanks and regards  Mehmet </pre>
