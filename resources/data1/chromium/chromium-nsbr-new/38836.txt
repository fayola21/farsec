<title>Issue 38836 -   chromium -    New taskbar preview issues with multiple profiles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev                    1. Open several tabs in multiple chrome profiles            After the introduction of the new taskbar preview into the dev version of   chrome  I would have expected that clicking on the taskbar icon for each   chrome profile would preview the tabs open in that specific profile.        In fact  even though I still see 1 chrome icon on the taskbar for each   profile I have running (this is how I like it) all the tabs open in all   profiles are previewed by clicking the taskbar icon that relates to the   default profile. It seems to nullify the point of running different   profiles if chrome is going to lump them all together into one huge messy   preview (Imagine 6 or 7 tabs open in each of 5 profiles... its now   impossible to find anything)    Thanks </pre>
