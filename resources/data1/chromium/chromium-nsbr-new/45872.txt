<title>Issue 45872 -   chromium -    ClientSocketPool doesn't discard active sockets on network change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The net effect is that  if you've got active http connections that finish up   during a network change  then they don't error out on the http transaction.    When the transaction completes  the socket (that was valid for the old   network configuration) gets released back to the pool  and when it gets re-  used  it might take awhile to error out  before the user tries to get a new   socket.  This is suboptimal  but it only affects a few sockets that just   finish up right when the network change occurs. </pre>
