<title>Issue 30514 -   chromium -    Applying a theme will bounce the Downloads icon in the Dock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.43 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34537">r34537</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.1.51.45        1. Make sure that Chrome's default download location is ~/Downloads and that you have a   Downloads icon in the Dock menu.  2. Open <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>.  3. Apply a theme.    Expected:  A .crx file gets downloaded and installed. Then its removed from the downloaded folder.  All this should happen without the user noticing it i.e without a download shelf popping up or   the bouncing of Downloads icon in the dock.    Actual:  A .crx file gets downloaded and installed and is removed ones the installation is complete. The   downloads icon in the Dock starts bouncing. </pre>
