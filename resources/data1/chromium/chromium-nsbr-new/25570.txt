<title>Issue 25570 -   chromium -    Mac: with Full Keyboard Access enabled  about dialogs display useless cursor turd - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable &quot;Full Keyboard Access  All controls&quot; under System   Preferences/Keyboard &amp; Mouse (or just Keyboard under SL)/Keyboard   Shortcuts.  2. Run Chrome or Chromium  and display the About dialog (&quot;About Google   Chrome&quot; or &quot;About Chromium&quot; from the main menu).      I expect a normal dialog box with no cursor in the text. Instead  I see a   cursor in the text (which I can move using the mouse  but not using the   keyboard ... making it completely useless).    This was on Chrome Dev Channel 4.0.223.4 as well as on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29758">r29758</a> off the   trunk (on 10.5.8 and on 10.6.1). </pre>
