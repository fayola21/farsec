<title>Issue 23579 -   chromium -    Potential thread unsafeness with CoreAudio - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ThreadSanitizer bot reports threading issues with media_unittests.    Could be related to calling AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer() on callback thread   while attempting to interact with CoreAudio on the main thread.    Should investigate by checking with coreaudio-api@lists.apple.com  <a href="http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/coreaudio-api">http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/coreaudio-api</a>    Sample valgrind output attached. </pre>
