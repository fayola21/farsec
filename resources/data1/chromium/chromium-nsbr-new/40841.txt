<title>Issue 40841 -   chromium -    &quot;Installed theme&quot; infobar should disappear if the user changes/resets the theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install a theme (e.g.   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ecdfhmffadihhcgfnpoohknailfammeo">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ecdfhmffadihhcgfnpoohknailfammeo</a> )  2. Wait for infobar to pop up  3. Go to preferences  click &quot;Reset to default theme&quot;        Infobar should go away after step 3.  It hangs around instead.    I ran into this while debugging themes syncing.  I think this has been around for a while so it's not a   M5 blocker. </pre>
