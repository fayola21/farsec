<title>Issue 34024 -   chromium -    shortcut to favorites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's not a bug  but can be implemented in chrome. Make a shortcut to add   pages to favorites. This is important and is missing. For example  I put a   page in the library  I copy the page address  I click on add a page and   then copy and rename. long service .... would be a practical shortcut &quot;add   page to favorites&quot; </pre>
