<title>Issue 42846 -   chromium -    Disabling/uninstalling extension with visible browser action leaves empty space when some browser actions are hidden - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Install two extensions with browser actions  2.Hide one.  3.Disable the other.      EXPECTED: the hidden extension should become visible and replace the old icon (at least that's   how it is on windows)  ACTUAL: empty spot where the icon used to be  and the other extension still hidden      Occurs on Mac 5.0.375.23 (Official Build 45554) dev. Fine on windows. Haven't tried linux.     </pre>
