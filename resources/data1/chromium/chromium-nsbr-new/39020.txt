<title>Issue 39020 -   chromium -    Session cookies + persisted whitelist: Cookie whitelist doesn't differentiate &quot;allow for session&quot; and &quot;allow persisting&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome version: 5.0.360.0    The new content preferences can be used to block cookies from all but a few   sites. I'd like to make cookies session-only for all but a few sites.    The cookie whitelist options need to mirror the global cookie options: allow   persisting  allow for session  ask  disallow (and possibly an allow-third   party check-box). Then I'll be able to whitelist persisting cookies like I   do in firefox.   </pre>
