<title>Issue 31579 -   chromium -    Remembered zoom levels cause problems for images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an image is zoomed and the browser is restarted  the image zoom level is   restored (this is nice). However  it seems that webkit now thinks this zoom   level is the &quot;base&quot; level and henceforth modifications apply to that zoom   level rather than the real base. </pre>
