<title>Issue 46291 -   chromium -    Pre-installed extensions don't do anything on first run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Install Chrome via <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?installdataindex=wc-extension">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?installdataindex=wc-extension</a>  2.  Go through first run  click ok  etc.  3.  See that the extension is present and installed.  4.  Click on the browser action.      The extension's popup window should work.  Instead  I see nothing -- the browser action doesn't do anything.     The browser action does work as expected on second run.     </pre>
