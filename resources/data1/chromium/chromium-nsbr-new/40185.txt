When I try to type in the second chinese words  it will automatically   replace the first one. I mean that I can only type in &quot;one&quot; chinese word in   the &quot;find&quot; textbox.      I have the similar problem in the Omnibox as it always lose focus when I   type in Chinese. It was discovered for a long time. I hope someone can   quickly fix it.    PS: It is��_��_��_found in Windows 7 using &quot;QUICK IME&quot; and no problem when using   &quot;NEW QUICK IME&quot; </pre>
