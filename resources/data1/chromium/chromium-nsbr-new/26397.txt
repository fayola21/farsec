<title>Issue 26397 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager from Incgonito window should support bookmarks sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing this as we do support bookmarks sync from Incognito window (as per  <a title="'Sync my bookmarks...' menu item doesn't do anything in incognito" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23993"> issue 23993 </a>).    -Bring up Incognito window.  -Ctrl+shit+b on the Incognito window to bring up the Bookmarks manager.    Notice there is no option for Bookmarks sync on toolbar of B'Manager.    I guess we are supporting this  but proving null string (??)  if I hover  over the place of Bookmarks sync (next to Tools button)  I will get empty  button hover state. </pre>
