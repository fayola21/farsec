<title>Issue 46263 -   chromium -    Clear Browsing Data Grayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.427.0 (Official Build 49010) dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.6.3            1. Close all windows/tabs.  2. Try to select &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; from the &quot;Chrome&quot; menu.  3. Menu item is grayed.      Even when all windows are closed I should be able to clear the browsing data  since that command clears all the data (by category) and not just the data generated by a specific site in one window/tab.      I cannot clear the data unless I open a Chrome window. </pre>
