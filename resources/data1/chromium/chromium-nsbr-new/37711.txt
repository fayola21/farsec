<title>Issue 37711 -   chromium -    Dynamically loaded subresources are cached through a shift-reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to the above testing URL (<a href="http://test.getify.com/chrome-cache-bug-2/">http://test.getify.com/chrome-cache-bug-2/</a>)  2. Notice the first number and background color that appear immediately  3. After 3 seconds  notice the second number  and the new background color  4. Shift-Refresh the page  notice the first number and color change  but   after 3 seconds  the second number and color are the same as before the   refresh.  5. Clear the browser cache  refresh the page. Notice same behavior as in   #4.      That scripts and css that are loaded dynamically after page load will go   normally into the cache  and therefore be removed from the cache when it is   cleared or when a shift-refresh occurs.      scripts and css that are loaded at page load time behave correctly in the   cache. but  scripts and css that are loaded later (after the 3 seconds)  go   into some special cache state  where they cannot be cleared by normal   means. They will persist even if the file changes on the server  or even if    the cache is cleared through any of several methods.    <b>Please provide
