<title>Issue 32828 -   chromium -    It would be nice to get (void)cancel:(id)sender to work for Html Dialogs on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Implement (void)cancel:(id)sender to call [self close] in   html_dialog_window_controller.mm.  2. Remove the existing code in HandleKeyboardEvent that manually handles   Esc and Command-. .        Hitting 'esc' or Command-. should still close an HTML dialog (e.g.  Sync Setup   Wizard)   </pre>
