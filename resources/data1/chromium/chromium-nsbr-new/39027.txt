<title>Issue 39027 -   chromium -    (Linux) Mysterious status bubble behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are currently two different cases for moving the status bubble out of   the way of the mouse.  To the linux user this is counter-intuitive:    If no download shelf  slide the status bubble down  which makes sense on   Windows because down means over the chrome of the window.  However this   feature is not planned for linux (see comments in source code) due to wm   diversity.  Status bubble is not visible.    If the download shelf is showing  flip the status bubble to the right.    This is because sliding the status bubble down would obscure the download   shelf.  Here  the status bar is visible.    Expected: an intuitive  single hiding strategy  since sliding over window   chrome doesn't apply to linux. </pre>
