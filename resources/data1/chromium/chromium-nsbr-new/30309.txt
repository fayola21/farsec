<title>Issue 30309 -   chromium -    Focus on PDF after alt+tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  URLs (if applicable) : Any PDF  Other browsers tested: (Windows 7 RC1 x64 only)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 8: OK      1. Open any PDF in the browser (Adobe plug-in)  2. Focus the PDF (you can scroll up and down with the arrow keys (!))  3. Alt+tab to any other window  4. Alt+tab back to Chrome.      Scrolling up and down with the arrow keys should still work.      You have to click on the PDF before you can scroll with the arrow keys   again.    Scrolling with the mouse wheel or touchpad still works after the alt+tab.   Still  this is really annoying. </pre>
