<title>Issue 36748 -   chromium -    WebSocket connection remains open on refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071) unknown      n/a since only chrome has real use of WebSockets      1. Open a page that uses a WebSocket  2. Hit the refresh button  3. Check server and see that 2 connections remain open   4. monitor connections with the WebSocket page as active tab. first   connection remains connected alongside the new connection (although only 1   page is loaded).  5. switch tabs off of WebSocket page and monitor connections  old   connection will time out and drop  but only if the page using the WebSocket   is not the active tab      On refresh the active WebSockets should be closed first  like it does on a   tab close. And I'm not sure why a socket would time out only if its not in   focus when the parent page is not even loaded.      The original connection of the now non existent page still remains   connected to the remote server until A) The tab is closed  or B) The tab   loses focus and it times out after a time period.     </pre>
