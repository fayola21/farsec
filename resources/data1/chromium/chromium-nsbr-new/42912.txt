<title>Issue 42912 -   chromium -    Flash Player Content player controls/buttons not clickable when page is zoomed in  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.375.23 dev (happens in all Google Chrome versions)  Websites: websites with flash content and buttons/controls like YouTube and   Ustream.          Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    When zoomed into a page with Flash Content in Google Chrome for example a   YouTube Video on a channel page or the flash ad on the YouTube homepage or   the video player on Ustream.tv  the controls/buttons on the flash media   player are unclickable/unresponsive.        When zoomed into a page in Google Chrome  I expect the controls/buttons on   the Flash Player content like the ad on the homepage of youtube  or the   YouTube video player. Or the Ustream live video player  and other websites   to work properly and be clickable.      Buttons/controlls are unclickable      Go here for more informaiton on this  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=514226591b8d9907&amp;hl=en   </pre>
