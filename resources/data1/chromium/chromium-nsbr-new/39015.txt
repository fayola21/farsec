<title>Issue 39015 -   chromium -    Mouse move not reported to flash while mouse button is down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev / 5.0.360.0 (42326)  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Mouse events are generated  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Mouse events are generated  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Mouse events are generated (with stable chrome)      1. Press mouse button inside flash movie  2. Move mouse  3. flash should get MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE events      Works while mouse is not pressed  but no move events are generated when button is down.      Not much.    I've attached a test case showing the behavior. Press mouse button inside the square and the ball   should move in the x axis.    actionscript code:  mcBox.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE  mouseMoveHandler);    function mouseMoveHandler(e : MouseEvent)  {  	mcBall.x = e.stageX;  } </pre>
