<title>Issue 43520 -   chromium -    Chrome Mac opening as a result of a link click opens 2 tabs instead of one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1.  Make Chrome Mac your default browser.  2.  Click on a link.        Chrome should open and display only the link you clicked which caused it to open.        Chrome opens your home page in one tab and the link you clicked in a second tab.  This is   inconsistent with other browsers  and with Chrome's behavior when you have it open and all   windows closed (where it does the right thing of only opening the one link).   </pre>
