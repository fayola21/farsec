<title>Issue 30076 -   chromium -    On startup  unwanted tabs are opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.269.0~svn20091210r34249-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : metacity      1. I have some tabs open (even the case when only one  which is the &quot;new   tab&quot; page  2. Exit from chromium  3. Launch chromium    Now interesting things happen: though chromium &quot;remembers&quot; the tabs were   open  some unwanted tabs are open which were _not_ open at all before I   exit from browser! I've also tried to make chromium to crash (sending   signal 11 to chromium processes). After launch chromium again  it asks me   if I want to restore the session. Even if I just close that bar (so I don't   want to restore) I got a new tab page _and_ several other unwanted tabs   again after it. I don't even now where does tabs come from  I don't   remember to open any of those URLs I can see there. I have the only suspect   that it can be an extension problem: TpGoogleReader is installed. If it   caused this problem (and this is not some interesting chromium bug) then   sorry for the noise here.   </pre>
