<title>Issue 44178 -   chromium -    Significant more CPU-Load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1  OS: Mac OS 10.6.2    Since update to version 6.0.401.1 this morning CPU load has been raised significant. I'm working   with about 20-25 open tabs since switching to Chrome and CPU load was only generated for the   visible tabs before.    Now after the update _every_ tab - visible or not - generates constant load of 2-5% CPU on a C2D   machine running on Mac OS 10.6.2. So the system can't calm down and fans are running all the   time. Also the whole UI slows down through this. (Is instantly getting better after all Chrome   processes are closed)    Only 2 of the tabs continue huge javascript or flash so this might be a more general problem.   (Even closing this two tabs does not improve the situation.)    Screenshot of htop is attached to prove this. (As you can see the system is restarted only 30   minutes ago. I'm watching this now for nearly one hour and the behaviour isn't changing.) </pre>
