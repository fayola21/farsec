<title>Issue 34429 -   chromium -    deflate on chrome 4.0.249.78 (36714) running on Windows 7 broken  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (36714) running on Windows 7  URL : <a href="https://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk/account/javascript/library.js">https://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk/account/javascript/library.js</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Unknown  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Works  Behavior in Chrome 3.x : Works  Behavior in Explore 6/7/8 : Works      1. Inspect the source of the javascript as downloaded by Chrome 4.0.249.78  2. Inspect the source of the javascript as downloaded by Firefox 4.x  3. Compare the two files.    Notice how Chrome 4.0.249.78 corrupts the javascript?  This then results in   error when it tries to interpret.    When deflate is turned off on the apache server that is serving the   javascript file Chrome 4.0.249.78 doesn't alter the file in anyway.    Chrome 4.0.249.78 running on Windows Vista or Windows XP doesn't have the   same problem.       </pre>
