<title>Issue 27383 -   chromium -    tab drawing with lots of tabs goes slightly wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you open up a whole lot of tabs  we seem to have some math error when   trying to figure out how much text fits.  The start of the tabs all seems to   properly stay within the tab  but later they start to draw past the right side of   the tab.    Screen shot attached. </pre>
