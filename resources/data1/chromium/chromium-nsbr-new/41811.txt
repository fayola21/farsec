<title>Issue 41811 -   chromium -    Add histogram for network error codes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add some histogram for net error codes.    At a minimum  should distinguish between errors that happened when starting the request  and   errors that happened while reading.    And even better would be to differentiate between users visible errors (i.e. they actually were   displayed an error page). </pre>
