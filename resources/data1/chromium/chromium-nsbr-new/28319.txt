<title>Issue 28319 -   chromium -    Nacl and Chrome doesn't compile if devenv run from cygwin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today after updating my local client for Chromium  I couldn't build it. After   some investigation it seems that now if I run gclient sync under cygwin the   generated files are not correct and compilation fails with this error:    1&gt;cl : Command line warning D9002 : ignoring unknown option   '/cygdrive/[...]/src/native_client/src/trusted/service_runtime/arch/x86_32/d:  /[...]/src/native_client/src/trusted/service_runtime/arch/x86_32/nacl_switch.  S'    Brad  I am not sure if you are the right person but I saw some reviews fly by   from you that were changing gyp files under here. So assigning it to you    please reassign/unassign as appropriate.   </pre>
