<title>Issue 41053 -   chromium -    FTP downloads keep on &quot;downloading&quot;  while they are completed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download an iso-file (as I did with the files mentioned above)  2. While downloading everything seems normal  but wait till it finishes.  3. The progress bar (~circle) is completed  it says xx MB of xx MB   downloaded  but still it's acting like it's downloading. If you try to   close the browser it responds as if you're in the middle of a download    warning you that you're about to abort the download.  4. When killing the browser and calculating the download's checksum hash    the download seems to be perfectly ok.  5. If you restart Chromium  the download overview says &quot;canceled&quot; about the   download.      A download procedure that finishes properly  the browser being aware of   that.      Download works well  but the browser doesn't seem to know when the download   is complete.      <b>Please provide
