<title>Issue 41535 -   chromium -    [CF] Could not get cookie information correctly when page is rendered by CF - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to gcf:<a href="http://www.html-kit.com/tools/cookietester/">http://www.html-kit.com/tools/cookietester/</a>  2. Click on button &quot;Set Test Cookie&quot;        After you click on the button  page gets refreshed and &quot;Number of cookies  received&quot; should show 1  but now it still shows 0  and actually the cookie  has been created successfully and it shows correctly when you access the  same page with IE directly.    This also happens when you click on the &quot;Refresh&quot; button or &quot;Remove Cookie&quot;  button.    If you click the refresh button in page rendered by IE  then click the  refresh button in page rendered by CF  the &quot;Number of cookies received&quot; wil  show correctly.       </pre>
