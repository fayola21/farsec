Delete all the Bookmarks  2. Open Bookmark manager and select Bookmarks Bar  3. &quot;Import Bookmarks &amp; settings&quot; ( Make sure we import bookmarks which adds to the Bookmark bar )    Expected: Bookmark manager's bookmark Bar( right pane ) view should get filled with added( imported ) bookmarks dynamically.
