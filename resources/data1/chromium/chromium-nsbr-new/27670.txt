<title>Issue 27670 -   chromium -    Drop-down list selection by typing does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?">http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?</a>  filename=tryhtml_select2  Other browsers tested: FF3.5 and IE7        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK (with slight behavioral difference)        1. Go to a site that uses an option element in a form  2. Click on the drop-down list  3. Type the first letter of one of the options      As letters are typed  the selected list entry should be changed to match   the typed letters (case-insensitive)  as if the user were spelling the   entry.  For example  if there were a drop-down list of countries and the   user typed &quot;u&quot;  then the first list entry starting with &quot;u&quot; or &quot;U&quot; should   be highlighted.  If there is more than one entry starting with &quot;u&quot;  and the   user types &quot;n&quot;  then the first list entry starting with &quot;un&quot; should be   selected.  If there are no entries starting with &quot;un&quot;  then the selection   should not change.    If there is no keyboard activity for a certain amount of time (3 seconds    maybe?)  then any letters typed should be treated as a new &quot;search&quot; of the   list entries.      The selected list item is not updated as the user types.     </pre>
