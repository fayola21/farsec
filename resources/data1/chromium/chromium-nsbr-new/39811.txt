<title>Issue 39811 -   chromium -    show &quot;Translating...&quot; in after-translate infobar when translation is triggered - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The information below is copied and pasted from windows bug  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36682">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36682</a>.  if it has already been fixed  pls close it.    1. open a page that will show the translate infobar  e.g. spiegel.de in   english chrome.  2. click &quot;Translate&quot; button to trigger translation.  3. after page is translated  modify the target language to trigger another   translation.    Expected:  infobar should show &quot;Translating...&quot; while page is waiting for translation   to complete.    Actual:  infobar remains the same.  for slow connections  user might not know   translation has already been triggered.     </pre>
