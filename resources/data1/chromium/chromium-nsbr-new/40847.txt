<title>Issue 40847 -   chromium -    &quot;Installed theme&quot; infobar doesn't show up on theme syncing if the theme was recently installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enable themes syncing on computers A and B  2. Set a new theme on computer A.  Wait for computer B to pick it up.  Infobar should show on   computer B.  Dismiss it.  3. Set the default theme on computer A.  Wait for computer B to pick it up.  4. Set the theme from step 3 on computer A again.  Wait for computer B to pick it up.        &quot;installed theme&quot; infobar should show again.  It doesn't.    This is because since the theme is already installed  it is immediately loaded  which doesn't go   through the installer; the infobar is part of the installer flow. </pre>
