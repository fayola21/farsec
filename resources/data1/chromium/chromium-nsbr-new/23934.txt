<title>Issue 23934 -   chromium -    Chrome adds .gz to tgz files so the file name becomes filename.tgz.gz instead of filename.tgz - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : All versions  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla">http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK        Opera 9: OK       Opera 10: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla-downloads/club/1127-infuse">http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla-downloads/club/1127-infuse</a>  2. Click on the Download button for the Infuse template.  3. You need to be logged in to download though...        rt_infuse_j15.tgz should be downloaded.        In Chrome the file downloads but with the name rt_infuse_j15.tgz.gz which  will cause serious issues with Joomla and also extraction on some  servers/computers. I think this will happen on all sites using .tgz files.
