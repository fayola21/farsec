<title>Issue 39809 -   chromium -    geolocation: flip switch to make it on by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enable geolocation in the dev channel.  With the location bubble complete  we now have sufficient UI (i.e. a means to   revoke permissions) to enable geolocation by default.    (If any platform is going to lag significantly in getting the full exceptions   dialog implemented  we could have a top-level Remove All Exceptions button   as a stop gap alternative)   </pre>
