<title>Issue 31616 -   chromium -    make &quot;new tab focus&quot; configurable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A              Currently there is no way to change the default behavior of new tabs opening   in the background  and I didn't see a ticket in already about providing a   setting to make this configurable. Safari and Firefox allow you to change this   setting  and Chrome should too. </pre>
