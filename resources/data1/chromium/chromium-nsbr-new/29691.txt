<title>Issue 29691 -   chromium -    Add support for MLSD FTP directory listings (RFC-3659) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MLSD listing instead of LIST is standardized. It's quite similar to EPLF - both   provide a series of facts about a listing entry. It seems to be easy to parse    and there is no guessing.    One of the FTP servers known to implement MLSD is Pure-FTPd (it's also quite   popular). See <a href="http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd">http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd</a> and search for   MLSD.    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-23">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-23</a> </pre>
