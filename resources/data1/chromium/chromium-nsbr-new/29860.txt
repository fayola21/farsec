<title>Issue 29860 -   chromium -    using expose with Chrome for mac when it is the only window open in a space - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. using expose with only one window open      when in expose mode  the window will not take the same actions as other   windows that would be in the situation. Chrome will not fit the screen the   same; instead  if you have one tab open  it will weirdly scrunch more to the   left side of the screen  but if you have multiple tabs open  it will scrunch   weirdly onto the right side of the screen. Again  this only happens when it   is the only window in the space its in  and when in expose mode.    <b>Please provide
