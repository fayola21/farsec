<title>Issue 36420 -   chromium -    openDatabase returns null when called from local filesystem sources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	5.0.336.0 (Developer Build 39588) Ubuntu  WebKit	533.1  V8	2.1.0.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.1   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.336.0 Safari/533.1          1. View the local storage demo found here and note how it works:  <a href="http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/index.html">http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/index.html</a>    2. Save a local copy (or download the attached source).    3. View the local copy you downloaded in Chromium.  It can't open a DB.        openDatabse(......) should return a DB instance.          openDatabase(......) returns null.        A quick drop in at #chromium on freenode yielded the speculation that   this might have been disabled for security reasons.  I find this to be a   bit of a pain when developing or learning HTML5 as it then requires users   to have access to a web server.    It's my hope that this is either a glitch in the current SVN  or that   some kind of UI-based prompt can be put together to allow users to allow   HTML5 local storage for filesystem-hosted sources.    This has stopped me dead in my tracks! </pre>
