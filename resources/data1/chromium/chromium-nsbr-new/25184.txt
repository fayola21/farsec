<title>Issue 25184 -   chromium -    break up the page cycler tests in bot config - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The page cycler (and http one) in the bot configs are done in bataches.  ie-  turning on the test turns on a few different tests.  This means you can't better   balance those tests between a few perf bots to get the average cycle time of   the bots down.  it would be nice if the config had better control over enabling   these tests.   </pre>
