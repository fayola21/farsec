<title>Issue 28265 -   chromium -    open file dialog navigates to chrome installation folder if default ( = previous) folder doesn't exist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: none      1. Open a file in a removable (USB) drive for (for example) any upload   process of chrome. I don't know if you have to really upload it  or if just   selecting the file is enough  2. Remove the drive  3. Open the open file dialog again. Notice that it will navigate to the   installation folder of Chrome      For example: to navigate to the my documents folder if the folder doesn't   exists      First: a Windows msgbox telling you the folder doesn't exist  then   automatically navigating to the chrome installation folder </pre>
