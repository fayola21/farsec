<title>Issue 44801 -   chromium -    Bottom of page flickers between visible tab and some other tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev  OS: Mac OS 10.6.3      I'm not sure that I have a way to reliably reproduce the issue  but it does come up fairly frequently.    Essentially  the browser gets into a state where the bottom 10% or so of the tab will flicker back and   forth between what it's supposed to be rendering and some other tab.    It's worth noting that I have a very tall display (2650 px)  so that may be a factor in triggering it. </pre>
