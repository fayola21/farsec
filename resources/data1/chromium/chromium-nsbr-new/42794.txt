<title>Issue 42794 -   chromium -    Can get grey search text in the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5.0.375.23 dev    0) Start with a clean profile.  1) Type &quot;http://a into the omnibox.  The http:// part will turn grey.  2) Delete everything but the h.  The h is still grey.  3) Type anything else.  The whole text will be grey!    I *think* this happens on ToT too. </pre>
