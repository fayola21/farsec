<title>Issue 36213 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox incorrect field when selecting in popup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type &quot;g&quot; (or most any letter).  2. Pick an item towards bottom of popup and Command-click.  Should open in other tab.  3. Arrow down.        Should either be arrowing from the currently-selected row  or the currently-selected row should   revert to correspond to the field's value.  Instead arrowing down arrows down as if the field's value   (first row) is selected.   </pre>
