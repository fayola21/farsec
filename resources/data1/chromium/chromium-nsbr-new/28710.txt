<title>Issue 28710 -   chromium -    Slows to crawl  when all browsers closed still needs chrome.exe killed in task manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open dozens of tabs for different sites  2. Keep open over a week  3. Try to keep surfing  opening  closing tabs        Chrome should close tabs immediately  open new tabs quickly  and continue   to surf quickly to other sites.        Slows to crawl. Loading a website in a tab can take many minutes. Can get   &quot;not responding&quot; message from Chrome and if wait it eventually comes back.   Closing a tab or a browser window of tabs takes a long time. Surfing is   extremely slow.    Close all chrome browsers and kill off chrome.exe remaining in task manager   and then reload chrome and it is extremely fast once again and browsing is   again fast. I thought my internet connection had got bad but restarting   chrome resulted into huge improvement.    <b>Please provide
