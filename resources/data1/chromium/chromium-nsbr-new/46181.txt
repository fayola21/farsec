<title>Issue 46181 -   chromium -    Too-long javascript string in alert() blows up Chrome (and kills my Linux session) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  6.0.422.0 dev (LINUX)  URLs (if applicable) : None  Other browsers tested: None         1. Save this web page as a text file on your system:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;  &lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;  function BigAlert() {    var text = &quot;&quot;;    for (var i = 0; i &lt;61889; ++i) {      text += &quot;1&quot;;    }    alert(text);  }  &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;button name=&quot;kaboom&quot; value=&quot;kaboom&quot; onclick=&quot;return BigAlert();&quot;&gt;Kaboom!&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2. Load the page.    3. Click on the button.    4. Watch Chrome trap.    5. Even better - for some limits of the loop (including the one above)  it also happens to hose my entire Linux session! At least the window manager is toast; I haven't figured out how to get it to restart cleanly  so I wind up logging out and in again.    61889 is roughly the critical value (I didn't probe too much  as it was irritating to have to keep logging in). Smaller limits work okay; the alert shows and can be dismissed. Larger limits kill Chrome wihtout killing the session.     </pre>
