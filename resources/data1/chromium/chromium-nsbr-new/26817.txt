Launch chrome.   2. Right click to get the contextual menu below the tab contextual area      ( Screen shot attached for reference)    Actual: Page Menu appears.     Do Windows and Linux shows page menu below the tab contextual area ?  No  It doesn't opens. It opens only via Toolbar - Page menu     Note: This doesn't harm us in any case  Just logging to track to get the uniformity with other   platforms behavior with mac.   </pre>
