<title>Issue 25892 -   chromium -    Empty body setInterval(...  0) causes 100% CPU use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The follow test page:    &lt;script&gt;  setInterval(function() {}  0);  &lt;/script&gt;    will cause CPU use to sit at 100%  sometimes  if I leave it alone on the latest dev   channel release on my very fast Windows 7 box.  I've verified that the clamping to   4ms is working correct and that it's not V8's garbage collector going crazy  looks   like something else is horribly wrong.  I haven't been able to repro on OS X  but   given how unreliably this happens with the simple test page I don't want to say   anything definitive about that just yet.    I think the root cause of this is also behind lots of the various 100% CPU reports   seen on various sites (gmail  nytimes  etc) since it's very easy to leak a   setInterval(). </pre>
