<title>Issue 28596 -   chromium -    Extensions page uses 'binary sort' when listing extensions as a tie breaker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/browser/resources/extenions_ui.html has the following:    function renderTemplate(extensionsData) {    // Sort by order specified in the data or (if equal) then sort by    // extension name (case-insensitive).    extensionsData.extensions.sort(function(a  b) {      if (a.order == b.order) {        a = a.name.toLowerCase();        b = b.name.toLowerCase();        return a &lt; b ? -1 : (a &gt; b ? 1 : 0);      } else {        return a.order &lt; b.order ? -1 : 1;      }    });    Obviously  this &quot;binary&quot; comparison does not work in most  if not all    languages.      This is the 2nd real-life case that requires some i18n apis (e.g.   formatting and sorting) available for DOM UI via Javascript bindings.     Another is <a title="recently closed tabs text is not localized for all plural formats "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21407">bug 21407</a> (and see also <a title="Unfortunate translation of &quot;N Tabs&quot; in the New Tab Page" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25508"> bug 25508 </a>).     ChromeOS apps may need them as well (depending on how they're written).     I'll file a meta bug on the issue. </pre>
