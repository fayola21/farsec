<title>Issue 39486 -   chromium -    Possible that google web toolkit broke chrome frame installation? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) unknown  WebKit	533.3  V8	2.1.4.1  using IE6    chrome frame was working great! I installed google web toolkit  more   specifically  I installed the plugin for debugging into chrome. Maybe   coincidental  but after chrome frame will not open a page. If I go to a URL   that has the special headers  the hour glass shows and the IE window is   blank but nothing ever happens. If I try gcf:<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a> I get a   &quot;The page cannot be displayed&quot; message.    I have to get this working  so I'm going to uninstall chrome frame and   reinstall  and if that works I'll let you know. </pre>
