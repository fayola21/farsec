<title>Issue 39213 -   chromium -    KeyboardAccessTest tests are failing on the Interactive build bot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> KeyboardAccessTest.TestMenuKeyboardAccess and   KeyboardAccessTest.TestAltMenuKeyboardAccess are failing on Windows on the   interactive build bot.    The test succeeds when I run it locally and succeeds on the Vista build bots   when I made it a ui_test. Need to figure out why it doesn't work on the   interactive test bot.    The tests are marked as FLAKY for now  just so I can gather a little more   information about how they run.   </pre>
