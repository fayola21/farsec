<title>Issue 37236 -   chromium -    Auto translation feature is unavailable for english pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1021 beta (40167)  URLs (if applicable) : any english language site  Other browsers tested: chrome-specific      1. In options-&gt;languages i'm set preffered language: russian (cause it's my   native language  and i don't need any translations for this)  2. sets language for chrome menus in _english_  cause i want use english   interface (in many cases it's more comfortable for all applications  not   only chrome)      I want have auto translation feature on english page.        It doesnt enable auto translate feature  cause i set same interface   language. i think this feature must independent.    PS: If i suppress specific language translation in options - i don't have   any way to revert changes... </pre>
