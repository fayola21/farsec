<title>Issue 42694 -   chromium -    Implement speculative preconnection to subresource sites when history indicates it is likely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently &quot;learn&quot; about subresources and speculatively pre-resolve domain   names for &quot;expected&quot; subresources.  This feature attempts to go one further   and preconnect (create an open TCP/IP connection  which would otherwise take   at least one Round Trip Time) when we think it is very likely that we'll need   content (and hence a connection) from a secondary domain/port </pre>
