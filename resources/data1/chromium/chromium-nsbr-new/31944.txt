<title>Issue 31944 -   chromium -    Segoe UI font produces weird displacement in the URL bar in linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.296.0 (35891)    &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?    1. Set the GTK font to Segoe UI 9 (you may have to use -ubuntu   or -cleartype patches  as the vanilla freetype2/cairo/libxft builds   have problems with Segoe UI)  2. Type in the URL bar or select existing text with mouse or   keyboard or just move the text cursor with the arrows while in the   URL bar    &gt; What is the expected result?    Text shouldn't vibrate.    &gt; What happens instead?    With each letter/arrow press the text in the url bar goes up or   down and while the LMB is pressed it vibrates constantly.    &gt; Please provide any additional information below. Attach a  &gt; screenshot if possible.    I understand that Segoe UI isn't your typical linux font  however I   use it system-wide and everywhere else it works fine. A font-  chooser inside Chromium would be nice too.    Also  I'm not using any DE  so the configuration comes from .gtkrc-  2.0. Relevant entries are:    style &quot;user-font&quot; {  	font_name = &quot;Segoe UI 9&quot;  }  widget_class &quot;*&quot; style &quot;user-font&quot;  gtk-font-name=&quot;Segoe UI 9&quot;  gtk-xft-antialias = 1  gtk-xft-hinting = 1  gtk-xft-hintstyle = hintslight  gtk-xft-rgba = rgb    I've also tried setting it via XSETTINGS  same result. </pre>
