<title>Issue 32464 -   chromium -    Task manager shows an added 0.5% CPU usage for each process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.300.0 (36394) (Chromium Mac nightly build)      (not applicable)      1. Start Activity Monitor  2. Start Task Manager  3. Compare CPU usage of the Chromium processes      The CPU usage should be mostly similar.      Notice that the Task Manager shows an added 0.5% CPU usage for each   process.    I've noticed this when I first tried the Task Manager (fixed in <a title="The Task Manager is not implemented" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13156"> bug 13156 </a>).   Each extension has a CPU usage of 0.5% even though nothing happens in   the browser. Comparing this with the Activity Monitor display  I've seen   that the Chromium main process also has an added 0.5% CPU usage in the   Task Manager window. It looks like a consistent behavior for all processes.    This has been noticed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 (not sure if it happens on other   platforms). </pre>
