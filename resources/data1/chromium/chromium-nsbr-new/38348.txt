<title>Issue 38348 -   chromium -    Mac: Should share more code between cooke tree and cookie prompt dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The cookie prompt dialog now works on mac (any time after approx <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=41700">r41700</a>)  but there is a chunk of   code that is duplicated between the prompt dialog and the cookie tree that should be refactored so   that it's shared. This should be done before further cookie tree/prompt functionality is added on   the mac  e.g. appcache support. </pre>
