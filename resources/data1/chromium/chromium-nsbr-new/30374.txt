<title>Issue 30374 -   chromium -    Partial autodirectionality in the Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this is a split from <a title="Omnibox should support autodirectionality on all platforms"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14239">Issue 14239</a> (Omnibox should support autodirectionality   on all platforms)    since there are many difficulties with the autodirectionality concept in   the Omnibox     how about a less fancy implementation to solve the following common   scenario:  Using the regular chrome UI (not the mirrored one)    1. Ctrl+RightShift in the Omnibox to change the alignment to the Right  2. Type something in Hebrew to search Google for  3. Press Enter  4. The search string in the Omnibox will be replaced by a Google search URL   but the alignment will stay right aligned    i think a search URL should appear left aligned once it replaces a right   aligned search string </pre>
