<title>Issue 27217 -   chromium -    layout tests failing because java is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These files were originally cloned from <a title="Java plugin does not work" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24193"> bug 24193 </a>  which itself came from:   http://buganizer/issue?id=879449   although it appears to have nothing to do   with that bug.    These tests expect Java to be disabled  but Chrome doesn't have any concept   of enabling or disabling Java. We need to decide if we should WONTFIX these.    // TODO(joshia): Need some changes to the test shell in order to support  // Java applet related unit tests. So disable the following for now.  <a title="Java plugin does not work" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24193"> BUG24193 </a> : LayoutTests/fast/replaced/applet-disabled-positioned.html = FAIL  <a title="Java plugin does not work" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24193"> BUG24193 </a> : LayoutTests/fast/replaced/applet-rendering-java-disabled.html =   FAIL   </pre>
