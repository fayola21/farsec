<title>Issue 30030 -   chromium -    Feature req: permission dialog to see (modify) permissions for an extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a new Permission dialog per each extension  so I could see   and even limit the reach of an extension.    Use-cases:  * I want to review what permissions I've given to an extension.  * I want an extension to work only on http  but the one I've installed does   both http and https.  * I want to allow an extension to run also in Incognito mode  * (more?) </pre>
