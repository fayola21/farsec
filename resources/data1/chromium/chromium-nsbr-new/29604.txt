<title>Issue 29604 -   chromium -    'Bookmark synch' link on NNTP does nothing  when synched. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)    -Sync your bookmarks.  -Open a NNTP and click on the link 'Bookmarks sync' of Promo info bubble.    Isue:   Right now  it does nothing.    Expected:  We should either   i) show the Chrome Options/Personal stuff tab  ( as we do from B'Manager   and Menu) (OR)  ii) We should simply hide the 'bookmarks sync' link from the promo bar  in   case if bookmarks are synced.   </pre>
