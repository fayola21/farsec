Go to 4.0.239.0 (31235)  2. Try downloading Mac version        Orb is downloaded.      Chromium claims download is complete after 2.9MB  yielding an invalid   image.  I first tried downloading over a bad connection  so the transfer might have   been broken. Repeated attempts alway finished with success  but at 2.9MB.   I tried restarting Chromium  and updated the binary.    </pre>
