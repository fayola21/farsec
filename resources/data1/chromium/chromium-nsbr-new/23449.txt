<title>Issue 23449 -   chromium -    CSS dropdown menu vanishes on moving to submenu unless moving quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (27622)  URLs (if applicable) : internal  but reproduced on external urls by playing  with font size           Safari 4: OK       Opera 10: BROKEN (but the entire CSS is  Opera just fails at rendering  in general)      Firefox 2: OK      Firefox 3: OK    Firefox 3.5: OK   Firefox 3.7a: OK           IE 6: OK (uses hover fix)           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK  Webkit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=48794">r48794</a>: BROKEN      1. hover mouse over menu item  2. move mouse slowly onto sub item  sub list vanishes      Sub list is accessible        Sub list vanishes.      The issue as far as I can tell is that the positioned sub list has been  placed just slightly outside the area of the parent list item.  This is most likely a font-size related rounding issue as the parent is  inline and font sized and the two are in fact side by side.  However  no  other browser messes this up  not even Safari 4 which is using an only  slightly older version of Webkit.    Furthermore  going to a similar list on a working website and using ctrl-+  to enlarge the font eventually yielded a huge font with a 1px gap below.   In Chrome  this 1px gap was sufficient to trigger similar behaviour.   Interestingly it was not in Firefox which continued to maintain the hover.    Since Webkit nightly is also broken sounds like some sort of regression to  me.  I will file a Webkit bug as well and try to work up a testcase.   </pre>
