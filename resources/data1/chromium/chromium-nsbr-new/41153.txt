<title>Issue 41153 -   chromium -    CMD+W on OSX sometimes causes all tabs in current window to close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta      I can't reliably reproduce  but sometimes closing the current tab using CMD+w closes all tabs open   in the current window. This doesn't affect other open windows. and it doesn't happen when the x is   clicked via the mouse next to a tab. </pre>
