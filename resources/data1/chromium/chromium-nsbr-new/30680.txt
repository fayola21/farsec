<title>Issue 30680 -   chromium -    Feature Download breakout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello.    I was searching the web to find if there is any suggestion forum  but this is   all i found.    I was thinking of the download bar. Its really great  but sometimes you want   to close all the browser windows  but keep on downloading. Is there any   posibilitys to maybe create a function like &quot;break out download to own   window.&quot;?   </pre>
