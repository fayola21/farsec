<title>Issue 27836 -   chromium -    Some Korean strings sound rather awkward - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 'Edit' is consistently translated as '��__��_��_' (Modification) rather than more   established '��__��_��__��_' (literally 'edit') in other OS/apps.     Window is translated to '��_��__' on Mac  but Safari uses '��__��_��_��__��_'.     &quot;History&quot; is translated as '��_��_��_��_�Ǖ�_ ��__��_��_��__��_'  but '��_��_��_��_ ��_��_��_���' is better (Safari does   that  too). This is not just for Mac but also for other platforms.     There are a couple of other strings I'd rather change. I'll file an internal bug.     This is just to keep track of them.      </pre>
