<title>Issue 37716 -   chromium -    Google docs redirect loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Log into gmail  2. Click on &quot;Documents&quot; to go to Google docs   3. See &quot;This webpage has a redirect loop&quot;        I expect to see the Google docs menu.    I get a similar failure for any Google docs document.    I'm observing this on Chrome 5 Beta (5.0.307.11) on MacOS (Google corp   notebook) but I'm not sure it is Chrome specific. I've seen similar   misbehavior before  and suspect at that time it was due to profile   corruption.       </pre>
