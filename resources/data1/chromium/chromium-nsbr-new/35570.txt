<title>Issue 35570 -   chromium -    Paint issues with bookmarks deletion having large number of bookmarks. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810)  OS: XP    -I've around 400 bookmarks on other bookmarks folder.  -Open the other bookmarks list  right click on a bookmarks on the list and   select 'delete' from the interstitial context menu.    Issue:  As shown in the screenshot  the item is deleted  but drop-down list is not   properly repainted. If you mouse hover few times over the deleted item-  space  then you will get empty area in space of the deleted item.  If you   close the list and reopen  then every thing will be fine.    PS: This happens with or without sync. </pre>
