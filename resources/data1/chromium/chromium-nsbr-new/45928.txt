<title>Issue 45928 -   chromium -    Need to click on close button twice to close tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> No repro yet.    When I first run Chrome it works as expected. After heavy use  after a while  tabs no longer close   with one click of the close button  but it takes two clicks to close them. (Similarly with command-W.)   In addition  &quot;Quit&quot; doesn't work; it hangs indefinitely.    6.0.422.0 dev </pre>
