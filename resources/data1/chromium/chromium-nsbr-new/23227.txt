<title>Issue 23227 -   chromium -    Gmail file selection dialog is hidden behind browser window after application switch. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 219.3 (Developer Build 27338)  URLs (if applicable) : www.gmail.com  OS version               :Mac OS X 10.6.1  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: OK - File selection window is modal for the whole program.    Firefox 3.x: OK - File selection window is modal for the whole program.      1. Go to Gmail  compose a new mail or reply to an existing thread.  2. Click &quot;Attach a file&quot;.   3. Switch to another program and switch back.  4. Attempt to switch back to the file open dialog by using the window   menu or cmd-`      File open dialog should appear in Window menu  or cmd-` should switch   to it  or file open dialog should be a modal panel instead of a window.      The topmost normal window in Chromium comes to the front when   switching back  which makes it difficult to find the file open dialog if the   browser window is large.    Screenshot is attached. </pre>
