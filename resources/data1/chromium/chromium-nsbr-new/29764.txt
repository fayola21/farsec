<title>Issue 29764 -   chromium -    base/third_party/NSPR README.chromium doesn't say what it is - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> $ cat base/third_party/nspr/README.chromium   The original code is the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR)  licensed under  the MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/</a>).      This README should include:  - What it is   - What version we have   - What changes we locally carry (if any).      Assigning to wtc since he has a commit that mentions merging code. </pre>
