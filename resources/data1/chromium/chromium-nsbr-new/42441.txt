<title>Issue 42441 -   chromium -    Browser action dragging should work like NTP and tab dragging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.387.0 (45474)      1. Drag browser action around browser action container      The browser action should &quot;slide&quot; around the container  like thumbnails do on   the NTP  or like tabs do in the tabstrip.      Dragging is very jagged. The ugly drag icon is used. </pre>
