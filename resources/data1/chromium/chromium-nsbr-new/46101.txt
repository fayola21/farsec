Have lots of bookmarks.  2. Click on BMB chevron and do right click on 3rd or 4th bookmark and select delete.      Expected result:  2.1 There is no change in the position of menu's first bookmarks.    Actual result:  2.2 Menu's first bookmark hides under the 'Up Arrow' and first bookmark is not accessible.    Note: we are seeing a crash on deleting bookmarks (10-20) from  BMB's chevron menu  with different stack trace. Not sure if fixing this bug will resolve this crash. </pre>
