<title>Issue 30731 -   chromium -    Chrome sometimes ties up all my memory WITHOUT reporting it to Windows Task Manager. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Open a couple chrome windows - each with a couple tabs.   2.Leave them open several hours.        Normal browsing  memory usage of between 2 and 100 MB per instance.        Although Task Manager reports expected memory usage  the graph showing   memory usage climbs to the top and Windows struggles to manage the cache   and keep functioning.    Upon quitting ALL chrome instances  the memory is recovered dramatically.    It doesn't work to close a window and relaunch it  then close the other and   then relaunch that one - there must be a period in which there are no open   chrome windows.  Once that happens  within a few seconds  the memory usage   plumets  then recovers partially.        <b>Please provide
