<title>Issue 34206 -   chromium -    No slow I/O done while holding syncapi::WriteTransaction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The UI thread tries to acquire WTs  so we have to make sure all slow I/O is   deferred until after the transaction falls out of scope  likely by moving a copy   of state aside and persisting synchronously afterwards.    All uses of WT need to be audited for this. </pre>
