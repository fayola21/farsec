<title>Issue 26589 -   chromium -    If you are on the beta or dev release branch you should see this in the about dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    Currently there is an dev release 4.0.223.11 and there is an beta release   of 4.0.223.16.   Because I saw a higher version was released (223.16 &gt; 223.11) I tried to   update (I am on the dev channel myself). But the Aboutbox told me that I   had the newest version.   This made me confused  because I thought there might be something wrong   with the updater of the dev channel. Re-reading showed me that only the   beta has been updated.    But for this reason it would be nice if you would see a text saying you are   on the beta or dev channel. I shouldn't show this for the stable  but   surely for the beta and dev.  </pre>
