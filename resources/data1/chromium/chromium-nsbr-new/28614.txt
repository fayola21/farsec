<title>Issue 28614 -   chromium -    &quot;Download Locations&quot; should not include directories with read only permissions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.11 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32790">r32790</a>  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open Chrome preferences &gt; Under the hood.  2. Change the Downloads location to /Applications.  3. Download a file and select &quot;Show in Finder&quot; from its menu.    Expected:  The file should be downloaded to /Applications.    Actual:  The file is downloaded to the previous user directory.    Note:  This may be because we don't have write access to the selected directory. So we should not allow   user to select directories to which we cannot write anything.   </pre>
