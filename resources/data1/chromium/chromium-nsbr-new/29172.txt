<title>Issue 29172 -   chromium -    Scrollbar drag handle should stand out more - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.260.0 (Developer Build 33308)  OS + version : Linux  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): good  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): good      1. open any webpage that needs scrolling (best to test with a very long    not too dark page)  2. try to *quickly* find the scrollbar handle      NOTE: there has already be a bug about the scrollbar look on linux and back    then a few things were fixed.     One thing that was not fixed is the scrollbar color  which is just gray   instead of the color most GTK themes use. Visually this is not a big deal    but it feels like a big usability issue to me: you have to actively search   for the handle along the scrollbar length because the handle and background   look so similar. As said  this becomes more obvious as pages get longer and   the drag handle gets smaller. Also  screens with low contrast make it   worse.    Coloring the handle using the color specified in the GTK theme would be   ideal  but any other way to make it stand out more would already help a lot   I think. </pre>
