<title>Issue 31601 -   chromium -    Complete browser crash when navigating to heavily populated directory in Open/Save File dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.290.0~svn20100105r35507-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic  OS + version : Kubuntu Karmic 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : KWin (KDE SC 4.4b2)      1. Spawn Open/Save File dialog  such as by finding an image on the web    right clicking and picking Save Image As  or by trying to attach a file to   a bug report  2. Navigate to a directory with lots of files  such as /usr/bin (4223 files   on this machine)  3. Observe complete browser crash while it's listing the directory content      Directory contents gets listed and I can safely save/open my file or   navigate elsewhere.      Complete browser crash (as opposed to tab ohsnap) with backtraces as   attached output to terminal.    Unsure of what is triggering this. It happens every time I try to save a   file to my pictures folder  and I can avoid it entirely by rolling back to   4.0.269.0~svn20091211r34346-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic. At first I thought it was   a thumbnail thing  but it happens even when trying to attach a file to this   bug report.    Worth mentioning is that I'm running UIM for Japanese input  and I have an   extensive fontconfig ~/.fonts.conf file to get unicode fallback (bitmaps)   and font replacement as I like it (in other apps  seeing as Chromium   doesn't support fontconfig yet). I have tried disabling both UIM and   renaming my ~/.fonts.conf file in case either were the culprit  but the   behavior persists.    Attaching one backtrace from a normal crash with both .fonts.conf present   and UIM enabled  and one &quot;clean&quot; backtrace where neither are a factor. </pre>
