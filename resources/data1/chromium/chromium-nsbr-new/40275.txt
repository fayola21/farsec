<title>Issue 40275 -   chromium -    Mac bookmark drag into web content causes sad tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. www.google.com as first bookmark in always-on bookmark bar.  2. browse to www.google.com  3. Command-L to select-all in the location bar.  4. Put mouse over bookmark.  5. Hit enter and quickly drag www.google.com bookmark down into web content.        Expected output is nothing at all.  Sometimes I get a sad tab.  My use-case is wiring up drag-and-drop on the location icon  but this looks like the same problem.  It's pretty timing   dependent  usually you have to drag pretty quickly to make it happen.    I can also repro pretty consistently by double-click-drag the bookmark into the content.    Renderer report is:  ASSERTION FAILED: !m_currentDragData.get()  (/usr/local/google/home/shess/chromium/chromium-git/src/third_party/WebKit/WebKit/chromium/src/WebViewImpl.cpp:1507 virtual WebKit::WebDragOperation   WebKit::WebViewImpl::dragTargetDragEnter(const WebKit::WebDragData&amp;  int  const WebKit::WebPoint&amp;  const WebKit::WebPoint&amp;  WebKit::WebDragOperationsMask))    The function is WebViewImpl::dragTargetDragEnter()  and the assertion basically looks to be that dragTargetDragEnter() has not already been called.  I suspect that there is a race condition   in navigation such that the previous page enters dragTargetDragEnter()  then is navigated  and then dragTargetDragEnter() is entered for the new page  within the same renderer.  Or   perhaps the browser is losing state and sending a duplicate drag enter? </pre>
