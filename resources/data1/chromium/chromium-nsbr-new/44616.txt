<title>Issue 44616 -   chromium -    AutoFill user needs to clear fields in an AutoFilled form - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Scenario 1: User needs to clear fields in an AutoFilled form  1.  Given that I have filled a form using AutoFill  2.  When I click in one of the filled fields with the intent to edit its value  3.  Then I should see a list of AutoFill suggestions (as usual)  4.    And I should see an additional &quot;Clear form&quot; menu item (after the separator  before the   &quot;AutoFill Options...&quot; item).    Expected:    I see the &quot;Clear form&quot; menu item.    Actual:    I don't see the &quot;Clear form&quot; menu item.    Scenario 2: User chooses &quot;Clear form&quot; option when editing a previously filled field  1.  Given that I have filled a form using AutoFill  2.    And I have clicked on previously filled field  3.  When I choose the &quot;Clear form&quot; menu item  4.  Then I should see all previously filled (yellow) fields cleared of their values.    Expected:    I should see all previously filled (yellow) fields cleared of their values.    Actual:    No &quot;Clear form&quot; menu item currently  so not possible.   </pre>
