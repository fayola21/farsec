<title>Issue 44378 -   chromium -    System-level toast should write client code to HKLM  not HKCU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Trigger toast on a system-level install  2.  Observe that the client code is written to HKCU    When this happens  Omaha does not report this value  since Omaha is looking   at HKLM.  The value is written fine to HKCU but is never reported.    If possible  we should write this key to HKLM if it is a system-level   install. </pre>
