<title>Issue 28497 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data is focused on wrong element by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32475">r32475</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu Linux 9.10 Karmic Koala  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Metacity (GNOME)    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: The steps outlined below will clear   browsing data on Chrome 3.0.195.33 for Windows via the keyboard  but   produce different behaviour on Linux.      1. Hold down Ctrl + Shift + Del  or select 'Clear Browsing Data' from the   Options in the wrench menu.  2. Press Enter      The above steps should clear browsing data  as is the behaviour on Chrome   stable for Windows.      The text label of the first checkbox  'Clear browsing history' is   highlighted instead of the 'Clear Browsing Data' button. This causes the   Enter key to toggle the aforementioned field instead of submitting the   selected options for execution. In order to perform the expected action    Shift + Tab has to be used  or Tab has to be pressed 8 times  and then   followed by the Enter key. This is a minor issue  but is still rather   annoying from an accessibility point of view. </pre>
