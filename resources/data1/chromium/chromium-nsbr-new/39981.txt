<title>Issue 39981 -   chromium -    SSO: WebSEAL complains about using NTLM authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> vegitto.ru@gmail.com added a response to <a title="Automatic integrated windows authentication (aka automatic NTLM / Negotiate Auth support)"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19">bug #19</a> - moved to a separate bug   for tracking purposes.    ===  [SSO] Works like a charm when browsing external Internet sites (i.e. it   doesn't ask to  authenticate with the proxy) but when browsing some internal applications I   still get  the following error:    Error Text: DPWWA2403E Your browser supplied NTLM authentication data. NTLM   is not  supported by WebSEAL. Please make sure your browser is configured to use   Integrated  Windows Authentication.    I ran the tests on Windows XP SP3.  ===    I'm guessing that in this case Negotiate is falling back to NTLM rather   than Kerberos to handle Negotiate.  </pre>
