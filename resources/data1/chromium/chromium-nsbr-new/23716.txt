<title>Issue 23716 -   chromium -    Dragging web contents is anywhere between weird and broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1      1a. On the ntp  drag a thumbnail around or  1b. Go to <a href="http://html5demos.com/drag">http://html5demos.com/drag</a> and drag something around        On the NTP  it's weird that the &quot;You're dragging something&quot; cursor is   displayed  as the drag is already handled by javascript.    On <a href="http://html5demos.com/drag">http://html5demos.com/drag</a>   the boxes are shown attached to the   cursor in safari  but are not in chrome.    Also  the demo doesn't seem to work in chrome at all as the boxes don't   disappear on drop on the trashbin.          </pre>
