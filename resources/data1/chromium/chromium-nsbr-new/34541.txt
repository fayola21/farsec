<title>Issue 34541 -   chromium -    Pages become unresponsive while loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch Google Chrome  2. Enter any URL   3. Wait while Google Chrome attempts to load site/page at chosen address        Pages fully load after all data has been received.        Pages are partially loaded (to differing) degrees  before progress halts.  After this occurs it is no longer possible to click on any links or  interact with any content contained within the pages in question  nor can  the tab containing said content be closed. After a certain amount of time  has elapsed  Chrome returns the error message: &quot;The following page(s) have  become unresponsive. You can wait for them to become responsive or kill  them.&quot; If the user elects to close Chrome at this point  the application  closes  but the process continues to run unless a kill signal is manually  sent by the user. Deleting all the contents of .config/google-chrome and  purging/reinstalling Google-Chrome does not alleviate the problem.      <b>Please provide
