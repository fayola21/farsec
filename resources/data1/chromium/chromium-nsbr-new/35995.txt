<title>Issue 35995 -   chromium -    Don't honor appears preference changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open text edit  type enough lines to get a scroll bar.  2. Load a long we page that scrolls  3. Open the Appearance System Preferences  4. Change the scroll bar arrow setting (together/at top &amp; bottom) to the   other setting.        In realtime TextEdit will update the scroll bar to match  chrome just sits   there.  We need to listen for the notifications and message the info across   to all renderers.    This is also true of the Appearance (blue or graphite) and the Highlight   Color.  Not sure if we want individual bugs for each.  Might be true for   other settings (font smoothing).    Marking this a UI  but it probably goes all the way into webkit. </pre>
