<title>Issue 29124 -   chromium -    Support Unity Player plugin on 10.5 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Another placeholder for a currently-unsupporte plugin: Unity Player doesn't work right now.    Oddly  it asks about CoreAnimation  CoreGraphics  and Cocoa event models--but then sets the   models to QD+Carbon (explicitly) even though we say we support the latter two. </pre>
