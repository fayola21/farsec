<title>Issue 26054 -   chromium -    Shortcut to quit app shouldn't be sent to renderers (Ctrl-shift-q on linux  cmd-q on mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="Figure out how to deal with sluggish renderers blocking accelerators" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5496"> issue 5496 </a>  comments 49 and 50. Windows doesn't have a &quot;quit app&quot;   shortcut.    Since this should be small  I think one bug for both mac and linux is ok. </pre>
