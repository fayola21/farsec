<title>Issue 34120 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't show Choose File button after clicking Attach File while creating new mail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : my mailbox  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): not checked there  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: works as expected    The problem appears after about 10-12 hours of &quot;stand-by&quot; and some   hours of active work. Unfortunatelly I don't know actually what steps will   make Chrome do this.  But after closing and reopening it again (doesn't matter how much tabs   opens) it works.      Button Choose File visible and working      Only Attach Another File visible. </pre>
