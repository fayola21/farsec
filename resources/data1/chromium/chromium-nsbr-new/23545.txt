<title>Issue 23545 -   chromium -    Incorrect rounding when size is specified in percentage  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. browse to attached page   2. wait for completion of the onload event handler  3. check the report generated at the bottom of the page          All computations should be marked as &quot;correct&quot; in the report.    In the first container  the red DIV elements (width specified as   percentage) should be squares of exactly the same width as the green DIV   element (width specified in pixels) above it.    In the second container  the black DIV elements (width specified as   percentage) should have the same width as the green DIV element (width   specified in pixels) above them.    For items with a width specified as a percentage  the actual pixel width   should correspond exactly to the actual pixel width of its container   multiplied by the percentage divided by 100 and rounded to the nearest   integer.           There are plenty of &quot;INCORRECT&quot; computations in the report.    In the first container  the red DIV elements (width specified as   percentage) are one pixel less than the the green DIV element (width   specified in pixels) above it.    In the second container  some black DIV elements (width specified as   percentage) does not have the same width as the green DIV element (width   specified in pixels) above them.    The actual pixel width of element specified as a percentage corresponds to   an inconsistent rounding.    <b>Please provide
