<title>Issue 30866 -   chromium -    kobus.co.kr seat assignment chart does not work properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to <a href="http://www.kobus.co.kr">http://www.kobus.co.kr</a>  (Korea's inter-city highway bus ticket reservation site)  2. In the upper-left corner      a. select departure city (��__��_��_��_��__��_) : say '��_��_��_��__(500)'     b. select destination (��_��_��_��_��__��_): say  '��_�ҕ�__��_(020)'     c. select departure time : leave year and month alone and set the day to tomorrow (say  21st).   Set the time to 09:00    d. select '��__��_�б��__��_��_��_' (3rd choice) for  '�б��_��__'    e. for '��___��__��_' (# of passengers)  set '��__��_��_��_��_' (adult) to 1 and leave '��_��_��_��_'(child) alone    f. click the orange button ('��___��_��_��__��_ ��__��__/��__��___')  3. When a pop-up box pops up with terms and conditions  press enter or click the default choice   ('Ok' - approve)  4. In the body of the next page  there will be two tables. The first table lists the bus schedule   matching the criteria selected in step 2. 4th column is # of available seats('��__��_��_��_��_��_��') and 5th   column has '��_�_��_�' (select) button.  5. Click '��_�_��_�'(select) button in one of rows with seats available less than 28.  6. Click 'OK' (the default choice)  for two pop-up boxes that show up in sequence      What's expected:     - It's possible to tell available seats from seats already taken by a slight difference in color.     Actual:    It's impossible to tell the difference.     Safari  Chrome (on Mac OS X) and the default browser on Adroid have this problem while Fireofx   3.5 on Mac OS X does not. So  it's likely to be a webkit issue and has to be reported in the   upstream.        </pre>
