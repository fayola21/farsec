<title>Issue 40260 -   chromium -    Add new preferences API to pref_service - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pref_service currently has no concept of whether a preference is centrally-  managed  or &quot;unchangeable&quot;.      For users who have settings that are centrally managed  we need a way for the   UI to show options that are &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;greyed out&quot;  so an API to detect   whether a setting is user-changeable or not is required.    Adding this is dependent on refactoring the prefs to be abstract (and having   a platform-specific implementation underneath) </pre>
