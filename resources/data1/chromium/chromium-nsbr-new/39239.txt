<title>Issue 39239 -   chromium -    third_party/mozilla doesn't pass tools/licenses.py - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> $ ./tools/licenses.py | grep ^third_party/mozilla  third_party/mozilla: missing README.chromium    There's a README.chromium one directory lower  but that file doesn't make   the license explicit.  If you run ./tools/licenses.py it'll walk you through   it  as well as report on other directories that pass which you can use as a   reference.    Assigning to pinkerton since it seems you checked in the files. </pre>
