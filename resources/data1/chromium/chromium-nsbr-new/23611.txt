<title>Issue 23611 -   chromium -    Refresh all tabs button/shortcut (feature request) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: Nope    Firefox 3.x: Nope           IE 7: Nope           IE 8: Nope      I've always wanted a browser to incorporate some sort of &quot;Refresh all tabs&quot;   button/keyboard shortcut. With Chrome's open community I think that could   easily be implemented  it would also prove useful to those of us that keep   up with the news and such. Or forum-goers who want to refresh those tabs   without switching  it could make a 15 click job a one-click or shortcut   away!   </pre>
