<title>Issue 37810 -   chromium -    SocketStream should use socket pools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SocketStream should use socket pools instead of using sockets directly.    They should use their own pools without per host connection limits  but   should enforce a per-machine connection limit.    The fix for this should also remove the deprecated constructors to various   socket types (like SOCKSClientSocket) that take ClientSocket instead of   ClientSocketHandle. </pre>
