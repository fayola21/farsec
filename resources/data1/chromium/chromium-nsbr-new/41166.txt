<title>Issue 41166 -   chromium -    Scrollbar in OSX triggers inconsistent auto margin  layout off by 1 pixel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Create two divs with no width specified. In each  put a div of the same fixed width  set to   margin: auto;  2.Make one page with a small amount of content. Make another page with enough content in the   bottom div to force the scrollbar to appear.  3. If you inspect the elements  you'll see that while the computed margins for each nested div are   the same  as rendered one of these will shift by 1 pixel relative to the other. This is similar to a   bug in IE when using auto: margins and adjusting the window size.                <b>Please provide
