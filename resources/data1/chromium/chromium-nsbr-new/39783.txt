<title>Issue 39783 -   chromium -    100% CPU usage and selective responce to user input when working when sharepoint-based webpage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.8 beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A (intranet)               IE 6: OK    I had Chrome almost stopped responding several times and eating 90-100% cpu.   It happened when I used sharepoint portal located inside company intranet.   Process eating 100% cpu is main browser process and if it's killed    everything goes down and everything entered in forms is lost forever. Same   issue happened on some internet sites  but not so frequently  and it wasn't   same site all the time. I believe it's somehow depends on how much JS website   uses. </pre>
