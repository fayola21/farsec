<title>Issue 27379 -   chromium -    File &gt; New Window disabled while any sheet is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a new window  - go to a page  - save    expected:  - File &gt; New window is enabled so I can open a new window.    actual:  - Item is disabled.    I should be able to create new windows since the sheet is only window modal.   This appears true of any modal (edit bookmark is another). </pre>
