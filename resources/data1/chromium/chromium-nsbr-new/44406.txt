<title>Issue 44406 -   chromium -    (Dummy Bug Report) Internal Flash crashed on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Like <a title="Browser actions update their icon too frequently" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27485"> bug 27485 </a>  but for libgcflashplayer.so.    This is just a dummy crash report for Flash player crashing on Linux. This  is just so we have a bug to associate stack traces with to make it easier   for me to easily identify internal flash bugs. </pre>
