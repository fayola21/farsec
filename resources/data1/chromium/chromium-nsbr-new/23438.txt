<title>Issue 23438 -   chromium -    Build the Page Info window dynamically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Views and GTK build the PageInfo window dynamically from the shared   model.  Mac already uses the model  so we should be able to do the same   thing.  This way if new sections get added  title changed  etc. things should   &quot;just work&quot; because the data going into the window is shared. </pre>
