<title>Issue 41641 -   chromium -    Cant reorder with the bookmark(which is dragged thumbnail from NTP) on BMB  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.3 (Build 10D578)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.6 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44316">r44316</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 113    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1. Go to New tab page and drag a thumbnail and drop the bookmark in middle of any existing   bookmarks on Bookmark bar.    Actual: On dropping that  it creates the bookmark in the end of BMB as the last entry  instead of   our desired location. Reordering failed.    Expected: Reordering of bookmarks on drag drop of thumbnail should work    Note: Windows reorders as expected in this case.   </pre>
