Open any web page  bring up the DevTools window  2. In the Elements panel click the &quot;magnifier glass&quot; button and point-and-  click any element in the web page    What is the expected output?  The clicked element is selected in the DOM tree  the DevTools window is   focused    What do you see instead?  The clicked element is selected in the DOM tree  the DevTools window is NOT   focused but rather stays in the background    This seems to be a side effect of <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31087">r31087</a> </pre>
