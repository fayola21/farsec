<title>Issue 24760 -   chromium -    Chromium tree status message should pre-populate the text box with the current status - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you open up the Chromium tree status page  most of the time you want to   augment the current tree status.    For example  change a word:    Tree is closed -&gt; Tree is open    Or  add a failing test:    Tree is open -&gt; Tree is open (Test -&gt; developer_foo)    ... or the reverse (remove a test that is no longer failing).        90% of the time I copy-paste the latest tree status and change it. It would save   a lot of time if we could pre-populate the text box with the latest status  to   avoid the constant copy-paste. </pre>
