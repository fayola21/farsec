<title>Issue 40103 -   chromium -    geolocation: track location arbitrator observers per frame rather than per renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the geolocation dispatcher is a single observer of the location   arbitrator  however it may be acting as  a proxy for multiple frames within   the corresponding rendering  each which may have different use high   accuracy settings.  When we implement arbitration &amp; support for high accuracy providers (i.e.   GPS) which also have high power requirements  we need to keep track at any   moment of the exact set of watchers and whether each is using high   accuracy  so that when one of them goes away we'll make the correct   evaluation on whether to keep the high accuracy providers running.    (This is not an visible issue in the current / M5 implementation as it only   supports a single  low accuracy provider.)    consider adding test cases with a mix of one-shot and location watching   clients  with a mix of low &amp; high accuracy.     </pre>
