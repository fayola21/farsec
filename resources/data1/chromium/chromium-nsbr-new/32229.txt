<title>Issue 32229 -   chromium -    Plugin focus events are sent too often - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we send plugins focus events on every mouse-down  even if they were already focused.   We should be able to send the event only if the plugin wasn't already focused.    I'm going to wait until after the next beta just in case there is some case I haven't though of where   we could get out of sync and the plugin would think it was not focused when we did  and it would   thus be temporarily unfocused. </pre>
