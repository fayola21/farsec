<title>Issue 25140 -   chromium -    One pixel gap above and below address bar in Mac popups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Kinda like <a title="OSX Omnibox border wrong in popup windows." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20244"> issue 20244 </a> but not the same.    Open a popup on the Mac and there's a transparent gap one pixel high above   and below the address bar.  (Good repro site: a &quot;comments&quot; link on one of the   Google Chrome Releases blog posts.) </pre>
