<title>Issue 24349 -   chromium -    Single clicking in the address bar should not highlight all text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.8    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Single click just inserts cursor  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):Single click selects all text  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ???      1. Go to any website in chrome  2. Single click in the address bar as if you were going to fix a typo        The cursor should be placed where I single clicked��_��_��_just like should always   happen with a single click in a text editable field.          A single click causes all the text to be highlighted  and thus causes me to   accidentally type over the whole URL rather than simply fix the typo.   </pre>
