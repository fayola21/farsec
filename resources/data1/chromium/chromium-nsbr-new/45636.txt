<title>Issue 45636 -   chromium -    PayPal treats Chromium as a mobile browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.424.0 (Developer Build 48706)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a>        Firefox 3.6: Works fine           IE 8: Works fine      1. Browse to www.paypal.com      Page should display proporly.      You get the mobile version of the page.    It looks like PayPal no longer recognizes Chromium and treats it as a   mobile browser. I sure whish web devs would treat their browser checks more   serious. So many sites filter Chrome out because they don't recognize it's   UserAgent. It would be really nice if the ability to spoof the UserAgent   could be added to the Plugin API. </pre>
