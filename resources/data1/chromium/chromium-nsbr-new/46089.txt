<title>Issue 46089 -   chromium -    &quot;Did you mean to go to&quot; link should be first in keyboard tab-key focus order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 6.0.422.0 (Official Build 48573)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: ghardy 2010040601  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit):64-bit  Window manager: ratpoison      1. Enter name of intranet webserver in url bar (bare; no scheme  no trailing slash).  2. Witness google search results come up; do nothing.  3. Witness &quot;Did you mean to go to&quot; bar come up.  4. Press TAB key      Focus goes to the &quot;did you mean to go to&quot; link  so that tab+enter goes to the originally-intended location instead of the google search.      Focus skips the &quot;did you mean&quot; link and goes directly to the first link on the google results page (&quot;Images&quot;).    Other notes:  Shift-tab does go backwards onto the &quot;did you mean&quot; link (good)  and ctrl-l and tab (after the &quot;did you mean&quot; bar is already up) goes to the &quot;did you mean&quot; link as well (also good). </pre>
