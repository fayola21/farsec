<title>Issue 39883 -   chromium -    Inspect Element with inline Developer Tools open causes Devtools to hang - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): Self-compiled 5.0.366.0   (43114)  Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: KDE      1. Open the Developer Tools on any page and make sure the screen in inline   (not a separate window)  2. Right click an element on the page and select &quot;Inspect Element&quot;  3. Developer Tools &quot;window&quot; has hung.    What is the expected result? The Developer Tools should jump to the element   in the DOM layout      What happens instead? The Developer Tools hangs.    If this test is repeated with the Developer Tools window detached it works   fine  with each &quot;Inspect Element&quot; function jumping to the relevant place in   the Tools window. It seems to only happen when the tools are inline in the   page. </pre>
