<title>Issue 35573 -   chromium -    Crash when using Wordpress editor (Mac 307) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry for the vagueness: I haven't repro'ed this bug myself.    Various blogs online (e.g. VentureBeat  ReadWriteWeb) report that the new 307   beta release has a bug that causes frequent crashes when using the Wordpress   editor.  This basically makes the browser unusable for a lot of bloggers.    Hopefully someone can repro and fix? </pre>
