<title>Issue 39797 -   chromium -    When triple-clicking to select text  the visually marked selection should be what you get if you copy  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199)  5.0.364.0 (Developer   Build 42899)             Safari 4: FAIL (identical with Chrome&amp;Chromium)    Firefox 3.6: OK (excellent)           IE 7: FAIL (copies invisible line breaks  otherwise OK)           IE 8: ?      1. Triple click to select a paragraph or line  2. Copy  then paste in notepad/similar text editor  3. Notice that you need to stay alert about whether you get or don't get   extra characters (line breaks) at the end of the copied word.      What I see marked is what I expect will get copied.      Oftentimes extra line breaks get copied.
