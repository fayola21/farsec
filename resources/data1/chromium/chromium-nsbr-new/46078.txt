<title>Issue 46078 -   chromium -    Don't let user change synced types while offline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You can change synced types while offline. This will cause a bad state to occur because the syncer will not be able to track changes to items prior to model association completing. However  while the syncer is offline  we can't get all updates for a datatype  thus causing model association never to complete. While the user is offline  they can then change lots of data around  which may be lost upon model association occuring.    Example:    1. Turn on only theme sync.  2. Go offline.  3. Turn on bookmark sync.  4. Delete all bookmarks.  5. Go online.  6. You expect the deletions to propagate  instead you probably get a merge. </pre>
