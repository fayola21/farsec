<title>Issue 31214 -   chromium -    Scrolling with scrollbars is sluggish - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium revisions 35078 and above  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: Firefox  Midori         Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1. update to any revision from 35078 and above  2. scroll using scrollbars      It should scroll without delays.      It feels like sluggish scrolling with middle-mouse button in Firefox.    ***    I don't know if this is limited only to chromium-rel-linux. Also  I don't   know exactly how to describe this sluggishness except that it resembles   middle-click scrolling in firefox. It needs to accelerate to certain scroll   speed and needs some time to slow down. If you scroll fast enough  the   scroll movements will be inverted of the mouse movements because of the   delay. Scrolling this way is very imprecise. Also  it could be that this is   noticable on slower notebook CPUs only.    I read the changelog related to when this bug began for me (it was <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35078">revision   35078</a>  because 35077 works fine): <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=35078    There were some changes in scrolling system which apparently caused this.   </pre>
