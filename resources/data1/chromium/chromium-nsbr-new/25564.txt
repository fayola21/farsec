<title>Issue 25564 -   chromium -    Turn renderer accessibility on by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. To enable renderer accessibility in Chrome  run chrome.exe with the flag  '--enable-renderer-accessibility'  2. On Vista TabletPCs  the nested message pump that processes message to  keep the UI responsive is running on top of a windproc that is currently  processing a message for a DraggedTabController. The nested message pump  processes a message that deletes the DraggedTabController. So when the  nested message pump returns control the windproc tried to access parts of  the deleted DraggedTabController causing the access violation.        We'd like to be able to have renderer accessibility enabled by default   without causing instability.     </pre>
