<title>Issue 46029 -   chromium -    'Is my rev in build x.x.x.x' tool - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create a tool (or extend <a href="http://omahaproxy.appspot.com">http://omahaproxy.appspot.com</a>) that:  - receives a rev number and a build number  - returns if that change is in that build (think how to deal with merges and reverts) </pre>
