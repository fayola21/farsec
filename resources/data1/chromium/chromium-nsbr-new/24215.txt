<title>Issue 24215 -   chromium -    GMail tab title does not update when we receive a new chat message in a selected chat window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.221.8  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Start a chat session with your contact in Gmail.  2. Select this chat session and move to a different tab.  3. Wait for your contacts next message.    Expected:  The tab title should change to &quot;xxx says...&quot; when you receive a chat   message from your friend even though you have selected that chat window   in Gmail.    Actual:  The tab title is not updated.      This happens only when we have selected that particular chat session in   Gmail. If not the tab title does update.   This works as expected in Safari  Firefox on Mac and Chrome on Windows.   </pre>
