<title>Issue 30484 -   chromium -    &quot;Open With&quot; option with Chrome email attachment download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30             Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK    Opera 10.01:OK           IE 8:OK      1.open an attachment in a gmail message  2.select download    What is the expected result? an option to open or save    What happens instead? only the save option is available in chrome    Using the open option allows you to select the program you want to open   with. The Google Docs viewer has limited functionality. For example  a full   screen slide show with sound is not available for a pps file. I suspect   most users want the attachment opened in their default program. </pre>
