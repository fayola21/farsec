<title>Issue 36690 -   chromium -    Untranslated strings  in the network error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split off from <a title="Web page not found chrome error page is not RTL aligned" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36624"> Issue 36624 </a> .    Repro steps to get to error page (from original issue):  1. Launch Chrome with Ar or He UI  2. set proxy with invalid value from &quot;Network Proxy Preferences&quot; (   Wrench=&gt; Options=&gt; Under the Hood =&gt; Change proxy settings)    3. go to any website ( ex: yahoo.com)    See the attached screenshot (from WinXP/5.0.307.10 (Official Build 39263)) - some strings need   translation into Hebrew &amp; Arabic.    Triage note: This is a polish issue  recommend we schedule for mstone-5 if possible. </pre>
