<title>Issue 38930 -   chromium -    HTML5 audio &quot;ended&quot; event fires too early on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 5.0.360.0 (42239)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/x5VRq/1/">http://jsfiddle.net/x5VRq/1/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: NA           IE 8: NA        First audio file (male voice) should finish completely before second audio   file (female voice) starts playing.        The &quot;ended&quot; event fires too early and the second sound file overlaps the   first.          * Tested on Snow Leopard 10.6.2 with two Ogg Vorbis encoded files.  * Also tested with two MP3 files and the same problem occurs.  * Same problem exists in Chrome 5.0.307.11 beta so it's not a regression.  * Could be related to <a title="Unable to play very short audio files using JavaScript" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25972"> issue #25972 </a>. </pre>
