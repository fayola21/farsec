<title>Issue 31357 -   chromium -    Chromium restarts fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Restart a hung/failed previous complex (~50 windows  perhaps 200-300   tabs) session resume.  2. Restart will proceed normally  during the restart there is high (CPU &amp;   network) use (presumably due to browser/X windows activity)  3. During the restart the browser appears to be in a &quot;normal&quot; state  i.e.   you can interact with the windows  they (and the page contents) are   displayed should it be the active window during the restoration.  The   browser is reasonably responsive during this situation (though one can   argue that the curent active primary window should take precedence).  4. At the end of the &quot;finished&quot; restore  one has a browser which displays   all the windows with nothing else.   I.e. zero-zip content -- I cannot read   even a single page (in any of the multiple windows) -- pages where were   displayed during the restart).  5. For some reason the command process responsible for communicating with   the X server seems to stop operation at the end of e the restore process --   one needs backups/redundancy for such situations.        The restart (even for 50 windows) should work.        One has a completely unusable dysfunctional chrome session that is   consuming ~100% of the memory (this is not unexpected given that this is   what chrome does) -- that will not display pages that it has apparently   downloaded (i.e. network activity is complete).  Switching from window to   window doesn't help as they all display the title (presumably extracted   from the restore file) but will not display the actual page they are   referencing (even though they apparently would during the restoration   process).    <b>Please provide
