<title>Issue 38598 -   chromium -    Support side-by-side install on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to add support for side-by-side installs  so users can run multiple   channels.    On Windows we have added a SxS install channel (<a title="Add side by side distribution" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35574"> issue 35574 </a>). The SxS channel   uses the same build as Dev release  but it is installed to different path    has different default user profile  and runs separately with current   stable/beta/dev releases.    We want to provide similar SxS package to Linux. There are two options:    - Add SxS to dev build as Windows does  - Add SxS packages to all channels (Dev  beta  and stable) </pre>
