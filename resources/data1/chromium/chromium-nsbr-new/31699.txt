<title>Issue 31699 -   chromium -    Scrolling speed regression - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : dev channel 4.0.288.1 unstable   OS + version : ubuntu LTS      1. Open a web page  2. Scroll; using scroll wheel or arrow keys        Scrolling should be smooth.        It's much slower (2 fps?) than the last dev channel.    Watching youtube is fast  so it's not painting that's slow. (or maybe   youtube is only updating a smaller screen rect?)    Evan  maybe your shm stuff? </pre>
