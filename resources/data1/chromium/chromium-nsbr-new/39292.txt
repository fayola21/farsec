<title>Issue 39292 -   chromium -    Chrome/Breakpad's libc-avoidance is not consistent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome's Breakpad code (src/chrome/app/breakpad_linux.cc) tries to avoid using libc   functions  and uses Breakpad-supplied functions such as my_memset() and sys_sendmsg()   instead.    However  this is not complete.  NonBrowserCrashHandler() also uses the regular memset()   and the regular socketpair().    I discovered this in the context of Native Client  when trying to use this code to   handle a crash in untrusted NaCl code on x86-32.  Linux does not restore %gs (the TLS   register) when running a signal handler.  On some glibc builds  syscall wrappers such   as socketpair() get glibc's internal syscall function from %gs  so if the signal   handler does not restore %gs  this will crash.    It's not clear how serious this is.  I imagine it means the crash handler will fail to   handle crashes that have corrupted libc's internal state (e.g. contents of TLS).   </pre>
