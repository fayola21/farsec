<title>Issue 23833 -   chromium -    browser actions: popups should have a nice border - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See the mocks in <a title="browser actions: implement popups" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23596"> issue 23596 </a> for an example.    For now  we'll make the border fixed.  In the future  we may want to support   a 9-grid API to allow authors to do something custom.   </pre>
