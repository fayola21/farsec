<title>Issue 43703 -   chromium -    Tips in &quot;new tab page&quot; are displayed in wrong language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.396.0/Mac with UI language set to **English**      1. Masquerade as an Israeli IP.  2. Open NTP  3. Look at &quot;tip&quot; in the upper right hand corner  note it's in Hebrew        Tip should be in same language as Chrome UI.    Apart from this going against user expectation  in the case of RTL languages - if Chrome's UI   language is English then the directional attribute of the tips item is set wrong and the tip text gets   messed up.   </pre>
