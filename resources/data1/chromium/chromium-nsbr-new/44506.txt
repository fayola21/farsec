<title>Issue 44506 -   chromium -    New Tab puts focus nowhere useful - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta on OSX    when i do either of File -&gt; New Tab or use the keyboard shortcut &lt;cmd&gt;-t  a new tab is created    but the focus doesn't seem to be anywhere usable.  typing  hitting &lt;enter&gt;  &lt;space&gt;  etc  seem to   have no effect.  hitting &lt;tab&gt; moves the focus to the first page in the tiles.  i would think we'd want   to put the focus in the OmniBox when a new tab is created  no? </pre>
