<title>Issue 35564 -   chromium -    Show alert for unrecognized command-line switches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to show the user a dialog on startup if they pass   unrecognized command-line switches.  This way we can catch misspellings  or   use of switches that no longer exist in the product.    There are several pieces of this:  * Fix all the uses of bare string constants as switch names  so all the   switches we recognize are in one of the xxx_switches.* files.    * Make it possible to iterate over all the switches.  There are a lot of   ways to do this; I was thinking of something like the following:    foo_switches.cc:  const char kSwitches[][] = {    &quot;switch0&quot;     &quot;switch1&quot;   };  const char kSwitch0[] = kSwitches[0];    (Don't know offhand if this compiles; the second assignment may need to   happen inside a function?)  The nice thing about this is that it makes it   very unlikely that someone will add a new switch without it being in the   iteratible list.  OTOH  it makes removing a switch a bit messy...    * Actually iterate over all the switches somewhere  and show a message box   to the user.  Note that you can't show message boxes from inside   command_line.cc  since it's in base/. </pre>
