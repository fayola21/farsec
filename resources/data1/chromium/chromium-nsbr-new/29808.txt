<title>Issue 29808 -   chromium -    &quot;Up&quot; scroll bar arrow doesn't function properly with AppleScrollBarVariant = DoubleBoth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.6.2 (10C540)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): This regressed between Safari 3 (worked)   and Safari 4 (broken).  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works (using Yahoo! Mail Inbox window to   test)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Enable &quot;AppleScrollBarVariant = DoubleBoth&quot;:  $ defaults write &quot;Apple Global Domain&quot; AppleScrollBarVariant DoubleBoth  2. Launch Chrome.  3. Load a page with a lot of HTML &lt;<a href="http://apple.com/">http://apple.com/</a>&gt;.  4. Open the web inspector.  5. Position the vertical scroll bar half-way down the scroll area.  6. Click the lower &quot;up&quot; arrow on the vertical scroller once or twice.  NOTE: The upper &quot;up&quot; arrow gets stuck in the &quot;clicked&quot; position.  7. Now click the upper &quot;up&quot; arrow directly.  NOTE: The page starts scrolling down instead of up.  (Sometimes clicking it gets   stuck as if you were holding the mouse button down.)      - The upper &quot;up&quot; button should not get &quot;stuck&quot; highlighted when using the lower   &quot;up&quot; button.  - The upper &quot;up&quot; button should scroll up just like the lower &quot;up&quot; button.      - The upper &quot;up&quot; arrow gets stuck in the &quot;clicked&quot; position.  - The page starts scrolling down instead of up.    I'm pretty sure this is a WebKit scrollbar bug since it happens in both Chrome and   Safari 4.   </pre>
