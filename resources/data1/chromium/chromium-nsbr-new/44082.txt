<title>Issue 44082 -   chromium -    should send nag emails for expected failures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For any gtest test or line in test_expectations  we should send nag emails to remind people they   need to fix it. The nag emails should go to whoever added the line (according to annotate/blame).     The details are flexible  but my intuition is that we should send them daily. Then  once a week  we   should send an email-of-shame summary to chromium-dev for any lines that are more than a week   old.    We probably don't want to be nag emailing people who don't work on chromium  so we might want   to limit the emails to @chromium and @google accounts.    It's too easy to mark a test as fail/flaky/disabled and then forget about it since the tree is no longer   red.    We've tried having everyone just be responsible and that clearly isn't working. We need technology to   help us. We also probably want pretty graphs showing numbers of disabled/failing tests  but   sending emails seems to me like it will be the most effective thing in actually keeping those   numbers low. </pre>
