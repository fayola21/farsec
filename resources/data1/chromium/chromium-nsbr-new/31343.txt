<title>Issue 31343 -   chromium -    Reloading FlashBlock causes SEGV and crashes chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome with AdBlock and FlashBlock extensions  2.

Chromium crashes  apparently due to a memory access error in the master  chromium process in &quot;LocationBarViewGtk::PageActionViewGtk::OnExposeEvent&quot;  in a callback from the gtk/glib library.      <b>Please provide
