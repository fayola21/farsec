<title>Issue 33977 -   chromium -    Chrome suddenly started slowly responding to clicks and menus within webpages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load google mail  or google reader  2. click next in reader or clicks menu items in google  3. in google reader after clicking next 3 or 4 time there then is a short  hesitation  before the next item is processed. In google Mail sometimes  when I hover over a menu item there is a short hesitaion before the arrow  changes to a hand. This next used to happen    I played around with installing some extensions which were speed dial  a  scroll smooting one  a password keeper extension and google docs extension.    I have since removed all extension and the problem is still there. I have  seen one other mention of this when I did a google search for &quot;chrome slow  responding&quot; on the DSLreports forums                <b>Please provide
