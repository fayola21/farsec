<title>Issue 44747 -   chromium -    Saving password when website uses javascript for forms fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 5.0.342.9 (43360)  URLs (if applicable) : Website using javascript for forms (Ex.:   <a href="http://cw2.erpi.com/cw/chimie5/">http://cw2.erpi.com/cw/chimie5/</a>)      Firefox 3.6: OK    Opera 10.50: OK    Google Chrome 5.0.307.11 beta: FAIL      1. Enter username;  2. Enter password;  3. Submit.      Saving the password. When websites use javascript for submitting username and   password  the browser does not save them.      The page load  but the username and password are not saved.    I think that it is because the page is not refresh  so the browser does not save   the password. </pre>
