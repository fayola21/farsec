<title>Issue 44384 -   chromium -    Some browser tests &quot;hang&quot; on Windows before running the test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try running browser_tests on Windows.  Notice that each window pops up  then   its message loop hangs  causing Windows to eventually paint a standard   titlebar over the window; after many seconds  the window suddenly becomes   responsive again and the test executes.    Given that this happens on every test  it's dramatically slowing the cycle   time for these. </pre>
