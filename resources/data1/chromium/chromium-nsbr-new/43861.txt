<title>Issue 43861 -   chromium -    Security Threat: Code being pasted into the address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have seen many scams (especially on Facebook) which tell the user to paste   a line of javascript into the address bar.  We should warn the user of the   security risks when they do it or add a setting to the security options with   a warning when they opt in. </pre>
