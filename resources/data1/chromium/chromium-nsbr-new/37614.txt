<title>Issue 37614 -   chromium -    Please make ESC key working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Google Buzz I mistakenly click a hyperlink  I realized it's a mistake so I   hit ESC a millions times  the page continues to load.     There is technically no way to stop a page from loading in Chromium.    Can you guys please fix this?    I knew it's an old issue (<a title="pictures of RSS in Google Reader continue loading after hit ESC key"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19134">issue 19134</a>) but it's really annoying.    Chrome 5.0.307.1 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37331">r37331</a>) </pre>
