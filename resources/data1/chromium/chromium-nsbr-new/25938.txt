<title>Issue 25938 -   chromium -    No proxy settings dialog on KDE4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : google-chrome-unstable   4.0.223.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29916">r29916</a>  OS + version :  kubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : kde      1. Options  Under the hood  Change proxy settings    Nothing happens when I click Change proxy settings.  I get no dialog and no   error message.  From <a title="Chrome needs separate proxy settings." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25769"> bug 25769 </a>  it sounds like maybe it's trying to pop up a   gnome proxy dialog.  If I don't have gnome  maybe I get nothing.    Something's broken. </pre>
