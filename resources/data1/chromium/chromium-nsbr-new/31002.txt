<title>Issue 31002 -   chromium -    No 304's  improve page load time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  URLs (if applicable) : www.facebook.com  OS version               : 10.6.2      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works as intended      1. download and install Wireshark and start capture http traffic  2. open Chrome and visit www.facebook.com  3. close  open Chrome and revisit www.facebook.com from bookmark      In Wireshark  the second visit of www.facebook.com from bookmark   shouldn't issue http requests to the server to re-validate cached content.  On window  Chrome does not re-validate cache content  same as other   browsers.      Chrome on Mac OS X issues http request for static content and server   sends back a lot 304s. This slows down the page load time of Chrome.   Probably true for a lot of sites. </pre>
