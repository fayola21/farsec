<title>Issue 25435 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox doesn't show correct selection on click-drag. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type something to bring up the omnibox.  2. Click an entry and drag around without releasing the mouse.        I expect to see the highlighted cell change to the cell under the mouse and no hover cell.  Instead I   see the hover cell and no highlighted cell.  [In this case &quot;highlight&quot; is darker  &quot;hover&quot; is lighter.] </pre>
