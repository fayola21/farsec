<title>Issue 28831 -   chromium -    setup cygwin builder to make sure cygwin doesn't interfere with gyp / devenv - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Recently the msvs build has regressed and is not identical when run under   cygwin. Once this is working again  we should make sure it doesn't happen by   adding a cygwin clobber builder.   </pre>
