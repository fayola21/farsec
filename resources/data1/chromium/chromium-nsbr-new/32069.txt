<title>Issue 32069 -   chromium -    Implement three-finger swipe up/down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is spun off from <a title="Multi-touch gestures on OSX" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16305"> bug 16305 </a>. We need to figure out what we want to do with 3-finger swipe   up/down and implement it.    From comment 23 in that bug:    Three-finger up/down (not left/right) swipe in...    Finder: no action  Safari: no action  Mail: previous/next mail message  iPhoto: previous/next set of photos  Preview: previous/next page/pages (depending on if it's set up to view one or two   pages at a time)  Address Book: previous/next contact  iMovie: an oddity here: swipe up = move movie clip from library into project.. down =   N/A  AFAIK  both Firefox and Camino does a top/bottom thing.    I think this can be done by sending one of the pre-defined NSResponder selectors to BWC's   selectedTabView since there is no browser command for any of the discussed actions.   </pre>
