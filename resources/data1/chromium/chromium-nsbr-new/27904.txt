<title>Issue 27904 -   chromium -    &quot;Clear browsing data&quot; shortcut removed from 4.x.x.x - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16        1. In Chrome 3.x.x.x  if we clicked the wrench menu there was &quot;Clear  browsing data&quot; shortcut  where now &quot;Synchronize my Bookmarks is&quot;.        This makes it harder to clear browsing data (more time consuming to go into  settings etc.)   </pre>
