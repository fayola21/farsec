<title>Issue 39940 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Keylogger protector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My feature request is for Chrome to have a Keylogger protector that   encrypts keystrokes inside the browser so keyloggers will not be able to   view people's passwords. There is an example of a Keylogger protector   software here:    <a href="http://download.cnet.com/KeyScrambler-Personal/3000-2144_4-10571274.html?">http://download.cnet.com/KeyScrambler-Personal/3000-2144_4-10571274.html?</a>  tag=mncol    So you should develop your own Keylogger protector and integrate it into   the browser. It should be enabled by default  and there should be a   disable option. </pre>
