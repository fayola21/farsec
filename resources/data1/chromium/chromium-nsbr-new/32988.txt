<title>Issue 32988 -   chromium -    Chrome Scrolling show obey Mac OS system scroll settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Safari uses OS-standard scrolling behavior.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Firefox does NOT use OS-standard   behavior  but its own scroll handling is much closer to that of the Mac OS   then Chrome's.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: does not follow Windows scrolling   conventions  although few Windows applications do.      1. Scrolling on any web page.            The Mac has standard accelerated and smooth scrolling behavior that is   generally consistent across all cocoa applications. Smooth scrolling may   also be toggled on or off at the system level via a checkbox in the   &quot;Appearance&quot; OS preference pane.        Chrome completely ignores system scrolling behavior. Smooth scrolling is   not available  regardless of whether the box in system preferences is   checked or not. The acceleration curve and lowest possible scroll   increment are also completely different when scrolling with a scroll wheel.   Chrome appears to only scroll in large jerky blocks.    This behavior is jarring since it behaves nothing like any other Mac   applications  and also makes a mess out of any custom scrolling settings   that may have been defined (e.g.  applications like USB Overdrive and   Steermouse that allow you to change the scroll increment and acceleration   at the system level).    If Chrome is to feel like a native Mac application  it really needs to scroll   like other Mac apps. Among other Mac browsers  Firefox and Opera also   ignore scrolling conventions  but Safari obeys them  as do most other   Mac-specific browsers like Omniweb and iCab. </pre>
