<title>Issue 41463 -   chromium -    drag drop to bookmarks bar doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Grab a link on a web page and drag it to the bookmarks bar. It gets the drag handle  but doesn't go   in the bookmarks bar when you drop.    Tested on 5.0.375.6 (Official Build 44316) dev on Mac. I assume this is Mac only  but leaving it   general since I haven't tested elsewhere. </pre>
