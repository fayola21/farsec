<title>Issue 36586 -   chromium -    Option to disable lowering window on tab strip middle click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): Chrome 5.0.307.9 (Official   Build 39052) beta  Chromium 5.0.329.0 (Developer Build 39037) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: It's the most recent in Synaptic.  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit  Window manager: Compiz  KWin4    Please add an option to disable lowering the window when I middle click the   tab strip. This seems to be hardcoded in Chrome currently  so I still get   this behavior when using KDE  even though KWin doesn't do this. I know that   reading the settings of an arbitrary window manager and mimicking them would   be impossible  but because middle clicking is also used to close tabs  this   becomes an annoyance quickly. </pre>
