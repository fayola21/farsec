<title>Issue 43334 -   chromium -    Find as you type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Firefox  Safari  Opera         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Typing any word to search within a page as soon as you start typing    like in every other modern browser (Firefox  Safari  Opera).      Find first result if any  set focus to found text/link.      Nothing.      This is the third time I'm seriously trying out Chrome and yet even after   two years this crucial feature has not been implemented it seems. Why? </pre>
