<title>Issue 23828 -   chromium -    Change &quot;Change font and language settings&quot; in &quot;Under the Hood&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Language settings in OS X are changed in the system preferences; we should   change the dialog button to &quot;Change font settings&quot; on the Mac side so users   don't get confused.  (At least for the Beta launch -- and maybe forever  if   there are no plans to change this?)   </pre>
