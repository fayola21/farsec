<title>Issue 43370 -   chromium -    UMA_HISTORGRAM_ENUMERATION must take a constant name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ClientSocketHandle::HandleInitCompletion() uses the client socket pool name   as part of the histogram name.  This won't work properly.  It must use a   static histogram name  or abandon the macro and lookup the Histogram by   hand.    Also  UMA_HISTOGRAM_CLIPPED_TIMES is deprecated and should get cleaned up at   the same time.     </pre>
