<title>Issue 43712 -   chromium -    Dragging a tab to a new window causes the UI to hang (for several seconds) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load a few tabs.  2.

The UI hangs for several seconds and then works as expected (e.g.  then it   can be smoothly dragged).    <b>Please provide
