<title>Issue 27945 -   chromium -    There should be better UI for when extension install fails in Incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently don't allow extension installation in incognito mode because we   aren't sure exactly how it should work (see <a title="Should not be able to uninstall extensions in Incognito mode." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20175"> bug 20175 </a>).    In the meantime  we should have better UI when we don't install. It could   just be an alert that says that extension installation is not supported in   Incognito mode. </pre>
