<title>Issue 35566 -   chromium -    main menu does not shrink immediately. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> popup-&gt;SetBounds in chromeos/main_menu.cc  does not set the popup size when the size is smaller than current window   size. A couple of data points.    - Repeating close/open makes the size closer to what's been specified.  - Removing Renderer from layout fixes this.    So I guess this is some artifact that renderer is requesting allcation on widget   which prevents it from shrinking right away.    </pre>
