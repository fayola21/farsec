<title>Issue 24455 -   chromium -    Toolbar is created but not used for windows that don't need a toolbar (ie. dev tools) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Put a breakpoint in the BrowserActionsContainer constructor.  2. Open the inspector.  3. Breakpoint is hit.    The same is probably true for popup windows. We shouldn't create the browser   action container for windows with no toolbar. </pre>
