<title>Issue 29866 -   chromium -    wrong behaviour on screen with high dpi - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;include svn revno; e.g. dpkg -s chromium-browser&gt;  OS + version : google-chrome-beta-4.0.249.30-33928.i386 on Fedora 11  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : gnome    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): rendering according to screen dpi                  Renderung of pages according to screen dpi so that 1 inch on the screen has   the same size as 1 inch on the ruler      Google chrome render always the pages assuming that the screen resolution   is 96 dpi. The textes are accordingly very small if the screen dpi is hight   and therefore unreadable.    Please modify the webkit file CSSHelper.h so that cssPixelsPerInch will be   set to the actual screen dpi  or provide a default zoom factor set to screen dpi / 96.  For the second solution  the window size used by webkit shall be   recalculated according to the zoom factor (height = real height / zoom   factor).           </pre>
