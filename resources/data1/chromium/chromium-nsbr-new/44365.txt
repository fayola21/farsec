<title>Issue 44365 -   chromium -    Support increment and decrement style size on developer toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta    I come from Firefox + Firebug  and with this setup when i edit a style   attribute that has a size value  for example:    width: 50px;    i am able to use the up and down arrow key to increase and decrease the   value and the result is immediately visible. This is very handy. </pre>
