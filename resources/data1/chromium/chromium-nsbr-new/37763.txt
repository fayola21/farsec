<title>Issue 37763 -   chromium -    Linux SUID sandbox is silently ineffective if CLONE_NEWPID is unsupported - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not all versions of the Linux kernel have support for the CLONE_NEWPID flag (either because   it is not compiled in or because the kernel is too old).  This includes Ubuntu hardy.    If Chromium's SUID helper is run on these kernels  it continues without giving a warning    even though it provides no protection in this situation because a &quot;sandboxed&quot; process can   take control of an unsandboxed process via ptrace().    The fix is for the SUID helper to use setuid() (allocating a new  unused UID each time)   instead of CLONE_NEWPID  at least on kernels that don't support CLONE_NEWPID.  We can set   RLIMIT_NPROC=1 to ensure that the UIDs we allocate are unused.
