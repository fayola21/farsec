<title>Issue 24196 -   chromium -    Add an option to disableenable autoscrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is no option to disable middle click autoscrolling  as there is in  firefox and several other browsers.  Users that middle click open long  lists of links to new tabs find it easier to disable autoscroll because  missing a link by a small amount triggers the autoscroll behavior  which is  undesirable.   </pre>
