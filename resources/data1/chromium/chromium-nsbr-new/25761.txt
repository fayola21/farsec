<title>Issue 25761 -   chromium -    Store time closed for tabs and allow sorting by that on History page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a history for tabs and the time when they were opened. But is there   a way to make the same history for tabs but included the 'when closed' in   it.     So that you can show up the history and sort by 'when opened' or 'when   closed'.    Then you're always able to open the last 'x' tabs that are closed at any   day. </pre>
