<title>Issue 42495 -   chromium -    Unable to update to 4.1.249.1059 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Security reports say update released on 4/20/2010 to version   4.1.249.1059 fixes 3 High and 4 Medium bugs.  2. My 'About Google Chrome' says I have 4.1.249.1045 and it is up to date.  3. Went to website and ran installer again.  Still says version is   4.1.249.1045    What is the expected result?  I should have version 4.1.249.1059      What happens instead? I still have 4.1.249.1045      <b>Please provide
