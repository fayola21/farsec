<title>Issue 28592 -   chromium -    Chrome periodically fails to load pages (including when opening a new tab) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   There are no particular steps that cause this.  I'd say currently  that   pages will stop loading in Chrome every 5 to 10 minutes.  And then a few   minutes later  they will start loading again.  Additionally  as mentioned   in the Summary  during these periods where I can't load pages  the new tab   page never loads either.      Pages should always load.        The page will sit and I'll see the &quot;loading&quot; animated icon in the tab.  But   it never finishes.    <b>Please provide
