<title>Issue 43755 -   chromium -    Proxy Access Denied error for the entire system while Chrome is running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome behind a proxy  browse for a few minutes.        Pages load normally.          After this last update (Friday  May 7)  I keep getting an &quot;Access Denied&quot;  error from the proxy for most sites (the few sites that do load - those  that I visit most often I think - don't have all images or style-sheets loaded)  While chrome is running  the same thing happens with other programs as well  (Firefox  opera  yahoo messenger etc).  As soon as I close Chrome  the other programs run normally.    Please provide
