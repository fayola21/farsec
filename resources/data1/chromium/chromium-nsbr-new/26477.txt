<title>Issue 26477 -   chromium -    Convert ExtensionPopup to use InfoBubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ExtensionPopup on Windows is built on top of BrowserBubble.  InfoBubble is a   more appropriate starting point.  When I last looked at this  the nested   ExtensionView didn't render properly  but I admit I didn't try very hard to   get past the issues at the time.  Peter believes that this would fix the   &quot;inactive window&quot; issue that we see with ExtensionPopup (see <a title="REGRESSION: InfoBubble::Show makes window inactive" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20966"> issue 20966 </a>). </pre>
