<title>Issue 45085 -   chromium -    Images should be loaded outwards from the user's viewport  not top-to-bottom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev    <a href="http://munin.ping.uio.no/ping.uio.no/rossum.ping.uio.no.html#Time">http://munin.ping.uio.no/ping.uio.no/rossum.ping.uio.no.html#Time</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Go to a page with a lot of images  2. Scroll to the bottom while it's loading  3. Images continue to load in top-down order        Chrome should take into account the position of the user's viewport on the page   when loading data  and act appropriately.    Sometimes  such as when viewing pages generated by monitoring software. A lot of   images are included on the page  but the user has followed an anchor link to the   middle of the page because he's most interested in that part.    Chrome should then load images in a pattern expanding outwards from the current   viewport  instead of just loading them from top to bottom.        Images are loaded from top to bottom. </pre>
