<title>Issue 27616 -   chromium -    text-transform: uppercase replaces ��_��_ with SS correctly but moves the caret only one character further - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.223.16         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: FAIL (because it doesn't replace ��_��_ with SS but keeps ��_��_).      1. Add an input field to a form using &quot;text-transform: uppercase;&quot; as style.  2. Enter ��_��_ (U+00DF)      The ��_��_ should be replaced with SS (since there is no uppercase for ��_��_ in  Germany) and the caret should move to steps further behind the second S.      Instead ��_��_ is replaced by SS correctly but the caret is moved only one step  further after the first S (between them).    Seems to be a WibKit issue since the same bug occurs on Safari as well. </pre>
