<title>Issue 30743 -   chromium -    fullscreen exit bubble should slide in when the mouse cursor is placed near the top of the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See Windows and the code in chrome/browser/views/fullscreen_exit_bubble.cc   for what this behavior should be.  Ideally  we should try to refactor this   logic out so we don't have to duplicate it for gtk/mac.   </pre>
