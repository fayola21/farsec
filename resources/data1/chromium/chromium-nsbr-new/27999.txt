<title>Issue 27999 -   chromium -    Uninstalling extension should remove it's localStorage data too - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.245.0    The localStorage data appears to persist across extension uninstalls.  It  seems like that data should be cleaned up during the uninstall.  To verify:   - Install an extension with a background.html page   - From chrome://extensions/  inspect the background.html view and open the  console   - Add a new value with &quot;localStorage.setItem('test'  'dummy value');&quot;   - Uninstall the extension (optionally restart Chrome  the issue persists  across restarts as well)   - Reinstall the extension   - Head back to the console for that background.html view and check out  your previously saved entry with &quot;localStorage.getItem('test');&quot;   </pre>
