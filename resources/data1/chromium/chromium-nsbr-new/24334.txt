<title>Issue 24334 -   chromium -    Remove &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot; from the Wrench menu (or from the Options dialog) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Offizieller Build 27713)    For consistency with Clear Private Data  this feature should only be exposed   either in the Wrench menu or in the Options dialog  not in both. Exposing it   once and as a tip on the NTP (per <a title="NTP: show the bookmarks synchronization (&quot;Start now&quot;) line as a normal tip line"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24328">issue 24328</a>) has been enough for all other   features  so why not also for this one? </pre>
