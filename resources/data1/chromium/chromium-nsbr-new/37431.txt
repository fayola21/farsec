<title>Issue 37431 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.* disabled on Mac (hangs Valgrind) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac UI Valgrind builders have been red all week because WorkerTests started causing Valgrind   to hang. All the tests complete (gtest finishes global test environment tear down)  but then it is quite   for 1200 seconds and times out. It's been like this since 26/2/2010.    Earliest occurrence:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20Mac%20UI%20(valgrind)(1)/bui">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20Mac%20UI%20(valgrind)(1)/bui</a>  lds/1883    There's now a blanket disable for WorkerTest.* in chrome/test/data/valgrind/ui_tests.gtest_mac.txt. </pre>
