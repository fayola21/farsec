<title>Issue 25982 -   chromium -    KURL treats http:// as a valid URL  GURL doesn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The different seems minor  but for img tags  if the URL is not valid  it   doesn't try to load it.  So for example     &lt;img src=&quot;http:// causes a placeholder to be shown in safari  while in   chrome  we get nothing.    This is a minor web compat issue since not trying to load an image means   that onerror does not fire in chrome  but does in safari.   </pre>
