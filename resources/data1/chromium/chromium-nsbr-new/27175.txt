<title>Issue 27175 -   chromium -    reloading an extension on chrome://extensions should give some visual feedback - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Before when you reloaded an extension on the chrome://extensions page the   whole page would refresh  so you knew it did something. Now when you hit the   button it properly reloads the extension  but there's no visual indicator so   you're left thinking &quot;did anything happen?&quot;.    Maybe we should have a little &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;done&quot; notification that fades away   after a second or two  or the reload link could briefly turn into a spinner   image or something.     Finnur  assigning to you since you did some of the most recent refactoring on   the extensions ui page  but feel free to unassign yourself if you don't want   to do it.   </pre>
