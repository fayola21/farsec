<title>Issue 29818 -   chromium -    Can't slide tab to first pinned position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 999.999.34209.004426  Chrome: 4.0.267.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34021">r34021</a>)  H/W: Eee    Chrome Windows 4.0.249.30 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33928">r33928</a>): OK  Chrome Linux   4.0.249.30 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33928">r33928</a>): OK        1. Have the leftmost tab pinned.  2. Try to slide a second tab past the pinned tab to the first leftmost   position.    What is the expected output?    Should be able to slide the tab so that it occupies the leftmost position.    What do you see instead?    Can't slide the tab to the leftmost position.  I am guessing it is because   of the Chromium icon in the upper-left corner.   </pre>
