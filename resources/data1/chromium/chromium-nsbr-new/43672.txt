<title>Issue 43672 -   chromium -    QoS RSVP service on Windows XP SP3 appears necessary to display google ig page  streaming video  service intermittently stops and Chrome crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Intermittent. Some pages seem to bring it on  intermittently  but with no   apparent pattern so I can't swear to it.  2. Intermittent. Has applied to previous Chrome 4 and also 5 beta  which I   uninstalled because of frequent crashes.          Properly working browser!          Chrome works fine for significant periods. Otherwise  ig page loads slowly    cannot reach some gadgets  skin not showing in ig. Streaming video   difficult or impossible. Download bandwidth drastically cut and variable   instead of peaking and remaining stable at about 86% of 1152kb limit   imposed by ISP. Getting QoS started and reconnecting/reinitializing   connection/if all else fails rebooting fixes problem.      <b>Please provide
