<title>Issue 37971 -   chromium -    Wait for browser idle to install extension autoupdates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now a user could be in the middle of using some extension popup or tab   when an autoupdate happens  forcing a unload of the old version and closing   any open popups / tabs. It would be nice to wait until we detect some amount    of idleness (10 minutes?) before doing this. We'd probably also want to   eventually go ahead and apply it after some long time of never detecting idle   (1 day?).   </pre>
