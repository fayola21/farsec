<title>Issue 40007 -   chromium -    No option to manually restore last session after a clean exit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Mac 5.0.342.7  OS X 10.6.3    In Safari  there is an option to &quot;Reopen All Windows from Last Session&quot;  which allows a user to   manually restore the windows/tabs from the last session upon opening the browser.  This is   possible even with a clean exit  and is unlike auto-restore after a crash or auto-restore upon   opening the browser (since this one would be manual).    Currently  there is no such option in Chrome. </pre>
