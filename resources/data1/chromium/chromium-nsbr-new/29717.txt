<title>Issue 29717 -   chromium -    Please add options to icon right click menus to disable  remove and rate extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be great if every toolbar icon added by an extension could have   the same options added to their right click menu that are available in the   Extensions manager window  specifically disable / remove.    It would also be great if both right click menus and the Extensions manager   window could have a &quot;rate this extension&quot; option added  so that the ratings   database grows faster (people don't have to go back to the extensions site   and find the extensions they already have installed  they just rate them   right in the browser's chrome).     </pre>
