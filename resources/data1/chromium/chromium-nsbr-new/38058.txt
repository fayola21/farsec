<title>Issue 38058 -   chromium -    &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; menu is too narrow and doesn't scroll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3 dev      1. Open Other bookmarks menu    What is the expected result? The menu shows the names of the bookmarks and is as wide as   needed to properly show the longest bookmark name.      What happens instead? The menu is very narrow  cutting off the names and putting too much   vertical space between items  and centering them. It pushes items off the bottom of the screen    and does not provide vertical scrolling.       </pre>
