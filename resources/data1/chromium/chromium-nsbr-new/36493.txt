<title>Issue 36493 -   chromium -    NetworkChangeNotifier improvements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the NetworkChangeNotifier is pretty dumb.  The Observer class   only supports one notification: OnIPAddressChanged().  This probably covers   all the cases (including VPN)  but is a bit overzealous.  You probably only   want to know when the primary route changes in some way (change of primary   interface or the ip address of the primary interface changed).    Notifications for secondary interfaces probably don't matter.  We could   refine the Observer api to provide finer grained notifications.  This   probably isn't high priority. </pre>
