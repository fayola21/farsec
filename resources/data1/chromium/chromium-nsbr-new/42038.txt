<title>Issue 42038 -   chromium -    Encryptor should be removed on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Split off from <a title="Linux should encrypt passwords on disk"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25404">bug 25404</a>; see that bug for some of of the background.)    Encryptor is a thin abstraction of a Windows-specific API (from before the other platforms really   existed). Doing secure local storage on the Mac should be done with the Keychain  and the   Encryptor API is not really suitable for that. It's already not used for password storage (which is   where it started)  but its existence encourages new clients to design against that API and expect that   the Mac will implement the guts at some point--as has now happened with AutoFill--rather than   creating an abstraction that actually works for all platforms.    It will be much easier to do secure local storage correctly up-front than to go back and try to retro-  fit clients to a new API (as we had to do with the creation of PasswordStore  which was painful). </pre>
