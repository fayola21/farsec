<title>Issue 39802 -   chromium -    Feature: Allow auditing of extension activity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Other browsers tested: No browser known to have this feature yet.      1. Install a bunch of extensions  2. After a while  start wonder what they are really up to  3. Notice there is nowhere you can see an overview of extension   permissions  and under each permission a log of perhaps the last 5 events   (since last browser restart could be good enough?) that made use of this   permission.      At least there should be an overview of which permissions have been given   to which extensions.    Known workarounds?  I'm forced to either dig out some textfile  or Sqlite database  and perhaps   look to find this info there? </pre>
