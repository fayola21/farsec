<title>Issue 27941 -   chromium -    Update available notification - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In some cases  users go for weeks on end without restarting their browser.   They are missing important updates often containing security fixes. To   encourage users to update  we should show some UI when there has been an   update available for 2 weeks:  *Badge the wrench menu icon with a little warning triangle and &quot;!&quot;.   *Add the same badge beside the &quot;About Google Chrome...&quot; menu item.  *Change the text to &quot;Update Google Chrome...&quot;  *This menu item launches a dialog that says: &quot;Old school's not cool. Google   Chrome is woefully out of date because it hasn't crashed or restarted in at   least two weeks. Restart Chrome to apply update. [Restart and update] [Not   now]&quot;   </pre>
