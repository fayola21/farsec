<title>Issue 40187 -   chromium -    Can't Correct Invalid Credentials Supplied to Authentication Popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199)    <a href="https://ipay.adp.com">https://ipay.adp.com</a>         IE 7: OK      1. Visit <a href="https://ipay.adp.com">https://ipay.adp.com</a>  2. Click Login Button   3. Observe Username/Password Dialog Popup  4. Enter invalid credentials.   5. Observe redirection to login failure site.  6. Click Chrome Back Button.  7. Click Login Button again.  8. Observe that Chrome Fails to redisplay the Authentication Dialog      popup but instead resubmits the invalid credentials that were supplied     in Step#4     [ When I do this with IE7.0  it pops up the Authentication Dialog again       and gives me a change to correct the bogus credentials I supplied        in Step#4 ]  9. Observe that you are redirected to a login failure page because Chrome     failed to redisplay the Authentication Dialog when you clicked to      Login Button   10.Repeat steps 6-9 until you are locked out of the ipay site.      If the user accidentally enters invalid credentials into the Authentication   Dialog after clicking the Ipay Login Button  further clicks of the Login   Button should redisplay the Authentication Dialog giving the user a chance   to correct the bogus credentials.       Chrome continues to submit the invalid credentials each time the Login   Button is clicked.  Chrome does not give the user the opportunity to   correct the bogus credentials.  The only way to get Chrome to stop using   the invalid credentials is to close ALL instances of Chrome and revisit the   website under a completely new Session.      </pre>
