<title>Issue 35684 -   chromium -    Font rendering doesn't respect screen DPI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.326.0 (38870) Ubuntu    Chrome/Chromium uses miniature fonts at high-PPI screens. To get close to   values set at Fonts settings window  one must magnify the page by actual   PPI/96 * 100 % factor  suggesting that Chromium ignores DPI set by system.    The ignorance to provide minimum font size setting (<a title="Can't install .crx extensions"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30085">issue #30085</a>) also means   that there's no usable workaround for this issue. </pre>
