<title>Issue 26513 -   chromium -    document url not set correctly in DOM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    As part of developing a chrome extension  I am trying to access the document   URL from JavaScript.    When I access document.URL  or document.location.href  or   window.location.href  the url is often always the document URL. Instead  it   is set to some other link from the document  typically from an advertisement.    I know that I can retrieve it using chrome.tabs.getSelected  and the URL   passed as part of the tab object is indeed correct. However  I was hoping the   above DOM sources to work as per JavaScript The Definitive Guide and how   Firefox behaves.  </pre>
