<title>Issue 33444 -   chromium -    The description of &quot;Browsing data&quot; section is not udpated after button &quot;Clear browsing data&quot; moved to other tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Go to wrench menu -&gt; Options -&gt; Browsing data        The description of &quot;Browsing data&quot; still contains &quot;or clearing your  browsing data from this computer&quot;  even after &quot;Clear browsing data&quot; button  has been moved to &quot;Under the hood&quot; tab.    Another suggestion:    Put button &quot;Clear browsing data&quot; to under &quot;Privacy&quot; is not quite  meaningful  maybe we can have a special section &quot;Clear browsing data&quot;.         </pre>
