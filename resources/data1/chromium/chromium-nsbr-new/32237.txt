<title>Issue 32237 -   chromium -    Clicking &quot;back&quot; on an interstitial causes the &quot;bad&quot; page to show briefly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is *not* a security bug / risk*  more an annoying UI bug.    Go to a page that has a subresource from a bad page - e.g.   <a href="http://www.ianfette.com/bad.html">http://www.ianfette.com/bad.html</a> which contains an image from ianfette.org   (this is actually safe). When you hit &quot;back&quot; you will briefly see the &quot;bad&quot;   page.    We should not show the &quot;bad&quot; page again - rather  we should wait until   whatever page gets navigated to does its first paint.      * Not a risk because even though the page shows  all the pending requests   were cancelled including the request for the malware subresource. </pre>
