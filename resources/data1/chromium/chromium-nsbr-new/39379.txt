<title>Issue 39379 -   chromium -    Aw snap started happening frequently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev      I've been getting aw snap frequently  I believe since the last upgrade. I   disabled all extensions  and tried creating a new profile  neither of which   alleviated the problem.    Others are also having this issue.
