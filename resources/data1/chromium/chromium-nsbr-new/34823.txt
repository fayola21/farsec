<title>Issue 34823 -   chromium -    Popup blocking mechanism doesn't allow CF to show user initiated popup windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> New Chrome Feature doesn't hide popups anymore. They block them completely.  In Chrome we get an icon in omnibox when this happens to whitelist the   website. In ChromeFrame  icon doesn't come.       1. Go to <a href="http://www.meebo.com">http://www.meebo.com</a>  2. Click on link 'Connect to Facebook'    What is the expected output?   Window should popup where we can enter login credentials    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens    Same is the case with <a href="http://webmessenger.yahoo.com">http://webmessenger.yahoo.com</a>    CF 5.0.317.0 (Official Build 38070)   </pre>
