<title>Issue 36366 -   chromium -    All the different bubble controllers should share some code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have four different bubble systems by now (popup blocker bubble    extension installed bubble  page action / browser action bubbles  bookmark   bubble). They contain pretty repetitive code for bubble closing and bubble   click coordinate transformations (and then some). There should be a   BubbleController superclass that they all derive from that contains this code. </pre>
