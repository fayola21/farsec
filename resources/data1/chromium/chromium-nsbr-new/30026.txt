<title>Issue 30026 -   chromium -    dialog &quot;Report Bug or Broken Website&quot; covers too much - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 0.2 to 4.0.x    The dialog &quot;Report Bug or Broken Website&quot; covers too much of the screen. Very   often this forces me to move it around so I can see what's behind.      The dialog should not cover more than absolutely needed. </pre>
