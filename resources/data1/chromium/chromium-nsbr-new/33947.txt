<title>Issue 33947 -   chromium -    bug viewing certain sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I found a compatibility issue in Chrome  the problem should concern the compatibility with sites that use an older   version of Java  could also be a bug in WebKit   so this does not allow the display of these sites in chrome.  The site where I found the problem is the following:  <a href="http://www.scuolamajorana.it/">http://www.scuolamajorana.it/</a>    I think that an attacker could use this issue to hijack the user on a site   &quot;malicious&quot;.    I use Google Chrome Dev and Stable    I apologize for my bad English    Sincerely     Leonardo </pre>
