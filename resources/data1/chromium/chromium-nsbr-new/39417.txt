<title>Issue 39417 -   chromium -    grit should warn when there are duplicate English strings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A warning at compile time would help people either use the same IDS_* value   or to add a meaning= attribute to differentiate the strings.    We would first need to turn off the warnings that spew about untranslated   strings  otherwise this warning would get lost in the noise. </pre>
