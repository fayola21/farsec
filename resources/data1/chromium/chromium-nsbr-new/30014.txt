<title>Issue 30014 -   chromium -    Some cf:URLs displayed incorrectly in IE history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Frame: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  OS: Vista        1. Navigate to a cf:URL  preferably one with a urlencoded string appended    e.g. cf:<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=feather">http://www.google.com/search?q=feather</a>  2. Look in IE history under &quot;Computer&quot; heading.    What is the expected output?    Entire URL should be displayed.    What do you see instead?    Partial URL is displayed without the domain part  i.e. &quot;search?q=feather&quot;  The link is functional.   </pre>
