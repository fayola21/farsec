<title>Issue 24665 -   chromium -    Ensure crash dumps for vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Crash dumps are not collected on Vista as Chrome Frame runs in low IL IE and can't connect to the pipe   created by the crash reporting service.  Omaha has fixed this bug by relaxing the permissions so that   Chrome Frame can connect.    1. We need to test with this and make sure that it works.   2. Take necessary steps to enable this new version of Omaha/Breakpad for new Chrome Frame installs.     </pre>
