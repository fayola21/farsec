<title>Issue 43129 -   chromium -    Duplicating a nano-tab creates a new regular tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you duplicate a pinned tab  you get another pinned tab.    When you duplicate a nano-tab  you don't get another nano-tab  you get a   regular tab.    This is because the extension app state is not transferred over to the new   tab  so it looks like a regular tab.   </pre>
