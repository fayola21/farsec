<title>Issue 42333 -   chromium -    Feature: lazy/deferred loading for specific extensions   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request:  Some extensions only need to show a toolbar button  and nothing else until you actually click that button. They do not need   to load as part of the browser startup. For such extensions  it would be very nice to allow this to be marked in the   extension metadata  and then defer loading those extensions until you click on one for the first time.    Feature goal: Save on startup speed and memory usage    Motivation: Half my visible toolbar buttons are of this type.  Examples: (These do nothing until you actually click the toolbar button)  Session Manager  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bbcnbpafconjjigibnhbfmmgdbbkcjfi">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bbcnbpafconjjigibnhbfmmgdbbkcjfi</a>  Reading Glasses <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lkhbejoiaafgpibfoinbodibliooglde">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lkhbejoiaafgpibfoinbodibliooglde</a>  Aviary Screen Capture <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncgcgghbabbopfcpgcjpfffdgnbadegf">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncgcgghbabbopfcpgcjpfffdgnbadegf</a>    Known workarounds: None    (Programmers workaround option: Bake together several extensions into one super-extension.) </pre>
