<title>Issue 39521 -   chromium -    HTML notification weirdness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Display an HTML notification whose source URL is http://go/gamercam on the Mac.  Note that the notification remains almost entirely off screen. There's no way to close it or see its   contents if there even are any contents - I can't tell).    This works fine on Linux and mostly-fine on Windows - it hangs off screen at first on Windows  then   redraws on-screen.   </pre>
