<title>Issue 24620 -   chromium -    Reduce need to subclass Widget* - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> People often subclass Widget* in feature implementations. The problem is the   Widget impl is platform specific and it means that there often need to be two   objects then for Win/Gtk targets. It would be worth studying what people are   doing in these cases and find a way to support them without subclassing.   Scott raised the idea of a WidgetDelegate some time ago that'd have most of   the event notifications that people subclass to receive. </pre>
