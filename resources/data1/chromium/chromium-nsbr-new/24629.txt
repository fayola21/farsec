<title>Issue 24629 -   chromium -    Incognito mode shares host cache with regular mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Incognito mode should use a separate HostResolver with its own HostCache.    That way in-memory state gathered by incognito mode doesn't outlive closing the final incognito   window.    Right now the DNS entries gathered by incognito mode will show up in about:net-internals even   after closing the last window  since it is using the same host cache. </pre>
