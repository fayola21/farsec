<title>Issue 28864 -   chromium -    Searching in a bottom-up view of a large CPU profile overloads system and finally stops execution of any DevTools code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Gather a CPU profile from V8 benchmarks site.  2. Try to search in bottom-up view.    Search hogs all time of a CPU core and finally stops with no results.   DevTools stops working after that. Analysis shows that this is due to V8's   heap got exhausted by trying to build a bottom-up tree from a top down.    This problem originates from the fact that in WebKit Inspector the bottom   up tree is built dynamically from the top down tree. Thus  to perform a   search in a bottom up tree  it first needs to be fully built  which can grow   up V8's heap to its limit. JSC doesn't impose heap size limit  so searching in   the same tree in WebKit just eats up a enormous amount of memory  but   finishes happily.    It seems that an approach to maintaining calls tree needs to be reworked in   WebKit Inspector. </pre>
