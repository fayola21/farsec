<title>Issue 30123 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Alt-D causes system beep - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Alt-D is &quot;focus location bar&quot;.  Pressing it causes a beep.  This is a   regression since at least <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34214">r34214</a>.    I'm guessing this is the keyboard handling rewrite.    For an archaic version of this  see <a title="Alt+D shortcut (focus location bar) beeps" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91"> issue 91 </a>.  The patch to fix that was at   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/11268/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/11268/show</a> .  This may provide useful insight. </pre>
