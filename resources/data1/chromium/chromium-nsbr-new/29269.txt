<title>Issue 29269 -   chromium -    &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; Checkboxes UI Confusing  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.X    Whenever I use the clear browsing dialog  I always un-check the stuff I   want to delete  and then press the button  and then realize that I actually   intended to do the opposite  but now it's too late  and I've deleted   everything I wanted to keep. I would suggest starting off with nothing   checked  as that seems to be more intuitive. Or atleast  double check I   understand what I'm about to do when I click that button with a   confirmation dialog. Now I have to go and re-gain all my history and   passwords.           </pre>
