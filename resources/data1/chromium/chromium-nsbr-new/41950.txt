<title>Issue 41950 -   chromium -    Autofill changes don't persist - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.375.9 dev      1. Open Autofill  2. Make sure there's already a phone number entered (if not  enter one    save  and close  then reopen)  3. Change phone number  save  close  4. Reopen  notice the change didn't save    I haven't tested this with any other areas of autofill. I found this   because my autofill phone field currently has the area code in the second   field  then the rest of the 7 digits in the third field. I'm trying to move   the area code to the first field and the next 3 digits to the second field    but the changes aren't saving.   </pre>
