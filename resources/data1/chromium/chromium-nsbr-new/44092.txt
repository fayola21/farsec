<title>Issue 44092 -   chromium -    Downloading a dmg when the window is small does not give any indication that the download in waiting for users selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 6.0.401.1 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47052">r47052</a>      QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Shrink the window as much as possible vertically.   2. Download Chicken of the VNC from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/</a>    Expected:  Download shelf should appear and should ask the user whether to save the dmg or discard it.    Actual:  Download shelf appears but the download is hidden since the window size is too small for the   message.    Note: Shouldn't there be an indication saying that a download is waiting for users response.   </pre>
