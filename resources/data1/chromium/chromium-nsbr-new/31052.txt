<title>Issue 31052 -   chromium -    New (blank) tabs should be created adjacent to current active tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version      : 4.0.270.0 (34455)      1. Open a number of tabs  2. Activate any tab other than the right most  3. Open a new blank tab (cmd-t)  4. New tab is created at right most position after all previously created tabs        The above behavior is inconsistant with the behavior of opening a link in    a new tab. When opening a link in a new tab (cmd-click) the tab is    created immediately to the right of the currently active tab. Though this    behavior may or may not be consistant with other browsers it does    not  in my opinion  make logical sense and should at very least be    be configurable.   </pre>
