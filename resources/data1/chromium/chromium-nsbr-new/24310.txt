<title>Issue 24310 -   chromium -    gmail suddenly turns almost blank in the middle of email composition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome version: 4.0.221.6  OS: Windows Vista 64  Chrome's UI language : en-US    I was composing an email and all of sudden the gmail turned almost blank   except for 'ToDo list' at the lower right corner. Outside the ToDo list box    it's all white. Inside the box  it's all black. Attached is the screenshot.     This has just happened and I haven't yet tried again. Likely to be hard to   reproduce....    I'll see if there's a bug filed against gmail internally at Google.    </pre>
