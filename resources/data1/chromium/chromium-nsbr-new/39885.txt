<title>Issue 39885 -   chromium -    Audio doesn't pause immediately - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a noticeable delay when pausing an HTML5 audio/video element.  The   audio continues to play for a little bit longer.    This is due to our audio buffering and the latency between the renderer and   browser process.  The audio is buffered + sent to hardware in a different   process than the HTML5 audio/video element.  We need a better signalling   mechanism so that the audio does pause immediately. </pre>
