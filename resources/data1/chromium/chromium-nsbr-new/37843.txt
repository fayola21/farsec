<title>Issue 37843 -   chromium -    Feature request: Download a file by URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes  extensions or plugins do not handle the data they are assumed to   handle. For example  on my machine  Acrobat fails to load this large pdf file   when I type the URL in Chrome's address bar:    <a href="ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/final/sup01_ft.pdf">ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/final/sup01_ft.pdf</a>  (Why it does not do this  is another issue.)    Sometimes these files are hosted on an HTTP server where directory listings   are forbidden.    So  how do I download files like these? I would propose an &quot;Add new download&quot;   button in the &quot;Downloads&quot; page. Any other suggestions? </pre>
