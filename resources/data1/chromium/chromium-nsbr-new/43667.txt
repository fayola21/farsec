<title>Issue 43667 -   chromium -    Mac doesn't sleep when Chrome is running. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev  URLs (if applicable) : any or none  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Run chrome. Tabs open or urls loaded don't matter.      Macbook should sleep after idle time specified in energy saver preference pane.      Macbook does not sleep after idle time. If the macbook is running on battery power  the battery   gets drained completely and my macbook finally goes into safe sleep (i.e. hibernate  ram gets   saved to hard drive and macbook powers off. Can't wake up unless I plug in).    Quitting chrome fixes the issue  and the macbook can go to sleep normally.    In Console I see this error:  5/8/10 12:10:58 AM	[0x0-0x135034f].com.google.Chrome[31533]	  [31533:519:459993151466579:ERROR:/b/slave/chrome-official-  mac/build/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/browser_window_cocoa.mm(147)] Not implemented   reached in virtual void BrowserWindowCocoa::ShelfVisibilityChanged()    I see it a bunch of times when waking from safe sleep.
