<title>Issue 34766 -   chromium -    add &quot;experimental APIs&quot; section to extension docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As we add experimental APIs  there will come a time where we want to start   getting feedback on them  but we're not ready to move them out of   experimental.  We should add a section to the docs to link to these.  We   probably shouldn't blindly add all experimental APIs there  since some simply   aren't ready to be looked at  so we need a mechanism to selectively add them.    We should also have a landing page that explains what these APIs are  how to   use them (adding the command-line flag) and the caveats (will break  can't   publish in gallery  etc.).   </pre>
