<title>Issue 29277 -   chromium -    Clicking a link from a browserAction popup (on Linux) can crash the tab.   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21 (Official Build 33275)                    1. Create an extension with a popup for a browserAction.  Create a link in  that popup pointing to  say   <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd">http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd</a>  2. Load the extension (packed or unpacked) into your LINUX chrome (dev  channel).  3. Click the browser action button  then click the link in the popup.      You navigate to www.google.com  which redirects you to the wikipedia page      It redirects you  but immediately crashes the tab (and any other tabs  already opened via clicking links in the popup).  Note that this doesn't  happen for all redirects  only for some (such as the example  above).   </pre>
