<title>Issue 35483 -   chromium -    [Native Translator] the bar flashes with forward/backward navigation. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.322.0 (Official Build 38504)    -Launch Google chrome for EN UI.  -Navigate to non-english page to quick of native translator bar  -Navigate to a English webapge in the same tab.  -Do backward navigation to non-english webpage.    Issue:  As soon as non-english page is rendered  the native translator bar shows   up for a second and hides and then shows up again (basically  it will do a   flash).     I guess  once we show the bar in navigation  then it should be consistent   (no hide/show)   </pre>
