Open a chrome tab/window to a page with scroll bars. Also  highlight some text.  2. Open Mac OS X Appearance system preference pane.  3. Change appearance from Blue to Graphite. Notice Chrome scroll bars do not respect change in   existing window (opening a new window gets the change  and oddly  changing from Graphite   back to Blue seems to work).  4. Change highlight color. Notice highlighted text does not change properly.  5. Change &quot;Place scroll arrows&quot; between &quot;Together&quot; and &quot;At top and bottom&quot; and notice Chrome   window scroll bars do not respect setting.    Possibly the other appearance settings are also not respected in real time  but these are obvious.        Chrome should respect appeareance changes in existing windows.        Chrome does not respect appeareance changes in existing windows.   </pre>
