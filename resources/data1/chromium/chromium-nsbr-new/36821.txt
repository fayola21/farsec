<title>Issue 36821 -   chromium -    Chromium can't allow XHR to local directories	 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think this is related with the issue:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20450">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20450</a>    Actually I want Google Chrome to grant me the permission to access local   files. Why? I am a software developer  and in most cases I debug Web Pages on   local hard drives  since it's much easier than setting up a web server.   However  without the access to local files  I am unable to run my program. I   think you may have disable the XHR access to local files for some reason  but   many users  like me  need this feature. If there is such conflict  could you   add a configuration setting so that we can customize the permission?     Thanks   </pre>
