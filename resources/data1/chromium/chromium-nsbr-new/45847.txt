<title>Issue 45847 -   chromium -    Opening bookmark in new tab should keep focus on existing tab? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (pasting an edited version of a user forum post)    In the old bookmark manager  and also in current 'normal' browser tabs  a   middle click on a link opened up the link in a new tab  but kept focus in   the existing tab. A right-click/open in new tab exhibits the same   behaviour. This is also the case from the 'Other bookmarks' drop down -   i.e. middle click on one of the links in the Other Bookmarks opens the link   in a new tab  but you're still seeing the original tab in the browser.     Now  when I do this in the bookmark manager tab  it opens it in the new   tab  but shifts my focus into the new one. If I want to open several at a   time (which is what I normally do in the bookmark manager)  I need to click   back to the bookmark tab  middle click  click back to the bookmark tab    middle click etc.     If we can fix that  and make middle clicks open a new tab  but keep focus   in the bookmark manager  then that would make it all consistent again.    ------------------------------    It does seem like we should keep the focus on the existing tab  just like   we do with normal links on webpages.   </pre>
