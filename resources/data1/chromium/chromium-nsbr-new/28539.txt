<title>Issue 28539 -   chromium -    Investigate Direct2D support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See some motivation at   <a href="http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/2009/11/22/direct2d-hardware-">http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/2009/11/22/direct2d-hardware-</a>  rendering-a-browser .  If we can speed up the rendering time  the most   noticeable benefit will probably be smoother-feeling scrolling.    Note that this is different than <a title="Investigate DirectWrite support"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25541">issue 25541</a> (although both would probably   have equivalent minimum OS requirements) and I believe different from <a title="Consider using DirectDraw to manage the RenderWidgetHost's backingstore."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12587">issue   12587</a> as well. </pre>
