<title>Issue 28163 -   chromium -    Tab Focus is not reversible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Startup Chrome Mac (4.0.249.0)��_��_��_    The selection should be in the omnibox  and the new tab page should be loaded below.    2. Hit the &lt;Tab&gt; Key.     Selection is now somewhere in the web contents of the new tab page.    3. Hit &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Tab&gt;    My expectation is for focus to return to the omnibox (since this was the last element with focus).  Instead focus moves to some other place on the new tab page.  It looks like what happened is when I hit &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Tab&gt; that first time time  focus actually got moved to the _last_ element on the page. Since if I   hit &lt;Tab&gt; now I actually get returned to the omnibox!    I hit this same problem with older versions of Mac Chrome  but couldn't reproduce when I had gone to file a bug. </pre>
