<title>Issue 45162 -   chromium -    SimulateOSClick doesn't work correctly on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The mouse event automation from <a title="Implement UI automation on Mac" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26102"> bug 26102 </a> doesn't do simulated clicks correctly; they end up at   the wrong location. I think we want to use calls that actually move the mouse around  instead of just   creating NSEvents. </pre>
