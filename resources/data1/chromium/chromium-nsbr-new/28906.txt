<title>Issue 28906 -   chromium -    session php unset bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;             Safari 4: not tested    Firefox 3.x: works            IE 7: not tested            IE 8: not tested           IE8+chrome frame: bug happens      SESSION_MY_USER is a defined string.  1. session_start();  2.$_SESSION[SESSION_MY_USER] = new UserObject();  3.set a bunch of data in $_SESSION[SESSION_MY_USER]  4.unset($_SESSION[SESSION_MY_USER]);  5.session_destroy();  6.session_start();       after creating a new $_SESSION[SESSION_MY_USER] of type UserObject()  i should have a clean new UserObject() and should not be bringing the old  session data back.      when you log out and log in as some one else on the same pc it will  randomly jump from different sessions that where unset and should not be  there. this bug shows up on IE8 with chrome frames. but not in firefox 3.x  this compromises the security of my site if its going to randomly pull in  sessions that should not bet set anymore.    -----------------------------------------------------  please let me know if there is some kind of solution or bug fix that can  get this solved.       </pre>
