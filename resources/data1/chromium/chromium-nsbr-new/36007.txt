<title>Issue 36007 -   chromium -    add chrome.tabs.duplicate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since the idea of adding a keyboard shortcut to &quot;duplicate current tab&quot; was   rejected for some reason in <a title="Keyboard shortcut to &quot;Duplicate current tab&quot;" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7598"> Issue 7598 </a>   I am proposing to allow extensions to add one    Other browsers:  Ctrl+K in IE  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N in Opera  Ctrl+Drag in Firefox and possible to add a real keyboard solution using an   extension      currently only possible in chrome using the tab's context menu    (you can add a keyboard shortcut to open the same page in a new tab but   without keeping its history  forms  scrolling position etc) </pre>
