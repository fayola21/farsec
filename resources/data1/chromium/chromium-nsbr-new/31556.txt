<title>Issue 31556 -   chromium -    Add accidental search TLD+1 blacklist autodetector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From my email description about what needs to happen:    Copy the GoogleURLTracker class (i.e. its launch-after-startup and save-  results-to-prefs behaviors) to a new class that does three fetches of random   10-character strings.  If two resolve to the same TLD+1  we blacklist that   domain in the accidental search fetcher.    If <a title="Detect when switching networks" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26156"> bug 26156 </a> gets implemented  we should probably do this on each network   switch  not just at startup.  (FWIW  this is also true of the   GoogleURLTracker.) </pre>
