<title>Issue 39887 -   chromium -    Automatically build FFmpeg as part of Windows build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to get rid of our FFmpeg binary drops for Windows.    It's too much of a security risk and wasted a lot of peoples' time   investigating previously patched holes in FFmpeg.    This would require syncing a MinGW build environment via DEPS and using some   GYP wizardry to somehow build ffmpegsumo.dll inside MinGW. </pre>
