<title>Issue 30377 -   chromium -    problem viewing images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to the jcrew website  2. click on an item of clothing to view it (I was searching for women's   suits and blouses)  3. select another color or a different view  one among the smaller photos   under the primary photo    What is the expected result? I except to see the new image when I mouseover   the smaller photo underneath the main photo      What happens instead? instead I get the 'blank' placeholder (the tiny   rectangle in a white background) indicating the photo is not available.   Also  when I click on a thumbnail to view a larger size in a new window    the it never loads; rather  the little spiral indicating 'wait' just spins   and spins. But the jcrew site works fine in IE and FF  and also I think   chrome works fine on my husband's computer. We both have Dell's; mine's a   newish studio desktop.     <b>Please provide
