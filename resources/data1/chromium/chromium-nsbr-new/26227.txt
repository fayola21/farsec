<title>Issue 26227 -   chromium -    History ribbon/bar text is very fuzzy and blurry (on the new tab page) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29900">r29900</a> Linux Goobuntu  URLs (if applicable) : New Tab Page    See the attached picture.  All text is crisp and clear except for text in   the history ribbon/bar.  I am using Goobuntu with metacity and gnome and   pretty much default settings.  I do have sub-pixel font-rendering turned on.   </pre>
