<title>Issue 36794 -   chromium -    Themed drawing needs to include one px highlight at the top of the window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently themes draw flat to the top of the window  not providing enough   contrast with the window shadow. We need to draw:    1px  50% white  6px rounded corners  width should be outset by 0.5 px to make the left and right edges fall outside   of window bounds  height should be inset by 0.5 px to make the edge fall just inside the top of   window bounds. </pre>
