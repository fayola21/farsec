<title>Issue 37326 -   chromium -    Ability to set a default download folder in preferences and be able to push prefs out to clients and have it set for them. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta    OS version               : 10.5.8 and 10.6.2      Using Preference Manifests I have it set to ~/Desktop.      Able to set Desktop in the preferences and it automatically changes it to the logged in users   Desktop folder.      1. Pushing out Chrome to hundreds of clients and wanting to set default prefs for clients by   putting the prefs into /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Library/Application   Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Preferences    2. Need to be able to set the path for downloads.  It seems somewhat hardcoded and you can't   use OS X wildcards for users.   Example is below:      &quot;download&quot;: {        &quot;default_directory&quot;: &quot;/Users/ball/Desktop&quot;         &quot;directory_upgrade&quot;: true         &quot;extensions_to_open&quot;: &quot;&quot;    Should be able to set the following for &quot;/Users/ball/Desktop&quot; for all users  shouldn't be hard   coded for the first user that set the setting:    &quot;/Users/%@/Desktop&quot;   or   &quot;~/Desktop&quot;    So if a user gets the preferences on login that are already set for them it will automatically go to   the users Desktop when files are downloaded.      To be able to use a wild card in the Preference file so when its pushed out to clients you it works   for all users.   Wildcard is   %@ and ~/  for users Home Directory.      The first person that sets the preference gets hard coded into the preference file.  Trying to set a   wildcard doesn't work.   </pre>
