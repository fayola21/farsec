<title>Issue 23452 -   chromium -     valgrind: need a way to suppress flaky hanging tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Linux valgrind bot has an intermittent failure in   UnloadTest.BrowserCloseInfiniteBeforeUnload:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/2">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/2</a>  73/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio    This test is listed as flakey chrome/test/data/valgrind/ui_tests.gtest.txt:  # Flaky timeout on Linux; see <a href="http://crbug.com/22927">http://crbug.com/22927</a>  UnloadTest.BrowserCloseInfiniteBeforeUnload    Which is fine.  However  the suppressions file doesn't work as intended.  If this test flakily failed    it would work.  However  the failure is hang (timeout) which isn't detected/suppressed and   causes the tree to go red.  Change requested here is to fix processing of the suppressions file so   that hanging tests get recognized and suppressed properly.    Sent to Ian as a candidate for the green tree task force.           </pre>
