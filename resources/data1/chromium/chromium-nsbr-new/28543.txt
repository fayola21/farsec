<title>Issue 28543 -   chromium -    Problem with Release built on Fedora 10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.256.0 (32782)    I compiled source on Fedora 10  32 bit.     Debug works fine. Release doesn't work  it shows &quot;aw  snap&quot; for most pages  including cnn.com.   At first the page loads  but than in a second or so it is replaced by &quot;aw   snap&quot;. Also it reports this in the console    *** glibc detected *** /home/ing/chromium2/src/out/Release/chrome  --type=renderer --lang=en-US  --force-fieldtest=AsyncSlowStart/_AsyncSlowStart_off/CacheSize/CacheSizeGroup_0/DnsImpact/_default_enabled_prefetch/GlobalSdch/_global_enable_sdch/SocketLateBinding/_disable_late_binding/  --channel=3284.0xb4d1830.882946236: corrupted double-linked list:  0x0b564320 ***    When building Release I modified cookies_tree_model.cc as described here  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/414025/diff/1/2">http://codereview.chromium.org/414025/diff/1/2</a> to fix an error (Debug  compiled fine without this change).          1. Build Release on Fedora 10  2. chrome cnn.com  3. The page will start loading and than go &quot;aw  snap&quot;.      Should work normally  as debug build      &quot;aw  snap&quot;       </pre>
