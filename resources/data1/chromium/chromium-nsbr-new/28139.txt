<title>Issue 28139 -   chromium -    browser window jumps off screen when moving partially off screen window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	4.0.237.0 (Official Build 31086)  WebKit	532.4  V8	1.3.18.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.4  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.237.0 Safari/532.4      URLs (if applicable) : not applicable  Other browsers tested: not applicable          1.  Place the browser window slightly off screen.  2.  Let go of the window.  3.  Grab the window and try to move it back on screen.    Actual behavior:    The browser window moves completely off screen but can be dragged on  screen with the mouse pointer leading the window by many inches.    Expected behavior:    The browser window should not jump off the screen.    Particular annoyances:    When the browser window jumps off the top of the screen  there is not  enough screen real estate to pull the top of the browswer back onto the screen.       </pre>
