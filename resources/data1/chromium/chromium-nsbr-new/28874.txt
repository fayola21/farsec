<title>Issue 28874 -   chromium -    &quot;Child&quot; tabs crash when parent tab crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.255.0 (32765)  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Go to a web page in a tab (let's call it tab #1)  2. Create new tabs by doing &quot;open in a new tab&quot; on links from tab#1 (I   usually do this with cmd-click on a link)  3. Go to a page in tab #1 that crashes that tab (sometimes   <a href="http://lifehacker.com">http://lifehacker.com</a> crashes a tab for me.. not sure why  but it's   intermittent... there are probably many more pages that will crash a tab   more consistently)      Only tab#1 will crash      Tab #1 and its &quot;children&quot; all crash simultaneously... even if the child tabs   are done loading the pages and currently idle.  Other tabs that are not   children of tab#1 remain stable. </pre>
