<title>Issue 36960 -   chromium -    Add more SSL connection info to net::SSLInfo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This issue is related to <a title="More detail needed on cipher suite chosen.  "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27507">issue 27507</a>.    Right now the net::SSLInfo structure has the following members:      scoped_refptr&lt;X509Certificate&gt; cert;    int cert_status;    int security_bits;    We should add more SSL connection info to this structure  such as:      // Bitmask of the status of the SSL connection.  An example of a bit    // flag would be SSL_STATUS_NO_RENEGOTIATION_INFO  which is set if the    // server does not support SSL secure renegotiation (RFC 5746).    //    // Note: It is tempting to just add this bit to the existing cert_status    // bitmask  but the renegotiation-info extension support has nothing to    // do with the server's certificate  so adding this bit to cert_status    // could be confusing.    int connection_status;      // The negotiated cipher suite.  This could replace security_bits.    int cipher_suite;      // The negotiated compression method.    int compression_method;    These new members could improve our Page Security Information dialog.    These members may also need to be added to the NavigationEntry::SSLStatus  class. </pre>
