<title>Issue 43458 -   chromium -    Add Proxy policy  possibly convert from command-line option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  setting the proxy is either done in the Windows Proxy settings   dialogs  or is done on the command line.    Administrators will want to set the proxy settings manually via policy.  We   should add those policies necessary to make this happen (proxy url  PAC   script  etc.)? </pre>
