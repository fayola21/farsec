<title>Issue 28106 -   chromium -    Mac: edit commands (cut  copy  paste  maybe some others) not properly disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a web page and make sure nothing is selected (i.e.  don't touch   anything).  2. Open the Edit menu.  3. Press Cmd-C  for example.      In 2.  Cut  Copy  and Paste (and Paste and Match Style) should probably be   disabled. Even if you select something  Cut and Paste (and P&amp;MS) should   probably still be disabled. In 3.  Cmd-C shouldn't do anything. Instead  it   flashes the menu  even though the command doesn't do anything.    Obviously  we're not disabling the menu items. I don't know if we're   plumbing up the data to do so (have to see what happens on Windows). I   don't think this has ever worked correctly on MacChrome. </pre>
