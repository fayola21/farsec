<title>Issue 40311 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: absolutely positioned elements jump/skip/hop in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> REGRESSION: absolutely positioned elements jump/skip/hop in Chrome    Example page:  <a href="http://webdesign.com/using-google-chrome-for-development/">http://webdesign.com/using-google-chrome-for-development/</a>    Observed in:  5.0.369.0 (Developer Build 43565) on Vista w/ classic mode    The recent changes to WebKit to make it implement optimized scrolling on   pages with fixed position elements is surely to blame.  I can't imagine how   it can not have this bug given that it independently informs the embedder of   scrolling and invalidation.  There may be some flags that we are not   observing correctly however.    We need to do something about this for M5. </pre>
