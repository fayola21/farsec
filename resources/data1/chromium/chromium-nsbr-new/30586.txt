<title>Issue 30586 -   chromium -    When dragging text  the drag icon is not placed correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. Go to any page with text.  2. Highlight some text.  3. Begin dragging the text.    What is the expected result? Should show the text being dragged as a kind   of drag indicator or drag icon.  (See how it works on Safari.)      What happens instead? A globe drag icon is displayed which is placed about   70 pixels too high.  See attached screenshot.  The mouse cursor doesn't   appear in the screenshot  but it's on top of the highlighted text.  Notice   how much higher the drag icon is.   </pre>
