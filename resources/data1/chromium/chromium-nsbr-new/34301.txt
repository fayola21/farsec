Accumulate a fair amount of cookies over regular use over a few months. This means probably   a few hundred sites  possibly a few thousand cookies  2. Open the cookie manager from the preferences dialog  3. Try to do anything with the cookie manager  such as scroll through the list or search for a   string in the search field.      The cookie manager responds to user input.      The cookie manager freezes the entire Chrome app  every time. The app does not become   responsive again in a reasonable amount of time. Must force quit each time.    Profile of frozen process is attached.   </pre>
