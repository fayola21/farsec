<title>Issue 44529 -   chromium -    Cannot distingish converting segment while using ibus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1.Install ibus-hangul  2.Turn on ibus-hangul and enable Hanja mode  3.Type gksgksgks  4.Make sure 3 &quot;�Ǖ�_&quot;s in pre-edit area    What is the expected output?     1st candidate for conversion is &quot;__��___��_&quot;  so first two &quot;�Ǖ�_&quot; should have a  different attribute (ex. highlight) comparing to the remaining one &quot;�Ǖ�_&quot;  to show converting segment.    What do you see instead?    The three &quot;�Ǖ�_&quot;s share the same attribute. So we cannot distinguish the  converting segment.    Note that ibus-mozc seems to have the same problem.
