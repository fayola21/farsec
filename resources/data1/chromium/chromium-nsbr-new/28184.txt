<title>Issue 28184 -   chromium -    Change ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS to ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS_MAC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Due to the lateness of the hour  the menu item in the main menu and in the toolbar for importing   settings was set to ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS  which does not have an ellipses as it should.  Add   ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS_MAC or equivalent to the localizable strings and replace   ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS with ^IDS_IMPORT_SETTINGS_MAC (or equivalent) in the MainMenu.xib and   Toolbar.xib. </pre>
