<title>Issue 29537 -   chromium -    Tabs are getting closed when clicking on their title when there is no X (and a gap in the tabs bar) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :    Google Chrome	4.0.237.0 (Official Build 31086)    WebKit	532.4    V8	1.3.18.1    User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)     AppleWebKit/532.4 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.237.0 Safari/532.4      The problem is a bit tricky but I found how to reproduce it:  1. Open many many tabs  until the closing tab X is not visible anymore.  2. Choose one of the tabs which makes the X to appear.  3. Close this tab in the X.  4. Now  press on any other tab but in the right most area of the tab (no   need to be very accurate).  5. At this point the tab you just wanted to select was just closed and the   same will happen over and over when choosing other tabs in the right area   of them.       Selecting the new tab.      The tab is being closed.    The screenshot happened to me while trying to reproduce this bug. Not   sure if it's related or not. Moreover  if you switch to a different chrome   window and back the problem is temporarily resolved until you close   another tab.    </pre>
