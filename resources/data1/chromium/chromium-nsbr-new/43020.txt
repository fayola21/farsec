<title>Issue 43020 -   chromium -    Report Bug or Broken Website not accessible through anything but Pages menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;v5.0.342.9'&gt;                      The &quot;Report Bug or Broken Website&quot; form is only accessible through the Page Menu button  if   disabled then this important option is missing entirely. Like Safari this option should be in the   main &quot;Chrome&quot; (OS X) menu  making this as accessible as possible is the best way to keep track   of all errors. </pre>
