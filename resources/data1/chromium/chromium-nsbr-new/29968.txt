<title>Issue 29968 -   chromium -    Extension icon resizing doesn't work for 128x128 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you install an extension  a confirmation dialog appears with the 128x128   icon. If the icon is sized at 128x128 to begin with  it shows up  but if it's   larger (e.g. 200) it won't be resized so no icon is shown.    I've attached 2 zipped extensions. 128.zip works  200.zip doesn't. </pre>
