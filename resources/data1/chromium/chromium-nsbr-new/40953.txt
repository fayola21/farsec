<title>Issue 40953 -   chromium -    Support custom integral ranges in histograms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In some applications of histograms  the range of allowed samples is broad    and only a few values are legal.  A good example is when handling some   error codes  which often consist of a small number of broadly spaced   enumerated values.    One easy enhancement would be to support a predefined list of ranges.  The   histogram constructor should accept an array of plausible values  and   automatically generate a histogram range-vector that cleanly handles   exactly those values.  The current histogram code uses a binary search to find applicable bucket   ranges  so this extension to histograms could be performed with minimal   changes to the existing code.    Note that this bug is distinct from one which would support sparse samples    at (on a per user base) at small number of unpredictable values.  I am not   an advocate for that support at this point. </pre>
