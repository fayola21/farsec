<title>Issue 23981 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] Forward and back buttons don't work in Wave. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> note: this chrome &quot;x-clock&quot;'s correctly so we do not need a cf: prefix.    1) http://go/wave  2) wave opens after the SS0 dance  3) click a wave  4) click another wave    The browsers fwd/back buttons should now be active.  They are not and   the back button doesn't work  for example.    From joshia:  Well  I think the real issue is that back forward does not work in case the   navigation happened using '#' (bookmark) or inside any sub frame in the   page. These type of navigations originate and are consumed by the active   document (mshtml or Chrome Frame)  and the active document merely tells   IE to add the navigation entry to its travel log. When back/forward is   invoked  IE uses a different path to indicate navigations and we don't   support it yet. </pre>
