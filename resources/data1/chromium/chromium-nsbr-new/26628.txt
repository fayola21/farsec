<title>Issue 26628 -   chromium -    Back button doesn't restore focused link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29903)         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK    Note: focus is restored to form fields just fine.  This is about the mechanism   for selecting ordinary links with the keyboard.      1. Press tab until the link you want has a yellow border  2. Press enter to follow the link  3. Press alt-leftarrow to go back      The link should still have its yellow border.      I have to tab through all the previous links to get to where I was.  Or  you   know  use the mouse. </pre>
