<title>Issue 29650 -   chromium -    video hangs if you set rate and then play - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. go/videotestmatrix  2. click a video (ie bbee2.ogv) then a rate (ie 1x)  then a video... go   back and forth.  About 4 times should be enough.    What is the expected output?  Video should play.    What do you see instead?  Video hangs.  Sometimes for a really long time  like 1 minute  and then it   plays.  Most of the time it stays hung.  The browser and html are still alive  but no videos will play at all once   in this state.    Tested on Windows Vista64.  Happens on Chrome3 as well as Chrome4  3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)   </pre>
