<title>Issue 40428 -   chromium -    Add chrome.tabs.getCurrentTab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Extension views need to be able to figure out which tab they belong to.    This came up when a user asked how to have infobars show dynamic message   based on which tab it is in. The infobar has no way to look it up and the   background page can only enumerate the windows  but has no way to associate   that to the tabs.    The idea is to implement a getCurrentTab on the tabs object  which would look   up the tab that the view belongs to and return it.    For background pages and popups this value would be null. </pre>
