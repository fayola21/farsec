<title>Issue 37258 -   chromium -    Update windows python binaries to 2.5 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Windows uses python binaries for 2.4 checked in at: trunk/deps/third_party/python_24  Mac and Linux use system-installed python2.5.    It would be good to update the win binaries to python2.5.  We are beginning to write python tests and it's important that all platforms have the same python version for consistency.    Also  python2.4 misses some important python libraries (like hashlib).    AFAIK  there's another instance of python present in depot_tools for win. It would also be nice to use the same version there as well. </pre>
