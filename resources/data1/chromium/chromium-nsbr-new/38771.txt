<title>Issue 38771 -   chromium -    aero peek sometime have no preview - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Developer Build 42189)      i don't know when exactly it happens but sometime i don't see a preview or a   real preview (when you hover over it and the window changes) of a tab  the preview is than a blank withe page    it could be  because i loaded the tab in background and never looked at it  or it could have something to do with my use of chromium (i use a normal and   a incognito at the same time and move over all preview's in area peek) </pre>
