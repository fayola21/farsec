<title>Issue 41151 -   chromium -    Chrome Crashes intermittently while typing in omnibar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900)      1. On occasion (every few hours) while typing in the omnibar of a new tab   page.        Doesn't crash.      Chrome will crash and ask to relaunch.  This seems pretty hard to reproduce   and I couldn't find it in a search but hopefully a critical mass of reports   is gathered for testing.   </pre>
