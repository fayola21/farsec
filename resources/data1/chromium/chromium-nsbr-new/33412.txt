<title>Issue 33412 -   chromium -    [CF - Settings - Popup] Chrome Frame is not honoring IE's popup blocker settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Turn off popup blocker in IE  2. Try to access a website which has popups with CF    Alternatively:    1. Add a website which has popups to IE's popup exception list  2. Try to access that website with CF        Ideally CF should honor IE's popup blocker settings and doesn't block  popups in this case  but currently it still blocks popups.    Alternatively:    CF should not block popups of website which is in IE's popup exception  list  but currently it does.    This happens in all versions of CF.       </pre>
