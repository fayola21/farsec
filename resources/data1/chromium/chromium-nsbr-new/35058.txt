<title>Issue 35058 -   chromium -    rebaseline tool should delete results if they match upstream - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I switched a layout test upstream to be a dumpAsText() test.  When I ran the   rebaseline tool  it put new .txt files in the win and mac directory.  However    these result files are identical to the results upstream.  The rebaseline tool   should be smart enough to delete the .txt files since they match upstream.    It would be even more awesome if it knew to delete the .png and .checksum   files  but that's probably harder to know. </pre>
