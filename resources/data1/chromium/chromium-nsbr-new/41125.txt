<title>Issue 41125 -   chromium -    Chromium starts maximized in 4:3 mode on 1024x600 screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.376.0 (44211)  Is this the most recent version: Yes    Chromium starts maximized to 800x600 on a 1024x600 screen. It is in   maximized state  just that it limits itself to 4:3 mode. De-maximizing and   re-maximizing fixes it.    This is with -start-maximized and/or when returning from a maximized state. </pre>
