<title>Issue 23296 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: &quot;Find in page&quot; hogs keyboard focus when switching back to tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1      1. Open the &quot;find in page&quot; bar (Ctrl+F)  2. Type something  3. Highlight the page URL in the omnibox  4. Open a new tab  5. Click on the tab that was active previously      Keyboard focus returns to the omnibox  or wherever it was the last time the   tab was active      Keyboard focus goes to the &quot;find in page&quot; bar  and the contents of the   search is highlighted. The URL is also still displayed highlighted blue  as   though it has keyboard focus. This is misleading  as well as unexpected   behaviour  because there is no reason to think the user wants to return to   the &quot;find in page&quot; bar after performing tab-related tasks.   </pre>
