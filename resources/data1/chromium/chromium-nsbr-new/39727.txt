<title>Issue 39727 -   chromium -    Short cut key for extensions with Popup views. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.8 (Official Build 42697) beta    *** This is a feature request. ***    For extension maintainers  who use the extension browser-action &quot;pop-up&quot; feature  it would be    great to assign a short cut key (a key that was free)  perhaps in the manifest file  so users   could gain easier access to these type of extensions.    It becomes evident  from a users perspective  that chrome extensions can use keyboard short cuts   (thanks to the use of background scripts) but unfortunately developers cannot invoke the pop-up   action using these (unless I missed some documentation somewhere?). I feel it would bridge a   definite usability gap to allow developers to do the same for browser-action pop-ups! </pre>
