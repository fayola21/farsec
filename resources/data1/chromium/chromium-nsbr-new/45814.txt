<title>Issue 45814 -   chromium -    Chrome sync starts up in OFFLINE_UNUSABLE if no network is detected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Disable ethernet.   Start chrome.   About:sync shows OFFLINE_UNUSABLE  OFFLINE_UNUSABLE state causes extremely strange sync behavior. We should remove this mode or   do something drastic when it occurs.    Chrome should start in OFFLINE mode  not OFFLINE_UNUSABLE  which should only occur if initial   sync was never completed.    The result of this is pretty bad  many changes that occur to the bookmark model while we are in   OFFLINE_UNUSABLE mode are lost. It looks like model association reoccurs and wipes out user   changes. Organizing your bookmarks offline thus results in extremely odd behavior. </pre>
