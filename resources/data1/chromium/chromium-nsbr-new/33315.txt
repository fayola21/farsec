<title>Issue 33315 -   chromium -    Pinned tabs should not be blinked when 'Close others tabs' menu item is highlighted. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37221">r37221</a>)    -Have a pinned tab and a normal tab.  -Set keyboard focus on normal tab  right click on tabstrip and say 'Close   other tabs' from the interstitial context menu.    Expected: Pinned tabs should be closed.    Issue: tabs are not closed. In case  If we are not supporting this  then   we should not flash/blink the pinned tabs  when user highlights the   option 'Close other tabs' of tabstrip's context menu.    PS: The bug is also applied to 'Close tabs to the right' option. </pre>
