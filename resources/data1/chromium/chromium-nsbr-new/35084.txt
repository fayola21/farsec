<title>Issue 35084 -   chromium -    Content Settings dialog should be modal to parent window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Content Settings dialog should be modal to its parent window if the   parent window is the options dialog.    When the parent is the browser window (i.e. triggered by the content blocked   bubble)  I'm not so sure.  Ben  thoughts?  I'm leaning toward making that   modal too. </pre>
