<title>Issue 40098 -   chromium -    Flash plugin does not respond to mouse on some sites (e.g. bbc news) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 (Official Build 42476) beta  URLs (if applicable) : (e.g.) news.bbc.co.uk  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK (as expected)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK (as expected)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: unable to test      1. Go to news.bbc.co.uk and play any media (tv or radio clip)  2. Try to interact with the Flash clip using the mouse (e.g. to change volume or pause)    This also happens intermittently when playing embedded YouTube clips in reader.google.com    but many other sites (such as YouTube itself) are fine.      Clicks will be passed to the plugin (e.g. clip will pause)      Nothing - it's as if there was no click.   </pre>
