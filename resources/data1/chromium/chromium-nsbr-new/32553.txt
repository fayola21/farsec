<title>Issue 32553 -   chromium -    Security certificates not trusted from valid sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Fail to currently be the subject of a man-in-the-middle attack.  2. Use Chrome for a while.  3. Go to an HTTPS site.        Normal web browsing.        &quot;The site's security certificate is not trusted! You attempted to reach   www.google.com  but the server presented a certificate issued by an entity   that is not trusted by your computer's operating system. [etc.]&quot;    If I press the yellow triangle in the address bar  I see that the Thawte   certificate  due to expire in May 2014  is &quot;signed by an unknown authority &quot;   and of course validation fails down the chain after that. FWIW  the serial   number is 805306370 and the SHA1 fingerprint is EC 07 10 03 D8 F5 A3   7F 42 C4 55 7F 65 6A AE 86 65 FA 4B 02.    <b>Please provide
