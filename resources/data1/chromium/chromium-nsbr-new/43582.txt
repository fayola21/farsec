<title>Issue 43582 -   chromium -    &quot;Waiting for cache&quot; status message isn't always true - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My understanding is that given chromium's network stack  while one network   transaction is completing  if there is a second request for the same URL    then the request will be blocked at the cache.  The &quot;Waiting for cache&quot;   message is misleading  because you're not actually waiting to load something   from the cache  but rather are waiting for the first network transaction to   complete.  I'm not sure how important this is from an end user perspective    but I think some users get confused by the &quot;Waiting for cache&quot; message    since they then think that the cache is really slow or something.  Perhaps   more importantly  if their dns is slow or whatever  they aren't getting the   correct message  so they might incorrectly fault chromium for being slow. </pre>
