<title>Issue 39147 -   chromium -    Check order of actions in ExtensionsService::UninstallExtension() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As discussed with erikkay (cf.   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1095003/diff/27001/28003#newcode281">http://codereview.chromium.org/1095003/diff/27001/28003#newcode281</a> )  we   should check whether we really want to unload the extension before starting   to clean up. Sounds more sane than what we currently have  but we need to   investigate first. </pre>
