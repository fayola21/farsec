<title>Issue 39504 -   chromium -    submenu deficiencies in extension context menu API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows/MacOS the existing context menu display code only supports 2   levels  a top level and one level of child items. On linux  it only supports   1 (ie just the top level).    Right now we just don't display items beyond the 2nd level (or 1st in the   case of linux).    The data model of the context menu API does support arbitrary depth  although   we may want to add a limit of something like 3. </pre>
