<title>Issue 40171 -   chromium -    [Geolocation] Geolocation should prompt user with options like &quot;remember my choice&quot; and &quot;ask me every time&quot; when wesite tries to track location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the location tracking prompt info-bar only has option Allow and  Deny  once user selects one of them  then it takes effect permanently   however this is not convenient.    Just like cookies  it should provide user with options like &quot;remember my  chose&quot; and &quot;ask me every time&quot;  in this way user can select either  allow/deny tracking location long term or just for the given time.             </pre>
