<title>Issue 35603 -   chromium -    Password is rewritten into keychain after user clears it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.322.2 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38810">r38810</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1. Login to Gmail and save the password and logout.  2. While you are in the login page with your id and password autofilled by Chrome  clear your passwords (Preferences &gt; Personal Stuff   &gt; Clear Browsing data).  3. Now click sign-in on your Gmail login page  to log into your account.  4. Log out.    Expected:  As in Windows Chrome the id and password field should be empty  since you cleared your passwords.    Actual:  Chrome writes the password again into the keychain  this time without informing the user.   </pre>
