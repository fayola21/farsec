<title>Issue 39924 -   chromium -    disable manage content settings button in omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897) dev    Feature request: Option to not see the page icon button that manages cookie   settings. When third-party cookies are blocked a page action appears in the   omnibar that has the picture of a cookie and red cross. when clicked i have   the option to manage content blocking.   I would like the option to not see this icon for the pages i visit. I don't   find it necessary and no offense but its not the nicest thing to look at for   every page.   </pre>
