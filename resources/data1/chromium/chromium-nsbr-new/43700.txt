<title>Issue 43700 -   chromium -    Feature request: allow extensions to access Inspector API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As I understand it  the Inspector is a bunch of JS + HTML that is powered by   a custom Inspector API. It would be great if this API were exposed to   ordinary extensions as well.    In particular  the extension I'm working on could really benefit from being   able to call getEventListenersForNodeAsync() -- finding out what event   listeners have been added to a DOM element. </pre>
