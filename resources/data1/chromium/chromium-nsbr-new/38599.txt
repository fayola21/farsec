<title>Issue 38599 -   chromium -    Dragging text on mac hangs tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) dev  WebKit	533.3  V8	2.1.4.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.3   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.356.0 Safari/533.3  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -  psn_0_19567272    URLs (if applicable) : All of them  Other browsers tested: n/a         Safari 4: ok    Firefox 3.x: ok           IE 7: ok           IE 8: ok      Hilighting text and then dragging the selection causes the tab to hang and become unresponsive.    It closes cleanly with no error message.  There is no sad tab error.      Text can be dragged around via drag and drop.  This is a regression from the previous dev   channel release.      The tab is completely unresponsive but closes cleanly with cmd-w.  </pre>
