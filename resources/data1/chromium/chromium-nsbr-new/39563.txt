<title>Issue 39563 -   chromium -    Renderer segmentation fault in webkit_glue::WebMediaPlayerImpl::load when a page with many audio elements is loaded. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A segmentation fault occurs in webkit_glue::WebMediaPlayerImpl::load when a   page constructed by     $ perl -e 'print &quot;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;foo.ogg&quot;&gt;n&quot; x 500' &gt; bad.html  is loaded. The error occurs at least in 32-bit Linux with Ubuntu 9.10 using   Chromium versions     Chromium        5.0.307.11 (Developer Build 39572) Ubuntu     Google Chrome   5.0.342.7 (Official Build 42476) beta     Chromium        5.0.365 0 (Developer Build 42904).    There is a minimum value for the repetition above which all files cause the   error. More repetition might be needed to trigger the issue on other   platforms.    A stack trace and the triggering file are attached. Possibly just a   harmless null deref  but reported as a security issue to be on the safe   side.   </pre>
