<title>Issue 31051 -   chromium -    SELinux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I run Fedora 11. My software updater downloaded and installed some updates  tonight and some of them were chromium related. When I tried to open  Chromium SELinux complained. So I uninstalled Chromium with yum and  reinstalled it. SELinux is now complaining about the new install. I have  attached the SELinux alert.         </pre>
