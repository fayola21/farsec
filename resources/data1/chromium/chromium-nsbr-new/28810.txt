<title>Issue 28810 -   chromium -    Downloads / History page loses scrolling position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Ctrl+J to open the Downloads page (for example)  2. Ctrl+F to search for something in the downloads page  search for   something that will move the scrolling position down  3. Click on on one of the links to files you downloaded      the scrolling position willl revert to the top  and sometimes the wrong   file will open too (because in the new scrolling position  the cursor is   over some other file...)    there's no reason for the scrolling position to change at all.      reproduced using latest dev channel build and ToT under Windows XP   </pre>
