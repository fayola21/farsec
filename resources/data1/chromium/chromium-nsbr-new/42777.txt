<title>Issue 42777 -   chromium -    Extensions:  Experimental Pop-Up API windows do not reposition to avoid screen boundaries. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install an extension that displays a popup-window via   chrome.experimental.popup.show(...).  2. Position the chrome window such that the popup window is partially   clipped by the screen.  3. Contents of the popup become inaccessible unless the user moves the   chrome-window such that the popup is fully displayed.        The pop-up should reposition itself about the arrow anchor  if it is   possible to display the popup in a different orientation such that the full   contents of the popup view will be visible.       </pre>
