<title>Issue 36740 -   chromium -    If the first thread to call SSLClientSocketNSS::Connect is not the IO thread  EnsureOCSPInit() DCHECKs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. As the first SSL Connection for a browser session  call   SSLClientSocketNSS::Connect on an arbitrary thread  as is done in   notifier::SSLSocketAdapter::BeginSSL()  2.  DCHECK fails in OCSPInitSingleton()        I expect SSLClientSocketNSS::Connect() to succeed.    This has the effect of breaking bookmark sync on Linux. </pre>
