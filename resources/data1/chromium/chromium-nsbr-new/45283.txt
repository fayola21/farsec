<title>Issue 45283 -   chromium -    &quot;blocked&quot; popups can still display notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a page that attempts to create a popup via window.open() that will be blocked by the   popup blocker  2. Have the popup page display a desktop notification when it is loaded        Expected output: nothing  because the popup is blocked    Actual output: popup is blocked  but the notification is still displayed. It seems odd to me that   popups that are blocked are still loaded and still have their script executed.    As an aside  I'm wondering if there's maybe some overlap between notifications and popups - if a   page is allowed to display notifications  shouldn't it also be allowed to display popups (why are   these settings treated differently)?    I'm attaching two files - test.html and popup.html. Load test.html in a browser  click on the   &quot;request permission&quot; button to request notifications permissions  and click &quot;Allow&quot; in the   resulting infobar.    Then click on the &quot;Popup&quot; button  which displays a popup via setTimeout() which should be   blocked. </pre>
