<title>Issue 29980 -   chromium -    Transparent bar showing in Expose - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  OS version               : OSX 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): No issue  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): No issue  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A    This isn't really a problem in that it's not affecting functionality  it's just a   bug I think.  I first noticed this when I went to my hot corner for Expose to   show all windows in all spaces  there is a transparent bar that is appearing.    The only way to see it is to hover the mouse over it then it shows up in   blue.  By clicking on the bar it doesn't go away.    Please see attached screen shot.    Regards    Adam </pre>
