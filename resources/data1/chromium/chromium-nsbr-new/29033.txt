<title>Issue 29033 -   chromium -    Race condition in UrlmonUrlRequest EndRequest and OnStopBinding leading to crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a race condition between the UrlmonUrlRequest::EndRequestInternal   task function and the UrlmonUrlRequest::OnStopBinding function which   basically drops the bindings  etc after calling EndRequest. Due to this race   condition the OnStopBinding function would basically end up operating on a   deleted object if the EndRequestInternal task executed first.   </pre>
