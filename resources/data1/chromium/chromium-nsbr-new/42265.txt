<title>Issue 42265 -   chromium -    Plugin processes (like Flash) should be automatically ended when no longer in use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9-dev      Firefox 3.6: FAIL    This bug report refers to any and all plugins  but from here out I'll use   Flash as my example.    When I have Chrome open with multiple windows  and I only have one of those   tabs on a page that uses the Flash plugin  after I close that tab the Flash   process should be killed. None of my other tabs are currently dependent on   the plugin  but it's still there using my memory and CPU cycles even   thought it's not currently necessary.    For my own personal use case  I currently do this manually through the   Chrome Task Manager pretty regularly as Chrome + Flash + Linux has a lot of   weird bugs currently  specifically toward memory leaks and locking up your   sound. But even if this were not the case  I think it would be more   efficient to handle this type of scenario for all plugins.    For example  if I have O3D installed and I go to a page that uses it  I'd   expect the plugin to be loaded automatically  and when I leave that page    or at very least close that particular tab I'd expect O3D's process to be   killed automatically too. As O3D is a pretty rare requirement for the vast   majority of websites  why would I want it to stay open just in case I go to   another site that wants it? There's no reason for it not to automatically   close just the same as it was opened.    Furthermore as Chrome and Chrome-OS grow I imagine there will be many more   plugins made available and in keeping with the rest of Chrome's multi-  process philosophy I wouldn't want them all running at once unless I needed   them to. </pre>
