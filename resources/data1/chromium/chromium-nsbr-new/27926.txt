<title>Issue 27926 -   chromium -    Build system change for Chromium update with crash reporting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="Daily Auto-Updating Google Chrome Build"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22158">issue 22158</a> for more background    The current buildbot system already has everything we need to get started.     - The chromium builds are archived at http://chrome-  web/buildbot/snapshots/ We will use chromium_rel_xp.    - The corresponding symbols for chromium_rel_xp symbols are uploaded to   crash server by reliability bot.     However  We need a way to publish daily known good revision. Current   mechanisms:      - The revision published at http://chrome-  web/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/LATEST is updated every time a new   chrome_rel_xp is built.       - The revision published at <a href="http://chromium-status.appspot.com/lkgr">http://chromium-status.appspot.com/lkgr</a> is   updated every time the unit tests passes on all 3 platforms.      - The revision for daily official build is selected at 3AM and a   notification is sent to chrome-releases@google.com. This one is closest to   what we need but there might not be a corresponding chrome_rel_xp build   with the same revision. We could consider finding the chromium_rel_xp build   with closest revision and publish the revision somewhere.   </pre>
