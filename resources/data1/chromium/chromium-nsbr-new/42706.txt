<title>Issue 42706 -   chromium -    Toolbar buttons don't depress when doing 3 finger navigation gestures - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Do a 3 finger back or forward navigation gesture on trackpad        Expected is to see the back or forward button briefly depress to confirm what action is being taken    like Safari.  Actual is no indication  which is confusing if you're new to touch gestures and trying to figure out   what gesture you're trying to do.     </pre>
