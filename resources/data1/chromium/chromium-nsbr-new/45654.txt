<title>Issue 45654 -   chromium -    Can't drag download shelf item to trash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download a file  the shelf opens  2. After download finishes  try dragging the button/icon to the trash  3. File does not go to trash  4. Try dragging the file to the Desktop (presuming your download location isn't there)  5. File is copied to Desktop      File goes to trash in step 3.      It could be argued since the behavior of dragging from the shelf is to copy a file  this shouldn't   happen (as it'd be a move). I do not agree with that argument  especially since it was decided   that &quot;Move to Trash&quot; did not belong in the downloads context menu. </pre>
