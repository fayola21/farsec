<title>Issue 29402 -   chromium -    Spell-checker doesn't recheck the text after the language is switched in context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25 (Official Build 33676)    I have three languages configured in my spell-checker:  - Czech  - English (US)  - English (UK)    When the default language is Czech  and I am entering English text  all   words get highlighted as misspelled  which is OK. But when I switching the   spell-checker to English via the context menu  the highlighting doesn't go   away - I have to click each word individually to make it go away. Switching   the setting &quot;Check the spelling on this field&quot; off and then on  also   doesn't help.   </pre>
