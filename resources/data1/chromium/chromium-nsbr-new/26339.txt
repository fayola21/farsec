<title>Issue 26339 -   chromium -    SyncerThread should use MessageLoops - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is becoming increasingly hard to add things to the SyncerThread loop   because it isn't implemented in a way that plays nicely with mostly   everything else in Chrome.  We can't PostTask  for example  so we have to   tinker around with condition variables and lock code to get things done.    It's really hard to test  and I'd bet there are subtle bugs lurking that we   have not discovered. Moving to MessageLoops will make it easier to test and   find and fix bugs (including ones that it may possibly temporarily   introduce). </pre>
