<title>Issue 37590 -   chromium -    Improper solution files generated by GYP for Visual C++ Express editions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GYP revision: 795      1. Define environment variable GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2008e  2. Run python.exe src/build/gyp_chromium  3. The chrome.sln in src/chrome/ cannot be opened because it is recognized   as a Visual Studio project (which is considered a higher version than VC++   Express)        The generated project file should open in Visual C++ Express.      &quot;chrome.vcproj&quot; cannot be opened because its project type (.vcproj) is not   supported by this version of application. To open it  please use a version   that supports this type of project.  (This message is displayed for each project in the solution)    Attached a patch that solves this issue.   </pre>
