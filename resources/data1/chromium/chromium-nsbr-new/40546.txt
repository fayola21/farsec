<title>Issue 40546 -   chromium -    add protections against Preferences corruption - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Preferences files are becoming unreadable or corrupted out in the field   (see <a title="Extensions disappear from hard disk  but still (partially) show up in UI" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31670"> bug 31670 </a> and <a title="Attempt heroic recovery of extensions in cases where Preferences file gets corrupted and thrown out."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32895">bug 32895</a> among others).  We now have some protection   against overwriting Preferences that have become temporarily unreadable for   some reason (see <a title="need more robust handling of Preferences errors" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38352"> bug 38352 </a>)  but if the files are permanently unreadable or   corrupt  we don't have a way to recover them.    Here are some ideas:  * Make a periodic backup of Preferences to protect against file   corruption.  * If corruption is detected  attempt to restore from backup  * If we're simply unable to read Preferences  stay in read-only mode  but   read from the backup file (then you'll at least have access to extensions    and your   old settings).    Once we get data from <a title="need more robust handling of Preferences errors" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38352"> bug 38352 </a>'s histograms  we can see how common the   various failure modes are and decide how to proceed. </pre>
