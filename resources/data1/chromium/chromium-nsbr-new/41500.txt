<title>Issue 41500 -   chromium -    Sync should handle error states gracefully instead of CHECK()ing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At various points in the sync code  there are CHECK()s used to verify that   the internal state is consistent.  This means that if something goes wrong    the browser crashes.  Instead  sync should shut down gracefully  and drop a   yellow bar indicating that it has crashed.    And example of these CHECK()s can be found in   chrome/browser/sync/engine/get_commit_ids_command.cc:102 </pre>
