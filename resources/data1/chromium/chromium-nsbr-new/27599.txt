<title>Issue 27599 -   chromium -    &quot;reopen the pages that were open last&quot; - fails after upgrade - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open few tabs  2. Set &quot;on startup&quot; = &quot;reopen the pages that were open last&quot;  3. Close chromium  4. Update chromium to new version (important)  5. Launch chromium again      - Chromium should reopen tabs  - it actually works but only with the same version of chromium  but i think   that saved session should be &quot;decrypted&quot; with newer versions also...      - All your tabs are lost...    <b>Please provide
