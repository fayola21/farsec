<title>Issue 45255 -   chromium -    Tab restore is unpredictable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch a new instance of chrome  2. note that the tab restore  option  ctrl-shift-t  is disabled  3. open a new tab  4. note that the tab restore option is enabled!      I don't expect opening a new tab to change the tab restore state. Also  when   I launch a new instance of chrome  the tab restore option should probably be   enabled  and selecting it will launch whatever tab I last closed during the   previous session.   </pre>
