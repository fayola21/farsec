<title>Issue 45363 -   chromium -    Disable risky OOM patching on systems where it was not tested to work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are extremely dangerous things we do in OOM patches (particularly  with CFAllocators) that rely on internal knowledge of system functionality  that is very prone to breakage on new and unreleased systems. We had a  suggestion that we shouldn't rely on undocumented internal knowledge for  systems we haven't tested on  and just run without that part of the OOM  killer functionality.    Pros:  - We run on future systems without crashing.  - We make the lives of Apple's engineers easier    Cons:  - We release a version of Chromium that is theoretically open to attack via  an OOM situation.    Of course  with autoupdating the con is mostly mitigated. I'm mostly for  this change  but then again I'm not the most paranoid. Is this something we  want to do? </pre>
