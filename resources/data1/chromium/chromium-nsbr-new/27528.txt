<title>Issue 27528 -   chromium -    insertAdjacentHTML doesn't work correctly after using back button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. add an input or textarea to the DOM using insertAdjacentHTML  2. navigate to another page  3. click the back button  4. add some different input or textarea to the DOM using insertAdjacentHTML      The second content would be added.      The previous content (before navigating away and using the back button) is entered instead.  There must be   some cache or variable that is not being initialized properly.  This seems to only affect input and textarea   elements.  It works correctly with span and divs and a few other tags that I tried  although I did not do an   exhaustive test.      Please us the attached html file to reproduce.  This is broken as far back as Chrome 3.     </pre>
