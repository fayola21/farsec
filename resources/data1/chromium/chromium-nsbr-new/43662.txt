<title>Issue 43662 -   chromium -    Deleting files after uploading to gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com    Using Windows XP Pro Sp3  when I upload a file to gmail via the drag and   drop method  try to delete the file after uploading it.  (The drag and drop   method does not work in my IE.)  While the file may appear deleted  if you   refresh the folder the file will re-appear and cannot be deleted saying   &quot;access denied  file is still in use&quot;.  If it does not re-appear  you can   also tell it is still there when you try to paste a file into the folder   with the same file name.  When you close gmail  the file will disappear for   good.  Is this only a problem I am having?    I originally thought it had something to do with delayed sending or offline   gmail  but disabling those  I still have the same problem... </pre>
