<title>Issue 31551 -   chromium -    Gmail not rendering properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	4.0.289.0 (Developer Build 35435)  URL : <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox">https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : gmail is displayed correctly  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: gmail is displayed correctly      1. Visit Gmail  2. Wait for page to load  3. Observe that the page has not rendered correctly    I've attached a screenshot of what I see.  This problem is intermittent  and   is sometimes accompanied by the loading page taking a long time.    Bizarrely  if I leave the page like this for a minute or two  Gmail renders   properly. </pre>
