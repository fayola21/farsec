<title>Issue 44555 -   chromium -    Chrome is really slow in most websites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.surf to most websites when you have a large amount of tabs open (probably   around 100)  2.chrome runs really slowly  100 tabs may sound like a lot  but chrome was   running at a very fast speed before this latest update with far more than   100 tabs (I think the most was like 300). It gets really really bad when I   right click something the whole browser can become unresponsive for a   while  and when I type in text it lags lots. (a delay from when I'm typing    and when the text shows up on screen)  3.The pages that load slowly may all have flash player objects in them  I   have also noticed flash player using a lot more memory than usual (even   when I only have around 6 youtube tabs open)          <b>Please provide
