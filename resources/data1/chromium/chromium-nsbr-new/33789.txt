<title>Issue 33789 -   chromium -    Add a toolbar locking option to remove the Browser Action double line resizer clutter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1    The added double line resizer for the Browser Action overflow solution   clutters the appearance of the toolbar.  Please  add an option (right clicking on any of the Browser Actions    including right clicking on the resizer itself can show it) to &quot;Lock the   toolbar&quot;.  It should always appear in the context menu and have a V next to it when it   is enabled. </pre>
