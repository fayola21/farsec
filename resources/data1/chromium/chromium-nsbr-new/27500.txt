<title>Issue 27500 -   chromium -    &quot;Delete all spam messages now&quot; in GMail does nothing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 4.0.237.0 (build 31086)  OS: WindowsXP SP3.      1. In GMail  open the Spam folder with message(s)  2. Click the &quot;Delete all spam messages now&quot; link at the top  3. Click &quot;OK&quot; in the confirmation dialog    What is the expected output?  All Spam messages removed.    What do you see instead?  Spam messages remain where they are in about 30% of cases.  Retries do not help (you have to explicitly select the messages and click  the &quot;Delete forever&quot; button). Once the spam messages are deleted  the next  time you open the Spam-labeled messages  the described deletion might or  might not work. However it never works until the messages are deleted  &quot;manually&quot;  as said above. </pre>
