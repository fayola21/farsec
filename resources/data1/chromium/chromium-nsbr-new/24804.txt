<title>Issue 24804 -   chromium -    2% (6ms) Mac startup time regression at r28963 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-</a>  10.5/startup/report.html?history=150    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?</a>  url=/trunk/src&amp;range=28962:28963&amp;mode=html    Big surprise  I moved stuff around and startup time suffered a little bit.    I have a change in mind that might get some of this back  and I was going to   implement it anyway. </pre>
