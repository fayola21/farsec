<title>Issue 39473 -   chromium -    View Source Makes a Duplicate Request - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (42199)                  1. Trying viewing a confirmation page only accessible after a form post  where the url does NOT change.  2. View Source  3. Because Chrome re-requests the page instead of just showing the source  for the already rendered page  you can't view the source of certain pages.    Example:    I have a registration page with a reg. form here:  <a href="http://myurl.com/registration/">http://myurl.com/registration/</a>     It's processed via PHP and PHP simply reloads  <a href="http://myurl.com/registration/">http://myurl.com/registration/</a> with a confirmation message upon successful  submit.    You will not be able to view the source of the confirmation page because  Chrome will re-load <a href="http://myurl.com/registration/">http://myurl.com/registration/</a> and you'll just the  source of the original reg. page.     </pre>
