<title>Issue 44583 -   chromium -    Improve the performance of event parsing on aebuild - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> simplejson.loads() is really slow on aebuild and takes up a significant   amount of time. I did some research and stumbled on   <a href="http://bouncybouncy.net/ramblings/posts/json_vs_thrift_and_protocol_buffers_r">http://bouncybouncy.net/ramblings/posts/json_vs_thrift_and_protocol_buffers_r</a>  ound_2/    The issue is that this test uses the accelerated C versions that are not   available on GAE. So the actual results may not be representative but that   gives an idea on how wildly different the results can be. The zlib idea   doesn't seem to be bad either if we starts to be data-bound. </pre>
