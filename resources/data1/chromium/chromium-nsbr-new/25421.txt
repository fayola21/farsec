<title>Issue 25421 -   chromium -    Support /etc/services lookup for hosted desktop &quot;applications&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to have Chromium resolve services names (e.g.   someservice://someresource ) using the OS facility (i.e. nsswitch with   /etc/services).    Use Case:      let's say I would like to access an application hosted on the desktop   through http/tcp:PORT (where PORT is dynamically assigned)  I could enter on   the address bar &quot;myapp://someresource&quot; and Chromium would resolve the   service &quot;app&quot; to &quot;tcp:PORT&quot;.  From this point  Chromium would proceed   normally with HTTP for interacting with the service.     </pre>
