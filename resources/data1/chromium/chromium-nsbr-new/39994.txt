With Orange Business EveryWhere connection kit  go to advanced settings   to select Google Chrome as prefered browser      Google Chrome should be present in the dropdown list of available browsers   so that it can be launched when clicking on the web button of the   connection kit.      Google Chrome is not present in the list.  What happened is that the entry chrome.exe is not present in the    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionApp Paths   registry key.  Other browsers have their entry here.  If Google Chrome is defined as Windows' default browser  then the entry   chrome.exe is present and Google Chrome can be selected as prefered browser   in Orange Business EveryWhere connection kit.    See joined screenshots.    (issue posted by Orange Labs developpement team of Business EveryWhere) </pre>
