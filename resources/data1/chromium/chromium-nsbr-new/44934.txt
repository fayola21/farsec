<title>Issue 44934 -   chromium -    [UI Improve]Integrate a small search box into the right menu   replace the &quot;search google for something&quot; item. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796) beta    Chrome/Chromium has an item named &quot;search google for something&quot; in the right menu   it's conveniently for   searching words from any web page . Howerver   few people know about this feature .Most of my friends never   noticed this item until I tell to them  although this maybe sounds unbelievable .Instead   they usually    select on some words   then open the right menu and copy   then open a new tab  then paste    finally click the goto   button.They never noticed the item of &quot;Paste and search&quot; any more then the item of &quot;Search Google for something&quot;.  In my opinion  the &quot;search google for something&quot; item should be replaced by a small search box with a search   button   since a search box is more direct viewing than a sentence tell you to search something. It is just a small   change   but maybe change a lot.    Regards.   :) </pre>
