<title>Issue 27873 -   chromium -    Mini-application open by itself with no browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.3.22.2 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=242">r242</a>)  Chrome: 4.0.245.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31763">r31763</a>)        1. Have a browser window open.  2. Open applications menu by clicking on icon at far-left of title bar.  3. Open a mini-application  such as Notepad  Contacts  To-do list  or  Calculator.  4. Close tabs in the browser window until the browser window closes.     What is the expected output?    A new browser window should open.    What do you see instead?    The mini-application window is present by itself  with no browser window  open.  (If you close the mini-application  a browser window then opens.)   </pre>
