<title>Issue 30028 -   chromium -    dialog &quot;Report Bug or Broken Website&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 0.2 to 4.0.x    Two problems with the drop-down menu for Report Type:  1. First choice is pre-selected. Add an empty or &quot;Please choose&quot; at the top.     (There's a related bug/feature about adding more options in this list.)  2. It looks grayed out = disabled/do not touch.     (Gray color seen in 4.0.x on Vista/win32. Perhaps 0.2 was white.)    Perhaps you get lots of bug reports that are incorrectly marked &quot;Page won't   load&quot;. </pre>
