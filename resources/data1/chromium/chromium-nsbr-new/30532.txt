<title>Issue 30532 -   chromium -    XHR from extension leaks LoginDialogs if the request requires authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install the Google Mail Checker extension.  2. Ensured you're signed out of gmail.  3. Each XHR it makes will require authentication. In login_prompt.cc  we try   to find the TabContents associated with the XHR  but there is none. In that   case  we do nothing  and just let the request get cancelled. The LoginDialog   is never cleaned up. </pre>
