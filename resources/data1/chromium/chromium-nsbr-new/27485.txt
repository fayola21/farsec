<title>Issue 27485 -   chromium -    Browser actions update their icon too frequently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Might apply to page actions too.    Every time the user switches tabs  navigates  or changes some state  we   update the browser actions and reload their icons. We should only update the   icons if something about them changed. </pre>
