<title>Issue 41300 -   chromium -    Clear Renderbuffers (and framebuffers) so client program can not read previous contents. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I need to track all the renderbuffers and if they have ever been cleared. (this is done)    Each time glFramebufferRenderbuffer or glFramebufferTexture2D is called  I need to go through all the renderbuffers currently bound to the current Framebuffer (either query   or track them)  If one of those renderbuffers has never been cleared then    I need to call glCheckFramebufferStatus.    If I get GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE then I need to       Set glScissor  glColorMask  etc.       glClear       Reset glScissor  glColorMask  etc.       mark the renderbuffers as cleared. </pre>
