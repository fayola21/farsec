<title>Issue 25528 -   chromium -    Reimplement app shortcuts natively (not using gears) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to implement app shortcuts natively... not using gears.    It will be easier for us to maintain this code moving forward if it is   integrated with Chrome. There are many bugs now we have a lot of difficulty   fixing.    We need to implement:    - a dialog box similar to the current gears-based one  - an icon store (we can re-use the one created by gears) for the shortcut   icons  - windows 7 pinning support. </pre>
