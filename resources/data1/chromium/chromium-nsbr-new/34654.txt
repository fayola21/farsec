<title>Issue 34654 -   chromium -    problem in windows home chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When opening my browser after you start the pc  I came across the homepage of   google chrome with the windows above the others.    I know that before shutting down the pc  was using the chrome so the windows   7 could use two windows while the chrome. That feature drag a window to a   corner of the monitor and adjust it automatically.    just to be aware of.    By the way my keyboard has a button &quot;in&quot; and printscreen does not work  I had   to take the functionality of on-screen keyboard  as you can see in the image. </pre>
