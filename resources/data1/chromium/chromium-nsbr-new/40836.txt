<title>Issue 40836 -   chromium -    Task manager &quot;End process&quot; button should be disabled when no process is selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium OS	0.6.39.0 (Developer Build 3c3739ae - Thu Apr 8 05:22:30 PDT   2010 - )  Chromium	5.0.372.0 (Developer Build 43941)      1. Login to Chrome OS  2. Press Shift+ESC to open Task Manager      Since none of the processes is selected  thus 'End Process' button should   be grayed out.    Actual : 'End Process' button is enabled even if none of the processes is   selected. Clicking on it does nothing.    # Older issue : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18582">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18582</a>  # Issue seen on Linux-chrome also. </pre>
