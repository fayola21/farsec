<title>Issue 35053 -   chromium -    Security: full-screen video problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In chrome I can't click with the mouse when I watch a video on full screen on   a few web pages which has own embedded video player. For example xvideos.com  It plays the video  and it doesn't crash  but I can do nothing with the   mouse. Right click works neither.    Viktor </pre>
