<title>Issue 45810 -   chromium -    Tab title continues to say Loading after page has completed loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab via middle-click on a bookmark.      The tab will load the appropriate page  and the title of the tab will be   the title of the web page.      The title will be displayed as &quot;Loading...&quot; and remain that way  even after   the tab has finished loading the web page. Clicking on the tab does not   cause the title to be displayed correctly. This only happens intermittently   and I am unable to reliably reproduce the issue  but it has happened in two   dev versions numerous times.    <b>Please provide
