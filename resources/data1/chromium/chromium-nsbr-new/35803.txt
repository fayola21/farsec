<title>Issue 35803 -   chromium -    No option to temporarily allow plugins for a site. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev  URLs (if applicable) : Any that have a plugin    If you set Wrench-&gt;Under the Hood-&gt;Content Settings-&gt;Plugins to disallow   all plugins it does that.  However  there is no option to allow plugins for   a temporary amount of time (next reload of tab w/ same domain  5 minutes    ect..).      Having the option to allow a plugin for one visit would be nice  as it's   tedious to allow it and then manually disallow it when you're done.    (P.S. I searched a little for this type of bug  but I didn't see anything    if this is a repeat then it's my bad.)   </pre>
