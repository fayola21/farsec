<title>Issue 24182 -   chromium -    Slow WebKit tests that pass - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a general container bug for bugs that take a long time to run  but   pass. We list them in test_expectations so that we can give those tests   more time to run and reduce the timeout for other tests to something   reasonable. The latter part greatly improves our cycle time.    It's valid to mark any test that takes &gt;1 second as slow  but we'll probably   only reduce the timeout to 5 seconds. There's not much benefit in going   shorter than that and it would be a maintenance headache needing to mark   all those tests as slow.    It is currently *not* valid to mark a test as both slow and timeout.    The task to do here is to go through all the slow bugs and see about   making them faster. In some cases (e.g. acid3) the test is probably just   inherently slow because it's doing a lot  in others there's just stupid timers   and race conditions. </pre>
