<title>Issue 25369 -   chromium -    Extension loading bubble does not disappear on error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.223.8  (29563)    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Download and install the attached extension. (manifest_error.crx)    Expected:  We get a Extension Install Error dialog and a &quot;Loading...&quot;  growl   notification. The notification should disappear as soon as we close the   dialog.    Actual:  We get the dialog and the notification but the notification lingers even after   we have closed the Error dialog.  We have to restart Chrome to lose the notification.      I had the same problem when I got an error while installing a theme.   </pre>
