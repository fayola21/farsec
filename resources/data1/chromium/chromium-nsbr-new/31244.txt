<title>Issue 31244 -   chromium -    state left on disk by failing tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug is more for a discussion then a specific issue.    Some of the Mac bots are showing slowdowns with time. Look at them  there is a bunch of data getting left on disk  that   seems like it is what causes the problem (someone scans the directory  and each run leaves more in that directory).    Most of the chrome unittests are correctly cleaning up the files they create when they finish  and we're fixing a few that don't    but that will never be a complete solution...    The problem continues if a test hits a CHECK/NOTIMPL/cores/etc.  ie-there is no shutdown code that can run to clean things   up.  In these cases we still end up leaving things around after the fact.    This doesn't have to be related to things on disk either  it could be resources shared between processes that doesn't get auto   cleaned when a process exits.    So the question is  is there some way we can better deal with this so waterfall and try bots doesn't collect this cruft over time   that results in more errors/problems? </pre>
