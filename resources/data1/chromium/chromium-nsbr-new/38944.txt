<title>Issue 38944 -   chromium -    Weird little window detritus from aero peek - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Have a bunch of tabs open.  2. Make all other windows disappear by shaking any window on your desktop.  3. Note that there are now visible little windows at the bottom left of your   display... these appear to be for each tab and are to do with aero peek. When   I click on one the Chrome window becomes visible and I switch to thet ab   corresponding to that window.    There is no way to close these windows other than by exiting Chrome  so this   bug is pretty bad. </pre>
