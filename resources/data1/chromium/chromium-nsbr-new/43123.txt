<title>Issue 43123 -   chromium -    Hung won��_��_��_t render (and other HBO website problems) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://www.hbo.com/hung">http://www.hbo.com/hung</a>    or really anything under <a href="http://www.hbo.com/">http://www.hbo.com/</a>    It offers a way out  but I hate seeing that MY browser isn��_��_��_t supported.    Also  I couldn��_��_��_t resist the opportunity to file a bug named ��_��_��_hung won��_��_��_t render��_��_��_ and have it not be   about a hung renderer. </pre>
