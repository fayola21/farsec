<title>Issue 30829 -   chromium -    Opening new tab from extension icon context menu causes tabstrip to lose focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium 4.0.274.0 (Developer Build 34824)  OS: Win XP      --------------------------------------  1. Right-click on extension icon (could be browser action or page action)   to bring up context menu.  2. Select menu item that will open a new tab:     * Options (if enabled)     * Manage extensions...      * &lt;extension-name&gt;    What is the expected output?   ----------------------------  Should be able to click once on 'x' to close tab.  Right-click on any tab should pop up correct context menu.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  Must click twice on 'x' to close tab (once to give focus to tabstrip  and   again to close tab).  If it was a page action  right-click on tab pops up context menu for   Omnibox.  (After all  the last click was in the Omnibox  where the page   action icons are located.)   </pre>
