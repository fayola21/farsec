<title>Issue 24671 -   chromium -    It should be legal to include zero icons in a browser action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we require at least one icon be registered  as we use this to   determine whether to show the browser action at all. This makes using canvas-  backed browser actions a little more painful because you have to provide a   starting icon.    However  once <a title="Remove menu integration from browser actions" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24379"> bug 24379 </a> is fixed  we should be able to remove this. </pre>
