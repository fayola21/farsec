<title>Issue 39847 -   chromium -    a large gap is present between the source lange drop-down and the following punctuation  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Run Chrome in French (on Windows  '--lang=fr' in the command line. On Windows    'LANGUAGES=fr chrome'. On Mac  put French at the top of the language list)    2. Go to a Japanese page (say  ja.wikipedia.org)    3. The translation infobar shows up    Cette page est en &lt;src language dropdown list&gt; . Voulez-vous la traduire ?    4. There's a rather large gap between the src lang drop-down and '.'.     English original does not have a period after the place holder:    This page is in&lt;ph name=&quot;original_language&quot;&gt;$1&lt;ex&gt;French&lt;/ex&gt;&lt;/ph&gt;Would you like to   translate it?    French and some languages have     Cette page est en &lt;src lang&gt;. Voulez-vous la traduire ?    Note that there is no space before '.'.     However  as shown in the screenshot  there's a gap between the drop-down menu. I guess a   UI widget we use has rather large padding.     It's reported internally at http://b/248769     </pre>
