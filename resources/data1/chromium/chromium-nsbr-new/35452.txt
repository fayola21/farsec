<title>Issue 35452 -   chromium -    Detect loss of internet connectivity &amp; suggest actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071) unknown    It would be nice if Chrome noticed when DNS resolutions and/or TCP   connections were failing  and ran some kind of diagnostic either internally    or call an extension to do likewise.    This could perform some basic connectivity tests  and report to the user that   their internet connection has gone down  rather than just saying that the   site cannot be reached as it might be down etc (when its actually the user's   connection that is down). A more advanced mode could check if the device has   no network connection and suggest fixing that  or if the default gateway   isn't responding and is a home router (detected via UPnP) suggest rebooting   it or loading up its admin interface. </pre>
