<title>Issue 29960 -   chromium -    Chrome Issue with Expose (different than 29860 &amp; 29054) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  2. Launch expose with any number of tabs open  3. You'll see that how Expose displays the windows is not correct.    Examples:  When two non Google Chrome applications are open  in Expose  it is   displayed as one on the top and one on the bottom. When Chrome is open    (and only a total of two applications open) it shows one window to the   right  another in the middle  and the left is a large blank area.  The same thing happens with three applications. When Chrome is open    the windows are top left  top right  and bottom right  leaving a large blank   area at the bottom left.  When Chrome is closed  it's two at the top and one in the middle at the   bottom.    The main problem is that with Chrome leaving so much of a blank area   where another application can be open  the windows are much smaller and   making the use of Expose much worse. This is an easily reproducible error.   I can send screenshots when ready.  Note: for the applications that are open  you can use any program. The   results for those programs will be the same  but with Chrome open  the   display of the programs in Expose is completely incorrect.      See above.      See above.    <b>Please provide
