<title>Issue 31828 -   chromium -    emacs accelerator keys in web pages sometimes intercepted by browser UI. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit (AMD X2 3800+  possibly old/slow)  window manager : no idea      1. Bring up a gmail compose window.  Dump in some text.  2. Hold down C-b to backspace through the text.        Zoom through the text.        Initially  zoom through the text.  Rather quickly I get a combination of   zooming through the text  plus the bookmark bar appearing and disappearing.    There are a bunch of other cases.  C-f (forward  until a find box comes up)    C-d (delete-forward  until you get the bookmark bubble)  you get the idea.    I don't get it with this text box  perhaps because it implements the   accelerators using native code rather than JavaScript. </pre>
