<title>Issue 37564 -   chromium -    New search engine selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We'd like to do a controlled experiment on search engine selection at first   run. Instead of the UI we have today  we'd like to try making the selection   part of the first run.    Mocks: http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/84_search/5/#01_step1.png   http://mocks/glen/chrome/spec/84_search/5/#02_step2_import.png (sorry    internal only; note that the text in the mockup is not final).    Gwilson and I can help pull together large logos when the time comes.    *This should be controlled by installerdata.  *When we show this experimental search engine selection UI  we should show   a small omnibox bubble without the search engine selection.  *It's okay to experiment in English only for the sake of moving quickly  *We also need to add UMA stats for search engine selection. I'll request   that in a separate bug.     </pre>
