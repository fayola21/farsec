<title>Issue 28133 -   chromium -    Chromium man page documentation is incomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. man chromium-browser      A reasonably complete list of switches  particularly those involved in   determining the number of processes (1  1 per tab  1 per site  etc.) should   be provided so that users can tailor chrome startups to the amount of   memory  processor speed  and browser usage.  In particular it is not   unusual for me to open 50+ windows and 500+ tabs.  So the default model   could easily exceed the common per user process limit under Linux.  I would   probably want to run using a 1 process per site instance of chrome for   normal use.  The most significant resource affecting switches should be   documented.    It also isn't clear whether one can specify multiple URLs (extracted from   other browser session/history files) when invoking chrome so chrome can   &quot;recreate&quot; foreign browser states.  This is useful for testing complex   sessions known to be problematic in other browsers.      A very brief list of 6 command line switches is given.  However browsing   around the web seems to indicate there may be 80 or more switches that do   something.    <b>Please provide
