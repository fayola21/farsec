<title>Issue 35487 -   chromium -    Multiple lines support for the Javascript Console in the Web Inspector. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78    I suggest you add multi-line editing in the Web Inspector's JavaScript   console  like in Firebug. Maybe you could toggle between single-line and   multi-line modes by clicking the chevron (&gt;) to the left of the prompt. When   in multi-line mode the chevron could be pointing downward.    This feature would be very useful as a developer to be able to hack around   with JavaScript. I already use this feature a lot in Firebug. </pre>
