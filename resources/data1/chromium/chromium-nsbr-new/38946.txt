<title>Issue 38946 -   chromium -    Dragging a link to a different Chrome window should focus that window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I frequently get bit by this:    * Drag link from Gmail tab in window A to tabstrip in window B.  * Window B opens a new tab.  * I now hit ctrl-f or some other shortcut  and it acts on window A.    It seems to me that either window B or the newly created tab inside it should   have focus once I do the drop. </pre>
