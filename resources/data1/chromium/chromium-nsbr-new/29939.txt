<title>Issue 29939 -   chromium -    Very high CPU usage when viewing plugin content (Flash  QuickTime  etc.) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : Any Youtube video           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. View a video on Youtube in Chrome.  2. View the same video in Safari or Firefox.  3. Note the differences in CPU utilization.    Expected and actual results:  Other browsers use around 80% total CPU (out of 200%) for Flash. Chrome uses   135%.    Safari seems to get (on a particular video on my hardware) around 86% (of 1 core)   CPU usage.  Chrome will use 85% or so in one helper  30% or so in another  and   20% in the parent (I'm assuming Flash plugin &gt; Page renderer &gt; chrome parent).    Is this a byproduct of chrome process architecture  or can we get the CPU usage   down to a more reasonable level.  Note that on my iMac (and Linux boxes)  HD   video isn't possible under Chrome (too laggy)  but is under Safari or Firefox.    This spans across at least Linux and Mac (and from what I've Googled  Windows as   well). </pre>
