<title>Issue 37723 -   chromium -    does VerifyUpdatesCommand need to be a ModelChanging variant? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> syncapi VisiblePositionsDiffer can't detect ID changes right now as a result   of AttemptReuniteLostCommitResponse (which sets next/prev ids to server   known IDs from client-only ones).  If we can't actually move an item as a   result of this  VisiblePositionsDiffer probably should take this case into   account so that we don't call into BookmarkModel::Move.      I'm not positive though if AttemptReunite[...] can actually move an item...   seems possible since this is the updates path?  But then it's strange that   we fix this up during Verify and not Apply.      For now  I'm going to try making VerifyUpdates a ModelChanging variant to   obey threading constraints. </pre>
