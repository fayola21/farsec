<title>Issue 38627 -   chromium -    Feature: On chrome://extensions/  extension icon should link to its extension gallery page  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/        1. Go to chrome://extensions/  2. Notice there's no link to its extension gallery page.      Clicking on a logo/icon should take me to its &quot;homepage&quot;.      Nothing.    (Workaround: You currently need to activate developer-mode  copy its hash    then find the gallery  click any extension  then edit that URL.) </pre>
