<title>Issue 24223 -   chromium -    layout test results output should use IMAGE and TEXT rather than FAIL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The output on the build bots for layout tests includes a summary of things   that failed.  I think a lot of people just copy-paste from there when they   are sheriff into test-expectations.  That output still just uses FAIL rather   than IMAGE or TEXT  so we just keep adding new references to the deprecated   FAIL. </pre>
