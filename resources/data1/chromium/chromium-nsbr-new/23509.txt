<title>Issue 23509 -   chromium -    reduce pasteboard redundancy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/249048">http://codereview.chromium.org/249048</a> has placement of a URL on the Mac pasteboard using   third_party/mozilla/include/NSPasteboard+Utils.h.  This does things in a friendly way (e.g. places   URL and &quot;plain text&quot; on clipboard together).    base also has something like this; Clipboard::WriteBookmark() in base/clipboard.h.  Perhaps that   one should use the mozilla code?  Is it OK to have base depend on third_party libs like this?    Not a Beta blocker but definitely a cleanup issue. </pre>
