<title>Issue 44471 -   chromium -    Windows build should fail on unsigned mismatch warnings the same way as linux and mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I run into problems where I compile successfully on Windows  but failed on   Linux and Mac trybots because of the following error:    warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions    After digging  I discovered this is because Microsoft's warnings are messed   up.  Included at Warning Level 3 (which we use) is warning 4018.  4018 will   warn if you do a signed/unsigned greater-than/less-than comparison  but it   will not complain about equality comparisons.  To get Microsoft to warn   about equality comparisons between unsigned/signed mismatches  you need to   use warning #4389  which is only turned on as part of warning level 4.    To fix this  we can manually enable warning 4389 to our build system with:     /we4389    Here are the MSDN docs for 4389:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bx7x617k.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bx7x617k.aspx</a>    Here are the MSDN docs for 4018:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y92ktdf2.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y92ktdf2.aspx</a>   </pre>
