<title>Issue 24521 -   chromium -    DevTools: Consider implementing Activity-alike rendering of the resources list in the resources panel. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-  US) AppleWebKit/532.2 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.221.8 Safari/532.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Exists feature    May be it little bit geeky but I found this feature very useful when developing   some web projects. In Safari exists feature to show all opened urls and active   connections located under Window menu (possible exists only if activate   developers features). So I voting to add such functionality to Chrome </pre>
