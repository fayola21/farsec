<title>Issue 40528 -   chromium -    view-source:http://.../someimage.png shows binary data - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.5 (Official Build 42969) dev  URLs (if applicable) : view-  source:<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif">http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif</a>    View source (and its shortcut) is disabled on images. Yet  the user can   still load a view-source: url manually. Is this intended? I feel it's quite   counter-intuitive and in every possible case useless.    </pre>
