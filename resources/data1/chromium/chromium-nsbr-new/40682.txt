<title>Issue 40682 -   chromium -    5.0.366.0 dev: omnibox behavior broken when making a new window and starting to type the location while the window is still being created - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.0 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): not broken  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): not broken  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not broken      1. Visit news.com  2. Close the window  3. Cmd-N and while the window is being created - as in  while the New Tabs are being drawn -   press 'n'.      Omnibox shows news.com with 'ews.com' grayed out and 'n' drawn in black since it matches the   'n' already typed.        Omnibox shows &quot;news.com/n&quot; as if the 'n' event was seen and acted upon for autocomplete but   then replayed again and appended to the autocompleted location </pre>
