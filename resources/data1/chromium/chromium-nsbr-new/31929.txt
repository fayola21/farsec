<title>Issue 31929 -   chromium -    Chrome slows up my computer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1     When I open Google chrome  It is really slow. It runs over 100 MB RAM and   50% CPU. Then my computer is really slow and the mouse skips acreoos the   screen even when I close Chrome. If I do not open Chrome  my computer runs   fine. This started after the latest Developer release. I never had this   problem until the new update came out. Even with all extensions disabled    It is still slow and using up most of my resources. Also  it has problems   loading flash and playing videos (video and sound are skipping.) </pre>
