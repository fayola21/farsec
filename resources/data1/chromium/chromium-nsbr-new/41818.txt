<title>Issue 41818 -   chromium -    New tab's show up in just one tab when Clear browsing data window is in front. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.9 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44625">r44625</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.6    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Have just one window with one tab open.  2. Open Clear browsing data dialog.  3. Now try opening a new tab page  history and Downloads page using keyboard shortcut while   the dialog is open.    Actual:  All the pages that we open when the clear browsing data dialog is in front are opened in the   same tab. But when we close the dialog we can see them all opened in separate tabs.    Is this the desired behavior?     </pre>
