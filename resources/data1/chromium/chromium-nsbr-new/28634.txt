<title>Issue 28634 -   chromium -    Don't save inspector height preferences that are too small - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User got in a situation where they thought the inspector didn't work    because when they hit ctl-shift-J it was only 10px tall.    Maybe they'd resized it small before?  In any case  we should always ensure   that when the inspector first shows it has at least 40px or so. </pre>
