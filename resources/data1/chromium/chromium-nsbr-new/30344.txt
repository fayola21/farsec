<title>Issue 30344 -   chromium -    Options dialog too big for small screens - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chromium on a small netbook running window (e.g. resolution   1024x600).  2. Open the options dialog.    The Ok / Cancel buttons are off screen and not reachable (see attached   screenshot)  meaning that unless the user knows that Enter=Apply &amp;   Esc=Cancel  she can't use the dialog.    I encountered this while installing Chromium on a new Eee PC with Windows   7. When it started for the first time  it asked whether I want to have Bing as   my default search. I clicked &quot;No&quot; which opened the options dialog. I believe   many users follow this exact path. </pre>
