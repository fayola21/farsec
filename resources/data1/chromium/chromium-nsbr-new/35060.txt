<title>Issue 35060 -   chromium -    browser_sync::HttpResponse::SYNC_AUTH_ERROR should NOT be used for app-specific auth errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are currently using SYNC_AUTH_ERROR to pause the SyncerThread in the event   that a ClientToServerResponse::AUTH_INVALID response is parsed.  This is a   gross layering violation.  The HttpResponse enum should only be concerned   with HTTP response codes and not app-specific ones! Perhaps older code used   to expect HTTP 401 instead of a specific error inside the protobuf  but this   is not the case now.    We should use the AuthWatcher's SERVICE_AUTH_FAILED instead  which may   require hooking the SyncerThread up to the AuthWatcher.  For now  we need a   hotfix to get pushed to stable so we're going with minimal code changes and   piggybacking on the already miscreant use of SYNC_AUTH_ERROR. </pre>
