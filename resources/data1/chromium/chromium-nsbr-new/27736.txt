<title>Issue 27736 -   chromium -    App Verifier reports in firefox importer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running   unit_tests!ImporterTest::Firefox3xImporterTest  or  unit_tests!FirefoxImporterTest_Firefox3NSS3Decryptor_Test  under App Verifier finds several problems  particularly  &quot;Unloading DLL containing an active critical section.&quot;  and   &quot;Unloading DLL that allocated TLS index that was not freed.&quot;  See attached log.

(presumably we'd need to build firefox from source to figure  this out).     </pre>
