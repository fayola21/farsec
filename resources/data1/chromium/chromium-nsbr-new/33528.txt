<title>Issue 33528 -   chromium -    Add &quot;stable&quot;  &quot;beta&quot;  &quot;trunk&quot;  &quot;dev&quot; indicators to Chrome extension documentation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are no obvious visual indicators to show whether you're browsing the   stable/beta/dev/trunk versions of the documentation for extensions.  We   should render a notification box at the top of the page showing which   version you're browsing  and with links to other versions of the same   documentation page.     </pre>
