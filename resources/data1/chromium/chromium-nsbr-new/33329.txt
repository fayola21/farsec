<title>Issue 33329 -   chromium -    Implement an accelerated video layer for Intel in the GPU process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This layer would take a YUV encoded video frame from the renderer and  and   use the GPU to convert to RGB and scale the video appropriately.    This represents my portion of the work with brettw@  although we may want to   just have one larger bug to track everything. </pre>
