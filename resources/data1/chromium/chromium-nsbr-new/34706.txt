<title>Issue 34706 -   chromium -    Browsing for a file to upload causes &quot;segmentation fault&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I tried going to a site e.g. tineye.com or any sites. Tineye was just   the most recent one I tried to upload a file.      To browse normally e.g. double click folder  double click another folder    click on the file to upload  etc.      Terminal displays &quot;segmentation fault&quot;. I had to just put the whole path   instead of browsing for the file.    <b>Please provide
