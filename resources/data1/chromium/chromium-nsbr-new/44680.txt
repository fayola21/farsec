<title>Issue 44680 -   chromium -     error 0x000000a5 trying to open a link from a conversation in msn messenger wave 3 on win7 running msn in windows xp sp3 compatibility mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : any (e.g. 6.0.411.0 (47762))      1 run msn messenger under xp sp3 compatibility mode. make sure msn is not   pinned on the taskbar.   2 close every chrome istance (this is essential): you need to have all page   closed to repro this issue.  3 open msn and copy-paste a link in a conversation.  4 click on the link in the conversation (posted by you or by your contact    is the same)  5 error  0x000000a5 will show up instead of the link page  you have to shut   down msn to make it go away    NOTE: if chrome is already open when you click on the link nothing bad   happens.    msn compatibility mode is sometimes used by user that doesn't want the msn   icon in the taskbar. running msn in vista compatibility mode fix the issue.   but most user doesn't know.. maybe is worth investigate..  </pre>
