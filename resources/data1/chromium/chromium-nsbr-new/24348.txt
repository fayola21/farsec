<title>Issue 24348 -   chromium -    Tooltip rendering performance is very poor / janky when the tooltip contains a lot of word-wrapped text (on Windows 7 / Vista) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load the attached HTML file (Tooltip Demo.htm) in Chrome  2. Mouseover the item &quot;Long Tooltip 0.9&quot;  Platform: Windows Vista      The tooltip renders very slowly and jankily. Sometimes the shadow or   outline will be drawn  and then half a second later the text will be drawn.   It should either pop up all at once or fade in smoothly.    The problem appears to only occur when the tooltip text is word-wrapped a   lot. If you mouseover the item &quot;Lots of Text  but no word wrapping required   because of line breaks&quot; in the attached file  the tooltip renders fine.    NOTE: You may see some of the tooltips on that page flashing like crazy.   This is a separate bug that I've already fixed:  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4754">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4754</a>  If they do flash  you can compare the speed of the flashing on various   tooltips on that page. Ones that flash slowly are not rendering fast   enough. </pre>
