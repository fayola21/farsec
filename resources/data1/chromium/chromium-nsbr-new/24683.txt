<title>Issue 24683 -   chromium -    Strange hang possibly related to http authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5 (28764)  URLs (if applicable) : localhost:9091 (Transmission Web Interface)  Sample: <a href="https://gist.github.com/b39771ee0b924c5250e5">https://gist.github.com/b39771ee0b924c5250e5</a>    When I access the transmission web interface sometimes I'll get a hang   that is not fixable by just restarting. Im not sure what eventually makes it   work again. The interface does require http authentication but I have no   clue if this hang is related to it or not. I seem to get the hang even after   deleting my saved passwords for the site.    Strangely I can get the site to work if I access it in Incognito mode. The   password prompt comes up and once i enter the credentials  the site works   just fine  but it continues to hang if I go there in normal mode again.   </pre>
