<title>Issue 24461 -   chromium -    Catch uncaught exceptions and set breakpad info. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Posting to generate buy-in.]    Crashers like this:  http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=cd66231f4d342b1e    happen when an exception is raised before we've entered the event loop.  The stack backtraces are   generally mostly useless because they're all Cocoa code (naturally - we don't raise exceptions   ourselves).    I propose to register the uncaught exception handler and push at least the exception name to   breakpad before the crash to assist with debugging. </pre>
