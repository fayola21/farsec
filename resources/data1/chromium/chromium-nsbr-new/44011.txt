<title>Issue 44011 -   chromium -    Enabling WIFI on OS X does not lead to correct geolocation information unless the browser is restarted. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.396.0 dev  OS version: Snow Leopard    On Mac OS X  Chrome provides invalid data if WIFI was turned off during the first attempt to get   the location - as might be expected; however  even if I enable WIFI Chrome fails to provide the   correct location. I need to restart the browser to get the correct location. </pre>
