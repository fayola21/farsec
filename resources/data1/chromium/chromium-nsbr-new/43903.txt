<title>Issue 43903 -   chromium -    Links which open in a new window should not show &quot;about:blank&quot; during load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1.  Open any url with links which open in a new window (e.g. <a href="http://build.webkit.org/console">http://build.webkit.org/console</a>)  2. Click on a link which opens in a new window (like any of the top row of boxes on that page    boxes directly below &quot;core&quot; &quot;noncore&quot;)        The new window should open  showing the URL its loading in the address bar.        A new window opens showing &quot;about:blank&quot; for several seconds while Chrome figures out how to   talk to build.webkit.org.    I should also note that Safari/Firefox load these links *much* faster than Chrome do.    This is certainly related to <a title="Chrome Mac is very slow to change address bar when clicking link" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43267"> issue 43267 </a>  however I view this as a separate case where there is no   security argument to be made about not showing the URL as early as possible. </pre>
