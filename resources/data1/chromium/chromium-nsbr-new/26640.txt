<title>Issue 26640 -   chromium -    Multiple history entries for the same blog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.229.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30554">r30554</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open this link in Chrome - <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/gallery/lexus-lf-a-0/#2">http://www.autoblog.com/gallery/lexus-lf-a-0/#2</a>.  2. View all the photos in the blog. (Use next photo button)  3. Check Chrome history. (cmd + y)    Expected:  Chrome should have one entry for the blog like in Safari.    Actual:  Chrome has one entry per photo you have viewed in the blog.  This is true even on Chrome windows and Linux.  We don't see this in Safari.    Note:  The last number in the URL changes for every photo we view  but still Safari does not show them   as individual pages.   </pre>
