<title>Issue 35930 -   chromium -    Crash any tab with javascript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you type in directly in the browser address bar &quot; javascript:while(1); &quot;    the tab will crash and be stuck. The browser doesn't seem aware of this.     The cross site scripting danger is minimal  but there's still a slim chance   someone could crash users of Chrome with a link that leads to something like   javascript:while(1);    Thank you </pre>
