<title>Issue 41661 -   chromium -    Chrome using 100% of CPU while idle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6 dev  OS version               : 10.6.3    I noticed one of the CPUs on my MBP was pegged  and Activity Monitor showed the Chrome browser process   using 99% CPU. No Chrome windows were open. Sampling showed Thread_3470 apparently in an infinite loop   involving select  gettimeofday and other calls:      2195 Thread_3470        2195 thread_start          2195 _pthread_start            2195 ChromeMain              2195 ChromeMain                2195 ChromeMain                  2192 ChromeMain                    1965 ChromeMain                      1418 select$DARWIN_EXTSN                      217 gettimeofday                        168 __gettimeofday                          103 __nanotime                          65 __gettimeofday                        48 gettimeofday                        1 __commpage_gettimeofday                      130 ChromeMain                     .....
