<title>Issue 34089 -   chromium -    Fix &quot;make reconfig&quot; on the buildbot master. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our current buildbot scripts are too complex to work fine with make reconfig.    After fixing <a title="Move the log parser code outside buildbot"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34085">bug 34085</a> and <a title="Move the factory code outside buidlbot"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34086">bug 34086</a>  it should become easier to simplify the   config to make it work. </pre>
