<title>Issue 39305 -   chromium -    The page preview thumbnail on new tab only shows null thumbnails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 beta (41514)  URLs (if applicable) : new tab page  Other browsers tested: Only Chrome is involved in this issue. It's not   relative to other browsers.        Actually I'm not clear how to reproduce the problem. It just does not   recover since it occurs. The first time I found this issue was when I used   the application &quot;Ludashi&quot;(<a href="http://www.ludashi.com/">http://www.ludashi.com/</a>) to clean the system dump   files. After I deleted the system dump files with the application  I found   all the 8 page preview thumbnails became null. I thought it was natural   because all the history records were deleted. But after I surfed on the net   over half a day  the 8 page preview thumbnails are still null. I finally   realized something went wrong. I really love the page preview thumbnail   function. It's a big regret for me to get trapped in such a situation. I   tried to uninstalled Ludashi  but it did not work. Such situation has   lasted for three days. Just now I found one thumbnail got rid of null by   showing Google as the attached &quot;defect snapshot.jpg&quot; shows. I kept clicking   on the other 7 null thumbnails and the &quot;Google&quot; thumbnail became to the   last one strangely as the attached &quot;defect snapshot II.jpg&quot; shows.          I googled this issue but it seems nobody faces the same issue as I do. So I   just want to unveil it. It would be the best if you could help me to solve   this issue.     What directions can I follow to solve this issue? </pre>
