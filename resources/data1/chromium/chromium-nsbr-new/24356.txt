<title>Issue 24356 -   chromium -    browser actions: missing icon causes all icons to fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had three icons declared in my browser action.  The first of the three was   accidentally missing from the directory.  In this state  the other two   weren't accessible either (setIcon(1) or setIcon(2) did nothing  even though   the icons were there).    Perhaps it's the right behavior that icons shouldn't work if one of them is   bad  but we need better error reporting in that case. </pre>
