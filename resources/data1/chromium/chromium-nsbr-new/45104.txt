<title>Issue 45104 -   chromium -    bookmark buttons should see about using the same gradient fade for text that tabs do - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a page title is too long  we use a gradient fade on the end of the text so it isn't cut off   suddenly.  Seems like that same effect might make sense on the bookmark buttons that are too   long to fit in the max button width. </pre>
