<title>Issue 36270 -   chromium -    Implement option subpixel-quality image resampling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some applications would like to use subpixel-quality image subsampling.    This would default to using the current user's text antialiasing algorithm   (so would fall back on regular sampling/antialiasing if they've disabled   subpixel text AA in their system prefs).    This would likely be done as part of <a title="Add -webkit-interpolation-mode CSS for specifying scaling algorithm"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1502">issue 1502</a> which would give pages the   ability to specify sampling type. </pre>
