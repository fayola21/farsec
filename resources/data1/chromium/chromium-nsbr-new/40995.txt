<title>Issue 40995 -   chromium -    worker-simple.html and shared-worker-simple.html fail when run as part of ui_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> worker-simple.html and shared-worker-simple.html fail when run as part of   ui_tests:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Linux%20Perf%20%28w">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Linux%20Perf%20%28w</a>  ebkit.org%29/builds/10280/steps/ui_tests/logs/WorkerWebSocketLayoutTests    Disabling these tests for now  so I can roll WebKit's version forward.    Assigning bug to ukai@chromium.org because he was the last one to touch these   tests in WebKit. Please re-assign as appropriate. </pre>
