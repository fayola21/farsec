<title>Issue 24568 -   chromium -    debug_util::DisableOSCrashDumps installs too many signal handlers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current list is too long and catches signals corresponding to Mach   exceptions that Apple Crash Reporter never attempts to catch  and signals   that don't even map to Mach exceptions.  The default signal handlers are fine   in these cases.    Crash Reporter doesn't care about SIGHUP  for example. </pre>
