<title>Issue 26051 -   chromium -    [feature-request] different proxy settings for incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.0 (FreeBSD)        Since the IP-Address reveals a lot of information about the user it would be   great to be able to use incognito mode with e.g. Privoxy+Tor. Altogether it   would be nice to be able set custom proxy-settings for the incognito mode    so that activities in regular mode and in incognito mode can definitely not   be linked.    Thanks for you work   Hannes </pre>
