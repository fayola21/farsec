<title>Issue 41775 -   chromium -    Large SSL Uploads Crash Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6  URLs (if applicable) : Any SSL  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works as expected  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works as expected  Behavior in Chrome for Linux: Works as expected      1. Set up an SSL site with uploading (example html and php attached)  2. Upload a file larger than 512MB      The file uploads to completion.      Chrome crashes - report attached    Basically  all SSL uploads larger than 512MB crash Chrome every time.  However  even uploading files smaller than 512MB gets unusable depending on  the size of the file - the time it takes seems to increase exponentially.  For example  a 10MB file takes approximately 2 seconds on a 1gbps link   50MB takes 27 seconds  and 200MB takes 8 minutes. The largest file I  actually timed was 400MB  which took 29 minutes!    This behavior does not happen on a non-ssl site  nor does it happen on  Windows or Linux Chrome. Also  Safari (4.0.5) and Firefox (3.6.3) on the  same Mac upload via SSL as expected (600MB in 30-40 seconds).    Looking at the processor  Chrome is taking 100%  but no more  even on a  multiple-CPU machine. I've tried on both a 2.16GHz Core Duo with 2GB RAM  and a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo with 4GB RAM  and the results are identical.    Thanks and please let me know if I can provide any additional info to get  this fixed. </pre>
