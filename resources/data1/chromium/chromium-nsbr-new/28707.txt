<title>Issue 28707 -   chromium -    Text on dangerous download item truncated in some locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4.0.249.11      1. Start chrome with a german locale:       LC_ALL=&quot;de_DE.UTF-8&quot; google-chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome2  2. Download an exe  e.g.   <a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe">http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe</a>        Download warning text should not be truncated.        It is truncated. See screenshot.    This is broken on OS X as well (<a title="&quot;Extension download&quot; warning chopped off" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28705"> issue 28705 </a>). Chances are it's broken on   windows too  would be great if someone with a windows machine could check   that. </pre>
