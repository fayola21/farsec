<title>Issue 33065 -   chromium -    Syncing new data type requires GetUpdates from TS#0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As <a title="Support per-datatype GetUpdates" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29905"> bug 29905 </a> outlines  we are now required to (at the sync engine layer) sync   only the items for which sync is enabled in the browser.  This means when a   new type gets enabled  we need to do a full get updates from timestamp 0   (still with a filter for that data type)  so that we're sure to download   every item for that data type. </pre>
