<title>Issue 41091 -   chromium -    New windows always shifting down  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  2. Type Ctrl N several times      The new windows should be shifted to the right (as available)  or start   more on the left and then shift to the right.  The relative position should be parametrizable: delta x = 10 pixels  delta   y = 0 pixel  etc.  Or always open at the same position.      The new windows go the right and to the bottom  and move totally out of the   display. It doesn't make sense and is pretty annoying.      <b>Please provide
