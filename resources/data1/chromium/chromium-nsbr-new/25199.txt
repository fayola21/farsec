Go to the page <a href="http://torrenti.lv/">http://torrenti.lv/</a>  2. Wait until it's fully loaded      Page loaded  screen shows the top of the page      After load  screen jumps to the bottom of the page as if there was an #   anchor in the URL.    Noticed this behaviour for some other sites as well  not did not save their   URLs back then.  Problem seemed to appear when I switched from beta to Dev channel.   </pre>
