<title>Issue 39763 -   chromium -    Installing extensions through an Incognito Window would push the info bubble to the bottom. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.360.4 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=42897">r42897</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2        1. Open an incognito window.   2. Try installing one of the Chrome extensions which puts a banner in the toolbar.   3. Look for the info bubble when the extension is installed.    Expected:  We shouldn't get the info bubble  since the banner doesn't appear in a Incognito window.    Actual:  The info bubble gets pushed to the bottom of the screen.       </pre>
