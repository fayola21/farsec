<title>Issue 25466 -   chromium -    Compile failure in src/net/websockets/websocket.cc:383: suggest parentheses around + or - in operand of &amp; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.224.0 (29589)  OS + version : Gentoo Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  window manager : xmonad  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Attempt to compile Chromium      scons: done building targets      cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors  /home/rwald/chromium/src/net/websockets/websocket.cc: In member function   'void net::WebSocket::ProcessFrameData()':  /home/rwald/chromium/src/net/websockets/websocket.cc:383: error: suggest   parentheses around + or - in operand of &amp;  scons: ***   [/home/rwald/chromium/src/sconsbuild/Release/obj/net/net/websockets/websock  et.o] Error 1  scons: building terminated because of errors.    Pretty clear-cut: gcc is throwing a warning over the following line  and   because warnings are being treated as errors  it stops the build:    length = length * 128 + *p &amp; 0x7f;    Since binary + takes precedence over unary &amp;  I'm guessing the proper   parentheses would be:    length = ((length * 128) + *p) &amp; 0x7f;    So if someone with commit access could make the appropriate changes to the   code  this bug would go away. </pre>
