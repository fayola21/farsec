<title>Issue 33110 -   chromium -    Some flash games at timeforkids.com don't work in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35884">r35884</a> linux  stable Windows  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/games/staterace.html">http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/games/staterace.html</a>  Other browsers tested: firefox  IE        Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 6: OK           IE 7: OK        1. load <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/games/staterace.html">http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/games/staterace.html</a>      Game displayed      &quot;Please upgrade your flash player&quot;    This particular flash game seems to require IE  but tells users  to upgrade their flash player rather than telling them to run IE.  Might be worth some outreach.   Probably not a chrome problem per se   but some users might blame Chrome anyway.   </pre>
