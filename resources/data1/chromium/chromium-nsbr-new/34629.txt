<title>Issue 34629 -   chromium -    Need to hook up UI for databases on CONTENT_SETTING_ASK - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to hook up UI for databases on CONTENT_SETTING_ASK    This is only partially blocked on 34628.  That bug will get a message to the UI   thread and provide a way to send back a response.  The mechanism to do this   should look much like the one in LocalStorage. </pre>
