<title>Issue 24586 -   chromium -    Mac: window drawing breaks platform visual fidelity - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build Chromium as of 28613  2. Look at window controls (maximize/minimize/iconify widgets)        Expected: controls look and act like they do in other Mac applications  Actual: controls are drawn 3 pixels lower than standard  which is enough of a visual different to be   distracting.  See attached screen shot.   </pre>
