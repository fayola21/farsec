<title>Issue 25997 -   chromium -    Need to run atexitmanager for interactive ui tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Without this  there are subtle bugs.  I spent a day debugging a problem   because a change of mine changed the order that threads were being created.    The existing code had a singelton that worked magically because the same   MessageLoop object would get reallocated across threads at the same address. </pre>
