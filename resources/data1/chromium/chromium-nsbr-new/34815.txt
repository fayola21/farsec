<title>Issue 34815 -   chromium -    Incorrect theme_frame image usage on tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.319.0: (Developer Build 38234)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Fedora 12    I have created a theme that somewhat mimics the default gnome window deco.   In Chrome 4.x  this theme used to work fine. On recent 5.x builds however    there is a problem: the theme_frame image is now displayed upside-down on   tabs which makes it impossible to get the correct look for the main window.    To better show the problem  I have made screenshots in both a 4.x and 5.x   build using the same modified theme: on the 4.x tabs  the red lines start at   the top  just like in the main window. On 5.x however  the image is   rotated... </pre>
