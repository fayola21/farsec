<title>Issue 40793 -   chromium -    Audio tag doesn't seem to work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - verify the following url plays when you load it directly in the browser:     <a href="http://www.renshuu.org/audio=112-a58b0a9d6a434e57725df6d0b3c6a94bce58dfe1">http://www.renshuu.org/audio=112-a58b0a9d6a434e57725df6d0b3c6a94bce58dfe1</a>    (should be the japanese word &quot;otoko&quot;).    - load the attached html page which contains    &lt;audio controls src='<a href="http://www.renshuu.org/audio=112-">http://www.renshuu.org/audio=112-</a>  a58b0a9d6a434e57725df6d0b3c6a94bce58dfe1'&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;    I'd expect it to play  but it doesn't. The controls draw  but I can't get the sound to play. Even   using autoplay nothing plays.    What's wrong with this html?    This is with Mac  5.0.370.0 (43607) </pre>
