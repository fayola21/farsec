<title>Issue 35139 -   chromium -    OnSubmit request in WordPress via Javascript is sometimes intercepted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (36714)  URLs (if applicable) : You'll need to install Wordpress to test this bug.  Other browsers tested: IE  FireFox         Safari 4:--    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1.Create blog post in WordPress 2.9.1 or previous  2.Select Save Draft.  Wait 30-60 seconds.  Make a change to post.  3.Select Update.  Over 50% of the time  the onsubmit request never makes   it to the server.  This is NOT a Wordpress problem  as it works in other   browsers and half the time in Chrome.          After hitting the update button  one expects the saved content to post   back to the server.        Chrome intercepts the Javascript before it POSTS and it hangs.  Only a   browser refresh resolves the problem.  This happens on the UPDATE  not the   initial save draft.  It happens periodically.         </pre>
