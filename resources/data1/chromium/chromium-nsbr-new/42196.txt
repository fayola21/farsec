<title>Issue 42196 -   chromium -    Mouse Move Event Generated in Canvas even when mouse not moved - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045 unknown (42898)    Other browsers tested: Mozilla     Firefox 3.x: OK. There was no problem in it                 1. Just declare a new canvas object  2. Add a function MOVE which handles its mouse move event  3. Add alert to function MOVE.    The function MOVE is called by Chrome repeatedly even though there is not   mouse movement. This is an error as it populated the event queue with   unlimited move events even though user is not moving his mouse.        This problem is not there in Mozilla Firefox 3.x . There as expected the   mouse move event is not there if mouse is not moved.      In chrome even without mouse moving the mouse move event continues to be   active. </pre>
