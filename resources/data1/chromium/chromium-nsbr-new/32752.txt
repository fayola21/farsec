<title>Issue 32752 -   chromium -    Email spam - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just today started getting bombarded with emails from this group. I have no   desire to be a part of it and never asked for it. I have all of my updates   turned off  but the link for subscription settings takes me to a page where   my google account password will not work. What is going on? </pre>
