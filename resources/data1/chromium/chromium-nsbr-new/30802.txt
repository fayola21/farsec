<title>Issue 30802 -   chromium -    Extend the concept of about:net-internals (aka LoadLog) to show other interesting intervals (like process creation time) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Extend the concept of about:net-internals (aka LoadLog) to show other   interesting intervals (like process creation time)    When investigating bugs like <a title="Idle Omnibar -&gt; omnibar is not responding / not giving any results"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22662">issue 22662</a>  it would help if we had some   logging output that testers could enable and share with us.  That way we   could have an easier time pin pointing the problem.   </pre>
