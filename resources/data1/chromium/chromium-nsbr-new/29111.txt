<title>Issue 29111 -   chromium -    Identify testing strategy for accessibility in the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are quite a few layout tests for accessibility:    accessibility/  platform/mac/accessibility/  platform/win/accessibility/    We pass some  we fail some. However  in addition to WebCore  these are meant to   exercise platform APIs (MSAA  NSAccessibility  ATK). Since we don't have access   to these APIs in the sandbox  making these tests pass involves faking   interactions with these APIs and doesn't seem like a good use of our time ...   or a very effective testing strategy.    Currently  our accessibility plumbing in the renderer is Windows-only  but it   is theoretically built to support plugging into any AT on the browser side.    We need to figure out what the testing strategy for this plumbing should be. </pre>
