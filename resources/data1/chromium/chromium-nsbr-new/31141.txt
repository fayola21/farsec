<title>Issue 31141 -   chromium -    Chrome converts encoded slash (%2F) to literal slash (/) in path portion of URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38          Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 8:OK    Certain sites treat an encoded slash (%2F) as distinct from a literal slash   (/) in the path portion of a URL.  For example     A) <a href="http://www.example.com/foo%2Fbar">http://www.example.com/foo%2Fbar</a>  B) <a href="http://www.example.com/foo/bar">http://www.example.com/foo/bar</a>    Are considered different resources. (I can't find a specific example now    but an internal site does this.)    However  Chrome converts URL A to URL B in the address bar.  This results   in the following weird behavior:    1. Input URL A.  2. Hit enter.  &quot;foo%2Fbar&quot; is requested.  3. Notice the address has been converted to URL B.  Hit enter. &quot;foo/bar&quot; is   requested.    We would expect the originally inputted URL A to be preserved so that   hitting enter results in URL A being fetched again  instead of URL B. </pre>
