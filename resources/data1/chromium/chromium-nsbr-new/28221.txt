<title>Issue 28221 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Selecting to beginning/end of line destroys selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pressing shift-command-left or shift-command-right used to select to the   beginning or end of the line  respectively.  Now  they do that  and then   immediately replace all that text with a square glyph.  This makes it pretty   tough to edit anything.    CCing suzhe just because he knows stuff about keypresses. </pre>
