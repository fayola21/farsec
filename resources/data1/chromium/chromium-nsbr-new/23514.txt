<title>Issue 23514 -   chromium -    Command-enter in address bar should reset text + focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Focus the address bar  type an address  and hit command-enter.  The address opens in the   background and the address bar is not changed.  The address bar should be reset to the original   URL and focus should be set to the window itself (or nowhere  or whatever).  See how things work   on Safari. </pre>
