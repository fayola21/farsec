<title>Issue 27471 -   chromium -    Report OS (distro) version &amp; version in UA - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31086">r31086</a>  OS + version : Ubuntu KK  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit  window manager : compiz  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Properly mentions it in the UA    In Ubuntu  Firefox 3.5 properly mentions Ubuntu and release version in its   UA:  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091028   Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.4    But Chrome does not:  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.4 (KHTML  like   Gecko) Chrome/4.0.237.0 Safari/532.4    While  yes  the UA is fakable and nobody should rely on it for essential   features and etc.  it is still necessary. I've ran into a case where we   need to warn/tell them if their distro or version are different  and while   it works with the default browser that's used by most (Firefox)  it doesn't   with Chrome.    So would be great if Chrome stuck in the name &amp; version somewhere in there.   Using some permutation of lsb_release command will give it  like:    vadi@vadi-laptop:~$ lsb_release -a  No LSB modules are available.
