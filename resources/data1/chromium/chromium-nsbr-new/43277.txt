<title>Issue 43277 -   chromium -    Allow overriding page fonts with preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29  OS                   : Linux (Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty)  URLs (if applicable) : any          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Set default font to  for example  DejaVu Sans  2. Go to any website that doesn't have this font as page font.      My selected font is used.      The page's specified font is used.    I realise that this new behaviour (Chrome uses page's fonts) may be   desirable  but I think this is only the case if user has some way to force   own fonts.    Solution would be to have &quot;use (or override) page-specified fonts&quot; or   similar. </pre>
