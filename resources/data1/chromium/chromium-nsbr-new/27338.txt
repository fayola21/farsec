<title>Issue 27338 -   chromium -    move sync cookie load out of startup routine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sync's IsGoogleGAIACookieInstalled is called during Chrome's   initialization.  This causes cookies to be loaded early in the startup   process and introduces startup jank on systems with slow file access.  Two   approaches that would remove the cookie load from the startup process:    1. Only continue checking for the GAIA cookie if the cookie store is loaded   already?  (Downside: sync promo would not appear on first NTP loaded in   Chrome  only on subsequent NTPs if a site has been loaded.)    2. Hang the GAIA cookie check off of a NTP timer that runs 1-2s after the   NTP is loaded.    Marking Tim as owner for now and leaving as Available.  Tim  can you think   of a better person to handle this?  Thanks.    [originally discussed in email  moving to a bug for futher discussion] </pre>
