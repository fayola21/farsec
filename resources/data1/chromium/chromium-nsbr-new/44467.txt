Select popout feature      Movie begins playing in it's own small  separate window.  It can be moved   and resized.      Movie continues to play  but the popout window is NOT visible. No added   window is visible in Chrome Task Manager.  To stop audio from invisible   window  user has to end hulu tab.  Unfortunately  the problem with the   Chrome Task Manager might end other tasks as well  since they might be   combined with the entry for the hulu tab.    <b>Please provide
