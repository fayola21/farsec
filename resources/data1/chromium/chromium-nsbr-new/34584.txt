<title>Issue 34584 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame doesn't work on IE8 64-bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Chrome Frame)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/</a>  Other browsers tested: IE6 (virtual pc)  IE8 32-bit                 IE 6 (vpc): OK             IE 8: 64-bit: FAIL  32-bit: OK      1. Install Google chrome frame from within IE8 64-bit on Windows 7  2. Installation completes successfully.  3. Navigate to cf:<a href="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</a> (or some other url using chrome frame)        Desired page is rendered in the chrome frame.        Error page: &quot;The address is not valid&quot;      After a successful installation on IE8 64-bit (under Win7) chrome frame is   still not usable within the 64-bit version of IE. However  without any   additional installation step chrome frame appears to work correctly from the   32-bit version of IE8. If tried this on two separate computers (both running   Win7 x64) with the same results.  If chrome frame is restricted to only the   32-bit version of IE8 this should be mentioned on the install page  currently   there is no such indication. </pre>
