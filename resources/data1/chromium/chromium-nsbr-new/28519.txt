<title>Issue 28519 -   chromium -    Chrome auto-fills out 1/2 password fields where Firefox fills out 0/2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0 (Official Build 32041)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">http://www.openstreetmap.org/</a> -&gt; Create user -&gt;   Account -&gt; Preferences          Firefox 3.x: OK        In cases where there are two type=&quot;password&quot; input fields on a page Firefox   will auto-fill in neither of them but Chrome will fill out one.    This causes problems e.g. in Rails applications where filling in just one   field will automatically raise an error about the form being incomplete    but filling in neither password might not raise an error at all due to the   password not being required except in special circumstances.    An example of this is the OpenStreetMap preferences page where you need to   provide your password only if you're changing the E-Mail address but not   e.g. when switching languages. In Firefox it's possible to change just that   &amp; save the page  but in Chrome one has to erase the first auto-filled in   password first.    I guess this is due to the auto-remember password feature in Firefox being   more restricted than in Chrome. Firefox auto-fills in my password here just   like chrome:        <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/login">http://www.openstreetmap.org/login</a>    But only chrome fills in the password in the preferences dialog.   </pre>
