<title>Issue 43225 -   chromium -    Current Menu Path Inconsistently Highlighted while Dragging - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Choose a bookmark to drag.  2. Drag that bookmark into folders and subfolders.    What is the expected output?  - All folders in the current folder path should be highlighted.    What do you see instead?  - Both bar folders and folders within folders are only occasionally highlighted  and that usually   requires 'jiggling' the mouse around a bit. </pre>
