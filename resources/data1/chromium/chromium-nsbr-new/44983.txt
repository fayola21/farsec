<title>Issue 44983 -   chromium -    Clicking on far-right side of tab selects tab to the right. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Chromium 6.0.408.1 (Developer Build 47574) Ubuntu      When I click on a tab  Chrome should switch to that tab.      Imagine a vertical line separating a tab into two parts. This line is drawn   from the top-right corner of the tab  straight down. If I click on the tab    but anywhere to the right of the previously described imaginary line  the   tab to the RIGHT of said tab is switched to. The visual feedback regarding   the shape of tabs fail to correspond with the behavior when clicking on   them.   </pre>
