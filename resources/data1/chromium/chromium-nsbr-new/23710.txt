<title>Issue 23710 -   chromium -    Tab context menu item says  &quot;Reopen last tab&quot; when a window was the last one closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 4.0.220.1 (Official Build 27713)        1. Have 2 browser windows open.  2. Close 1 browser window.    3. Right-click on a tab in the remaining browser window.  4. Note that  if the last one closed were a tab  the context menu item  should say  &quot;Reopen closed tab&quot;.  If the last one closed were a window  it  should say  &quot;Reopen last window&quot;. (The title bar context menu is correct.)  5. Note that the context menu item says  &quot;Reopen last tab&quot; regardless of  whether it was a tab or a window that was closed.  6. When the menu item is selected  it correctly reopens the last window  that was closed.    What is the expected output?    The context menu item should say  &quot;Reopen last window&quot;.    What do you see instead?    The context menu item says  &quot;Reopen last tab&quot;.   </pre>
