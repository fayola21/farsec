<title>Issue 36254 -   chromium -    Command + Click Behavior Reversed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.6.2            Basically  the command + click function of Chrome on the Mac so far   matches the Windows control + click functionality  which is fine and good    however it's the reverse of what it should be on the Mac. In every Mac   browser as well as programs like mail  clicking command + click means   &quot;open this in a new tab&quot; while command+shift+click means &quot;open this in a   new tab but don't select the tab  so that it will open in the background   while I continue what I'm doing.&quot;        Command+tab should open a tab and select the new tab  bringing it to the   front        it functions as command+shift tab  working in the background and making   me click command+shift tab if I want to read the new tab now.    So to recount  Command+tab and Command +shift+tab's functionally   should be reversed  or at least  there should be a preference option for   Mac users who don't want the browser to work differently from how Safari    etc work  since every browser (Safari  Firefox  plus programs like Mail) work   differently.    </pre>
