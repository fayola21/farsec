<title>Issue 41220 -   chromium -    Sound fails in all apps while chrome open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev  URLs (if applicable) : NA      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open google-chrome  2. Try to use sound in any other app -- there is none      Sound should work in all apps while chrome open.      chrome holds /dev/snd open  monopolizing the sound card.    No browsing is required to cause this problem.  I tried removing all   plugins (flash was my only one) and uninstalling all extensions except   Notifier for Google Wave - Version: 3 and Docs PDF/PowerPoint Viewer (by   Google) - Version: 1.5.6.  The problem still persists.    As soon as chrome is closed  sound immediately returns.    While chrome is open it holds /dev/snd open.  This appears to be the   problem.  Is there any way to configure chrome to access sound through   pulseaudio instead of directly?    chuck@fire-mana:~/mnt$ lsof | grep /dev/snd  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   22u      CHR             116 64        0t0         4618 /dev/snd/controlC2  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   29u      CHR             116 64        0t0         4618 /dev/snd/controlC2  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   34u      CHR             116 32        0t0         4535 /dev/snd/controlC1  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   40u      CHR             116 96        0t0         4490 /dev/snd/controlC3  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   46u      CHR             116 96        0t0         4490 /dev/snd/controlC3  pulseaudi  4609       chuck   52u      CHR              116 0        0t0         4375 /dev/snd/controlC0  mixer_app  4657       chuck   21u      CHR             116 64        0t0         4618 /dev/snd/controlC2  chrome    15332       chuck  mem       CHR             116 80                    4595 /dev/snd/pcmC2D0p  chrome    15332       chuck   92u      CHR             116 80        0t0         4595 /dev/snd/pcmC2D0p  chuck@fire-mana:~/mnt$     This is a relatively new problem.  As of a version or two ago sound worked   fine.   </pre>
