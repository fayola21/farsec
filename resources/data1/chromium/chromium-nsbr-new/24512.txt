<title>Issue 24512 -   chromium -    Themes peel back image is missing in NNTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Happening On DEV (4.0.221.6) and ToT(r 28487)    Right now  I don't have repro steps.    For some reasons  Themes peel back image is not showing up in NNTP. When it  was happened for first time  I just deleted blindly my profile and  relaunched chrome  then I got the peel back image. Again it is started  happening after browsing for some time with Chrome/Chromium.    When I investigated  for some reasons the attribute 'theme_promo_remaining'  is set to negative values(-1/-3 ) in pref's. Hope  that will help you !!. </pre>
