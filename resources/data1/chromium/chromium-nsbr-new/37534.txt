<title>Issue 37534 -   chromium -    better handing of bad test steps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've and some events recently where different test steps accidently got busted  but the actual bot   steps stayed green.  To help catch these  what about the following:    - make a gtest based binary error if the no tests are found to run (because of filter).  (or make the   scrape of the output catch the zero tests)  - if a step is supposed to collect perf data  error if there was none in the output?   </pre>
