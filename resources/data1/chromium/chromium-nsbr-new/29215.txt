<title>Issue 29215 -   chromium -    Allow omitting optional parameters for extension api functions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  omitting an optional parameter which isn't last requires passing   null or undefined:    chrome.tabs.getAllInWindow(undefined  function(tabs) {});    we've talked about enforcing the convention that all extension functions   are of the form:    chrome.xxx.extensionFunction(scalar subject  object details  function   callback).    This has the benefit of     a) Allowing us to easily extend functions in a non-breaking wayout  without   resorting to adding params beyond the callback function  but adding them to   the details (2nd argument)    b) Because the params can be detected by their type (scalar  object    function)  any which are optional can safely be omitted without having to   pass null or undefined.    This the drawback that it would *require* a single form for all extension   api functions.    </pre>
