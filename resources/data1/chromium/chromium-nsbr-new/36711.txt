<title>Issue 36711 -   chromium -    Referrer not set on in-page navigations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm trying to determine if this is intentional or a regression and filing this   as a discussion point.    Issue: We seem to be no longer setting the referrer on in-page navigations   (referrer is set to blank).    I noticed this when following up on a regression. I changed my code to no   longer rely on the referrer field  but am wondering if this is intentional or   not?    If you set a breakpoint in DidNavigateMainFramePostCommit and look at |params|   you'll see that when you click an anchor link  such as just about any link in   gmail  you don't see a referrer.    If this is intentional  feel free to close. Otherwise this should probably be   treated as a regression  I guess... ?   </pre>
