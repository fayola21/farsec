<title>Issue 41120 -   chromium -    test_shell doesn't treat CHECK() as a fatal error when running in --layout-tests mode on Mac or Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Normally  if a CHECK() assertion fails  we consider this to be a fatal error and dump core. However    the Mac and Linux builds of test_shell will disable this if we are running in --layout-tests mode. I   don't know why.    This seems like a bug to me. The test harness will happily restart test_shell and continue on its way    so we don't lose much  but if we don't treat this as a failure  then the test continues to run and any   subsequent tests will also run  potentially in a corrupted address space (or with something else   wrong).    See <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37342">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37342</a> for the originating bug in WebKit where we   realized that we weren't getting stack traces in all of the appropriate situations during run-webkit-  tests. </pre>
