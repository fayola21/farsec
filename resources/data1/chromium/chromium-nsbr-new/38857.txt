<title>Issue 38857 -   chromium -    LastPass javascript only extension crashing often in 4.1.249. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 (41514)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a      1. Install LastPass (it usually crashes) <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd</a>  2. If that doesn't work  uninstalling and reinstalling tends to crash more often  (so does general use).     It should be noted that while LastPass also has a binary component  these crashes are occurring in the version released on   the chrome extensions website without a binary component.    It was not crashing for the last few months  and the 5.X series is fine. 4.1.249.X was crashing in beta  and now in stable   too.  Hundreds of complaints.     Are you notified of these crashes?  We suspect that thousands are impacted. </pre>
