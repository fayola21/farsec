<title>Issue 24573 -   chromium -    Installing &quot;Subscribe in Feed Reader&quot; on Chrome 3 shows wrong error dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     In Chrome 3  try to install the feed reader extension at   <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples</a>    What is the expected output?    Dialog that says: Extension Install Error. Extensions are not enabled.    What do you see instead?    Dialog that says: Extension Install Error. Invalid value for 'permissions  [0]'.    This happens for any extension that has &quot;permissions&quot;: [ &quot;tabs&quot; ] in the   manifest. It could potentially confuse people that are trying to install   extensions on the wrong version of Chrome. </pre>
