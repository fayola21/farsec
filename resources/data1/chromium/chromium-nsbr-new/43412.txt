<title>Issue 43412 -   chromium -    Graphics card switching error in  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.youtube.com/</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Open Chrome on a latest generation MacBook Pro (i5/i7)  2. Go to one of the listed web pages          That (like in Safari) this does not trigger a switch to the high performance graphics card as   google mail and some flash videos should run on the Intel graphics card without any problems.        This triggers a switch to the high performance graphics card  severely impacting battery life. This   is especially a concern for Google Mail which is likely to be open 100% of the time. However    there are many examples of web pages which cause Google Chrome to switch to high   performance graphics when Safari does not. </pre>
