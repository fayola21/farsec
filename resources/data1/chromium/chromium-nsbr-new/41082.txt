<title>Issue 41082 -   chromium -    Usability bug: incorrect folder flashes when adding a bookmark in the bookmark bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A  OS: Windows XP      1. Ensure that the bookmark bar is visible.  2. Ensure that more than one folder is sitting in the bookmark bar.  3. Visit any web page.  4. Add the web page as a bookmark in a specific folder that is currently   sitting in the bookmark bar.    (This sets the current folder for the star (make bookmark) menu).    5. Visit another web page.  6. Click the star (make bookmark button).  7. Now the current folder will flash.  7. Change the folder in the menu to another folder currently sitting in the    bookmark bar.  8. The new folder does not flash  while the first folder continues to   flash.        I expect the folder where my bookmark is destined to go should flash.        The bookmark does go to the correct folder  but the folder may not flash if   it is selected in the make bookmark menu. Instead  the original folder   continues to flash.    --  I suspect the problem is in the event handler of the bookmark menu's   &quot;destined folder&quot; drop down box. </pre>
