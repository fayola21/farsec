<title>Issue 46308 -   chromium -    Flash Player Zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've check on severals forum and I am not alone with this issue...    When I zoom in a web page with flash player in it  all buttons on the Flash application are no more usable....    If I do the same thing in Firefox or IE  there is no issues  then it seems to be an issue with Chrome.    The perfect example is in Youtube when you zoom in.    Please fix it soon  I am currently using Firefox to see youtube videos. </pre>
