<title>Issue 32729 -   chromium -    Chrome's RSS Subscription Extension popup flickers when opened and does not disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36504">r36504</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Install Chrome extension RSS Subscription Extension   (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd?hl=en-us">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd?hl=en-us</a>)  2. Navigate to a webpage with RSS feeds. (like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/">http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/</a>)  3. Click on the RSS subscription icon in the Omnibox.    Expected:  RSS feed icon allows you to subscribe to the available feeds on the page.    Actual:  We get the popup showing the various feeds we can subscribe to  but the popup is flickering and wouldn't   disappear when we move to a different app.    This appears to be similar to <a title="Extension popup stays open when rapidly repeat-clicking the browser action button." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31097"> bug 31097 </a> that was fixed recently  which I verified.   </pre>
