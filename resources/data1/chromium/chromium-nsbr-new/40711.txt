<title>Issue 40711 -   chromium -    Figure out why -dragImage:* doesn't seem right WRT -isFlipped in AutocompleteTextFieldCell. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/browser/cocoa/autocomplete_text_field_cell.mm has a -mouseDown:* implementation   which can initiate dragging.  I believe that all coordinates are correct  but when -dragImage:* is sent   to |controlView|  the drag image's offset relative to the mouse cursor is way off unless |dragPoint| is   manually adjusted according to |[controlView isFlipped]|.    This bug is to determine if the coordinates are actually incorrect  or if the -dragImage:*   implementation is broken in this way.  If it's broken  then double-check that other uses aren't   potentially broken  too. </pre>
