<title>Issue 43293 -   chromium -    When you change your system time to another timezone and refresh the current tab the getTimezoneOffset is set back to 0  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a webpage with the following javascript code (also see url) and open your javascript   console to see the output:  t = new Date();  t.getTimezoneOffset();  2. Change you system time to another timezone  3. Refresh your page and look at the output again        That the getTimezoneOffset is not set to 0 but adjusted according to the new system timezone.        In step 1 my system time zone was set to West Greenland Summer Time (Nuuk - Greenland)   which return the following results in the javascript console:     Wed May 05 2010 06:38:42 GMT-0200 (WGST)  -7200    In step 2 i changed my timezone (system datetime) to Central European Summer Time (Brussels -   Belgium) and refreshed the tab (step 3) and got the following results:    Wed May 05 2010 08:45:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)  0    If then open a new tab and type in the same url i get the expected result which should be:    Wed May 05 2010 10:46:39 GMT+0200 (CEST)  7200    Please provide
