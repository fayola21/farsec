<title>Issue 23739 -   chromium -    'Flash Required' box hides DHTML layers underneath - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.21  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.omniplex.com/">http://www.omniplex.com/</a>      1. Ensure flash plugin is not installed.  2. Visit sample URL above  3. Hover mouse over left menu bar.      Pop-up sub menus should be visible above 'flash required' box        'flash required' box is always on top.    Additional info:    I do not use flash due to it's negative performance effects on my browsing   experience.  The warning that flash is required to view certain elements is   logical  but not allowing other content to appear on layers above it   inhibits the users ability to navigate the non-flash remainder of the site.   </pre>
