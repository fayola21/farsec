<title>Issue 26655 -   chromium -    Page halts loading is Developer Tools window is open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page with some Javascript. Happens on Gmail and in phpMyAdmin for   me.  2. Right click somewhere and click &quot;Inspect element&quot; to bring up the   developer tools window.  3. Focus main Chrome window and reload the page.      Page should load normally.      Most of the time the page gets stuck loading partway. It appears something   in the DT window is halting the page loading. As soon as you close the   window  the page finishes loading.    My guess is that the DT sets some kind of &quot;breakpoint&quot; if there is an error   in the Javascript. The DT is normally pointing to some JS code.    <b>Please provide
