<title>Issue 44736 -   chromium -    Dragging the whole or partial URL from the omnibox doesn't include http:// prefix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to eg. www.google.com (the omnibox shows &quot;www.google.com&quot;  i.e. with  http:// stripped)  2. Select the whole URL (triple-clicking) and drag it to the home button        Homepage preference should be set  but it isn't  since the dragged URL is  not valid.    Should the dragged text actually include http? Note that if I drag the text  to some textfield  http:// is missing as well  but when I go through the  clipboard  it's there.   </pre>
