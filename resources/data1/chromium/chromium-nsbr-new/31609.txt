<title>Issue 31609 -   chromium -    Chrome search automagically folds accented characters &amp; similar to their ASCII versions &amp; vice-versa - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.althingi.is/lagas/131b/1940019.html">http://www.althingi.is/lagas/131b/1940019.html</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  w3m      Firefox 3.x: OK      Emacs w3m: OK      1. Go to the above page  2. Search for &quot;��_��_&quot; or &quot;e&quot;  &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;��__&quot; etc.  3. The search will find both forms    For example searching for &quot;her&quot; on the above page yields 57 hits but only 7   in Firefox because Chrome searches for &quot;h[��_��_e]r&quot;. &quot;H��_��_r&quot; in Icelandic means   &quot;Here&quot; but &quot;Her&quot; means &quot;Military&quot;.        Chrome should search for the string I entered  or at least provide an   option of not doing automagic folding.        Chrome automagically folds characters and search for a string I didn't   enter. </pre>
