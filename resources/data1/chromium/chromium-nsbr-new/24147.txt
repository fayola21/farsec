<title>Issue 24147 -   chromium -    Preload menu so that it comes up quickly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The main menu currently loads every time it's shown. We should load the   contents so that it can be shown quickly.    NOTE: if we stick with the main menu being html  the html will end up being   defined in Chrome so that we won't have to do this trick. </pre>
