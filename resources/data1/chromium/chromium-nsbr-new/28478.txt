<title>Issue 28478 -   chromium -    White on black text looks very bad in tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4      1. Install theme &quot;Karim Rashid&quot;  2. Look at a tab title        Text should be readable (create white text on black background in textedit   to see how it should look).        It looks crappy. See screenshot. </pre>
