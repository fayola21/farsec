<title>Issue 34094 -   chromium -    Create a way to customize the buildbot experience - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once we moved completely our buildbot status (console) to appengine  we   should look into adding ways for users to customize the view they see. It   could be implemented with a log in  or a cookie.    Eventually it would also be nice if we could force and interrupt a build from   appengine itself (for logged on users) </pre>
