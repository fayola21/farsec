<title>Issue 27431 -   chromium -    Special extension install mode for gallery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should trust the gallery URL to install extensions without prompts. We   should only trust the SSL URL  and only when it is the top frame.    Originally  we had wanted to isolate the renderer that is running the   gallery in a separate process  but as I understand it  that is just security   in depth  not required.    Security guys  can you comment on whether we could do the isolation part   separately  perhaps for stable? I'd like to squeeze this in for beta  if   possible. </pre>
