<title>Issue 28417 -   chromium -    xmlhttprequest-setrequestheader-no-value.html: lighttpd does not pass empty headers to CGI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run the layout test.    (According to victorw) This test fails because the headers are passing to cgi as   ENV parameters  and looks like the CUSTOM_HEADER with empty value is   discarded in ENV so it is lost in response.  </pre>
