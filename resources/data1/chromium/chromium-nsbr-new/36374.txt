<title>Issue 36374 -   chromium -    Up and down arrow keys not working properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Go to above website  2.Click on any menu item on left of page  3. Try to scroll with the navigation keys (PgUp  PgDn  Down arrow or Up   arrow)      Whenever a scroll bar is shown on the right of the screen  and the mouse   pointer is over the text associated with the scroll bar  BOTH the touch pad   scrolling AND the navigation keys should be enabled. The only exception to   this is should be when the cursor is in an input box  and then the   navigation keys should scroll through past entries or suggested entries for   that input box.      Only the touch pad scrolling works when you move the mouse pointer over the   main text. Although a scroll bar appears on the right of the screen none of   the navigation keys work until until you click on the text on the screen    at which point they start to work.    <b>Please provide
