<title>Issue 34795 -   chromium -    HttpAuthHandler's should be constructed from a factory object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Rationale: if there are system-level problems supporting an Authentication   scheme  such as being unable to find a gssapi shared library for Negotiate   on Linux  or SSPI not being able to handle NTLM  we     This could be done by introducing more static scope variables in HttpAuth -   but could also be done by introducing    class HttpAuthHandlerFactory {   public:    int CreateAuthHandler(const std::string&amp; auth_string    scoped_refptr&lt;HttpAuthHandler&gt;* handler) = 0;  }    The implementation can maintain state as well - so if a particular type of   auth failed in the past  it can continue to fail in the future.    Another upside: this may make unit testing HttpNetworkTransaction (and   other consumers of the HttpAuthHandler) easier.    </pre>
