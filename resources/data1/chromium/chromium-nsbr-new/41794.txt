<title>Issue 41794 -   chromium -    Always open settings for downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The text above it says &quot;You have chosen to open certain file types automatically after downloading   [which ones? where do I make these choices?]. You can clear these settings so that downloaded files   aren't automatically opened.&quot;.    I don't know if the button is ever enabled on Mac. Or on Windows  for that matter  though in that   case I can at least imagine how it would become enabled; it's still total suckage that I can   see/change those settings. </pre>
