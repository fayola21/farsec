<title>Issue 42421 -   chromium -    Provide command line switch to easily reset user-agent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	5.0.375.9 (Offizieller Build 44625) dev  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-US)  AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.9 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome  --help          If the chrome executable/script (eg. &quot;/Applications/Google  Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome&quot; on OSX  chrome.exe on Windows   google-chrome on linux) is invoked with --user-agent  a user-agent can be  specified. This user-agent becomes the default from now on until the end of  the session  which is the expected behaviour for me  as a user.    It would be nice  if there were an easy way to revert the user-agent to the  default. As it is right now  the user would either have to write down the  current user agent (as shown in about:version) or he'd have to quite chrome  and start again.    Both options aren't nice.    A new command line parameter like &quot;user-agent-default&quot; would be nice; this  should then reset the user-agent to the default value. </pre>
