<title>Issue 24385 -   chromium -    &quot;Find as you type&quot; search lacks the familiar &quot;/&quot; keybinding found in other browsers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)          Konqueror 4: OK      Firefox 3.5: OK       Opera 10.0: OK     Arora 0.10.1: OK    Midori 0.1.10: OK      1. Load a page in Chrome  2. Press /  3. Watch as the find box fails to appear.      Pressing the / key when the HTML frame has focus and has not delegated it   to form elements (or had the keypress captured by javascript and silenced)   should be equivalent to pressing Ctrl+F.      Nothing.   </pre>
