<title>Issue 44634 -   chromium -    RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeeded recursion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/trunk/src/chrome/app/client_util.cc:  void MainDllLoader::RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeeded() {    RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeededFunc relaunch_function =        reinterpret_cast&lt;RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeededFunc&gt;(            ::GetProcAddress(dll_                              &quot;RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeeded&quot;));    if (!relaunch_function) {      LOG(ERROR) &lt;&lt; &quot;Could not find exported function &quot;                 &lt;&lt; &quot;RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeeded&quot;;    } else {      relaunch_function();    }  }    I've had this code call itself over and over until all stack space is used up in MSIE   8.0 once during fuzzing. I could not reproduce  but it seems obvious that this can   happen from the source. The html loaded in MSIE that triggered it contained this:  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;chrome=1&quot;&gt;  Which would active ChromeFrame. I've tried to reproduce this problem manually but MSIE   just says &quot;Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage&quot;.    Attached is the html that would have triggered the issue.       </pre>
