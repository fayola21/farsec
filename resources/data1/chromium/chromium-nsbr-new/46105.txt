<title>Issue 46105 -   chromium -    Domain matching for saved passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the password manager only autofills passwords that were saved with the same exact URL.  This often forces users to remember the same password multiple times (i.e. google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin and google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginAuth).    In cases where the user has no saved usernames for the URL  we should continue to no autofill it in the username field  but should show the username in a dropdown when the username field has focus.  If the user selects this other username and submits the form  we should then automatically store the association of the URL with the username so it gets filled automatically in the future.    In cases where the user does have a saved username(s) for the URL  we should show the last one used as filled by default  but show other _unique_ usernames also in the dropdown list.  Unique means that if the user has signed into google.com with foo@bar.com  we should not show multiple instances of foo@bar.com in the list  even if it was used at both /ServiceLogin and /ServiceLoginAuth </pre>
