<title>Issue 26705 -   chromium -    window.focus() does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We do not honor window.focus() requests.      1. Open the attached file in Chrome  2. Enable the popup for the page and reload the page    Expected:  The popup window is opened then the main browser window gets focus and is brought to the front.    Actual:  The popup window is opened and stays on top.    Note:  - There is a problem with RenderWidget::didFocus() at this time  it gets called every time a node is focused  not just   when the widget gets focused. We would need to fix that first to fix this bug.  - It is not entirely clear what we should do with regards to enabling other tabs.  Darin suggested to may be limit the behavior to popups: the browser gets a request for focusing another renderer  if the   renderer issuing the request is a popup and if it is in the same process as the currently active renderer  then give   focus to it.   </pre>
