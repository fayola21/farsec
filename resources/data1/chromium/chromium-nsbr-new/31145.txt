<title>Issue 31145 -   chromium -    Chrome seems to cause a system-wide lockup. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run chrome.  2. Wait.  3. It crashes the system. The crashes are random. Sometimes it will be when   I'm actively using the computer - othertimes  I'll come back to a frozen   computer. It takes hours for the problem to crop up again.      At worst  chrome should just crash and should not lock up the system. At   best  chrome shouldn't be crashing at all.      The entire system (local mouse/keyboard input  ssh  everything) locks up   and doesn't respond.    <b>Please provide
