<title>Issue 44627 -   chromium -    Option to clear browsing data when exiting the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to have an option to clear browsing data when quitting Chromium. This option is   present in Firefox and IE8. As a practical matter  I prefer to clear all browsing data when quitting   the browser for a variety of reasons  including the protection of my privacy. I don't generally   remember to do this manually  so I avoid browsers that don't provide this option. </pre>
