<title>Issue 45168 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.WorkerLifecycle is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WorkerTest.WorkerLifecycle is disabled; according to the comment:    &quot;worker-lifecycle.html relies on layoutTestController.workerThreadCount which is not currently   implemented.&quot;    Presumably we should either implement that  or remove the test if we never plan to implement it. </pre>
