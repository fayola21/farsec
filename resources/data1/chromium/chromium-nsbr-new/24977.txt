<title>Issue 24977 -   chromium -    Chrome and Spaces busted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Turn on Spaces  2. Open more than one Chrome window in space 1  3. Activate spaces (to go to the overview screen) and drag one Chrome   window from space 1 to space 2  4. From Spaces  click on space 2.      You go to space 2 and the Chrome window you dragged to space 2 is   there. The other Chrome window(s) you didn't drag over are still in the   original space 1.      All your Chrome windows move to space 2.    Additional info:  Bad enough to cause me to switch to Safari until it's fixed.   </pre>
