<title>Issue 44303 -   chromium -    links to URL shortening services should resolve to full URLs automatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL shortening services such as bit.ly and goo.gl allow attackers to disguise   destination URLs easily (as in the recent attack against Apache  see:   <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_04_09_2010">https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_04_09_2010</a>). Chrome should   resolve these URLs and provide an affordance (status-bar or tooltip on   hover?) that allows users to peer beyond the shortening service and inspect   the destination of URLs they may click on.    We might also imagine an auto-updating list of shortening service providers   and their resolution endpoints. </pre>
