<title>Issue 43452 -   chromium -    [ Mac ] The Mousecursor do not switch to the &quot;handcursor&quot; on a link  when clicked it before - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.398.0 (46573)    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): okay  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): okay  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested        1. go to www.apple.com    2. move the mousecurser to the &quot;Store&quot;-Link  (but do not click)    2.a.  Result: the cursor is now a &quot;hand&quot;-cursor because it is a link (That's okay!!!)    3. now click on the store-link    3.a. Problem 1: the cursor should not switch to the arrow-cursor  because you are still on the   store-link. It should be still the &quot;hand&quot;-cursor.    4. now move the cursor within the store-link    4.a. Problem 2: the cursor stays as a &quot;arrow&quot;-cursor  but it should switch two the &quot;hand&quot;-cursor      Thanks and regards  Mehmet       </pre>
