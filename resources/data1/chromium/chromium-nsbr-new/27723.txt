<title>Issue 27723 -   chromium -    Crashes in WebKit::WebPopupMenuImpl::close() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I can't get stacks now  because I'm on the plane and am having a hard time   using the VPN and crbug simultaneously.  I'l get stacks later.    Probably caused by <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31195">r31195</a>  the fix for <a title="&quot;Chromium Helper&quot; orphan renderer processes remaining even with no tabs open after using a pop-up menu" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26311"> bug 26311 </a>.  That may have also   caused <a title="Crash in http cache while pages are loading" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27145"> bug 27145 </a>.    I may need to bring <a title="Figure out the ownership model for web content &lt;select&gt; pop-up menus" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26876"> bug 26876 </a> into M4 for this  but it's possible that I can fix   it by getting rid of the ShutdownHost call while keeping [cocoa_view_ release]. </pre>
