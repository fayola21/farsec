<title>Issue 37942 -   chromium -    Throbber doesn't start immediately when starting a cross-site navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Throbber doesn't start immediately when starting a cross-site navigation    It is suppressed by a call to RenderViewHost::SetNavigationsSuspended(true)    which happens during RenderViewHostManager::Navigate.    This can be a significant delay if the system is busy.  As a result  Chrome   looks like it did not respond to user input. </pre>
