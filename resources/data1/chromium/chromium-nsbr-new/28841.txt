<title>Issue 28841 -   chromium -    Interface disappearing and &quot;unturnoffable&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I was testing Chromium OS on Java VirtualBox  I've noticed that  when I   opened the Google search tab  Chrome's interface disappeared. And when I've   tried to turn off the system  there was no turn off button.    I hope I've helped the team.  Thank You for the attention. </pre>
