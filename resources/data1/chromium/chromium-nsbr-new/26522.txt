<title>Issue 26522 -   chromium -    Prevent seccomp sandbox from reading files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;the sandbox doesn't actually prevent reading of files at this   time  as we still need to allow the renderers to get access to font files.   This needs to be fixed  so that seccomp sandbox uses the same code as the   suid sandbox. I think  that's easy to do; I just need to look up where Adam   turned on file handle passing for font files.&quot; </pre>
