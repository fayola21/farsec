First of all we need a Print Preview Option. Period.  In most cases when you try to print selections  it doesn't work. Also  when   it comes to Flash pages  objects etc  it doesn't print them (99%) of times.  I use IE window extention and it prints most pages correctly (as expected).    I believe that you guys do a fantastic job with Chrome (already v.5!) Hope   I'm helping there...    Regards   George   </pre>
