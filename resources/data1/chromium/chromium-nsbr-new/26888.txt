<title>Issue 26888 -   chromium -    When reloading an unpacked extension fails  disable instead of removing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if you make a breaking change to the manifest while editing an unpacked extension  and   reload it  the extension disappears and you have to add it again.    It'd be nice if a failed reload left a disabled stub extension that could be re-enabled with one click.  </pre>
