<title>Issue 38782 -   chromium -    Tabs are right-aligned instead of left-aligned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0  under Linux      The tabs should be left-aligned as usual.      The tabs are aligned to the right of the window  which is very disturbing.   See the screenshot. From the way the &quot;+&quot; button's outline does not fit in   smoothly with the tabs  this looks like a bug.   </pre>
