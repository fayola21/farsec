<title>Issue 46169 -   chromium -    Merge http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/58153 to release branch? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/58153">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/58153</a> fixes a crasher which RTL users run into frequently in gmail.    Can we merge this into the release branch  it seems pretty low risk (it's basically a one-line patch).    (apologies if this is already merged  although I think it isn't). </pre>
