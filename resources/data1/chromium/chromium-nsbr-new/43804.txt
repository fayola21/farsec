On a dual-screen system  open a browser windoe on monitor 1.   2. While watching monitor 2  change browser window on monitor one to full-screen. (shift-cmd-  f)  3. While watching monitor 2  change browser window on monitor one back to partial-screen.   (shift-cmd-f)      Monitor 2 should be unaffected by the change in the context of Monitor 1      Monitor 2 flashes all-black when enabling and disabling full-screen on monitor 1.    More readily detectable if you turn on color-inversion in accessibility settings. In this case  both   screens flash full-white  which is very distracting.   </pre>
