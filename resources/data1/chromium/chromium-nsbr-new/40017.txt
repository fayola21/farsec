<title>Issue 40017 -   chromium -    NOTREACHED() in extension_prefs.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The changes for <a title="Send ping days parameter for extension blacklist" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39745"> Issue 39745 </a> introduce a new value into the extensions prefs   the next time chrome checks for extensions updates. When you then restart the   browser  we run though a code path that wasn't expecting this value and you   hit a NOTREACHED().    Nothing bad happens after this  but I need to update the code to not hit the   NOTREACHED in this case. </pre>
