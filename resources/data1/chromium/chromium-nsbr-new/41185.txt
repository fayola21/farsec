<title>Issue 41185 -   chromium -    Tab Crash on Chrome for Mac on specific page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/iwork-dot-com/">http://www.apple.com/iwork/iwork-dot-com/</a>      1. Load the URL  2. Observe &quot;Aw  snap!&quot; page.    The above URL always crashes the tab for me  even if I restart Chrome or disable all extensions.   Presumably this has to do with the quicktime embeds you can bring up in the page. Quicktime   behaves correctly on other sites  however. </pre>
