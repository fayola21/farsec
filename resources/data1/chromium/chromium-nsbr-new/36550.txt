<title>Issue 36550 -   chromium -    There is currently no way to clear localStorage or database data from extensions. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is currently no way to clear localStorage or database data from   extensions.    There's some discussion about this in <a href="http://crbug.com/33019">http://crbug.com/33019</a> (which is   about extension data being deleted when you delete other cookie/site data).    This might best be something added to the extensions page  though it's   possible another line item in &quot;clear browsing data&quot; makes sense.  Can the UI   and extensions team work out what'd be best  please?    I'm adding this to mstone 5 because it seems pretty important to have some   way for a user to delete all extension data.  (In mstone 4  deleting cookies   deleted local storage and database data for all protocols...including   extensions.  But that's not good enough for mstone 4.) </pre>
