<title>Issue 30404 -   chromium -    Non-responsive timeout triggered when popup menu is displayed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : any (sample: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a>)  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):    OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows:             OK      1. Install Flash Player  2. Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a> and play a video  3. Ctrl-click video to bring up Flash context menu    What is the expected result?  On Safari  playback continues under menu    What happens instead?  Playback freezes and 10-second non-responsive   timeout is triggered.    Chrome is using Carbon events to handle UI input.  Carbon blocks the main   run loop when it's got a pop-up menu up.  If a pop-up menu is up  Chrome   will notice that it's not responding  and will throw up that dialog after   about 10 seconds.    WORKAROUND:  [1] Dismiss the pop-up menu before that ~10-second window has passed  [2] Click 'Wait' in the dialog that Chrome pops up.   </pre>
