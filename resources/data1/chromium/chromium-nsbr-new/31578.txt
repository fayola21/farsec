<title>Issue 31578 -   chromium -    Page zoom and image zoom interact weirdly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you zoom an image and it becomes too big to fit in the viewport  you get a   magnifying glass (correct) however clicking on it does not reduce the image   to fit in the viewport  it changes its size to something larger o_O...    e.g. visit <a href="http://www.ranchtastic.com/photos/20100105-scott/photo2.jpg">http://www.ranchtastic.com/photos/20100105-scott/photo2.jpg</a> and   press Ctrl++ twice. Now click on the image.    In fact  the combination of the two features just seems generally broken.   I've managed to get it in a state such that Ctrl+0 won't reset the zoom level   to what it was to begin with  only some other  larger size. </pre>
