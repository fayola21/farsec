<title>Issue 30325 -   chromium -    [Drag and Drop] ondragleave should be called before ondragenter when entering child elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. See the file test.html attached  2. Notice that entering / leaving a child element that does not catch drag   elements fires ondragenter  THEN ondragleave  with end result that the   state is actually left instead of entered  3. On firefox  ondragleave is called before ondragenter  hence problem does   not arise        If one moves the mouse over a child element which does not catch drag   operations on his own  then the parent element should be kept as drag   target (if the parent element catches drag events).        With the sequence ondragenter  THEN ondragleave  it is near to impossible   to reliably make the parent catch drag events even if mouse is over child.   The best solution I've come up with is attached as best.html  basically I   don't execute ondragleave unless an ondragover event has been fired after   the ondragenter event. But this is unreliable for fast mouse movements   where the ondragover resolution is not sufficient and also in the cases   where ondragleave SHOULD be called after dragenter such as when the child   node finishes just before the parent node.    <b>Please provide
