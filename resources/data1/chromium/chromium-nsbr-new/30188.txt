<title>Issue 30188 -   chromium -    Mac: Omnibox border wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chromium browser window. The following is also much easier to   see if you switch to a dark theme such as &quot;Floral Blue&quot;.  2. Put your nose right up against the Omnibox; if you haven't smudged   your screen  it's not close enough. Or zoom in and look at the top and   bottom edges of the Omnibox.  3. Compare with the adjacent buttons (the star button will do).      The borders should line up perfectly. Instead  the Omnibox is one pixel   larger in each direction  with a barely-noticeable (in the default theme)    light  one-pixel border.    I guess I'll take this too. </pre>
