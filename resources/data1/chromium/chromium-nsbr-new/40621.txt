<title>Issue 40621 -   chromium -    page elements display outside of browser window  javaplugin2_npapi crash  possibly related - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Configure java preferences to run java applets in their own process  2. Visit the above url.  3. Click the &quot;Check Browser&quot; button.  4. Notice the pop-up has a black square.  5. Try moving the window - a small white square will remain behind at the location of the square    or may appear at some location on the desktop after a few moments.      The browser check should inform the user about what features are working for the   webct/blackboard system  however it appears to hang. In Firefox  all features are supported with   the exception of a failure to detect the system JRE. Opera behaves similarly to Chrome  in that the   browser check page hangs. However  Firefox and Opera both display the browser check and later   pages without floating elements  unlike Chrome.      Chrome displays certain page elements outside of the browser window. On the browser check    this appears as a small white box that is present underneath the browser window  or sometimes   off to one side. On the pages that require a login  a larger box appears directly below the   browser window  but still connected. It will move with the window if the window is repositioned.   Using Expos��_��_ allows the elements to be individually selected and may alter their appearance or   location.    If Java preferences are configured to run Java within the browser process  the elements do not   appear away from the page  but they may not appear at all.    More severe issues occur on pages that require login. Screen shots illustrate these issues.    <b>Please provide
