<title>Issue 41103 -   chromium -    HREFs as ipv6 addresses not clickable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 (Developer Build 42476) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : any URL formatted as/with an IPv6 address        Firefox 3.x: OK      I was using sarg which creates URLs from IP addresses but I am sure anyone   with a bit of HTML knowledge could whip up an example.  Sarg creates HREFs   of the form:    &lt;a href=&quot;2001:1234:123:1:123:1234:1234:1234/graph_day.png&quot;&gt;    Such a link opens fine in Firefox 3.6b6pre but Chromium won't open it.  It   does show it as a link but nothing happens when you click on it and nothing   shows up on the bottom left of the window when you mouseover it.        When clicked  the link should be followed.        Clicking has no effect.    I should add  that if instead of an ipv6 address  the HREF is an ipv4   address  clicking works just fine. </pre>
