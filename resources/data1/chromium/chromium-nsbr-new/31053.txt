<title>Issue 31053 -   chromium -    Workaround for buggy SSL extension handling in Java servers   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266             Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Start Tomcat or any other java servers - with SSL enabled  2. Connect from chrome using https ( with wireshark in background to see   the packets)                IOException or similar in java server  timeout or error in chrome.  I only tested in linux - no other OS available right now - the problem is   in    <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6728126">http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6728126</a> - a bug reading the empty   SessionTicket.    I suspect reversing the order of the extensions - i.e. send SessionTicket   first and Hostname second - would solve the problem.     Otherwise - waiting for people to upgrade their java would obsolete the   bug  hopefully people will find the bug and will know what to do.     Only tested on linux - sorry no other OS available right now - but I assume   all versions use the same SSL code.     </pre>
