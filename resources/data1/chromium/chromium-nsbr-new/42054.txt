<title>Issue 42054 -   chromium -    X11 middle-button cut-and-paste inconsistent with ctrl-C copy of http-less URL-bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. go to regular URL  e.g.  www.google.com  2.  Observe that there is no http:// in the URL bar as per <a title="Closed  because you can't stop talking about removing http." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40865"> issue #40865 </a>  3. select whole URL bar  e.g.  by triple-clicking on it  4. copy it with ctrl-C (or &quot;copy&quot; from the menu if you prefer)  5. paste into another window (e.g.  gnome-terminal) as text with gnome-  terminal's paste menu and observe <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a> appears  with the   &quot;http:// magically being added.  What amazing technology!  It isn't there    but it is  just when I need it.  A UI advance.  6. select the whole URL bar again with another triple click  7. copy it into gnome-terminal by clicking the middle button.  Observe that   only &quot;www.google.com/&quot;  not &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot;  8.  Cry bitter tears of disappointment at the inconsistency as the magic is   broken.    Can you restore my faith?  Step 5 seems nice  but 7 seems unfortunate.    This bug is probably X-specific since I think only X is silly enough to   have two different copying mechanisms.                <b>Please provide
