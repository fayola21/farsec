<title>Issue 44852 -   chromium -    Find field not appearing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1  URLs (if applicable) :  I noticed the problem on www.shacknews.com and various imdb.com pages  OS version               :  10.6.3      1.  Using the cmd+F hotkey for Find... or selecting Edit-&gt; Find-&gt; Find... from the menubar.      A search field should pop up for in-site searching.      On some sites--seemingly at random--the find field does not show up.  On a website with a   black background I noticed that a white bar the width of the usual find field by 1-2px height   shows up where the find field should be.   </pre>
