<title>Issue 44068 -   chromium -    Multiple select in upload widget fails  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create page with multiple file upload input element  ( &lt;input name='upfiles[]' type=file multiple /&gt; )    2. Try to select 20+ files and click open.        - The response message should show something like &quot;20 files&quot; which I can  then begin to upload. There is no indication of an upload limit  so I don't  see why I can't upload 1000 files if I want to.        - Once around 200 characters are used (only about 8+ files)  the response  msg shows 'No file chosen'  and thus no files can be sent. I become  frustrated and confused.      <b>Please provide
