<title>Issue 44695 -   chromium -    Finish porting AutomationProvider - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is admittedly a broadly sweeping bug description.    AutomationProvider is 95% ported to linux/mac  but still some functions are   missing  for example SendContextMenuCommand and TabReposition. For these two   particular examples  it's not clear to me where they are used or if they are   used at all (I tracked them to TabProxy but came to a dead end there).    Someone needs to go through all these AutomationProvider messages/functions   and either  a) delete them if they are not used anywhere  b) implement them on linux/mac if they are useful for testing  c) add new tests that make use of them if they could be useful but just   aren't being used at the moment </pre>
