<title>Issue 28947 -   chromium -    Mac scrolling performance is still way behind Linux/Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.249.12 (Official Build 32876)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.12     URLs (if applicable):   <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/11/27/1646221">http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/11/27/1646221</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Visit that slashdot  URL (but actually any big page will work)  2. Use the double-finger trackpad gesture to scroll  3. Observe that framerate/lag is much worse on Chrome than Firefox        Chromes scrolling should feel at least as responsive as Firefoxs or better    which is the case on other platforms I've tried.        Scrolling feels laggy  like it's getting a significantly lower framerate than   Firefox. Bigger/more complicated pages fare worse.    I realize this is kind of poor/subjective  but it's the best description I can   give. This is on a 3 year old MacBook Pro. </pre>
