<title>Issue 31285 -   chromium -    download bar: invisible text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.276.0 (0)      1. install Chromium  2. (may not be needed:) install Ratchet + Clank theme  3. download something    Result:  The download bar appears  and the file downloads -- as expected.   Unfortunately  the file's name is invisible/blank. It just looks like a   200pixel bar with the file's icon and a dropdown menu  but the file's name   is invisible. </pre>
