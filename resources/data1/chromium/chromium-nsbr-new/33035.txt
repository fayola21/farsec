<title>Issue 33035 -   chromium -    Microsoft core web fonts displayed incorrectly on Snow Leopard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : any  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: correct      1. Snow Leopard machine upgrated from Leopard  2. Microsoft core web fonts (i.e. Arial  Verdana etc.) installed  3. Open any web page using those fonts (google.com for example)      Normal page output.      Garbaged output  all letters appear as boxed 'A'.    I've already checked <a title="[Snow Leopard] Upgrading Snow Leopard  from Leopard : Chrome shows gibberish text instead of website actual text" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11269"> issue #11269 </a> and tried a workaround with removing   font caches/stopping/starting font server. It doesn't help - the issue still   persists. So the only way to get it working is disabling Microsoft core web   fonts completely. </pre>
