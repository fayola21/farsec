<title>Issue 30113 -   chromium -    Extensions: Browser Action Icons reset on page navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25      1. Change the browser action icon using setIcon  2. Navigate to a new page  3. See the Icon reset to the default      Browser action icons should be sticky to the TAB  not sticky to the page.   If you set the browser action icon  it should not reset on a page   navigation. At the very least this behavior should be explicitly   configurable.    I expect Page Actions to be contextual to a page. Not Browser Actions.        We end up resorting to using a content script on page start (which can slow   down page loads) in order to make the browser action icon sticky.       </pre>
