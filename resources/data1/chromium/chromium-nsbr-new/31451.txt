<title>Issue 31451 -   chromium -    Plugin mouse events are wrong under resolution independence - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Resolution independence is a feature of OS X which allows users to scale   applications for high resolution and large screens (for example TVs).     Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43   URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://youtube.com">http://youtube.com</a>  OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): worse  controls not visible  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): same as Chrome  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Scale the Screen using &quot;Quartz Debug&quot; (part of the Apple Developer   Tools.    Quartz Debug &gt; Window &gt; UI Resolution &gt; 1.25  2. Restart Google Chrome  3. Visit youtube.com  4. Play a video. Notice that the flash controls are visible on the video  they   don't receive mouse clicks. This behaviour seems similar to Firefox. Safari   doesn't show the controls at all...        The controls should continue to work. The rest of the chrome UI and sites   seem to be rendered nicely.        The controls don't work. User can pree command-F for full screen as a   workaround.    This feature would set chrome apart as a useful browser on TV connected   macs. </pre>
