<title>Issue 28735 -   chromium -    Losing focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : Google Chrome	4.0.223.16 (Official Build 30555)                   WebKit	532.3                   V8	1.3.16.1                   User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1;   en-US) AppleWebKit/532.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.223.16 Safari/532.3             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Being in gmail  talking through google talk there.  2. Opening other programs/or chromes.(Notepad++ FileZilla Putty)  3. May be time dependent  usually happens when you stay there a lot.        Work with the browser normally.      Starts to switch between program tabs on the taskbar really fast  without   opening them and loses focus from the current window for about 1.5 seconds.  Even if you close all other programs it continues to do that  only way to   make it work better is to restart windows.     </pre>
