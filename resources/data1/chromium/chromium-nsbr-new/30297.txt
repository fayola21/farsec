<title>Issue 30297 -   chromium -    Page action popups don't work well with RTL languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome using --lang=he  2. Open a page action popup    Notice that the popup is anchored to the right side of the icon  even though   the language is RTL. This causes the popup to appear partially off-screen   when Chrome is full screen (see screenshot). </pre>
