<title>Issue 31206 -   chromium -    Histogram code needs to be cleaned up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many consumers are using LinearHistograms without any macro to  histogram enumerations. This use case should be supported by a nice  macro.    The setting of UMA flags should be mixed into the virtual construction   rather being done each time a sample is aggregated.    Code for the *HISTOGRAM_* macros needs to be simplified  with removal of   repetitious code. </pre>
