<title>Issue 37279 -   chromium -    Install of xmarks extension sometimes fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Click install on   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla</a>        Expected install dialog. On my system  only see install dialog about 50% of time. Other times  see   download UI  but it goes away without any dialog. Dirk Pranke reported this bug to me and he   never sees the dialog. I tested this on dev  but Dirk sees it on beta. I also tested in on Linux dev    and did not see it. I wasn't able to test on Windows.
