<title>Issue 36214 -   chromium -    mouse cursor and text selection borked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.330.0 (39077) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : any  Other browsers tested: tested against other GTK apps. they are all ok.      1. open a page  some times problem occur instantly  if not  to step 2  2. highlight some text  3. click on the page  4. move mouse around      cursor to change depending on target (e.g. hand for link/button  text for   input fields  arrow for anything else)      the cursor state is maintained for the next target. it only changes when   there's button activity (and the scroll count as buttons  as expected)    for example  if the cursor is an arrow  and it's now over a text field   (expected: text entry cursor) then only after a click or mouse wheel scroll   it will become the text entry cursor. then if you leave the input field and   go target a link  it will keep being a text entry cursor (expected: hand   cursor). after any button activity  then it becomes the hand cursor. and   stay that way until any other button activity. </pre>
