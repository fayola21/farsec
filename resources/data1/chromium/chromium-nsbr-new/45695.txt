<title>Issue 45695 -   chromium -    in-frame links launching in separate tab instead of target frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev on Ubuntu 10.4  x86/32  URLs (if applicable) : any JavaDoc-generated pages  e.g.   <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/</a>  This might apply to other frame-using sites  but i don't have any other   handy to test.          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Visit a JavaDoc-generated page.  2. Click any link in the left-side frames.          That the clicked page opens in the main (right-side) frame.          It opens all such clicks in a new tab.     </pre>
