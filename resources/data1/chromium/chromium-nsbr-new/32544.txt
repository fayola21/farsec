<title>Issue 32544 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar pop-up menus should toggle on successive clicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.0 (36495)    OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Click on a folder in the bookmark bar.  2.  Without moving the mouse  click again.      The popup menu listing the contents of the folder should disappear on the   second click (exhibit toggle behavior) as is the case in most Mac   applications with pop-up menus (e.g. Safari's bookmark bar  Activity   Monitor's filter pop-up and most search box recent searches pop-downs...   and many more).      The menu is displayed as if the folder had been clicked for the first time.   </pre>
