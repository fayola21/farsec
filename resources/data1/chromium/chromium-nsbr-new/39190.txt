<title>Issue 39190 -   chromium -    Advance widths get messed up when a font without ASCII coverage is used for complex script rendering - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was reported against Chrome OS ( <a href="http://crosbug.com/2162">http://crosbug.com/2162</a>)  but it's a   Linux Chrome issue.    Droid Sans Thai does not have any ASCII character covered except for space   (U+0020). Somehow  Chrome on Linux gets confused with metrics.     I suspected that it'd be the case only when the first font in the font list   is Droid Sans Thai (line 3 in the test case being attached)  but even when   a font covering the ASCII is put before Droid Sans Thai (line 4 and line   5)  the same thing happens.       Chrome on Windows does not have this issue.        </pre>
