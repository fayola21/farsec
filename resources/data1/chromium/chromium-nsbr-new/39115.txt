Launch Chrome  2. enter &quot;chrome://extensions/&quot; on the Ominibox  3. Install Extensions from &quot;Get more extensions...&quot; link  4. make sure the Extensions are latest version  5. disable the extensions with clicking &quot;Disable&quot; link  6. close the browser and reopen it  7. extensions &quot;Re-enable&quot; info bar appears impoperly.    What is the expected result?What happens instead?    It displays the &quot;newest version of extension requires more permisson&quot; info-  bar for those disabled extensions  but actually there is no new version   for these disabled extension  those infobar shows improperly.
