<title>Issue 42855 -   chromium -    Missing &quot;http://&quot; protocol in OmniBar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please check my browser information from this post. You'll see that it's  done with Firefox.    Until a few minutes ago  it would have been done with Chrome. However  with  <a title="URL bar no longer shows http://" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41467"> issue 41467 </a>  a broken &quot;feature&quot; was sent to me on my Ubuntu workstation   and I just installed it today. If I need to paste a URL to a friend in IM   or in IRC  or in email  or post it someplace else  I no longer get the  &quot;http:// in front of it. I now must type it manually.    I liked Chrome. I liked what it could do for speed. I liked using it. This  change broke how I used it.    I didn't want to switch to Firefox. I put up with daily restarts. I put up  with broken compatibility lists. I put up with quite a bit  because what I  got so outweighed the issues.    With this change  it finally went over the top. I've uninstalled Chrome  already  and am not at all interested in returning to it unless/until this  change is reversed.    I know you're not worried about market share with this browser  especially  since I saw the one comment from Peter Kastings(sp?) about how you doubt  this will drive people away from Chrome. Well  it has driven away at least  one person.    Good luck with your future development efforts. </pre>
