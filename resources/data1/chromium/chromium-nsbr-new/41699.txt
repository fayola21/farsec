<title>Issue 41699 -   chromium -    System-level toast not appearing on Vista or Win7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Run the steps to trigger the system-level toast on Vista or Win7 with   brand CHXX.  2.  No toast appears.  The toast processes are not present under any user.      Toast should appear.    This may be because the desktop name used to launch as an alternate user in   process_util_win.cc is always L&quot;&quot;.  Perhaps this should be NULL on Vista   and Win7 to attach to the correct windowstation?    * The toast works on XP.  * setup.exe --system-level-toast works.  * The code left in client is &quot;TM80&quot;  which indidcates it hit the code path   to relaunch setup.    Ping me for more details. </pre>
