<title>Issue 43002 -   chromium -    Translator: Languages dropdown list should not appear below the cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. open some website that needs translation  for example   <a href="http://www.jambonetwork.com/blog/?p=13429">http://www.jambonetwork.com/blog/?p=13429</a>  2. open the languages list in the bar (thinking you know better what   language is showing ;) )      many times  doing this simple action actually changes the selected language   for me.  the menu should not open behind the cursor because it often triggers   accidental clicks on the menu.    same thing goes for the &quot;This page has been translated from &lt;languages   list&gt; to &lt;languages list&gt;&quot; var state.    bug inspired by Ben's &quot;Don't position menu underneath the mouse.&quot; comment   in  <a title="widget-anchored dropdown menus should not open under the cursor" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15443"> Issue 15443 </a> . </pre>
