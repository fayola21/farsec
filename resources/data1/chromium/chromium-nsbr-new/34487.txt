<title>Issue 34487 -   chromium -    in History  tab close time should be shown as timestamp  not page open time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78    Currently  pages are recorded in history based on when a page was opened  not   when closed.    But when researching a topic with dozens of tabs  it frequently helps to know   which of the tabs were closed last (and yes  how much time the paged remained   open at in focus)--and therefore page close time is more helpful than page   open timestamp. </pre>
