<title>Issue 33480 -   chromium -    Chrome gets stuck at &quot;Setup in progress...&quot; when sync bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   At first I noticed that all my newly added bookmarks from Chrome (Linux)   shown in Google Docs  but didn't appear in Chrome (Windows).    Then  I tried to delete all personal folders of Chrome (Windows)  and   reinstalled it. But when I did sync bookmarks again  Chrome gets stuck at   &quot;Setup in progress...&quot;  and the login window of &quot;Sync my bookmarks&quot; shown   there for hours. If I forced to close the login window  &quot;Bookmark manager&quot;   shows &quot;Sync Error&quot;.    Later  I also did same test on Chrome (Linux) after cleaning up all   personal folders. Unluckily  the same &quot;Setup in progress...&quot; problem .      Chrome bookmarks should be synced successfully.
