<title>Issue 34728 -   chromium -    Chrome js-debuger errors log - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.02    1. Open some page with form. On form onsubmit set some function which is   not exist like &lt;form onsubmit=&quot;return someFunction()&quot; &gt;  2. Submit form.  3. Form will reaload the page as it should but you can't see the error in   js-console. Just flash of red text line and then it disappear because the   page was reloaded.       I have expected to see the error text.      Text appears and disappers it one moment. You can see only the flash and   can't read it. And there is no way how to see what kind of error was it. It   will be nice if there was some checkbox that will allow to disable clearing   of console.     </pre>
