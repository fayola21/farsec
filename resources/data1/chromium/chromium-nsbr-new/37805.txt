<title>Issue 37805 -   chromium -    download bar: cannot view url of downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit the &quot;Download Google Chrome&quot; page -- which very ironically  is the   worst offending site for this bug I could find  2. Download Google Chrome  3. Attempt to find the url you downloaded it from      The expected result is that the user knows where their files are downloaded   from. Opening history does not reveal downloaded files. On Firefox  one   could just get info on the file by right-clicking on it in the download   manager. This has security benefits. My particular use case is I need to   know the URL so I can wget it on a laptop without a browser. </pre>
