<title>Issue 31588 -   chromium -    Cache under ~/.config not ~/.cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34537">r34537</a>    I went to backup my Chrome config and noticed the gigantic Cache directory   is stuck under ~/.config rather than ~/.cache; this is inconvenient and   defeats the purpose of the separation.  I haven't checked  but I guess   XDG_CACHE_HOME is not honored either.  I'm not sure what Thumbnails is  but   I suspect it should go in XDG_CACHE_HOME as well. </pre>
