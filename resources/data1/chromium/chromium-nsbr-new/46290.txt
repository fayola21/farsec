<title>Issue 46290 -   chromium -    Navigating from NTP to about:version crashes in --process-per-tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chrome with --process-per-tab  2. Get to a tab showing the new tab page  3. Type &quot;about:version&quot; into the Omnibox and hit enter.        Should go to about:version  but it crashes instead.    The crash occurs because about:version (and other about: URLs) are not treated as DOM UI URLs  but the process-per-tab logic is assigning them to the NTP's DOM UI renderer. </pre>
