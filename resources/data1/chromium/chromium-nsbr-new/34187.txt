<title>Issue 34187 -   chromium -    Video problems on linux (not just flash) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a page with a video on it  or a flash animation.  2. Start the playback        See the video.        The following doesn't always happen--  In the case of youtube videos: just a white or sometimes black box.    In the case of <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">http://jilion.com/sublime/video</a> (an HTML5 player  no flash!)   only the thin horizontal bar formerly occupied by the play controls gets   refreshed video  the rest is black.    After browser window scroll or sometimes resize  things usually go back to   working.    Going fullscreen also works  though high bitrate video coming from the   browser is very choppy for me in fullscreen. Usually when going back from   fullscreen  another window event is needed for the windowed player to show   content.    This doesn't only happen with videos; some flash games etc. also exhibit   this. Sometimes.    <b>Please provide
