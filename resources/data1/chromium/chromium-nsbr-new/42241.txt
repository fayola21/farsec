<title>Issue 42241 -   chromium -    dragData is never cleared in JS Bookmark Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) Drag some random text (not from a URL field) from a text editor over the &quot;Other bookmarks&quot;   folder in the tree.  Notice that nothing happens  and there is no drop target highlight.  2) Start a drag of one of the folders or bookmarks in the bookmark bar.  You can drop it   anywhere  it doesn't need to actually make a change. (You can also do this by dragging a   bookmark from safari over the JS BMM).  3) Repeat step 1.  Notice that &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; now gets highlighted even though we have   nothing to drop.  It will throw a NOTREACHED on debug builds if you drop it there.    When we start to drag a bookmark over the JS BMM  it sets a dragData object in the JS.  This is   the drag data used for all the ondrag*  ondrop calls.  The code tries to clear this dragData in   dragEnd so that when a non bookmark object is dragged over the BMM it doesn't think it can   drop it anywhere  but this is never called for 2 reasons.    1) since we preventDefault on the dragStart event  dragEnd is never called.  2) Drag end would never be called anyway if the drag in step 2 originated from another app.   </pre>
