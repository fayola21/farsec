<title>Issue 40527 -   chromium -    geolocation: multiple prompts from same origin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open a page that makes multiple geolocation requests in parallel (only tested on a site that   makes each request from different embedded frame)  2. answer infobar prompts (or dismiss)0      each request causes it's own (serialized) infobar prompt  each repeating the same question  should only ask once per domain (perhaps  unless the infobar was dismissed without answering)    --  In the geolocation permission context  as each infobar request comes to the front of the queue   we should re-query if the question has already been answered.  and/or whenever an infobar is answered  we should cancel  / dismiss all pending infobar requests   (across all tabs) which are pending for the same query (prob. easiest done if the permission   context is made into a unique instance (identity) object.) </pre>
