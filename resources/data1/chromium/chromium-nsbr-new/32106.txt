<title>Issue 32106 -   chromium -    Pinning running instance of chrome does not generate correct shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run chrome with &quot;enable-udd-profiles&quot;  2. New a browser window from non-default profile;  3. Pin this browser window of the non-default profile    What is the expected output?  The pinned shortcut should have correct &quot;user-data-dir&quot; argument.    What do you see instead?  The pinned shortcut has the original chrome command line which does not   have the correct &quot;user-data-dir&quot; argument.    This could be fixed by setting the following property for browser window:  System.AppUserModel.RelaunchCommand  System.AppUserModel.RelaunchDisplayNameResource   </pre>
