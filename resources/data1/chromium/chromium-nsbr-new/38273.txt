<title>Issue 38273 -   chromium -    AppCache: Migrate to the DiskCache's async interface - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="Disk cache: issue only asynchronous IO requests."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26730">issue 26730</a>. That involves replacing the synchronous interface that's   currently used by the appcache with a fully async interface. The new   programming interface is (mostly) in place now  so we can switch over.   </pre>
