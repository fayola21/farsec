<title>Issue 32460 -   chromium -    HTML5 - Playing audio or video files (embed with &lt;audio&gt; / &lt;video&gt; tag) doesn't function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.295.0  Webkit: 532.8  V8: 2.0.5.5    Related URL(s): <a href="http://www.dradio.de/wir/ogg/">http://www.dradio.de/wir/ogg/</a> (sorry  but it's in German)      It should start to play (there are livestreams on this site) if I press the   'Play' button in the player (of Chrome) for the embedded audio files (HTML5   embedded by &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tag).      It doesn't start  I only see the player in an idle mode.  Even when I press 'Play' or 'Pause' in the contextmenu  there doesn't   happen anything. It seems to be a problem caused by the engine itself or by   the communication between Chrome and IE (I'm using Internet Explorer 8).     </pre>
