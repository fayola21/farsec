<title>Issue 24553 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar renders over page leaving a gray empty spot where it should be. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28160)  WebKit	532.2  V8	1.3.13.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.2 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.221.8 Safari/532.2    URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Opened Chrome for the first time ever  2. Choose to import from Firefox (It pulls a couple bookmarks over)  3. Opened a new tab and went to google. I also deleted one of the   bookmarks but I don't know if either of these steps caused it.  4. Noticed the render error. A &quot;save this password&quot; bar finally reset the   position of the bar.     </pre>
