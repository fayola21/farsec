<title>Issue 25737 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.create closes popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    chrome.tabs.create triggered from within a Browser Action popup window opens   a new tab  but also closes the popup window.    I suggest to only close the popup window when an area outside of it is   clicked  as currently implemented  and with a special function. </pre>
