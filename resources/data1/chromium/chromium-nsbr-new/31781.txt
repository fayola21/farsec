<title>Issue 31781 -   chromium -    mouse pointer hovers download bar arrow context menu CANCEL entry by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 33928)        1. start downloading sth. to bring up the download bar  2. Left-click the arrow of an object that is downloading in the bar and   release the mouse button immediately without moving the mouse pointer  3. The download gets cancelled  and worse there is no way to resume it.  Already downloaded content is lost.      A mouse button release should not activate a context menu entry  OR  the context menu should appear in such a way that the pointer does _not_   hover an entry OR  a different  less harmful entry (i.e. not the CANCEL entry) gets hovered   by default on menu appearance.        The context menu appears so that the mouse pointer does hover the CANCEL   entry  and activates the entry upon button release     </pre>
