<title>Issue 29351 -   chromium -    Capture as much information in renderer OOM crashes as possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Out of memory crash reports can be pretty difficult to debug as the crashing   callstack does not provide much insight into what sort of objects are in the   heap.  We should be collecting as much information as possible in our   OnNoMemory handler and putting it in the stack  much like V8 did in   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=3406">http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=3406</a>.    To start  we should grab the size of the V8 heap  resource caches  and the   allocation class information displayed in about:tcmalloc. </pre>
