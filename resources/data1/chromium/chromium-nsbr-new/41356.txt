<title>Issue 41356 -   chromium -    UI nits around enabling incognito for extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. The text &quot;Allow extension to run in incognito&quot; is pretty long. Shorten to   &quot;Allow in incognito&quot;    2. The dialog that pops up is pretty abrasive. It would be nicer to have a   yellow text passively displayed after clicking &quot;allow in incognito&quot;. The   text should only show in the same pageview as the checkmark is checked  not   every time after that. </pre>
