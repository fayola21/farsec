Pause on a breakpoint and inspect local variables.  3. Choose inspect element on one the variables in a ScopeView(second instance   of DevTools will open).  4. Look at the listeners section.    What is the expected output?  'mousedown'  'click'  'dblclick' listeners should be present    What do you see instead?  No listeners(see attachment).   </pre>
