<title>Issue 30718 -   chromium -    bookmark should be accessable by clicking under omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> You should be able to open the bookmark bar by clicking in the blue strip   below the omnibox but above the page. If we get the effects just right it   would be a intuitive feature.     We should probably create a close button on the bookmark bar as well. </pre>
