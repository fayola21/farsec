<title>Issue 23615 -   chromium -    GMail chat notifications mess up Window menu entries on MacOS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.1 (Official Build 26852)  URLs (if applicable) : GMail with Talk  OS version               : 10.5.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works normally  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works normally  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Open multiple GMail windows  start a chat session  2. Wait for an incoming message to turn a chat mole orange  3. Look at Window menu        All entries in the Window menu should show the same titles as before    except that the gmail windows should have their name blinking  alternating   with &quot;XXX says ...&quot;        The window menu starts displaying the wrong titles for the various   windows. In particular  as you scroll focus up and down the menu  window   titles jump around. It's a bit like the behaviour you get with bash when you   shrink the xterm and it's confused about the window size; scrolling forward   and backward through the current line causes one set of text to be   displayed as you're moving forward  and an offset version of the text to   replace it as you scroll backwards.    Any window entries *prior* to the first blinking gmail window show up   correctly  and are stable as you scroll up and down. (Or possibly  any   windows prior to the window *before* the first blinking gmail window? It's   a little unclear). After that  it goes haywire. </pre>
