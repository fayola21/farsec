<title>Issue 27884 -   chromium -    Opening a URL with a mimetype of application/json will download a file and open it in wine notepad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit URL (for example <a href="http://www.mimeapi.org/api/mime?file=test.txt">http://www.mimeapi.org/api/mime?file=test.txt</a>)  2. The file is now downloaded as 'mime' (no extension).  3. Click the file in the download bar  it is opened with 'notepad'. On my   system this opens it with the 'notepad' installed by wine.    It would be nice if we could display JSON files in the browser (as if they   were plaintext).                <b>Please provide
