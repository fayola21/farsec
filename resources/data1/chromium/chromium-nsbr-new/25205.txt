Select some rich text and copy it  2. Click in another rich text field (e.g.  a Gmail compose window)  3. Paste the text  4. The text retains the original formatting  and does not match the   formatting of the document its being pasted into.        I should have the ability paste the text and have it match the style of the   text around it.        The text retains the original formatting  which never looks good.   </pre>
