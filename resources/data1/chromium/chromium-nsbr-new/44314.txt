<title>Issue 44314 -   chromium -    HTML5 audio volume attribute ignored on cloned DOM node - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac OS X 5.0.375.38  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/YQ79B/">http://jsfiddle.net/YQ79B/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open the jsfiddle link above.  2. Open the chrome developer console to see the debug output.  3. Click the &quot;Click to run test&quot; button in the bottom right pane.  4. Read the code comments to understand what's happening.        The volume attribute set on the cloned HTMLAudioElement for the female voice (snd2) is 0.0  but   it still outputs at full volume. No matter what volume is set on a cloned node before play  it still   outputs at full volume  even if the volume is set AFTER the clone. </pre>
