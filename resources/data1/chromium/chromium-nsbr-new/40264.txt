<title>Issue 40264 -   chromium -    ProfileSyncService accessed from non-UI thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The ProfileSyncService  as written  is intended for use on the UI thread   only.  However  some of the ModelAssociators and ChangeProcessors retain a   pointer to the ProfileSyncService: both directly  as well as via the   UnrecoverableErrorHandler interface.  These accesses are not safe if they   happen e.g. from the Autofill datatype controller  which lives on the DB   thread. </pre>
