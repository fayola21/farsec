<title>Issue 39670 -   chromium -    Search bug - Jumps to top of page on click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click on page  that list a long list of events (cant provide url)  2. Use chrome search (CTRL+F) to find the event I need. It works it marks   it.  3. When I then click it  the page suddenly 'scroll/jumps' up to top  so   when the click is fired I actually hit an event in top of list  instead of   the one i clicked way down.    I'v found that if I scroll after having found the result  it works and I'm   able to click the link.. Annoying as the page is one I use at work :=)                <b>Please provide
