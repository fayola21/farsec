<title>Issue 42544 -   chromium -    Way too much CPU wake ups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (43360) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : doesn't matter          Firefox 3.x:OK          1.start chromium  2.look at powertop    Chromium causes way too much CPU wakeups. Chromium wakes up the CPU 217 times   per second and makes more CPU load balancing necessary  too. All in all it   makes the CPU staying in C4 state 77.3 % of the time  only  which is very   bad. As you can see firefox doesn't even appear in the list of processes   waking up the CPU when idling. The CPU stays in the C4 state for 97.2% of the   time  which is quite decent.    I' using chromium 5.0.342.9 (43360) Ubuntu from the ubuntu repo under ubuntu   10.4 lucid lynx beta2. The screenshots are from my netbook Asus 1001p (Intel   Atom N450  1 GB RAM). But I experience the same on my thinkpad T61 notebook   running the same linux.   </pre>
