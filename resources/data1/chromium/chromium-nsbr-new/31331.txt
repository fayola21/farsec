<title>Issue 31331 -   chromium -    Options dialog should use dom ui (display in a tab) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.266.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33992">r33992</a>  OS + version : KKK ~ Kubuntu Karmic Koala  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : KDE 4.3  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): N/A    Feature Request:  (Since there is no template for feature requests  I guess this is sort of a bug ^_^)     The Bookmark Manager  and Chrome's Options Dialog should be implemented as a chrome:// style page instead of   a popup dialog page. As an example  the chrome://extensions/ page is very well formatted and easy to use. In   stark contrast  the Bookmark Manager is very much like Firefox's bookmark manager  but it could be written   with a much nicer  clean  Google-esk minimalistic interface that is accessible via a new chrome:// tab.   Ideally  bookmarks in this new style page would be drag and drop-able in the DOM. Similarly  the Options   dialog is very messy and even has scroll bars on one of the pages. It could be implemented much better as a   chrome:// page where all the options could conceivably be built into one page or as tabs like the interface   on the Google Code site.    I realize that both of what I'm asking for here are major changes  but I did read that Google envisions   breaking Chrome down successively into smaller and smaller pieces  and recursively re-writing the entire   application a number of times over. I think this would be a step in that direction  and greatly improve the   UI experience of chrome. Perhaps this could also rollover into Chrome-OS as well  as popup dialog pages   shouldn't be needed there. </pre>
