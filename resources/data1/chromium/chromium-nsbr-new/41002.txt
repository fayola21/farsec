<title>Issue 41002 -   chromium -    AutoFill doesn't prevent two addresses (or credit cards) from having the same label - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a problem because the default value is tracked by label.    Repro:  1. Open AutoFill prefs  2. Create two addresses  give them the same label  3. Click the default button on one    Both get checked as &quot;default&quot;.    This is certainly happening on the Mac  and while GTK might not have the  same checkbox issue  it's AFAIK not preventing the duplicate label. </pre>
