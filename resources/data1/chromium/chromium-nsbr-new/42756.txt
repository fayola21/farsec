<title>Issue 42756 -   chromium -    Chromium is attemping to use old dll folder and failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Win7 x64  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45808">r45808</a> (5.0.392.0)    For some reason when I run as a standard user under UAC  chromium fails to   run.  Procmon shows it is attempting to load dlls from   AppDataLocalChromiumApplication5.0.387.0 even though the current version   (and folder) is 5.0.392.0.  However  chromium runs fine when running as admin   -- it correctly loads the dlls from the current folder (5.0.392.0).    HKCUSoftwareChromiumpv == &quot;5.0.392.0&quot;.  Where is chromium getting the   reference to 5.0.387.0?  Internally? </pre>
