<title>Issue 27835 -   chromium -    Add update notification to NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We recently ran into a sync issue where several thousand people were still using an old version of   the developer channel. This might be because they haven't restarted their browser or because   they built Chromium from source.    I suggest adding a large-ish notification to the new tab page when there's been an update   available for more than ~5 days. Most people will restart their browser every few days  so we   don't need to nag these people.    For critical security updates  we could show this notification right away. For significant updates    we could link to a &quot;What's new&quot; page.    Additional suggestion from Brian: We should even consider force restarting during idle periods   (with a notification and countdown so people can stop it if they happen to come back to their   computer and want to stop it.  </pre>
