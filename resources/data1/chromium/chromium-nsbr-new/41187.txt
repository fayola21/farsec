<title>Issue 41187 -   chromium -    Read IE registry settings to control Kerberos SPN generation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome uses two command line flags to control Kerberos SPN generation with   the Negotiate/SPNEGO authentication scheme.    On Windows builds  Chrome should also read the values of some registry   settings which IE uses for non-standard SPN generation approaches  so it   will work the same without configuration (and the command lines could   override if explicitly set).    --auth-negotiate-use-alias indicates that the SPN should consist of the   host name listed in the URL  not the DNS canonical name for the host. By   default the canonical name is used  which mirrors IE and Firefox. IE6 and   IE7 after hotpatches use registry setting   FEATURE_USE_CNAME_FOR_SPN_KB911149 to control the behavior  as specified in     <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911149">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911149</a>    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938305">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938305</a>    --auth-negotiate-use-port indicates that non-standard ports should be added   to the SPN. Firefox never appears to add a port  and IE does not by   default. The registry key FEATURE_INCLUDE_PORT_IN_SPN_KB908209 overrides   behavior on a hotpatched IE6  and standard IE7  IE8.
