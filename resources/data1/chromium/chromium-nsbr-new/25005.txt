Application has to be force quit.    Observed in:  4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)    After a couple hours of use  with about 10 tabs open  my Gmail tab stopped   painting.  Clicking the tab title (not the close button) caused the tab to close.    Then clicking on other tabs closed them.  Finally  I was left with a browser   window that had no tabs.  The Chrome menu was not responsive.  I had to   force quit to get out. </pre>
