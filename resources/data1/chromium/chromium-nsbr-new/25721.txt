<title>Issue 25721 -   chromium -    not play nicely with wordpress.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;            1. Go to a personal blog at <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">http://www.wordpress.com</a>  2. In the user control panel  click COMMENTS -- where you go to edit   comments  3. The WordPress required you to enter password. Even when you enter   password  it can't get through.  4. BTW  on Firefox and other browsers  clicking COMMENTS would not   provoke a password request             </pre>
