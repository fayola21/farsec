<title>Issue 24320 -   chromium -    Casual user  list of bugs: Local html files  dialog box  clipboard access  CPU eating - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Opening local html files does nothing but change focus to Chromium.    Attachment dialog box on Gmail disappeared  then doubled  then became   unresponsive.    Website clipboard access doesn't seem to work  which is a problem when   using Skitch.    Every so often  a Chromium helper process decides to take up 99% of my CPU   when doing practically nothing. (Just had gDocs open)    Sorry for not formatting this properly  but I'm kind of busy and thought I   could help a little bit. </pre>
