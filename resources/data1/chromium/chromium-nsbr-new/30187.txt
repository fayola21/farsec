<title>Issue 30187 -   chromium -    Chrome Mac seems to leak defunct &quot;ps&quot; processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    Over time  chrome seems to spawn &quot;ps&quot; processes that do not get reaped.    After enough time (2-3 days?) there are so many processes that no more   can be created  and I must restart:    14:41 symbolism:~ [12] ps -ef | grep '(ps)' | grep -v grep | wc -l         8  16:45 symbolism:~ [16] ps -ef | grep '(ps)' | grep -v grep | wc -l        14  21:33 symbolism:~ [18] ps -ef | grep '(ps)' | grep -v grep | wc -l        22    I restarted Chrome earlier today and already have 22 defunct ps processes   :&lt; </pre>
