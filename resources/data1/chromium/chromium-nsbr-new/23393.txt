<title>Issue 23393 -   chromium -    Consider changing ipc_channel_impl to use IOBuffer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From the histogram of AsyncIO.IPCChannelClose (2.0.172.39)   [7_days/2009.08.07-2009.08.13]  we have:    Cutoff	Value	Min Avg	~Avg	Max Avg  50.00%	0.51	0.00	0.00	0.00  70.00%	0.71	0.00	0.00	0.00  90.00%	0.91	0.00	0.00	0.00  95.00%	0.96	0.00	0.00	0.00  98.00%	0.99	0.00	0.00	0.00  99.00%	1.03	0.00	0.00	0.00  99.50%	1.47	0.01	0.01	0.01  99.90%	1.95	0.01	0.01	0.01  99.99%	43.52	0.01	0.01	0.01  99.999%	425.7	0.02	0.02	0.03  99.9999%  2694	0.03	0.03	0.03    In other words  almost always we block for just a few milliseconds  but a   few times we end up blocking for even a few seconds. I don't believe this   is a source of jankiness though  given that it should be imperceptible for   99.99 of the cases we actually block (we don't record the times that we   don't block).    We could avoid waiting by changing the ipc code to use IOBuffers and   detaching part of the object when the channel closes. I haven't looked at   how much code would have to change. </pre>
