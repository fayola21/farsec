<title>Issue 42132 -   chromium -    Add startup and shutdown with sync enabled performance tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should start to monitor the impact that a sync enabled browser has on   startup and shutdown.  The current tests are in chrome/test/startup (build   target is startup_tests) and you can see the results of these tests on   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/waterfall?</a>  builder=Chromium%20XP in the &quot;startup_test&quot; box.    The way this test appears to work is that it launches the browser using a   pre-made profile that has been checked in chrome/test/data  then invoking   the UI test to start and stop the browser while keeping track of the time.    I think we do the same thing to test sync.    So I think we could set up a profile in   chrome/test/data/sync/profiles/startstop that has sync enabled with 10 or   so bookmarks  and then add to the exiting startup and shutdown tests to   test the browser with this profile.    In the future  it might be nice to have our own perf test that measures the    time that it takes to start the browser until we are fully synced.   </pre>
