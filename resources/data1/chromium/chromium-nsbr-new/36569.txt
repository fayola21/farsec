<title>Issue 36569 -   chromium -    Image sizes in multiple tabs are displayed with the same zoom ratio - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): As expected (in 4.x at least)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): As expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: As expected      1. Open two or more images in multiple tabs (not images embedded in pages; just   plain images).  2. With one image window open  press Cmd-+ or Cmd-- to resize the image  3. Change tabs to another of the images and observe that all tabs have the same   zoom level.    Note that this is independent of the zooming done by clicking the image (which   simply scales to fit or to actual pixel size  these sizes being modified by the   zoom levels set with Cmd-+/-).  The click-to-zoom works fine.      When one tab's zoom level is changed  the others should not change at the same   time.      All tabs with images keep the same zoom level. </pre>
