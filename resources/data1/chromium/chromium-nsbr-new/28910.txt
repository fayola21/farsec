<title>Issue 28910 -   chromium -    Password saving on sites with different onsubmit handlers doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some sites  such as LiveJournal.com  have javascript that listens for   submit events and clears the text in the password field and sets an MD5   (etc) challenge response in a hidden field on the page. example JS found:        var pass = pass_field.value;      var chal = chal_field.value;      var res = MD5(chal + MD5(pass));      resp_field.value = res;      pass_field.value = &quot;&quot;;  // dont send clear-text password!    This gets processed before the WebCore::FrameLoader is told to submit the   form  which makes sense because the intent is that the form being submitted   doesn't contain the clear text password.  Since we listen for   'willSubmitForm' events  by the time this event bubbles up to the password   manager layer  the password field is empty.    I'm filing this as Area-Webkit  because to fix this we need to come up with   a different way at the glue layer of grabbing the password field value.  I   don't know what else is available at the moment  short of watching input to   the fields when we detect a password form is present.  We already do this   for password autocomplete once we have determined we have data to autofill. </pre>
