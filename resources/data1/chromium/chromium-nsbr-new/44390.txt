<title>Issue 44390 -   chromium -    Slow Mouse and Drag Scrolling when CSS3 abilities used in combo with fixed positions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac 5.0.375.29 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.screened.com/forums">http://www.screened.com/forums</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OK      1. Login to screened (l/p: chrome/chrome) and view the above url.  2. Scroll down on the page.  3. Must be logged in to view fixed position bar and replicate.      Scrolling should be smooth.      Scrolling is extremely slow in Mac Chrome only.    Other notes:  This only happens in the Mac version of chrome  not Windows Chrome   Firefox  IE or Safari.    Removing certain webkit CSS3 abilities such as rounded corners (of which  there is a decent amount on that page) will fix the problem. Also  removal  of the fixed position bar at the bottom of the page (which can be seen when  logged out of the site) will also remove the problem.    I've specifically tried to remove other individual parts of the html page  (the header  the menu...etc) but will still always see extremely slow  scrolling unless one of those two things are removed so I don't think it's  an additive property of too many uses of individual properties like  box-shadows.    I can't replicate this on other parts of our site and seems to be tied  specifically to pages that use z-indexs and where that fixed position bar  is displayed. Tried searching for broken tags as well but everything seems  normal. Also note that slow scrolling only happens at the top and bottom of  the document. Have also tried disabling JS to combat problem but that  didn't seem to work. Seems to be something with the HTML or CSS.   </pre>
