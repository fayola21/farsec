<title>Issue 31070 -   chromium -    Window automatically resizes to fit content height - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit the urls above (it also happens in Google Reader with a large   number of unread items)        What is the expected result?  Website should open and window should stay   the same size.          Window resizes larger to try and fit content.  This window only seems to   resize larger  never smaller.  The window also seems to have some sort of   minimum size.  It will not always let me resize it back to normal.  This   seems to depend on the website  some have this problem others seems to let   me resize it back to normal.    <b>Please provide
