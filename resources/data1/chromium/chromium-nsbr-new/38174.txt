<title>Issue 38174 -   chromium -    would be nice if InotifyReader wasn't a singleton - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the linux version of FileWatcher  InotifyReader is a singleton.  It would be   nice if we had one less global and this wasn't a singleton.    It's currently a singleton because it simplifies the ownership of the class   (otherwise  it's app specific on when to instantiate it and delete it soon   enough).    It also simplifies some thread safety issues by using ChromeThread.  If it were   more general purpose  we would probably want to remove this usage as well.   </pre>
