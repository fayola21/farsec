<title>Issue 25972 -   chromium -    Unable to play very short audio files using JavaScript - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    Using this code snippet:    var audio = new Audio(&quot;<a href="http://www.example.com/wrap.mp3&quot;);">http://www.example.com/wrap.mp3&quot;);</a>    audio.play();  there is no sound.      The wrap noise plays.      There is no sound.    Additionally  if I made a page that embeds it using the audio tag  the  behavior is unreliable. Sometimes it doesn't play at all  other times I  hear the wrap noise twice.    Using wrap2.mp3 instead  there is sound; if I embed wrap2.mp3  it behaves  correctly. The only difference here is the length - it seems like Chromium  is unable to play very short sound samples. </pre>
