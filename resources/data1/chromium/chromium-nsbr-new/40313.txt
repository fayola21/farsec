<title>Issue 40313 -   chromium -    New tab page thumbnail not displayed (Thumbnails db corruption) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Crtl+T          The thumbnails reflect most used pages  or something like that.          Only two thumbnails have images and links  for   <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/welcome.html">http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/welcome.html</a> and   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>    This started right after my last 'yum update'  probably from the previous   google-chrome-unstable version. There is a lot of browsing history in this   profile  which still shows up in other places  except in the thumbnails.    Doing more browsing doesn't improve the situation. Only these two   thumbnails appear. The other 6 are blank.      <b>Please provide
