<title>Issue 33969 -   chromium -    Feature request: Easier ability to select JavaScript file in debugger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The JS debugger in Chrome is pretty painful to use when compared to  FireBug  which is the only reason I don't switch browsers.  For example  it  is much easier to select a JS file in FireBug.  In FireBug you can open the  dropdown and start typing the name of the file you want to select  and it  will do a search for that file removing others from the list.  Chrome  really needs to copy FireBug's behavior here.  I regularly debug pages with  hundreds of JS files included and it's very difficult to find the one I  want to open using Chrome.   </pre>
