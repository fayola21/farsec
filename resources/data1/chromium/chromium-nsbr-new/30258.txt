<title>Issue 30258 -   chromium -    extension pages do not support Java - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.30 Safari/532.5  Other browsers tested: only relevant for chrome      1. Create an extension using the attached files  and then load it.  2. Click on the green leaf icon that appears to open the popup.  3. Notice that &quot;applet:&quot; and &quot;done with applet&quot; are visible.  4. However  the Java applet class that draws &quot;hello world!&quot; is not visible   in the popup window.  5. Open popup_test.html in Chrome. You'll see the &quot;hello world!&quot; applet   displayed on the web page. Thus  the applet works in a regular chrome   window  but does not work in a popup window. Similarly  I don't think Java   works in the extension background html file  either.      The Java program should show up in the popup window.      There is a blank space where the Java program should be.   </pre>
