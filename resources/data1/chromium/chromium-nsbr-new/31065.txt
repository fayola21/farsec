<title>Issue 31065 -   chromium -    Main &quot;Browser&quot; task won't exit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I'm not sure how to reproduce the problem - but once in this state it will   be stuck this way until I kill the process.  1. Open some browser windows  2. ... time passes (days usually) ...  3. For whatever reason I decide to close out all my browser windows (not   tabs  windows)  4. Attempt to close the browser window  nothing happens.    At this point I know the main chrome &quot;Browser&quot; process will never exit w/o   a &quot;kill -9&quot;    After the &quot;hang&quot; I will be able to close all the tabs  (Chrome's Task   Manager window will display only &quot;Browser&quot; in its list)  but there will   remain a single window open with one &quot;empty tab&quot; displaying a completely   white page and whatever the previous webpage's title was will remain on the   one open tab (usually gmail for me because I leave it open all the time).    Attempting to do tool-menu -&gt; exit or shift-ctrl-Q will not exit the   program either. Nothing but a &quot;kill -9&quot; will end the process.      That Chrome will close out its process and exit normally.      Chrome will hang and be unable to exit    <b>Please provide
