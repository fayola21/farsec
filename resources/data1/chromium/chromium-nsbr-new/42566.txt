<title>Issue 42566 -   chromium -    Provide toggle option for users to control display of extension's icon instead of using the resize grabber - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.9 Safari/533.2      1. Install and enable a plugin that places an icon next to the URL bar   (&quot;Quick Bookmarks&quot; and &quot;UnTiny&quot; both meet this)  2. Look at the icon to the right of the URL bar  3. Cringe at the lines inexplicably surrounding it      Perhaps one soft line to separate the extension from the page and tools menus while maintaining   the clean minimalism of chrome.      Two garish lines appear to the left of the icon for no clear reason.   </pre>
