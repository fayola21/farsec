<title>Issue 30508 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame is not uploading data via UMA - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the file chrome_frame_automation.cc has the following code:      // The metrics bug out because they attempt to use URLFetcher with a    // null URLRequestContext::default_request_context_. Turn them off for   now.    // TODO(robertshield): Figure out why this is. It appears to have   something    // to do with an improperly set up profile...    command_line-&gt;AppendSwitch(switches::kDisableMetrics);    As a result  the chromium binary will not send any UMA data  even after the   user opts-in to allow it.             </pre>
