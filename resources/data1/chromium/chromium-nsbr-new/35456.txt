<title>Issue 35456 -   chromium -    Can open tabs/windows using the keyboard shortcuts while infobubble is in focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.322.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38504">r38504</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1. Open multiple tabs in Chrome.  2. Install a packaged extension. Verify the InfoBubble is shown  with the   install icon and some description.  3. Try opening a new tab using the keyboard shortcut (cmd-T).    Expected:  Nothing happens.    Actual:  New tab opens up.    Note:  1. We cannot close tabs while infobubble is in focus using the keyboard   shortcuts.  2. On windows we can neither open nor close tabs when the infobubble is   in focus.   </pre>
