<title>Issue 36833 -   chromium -    &quot;Did you mean&quot; infobar shouldn't show for email address search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I wanted to search for a hotmail address. I typed &quot;foo@hotmail.com&quot; into my   omnibox and pressed return.    I got a search  but also got a &quot;did you mean&quot; infobar asking me if I meant to   go to &quot;http://foo@hotmail.com    The &quot;did you mean&quot; should be smarter. Yes  technically  foo@hotmail.com   could me a username login into a website  but the user obviously doesn't   mean that and it shouldn't be suggested. </pre>
