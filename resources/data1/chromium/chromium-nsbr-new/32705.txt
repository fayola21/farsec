<title>Issue 32705 -   chromium -    generated Makefile should handle CFLAGS in a different way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : svn rev 36529    While crosscompiling $CXX is used to compile for target  and g++ is used to   compile for the building machine. CXXFLAGS are applied to both CXX.host and   CXX.target which causes problems for example with include directories   (usr/include/asm look differently for different machines). This applies to   CFLAGS and LDFLAGS as well.    Suggested solution: alter Makefile generation process so that it creates   different Makefile according to the attached patch.     </pre>
