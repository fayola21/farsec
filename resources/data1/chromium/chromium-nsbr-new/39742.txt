<title>Issue 39742 -   chromium -    youtube : performance issue on using internal flash plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897) beta  Launch chrome with internal flash plugin parameter (adobe flash already   disabled)      1. Go to youtube video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw</a>  2. Click on icon to show video in full screen mode  3. Hit esc to return to normal mode    What is the expected output?   no performance issue    What do you see instead?  On clicking icon for full screen  it takes few seconds to launch chrome in   full screen mode. On hitting esc  for few seconds video doesn't play and   control bar (for play  pause etc..) is not seen.         </pre>
