<title>Issue 26548 -   chromium -    bzip2 required for ffmpeg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> linux builds require bzip2:      SOLINK(target) out/Release/lib.target/third_party/ffmpeg/libffmpegsumo.so  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lbz2  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status  make: *** [out/Release/lib.target/third_party/ffmpeg/libffmpegsumo.so] Error 1  make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....    This library does not make sense to use for &lt;video&gt;.  It is large and slow  and shouldnt be used in the file formats we're  supporting.  If it is being used  we should try to find out how to disable it.   </pre>
