<title>Issue 24026 -   chromium -    browser actions: popups are a little slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Click on a browser action with a popup (try set_page_color)  and there's   sometimes a slight lag before the popup appears.    In this case  there are three interesting pieces:  - spinning up the extension process (set_page_color has no other views)  - creating a render view  - waiting for layout to finish (so we know the width)    The other possibility is that this is a Debug vs. Release perf issue.   </pre>
