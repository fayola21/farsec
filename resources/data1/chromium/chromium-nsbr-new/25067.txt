<title>Issue 25067 -   chromium -    handle magic bookmark folder names - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure if this is a bug or not  but capturing it for people that know the code   to better respond.    The bookmark ui has two special folders &quot;bookmark bar&quot; and &quot;other   bookmarks&quot;.  There are strings in the GRD files for these.  But from a quick   look  its not clear to me if the strings end up being stored in the model by   accident.  What should happen is the nodes get &quot;special&quot; values or ids that the   UIs then pick off those and put in the l10n values needed.  Otherwise  a user   running two on different languages at times can get confusing UI issues as   both folders end up existing.  Likewise  with sync in the mix  we get a chance   for it to happen between platforms. </pre>
