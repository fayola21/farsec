<title>Issue 29945 -   chromium -    Can crash after middle-click closing a tab when a modal sheet is up. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Bring up two tabs.  2. Bring up Save Panel in one of them.  3. Middle-click the tab containing Save Panel.        Tab should not close.        Tab closes  but Save Panel remains visible.  Cancelling the Save Panel causes a crash  as does trying   to save the file somewhere. </pre>
