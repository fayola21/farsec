<title>Issue 25209 -   chromium -    Autodetect and reconfigure when using gcc 4.4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try building with gcc 4.4  2. Run into confusing errors  3. Ask on the IRC channel and learn you need to create a mystery dotfile and   rebuild    What is the expected output?  Instead  we should just detect gcc 4.4 at gyp time and go from there. </pre>
