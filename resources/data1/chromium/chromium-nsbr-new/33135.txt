<title>Issue 33135 -   chromium -    Loading a new page: white screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Official Build 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : Pretty much any site you go to  Other browsers tested: Firefox and Internet Explorer 8      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to a website and click a link on any site for most part  2. Will notice browser screen turns white for a second while   Chromium/Chrome loads page  then will display content at once.    When you go to a new web page  Chrome loads a completely white blank page    then goes on to load the webpage. Can we skip this white page? It's not in   Firefox or IE  and it's very annoying  as it hurts your eyes especially   when viewing a site with a dark background.   </pre>
