Focus a note and click right mouse button    What is the expected output?   Context menu with options related to the text like Cut  Copy  Paste  etc   should appear when the focus is on note irrespective of which line it is.    What do you see instead?  The correct context menu appears only when we bring up context menu at the   exact line    Please see the attached images   </pre>
