<title>Issue 29039 -   chromium -    OS X unit tests should not set state of system pasteboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run SettingFindTextUpdatesFindPboard test from   find_bar_cocoa_controller_unittest.  2. Note that clipboard text is retained in the system clipboard.  Also  this   opens potential errors if another app is using the system clipboard while the   unit tests are running.    Better would be to use a FindPasteboard that refers to a local pasteboard  as   the find_pasteboard_unittest does.     </pre>
