<title>Issue 26606 -   chromium -    void TreeView::TreeNodesRemoved doesn't work with hidden root - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> void TreeView::TreeNodesRemoved in tree_view.cc@240 doesn't work properly   when deleting a node that is a direct child of a hidden root. This function   calls HTREEITEM TreeView::GetTreeItemForNodeDuringMutation(TreeModelNode*   node)  which then tries if (node_to_details_map_.find(node) ==   node_to_details_map_.end()). The TreeModelNode* passed in here is the   (hidden) root  and so we don't get anything found here and NULL gets returned   and the tree view is not updated. </pre>
