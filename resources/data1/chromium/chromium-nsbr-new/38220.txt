<title>Issue 38220 -   chromium -    Google Quick Scroll extension install failure ~75% of times on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On my mac  the Google Quick Scroll extension fails to install ~75% of the   time.    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibh">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibh</a>  gpbllgc    Other extensions seem to install OK  but we've gotten reports of this problem   from other extensions  such as xmarks.    Not clear yet whether it is mac specific  but I can't repro on linux. Not tested   yet on windows.    I am seeing this on trunk  but it has also been reported on the 4.1 candidate. </pre>
