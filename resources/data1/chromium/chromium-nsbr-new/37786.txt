<title>Issue 37786 -   chromium -    Options dialog cannot be sized smaller - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Option options dialog.  2) Resize larger  3) Attempt to resize smaller -- fails    This is due to gtk_util::WrapLabelAtAllocationHack() calls.    Options:  1) make dialog nonresizable  2) remove wrapping (this may be really bad in German  but it seemed ok-ish   to me)  3) make labels only wrap at the initial dialog width  and not new widths   after resize      I guess #3 isn't so bad  just need to disconnect the size-allocate handler   after it hits once.  Any thoughts? </pre>
