<title>Issue 33112 -   chromium -    Scroll slider  back button  fwd button  and URL window are all over the place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.

Why not put them all close together (see   picture). If the scroll slider looked like the picture  I would rarely have   to scan my mouse across the entire page (especially hard on a netbook).

A lot of back and forth with the mouse.    <b>Please provide
