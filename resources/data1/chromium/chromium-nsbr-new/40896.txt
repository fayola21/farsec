<title>Issue 40896 -   chromium -    Different em width explained in Chinese simplified version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;            Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8:OK      1. Change the language to Chinese Simplified  2. Open a web page with width set in em (instead of px)  for example:   <a href="http://diythemes.com/">http://diythemes.com/</a>      When language is set English  the width is correct.      In Chinese Simplified(I didn't test other languages)  the width is larger    producing a incorrect on the layout.    Sorry for the poor english.   </pre>
