<title>Issue 42005 -   chromium -    bookmark manager dragging glitches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux (if it matters):    when dragging items in the tabbed bookmark manager  the drop indicator seems   to jiggle  depending on the cursor's position. If you hover over the lower   half of item a  there drop indicator is in a slightly different location   compare to if you hover over the upper half of item b.    Also  when you hover exactly in between two items  a plus sign appears on   the cursor  and dropping here causes you to download the link.    related: <a title="Tabbed Bookmark Manager: Drag and drop doesn't work" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41601"> bug 41601 </a> </pre>
