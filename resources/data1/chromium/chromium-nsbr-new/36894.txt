<title>Issue 36894 -   chromium -    windows restore to full screen but then cannot leave full screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open one window in new chrome session (alternatively open several   windows + many tabs); do not full screen any windows.  2. Crash chrome; can happen on its own (not sure why) or can be induced    e.g. &quot;pgrep chrome | xargs kill -9&quot;  3. Open new chrome window  4. Click the Restore button        All windows and their tabs from before the crash should reopen in normal   windows.        All windows open with correct tabs  but in full screen mode.  Bringing mouse to top of screen does not cause &quot;Exit full screen (F11)&quot;   option to appear.  Pressing F11 does not cause window to leave full screen  but does case   &quot;Exit full screen (F11)&quot; to appear. However  clicking it is ineffectual.    <b>Please provide
