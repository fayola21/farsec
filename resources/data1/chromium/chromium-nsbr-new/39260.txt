<title>Issue 39260 -   chromium -    New blocked popup UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The popup blocker notification isn't prominent enough today.     To help  the existing page action icon should expand to say &quot;Pop-up blocked&quot;   inside a bubble adjacent to the icon but inline (like the tab to search   bubble).     The bubble should animate open and closed in the most awesome way possible.  </pre>
