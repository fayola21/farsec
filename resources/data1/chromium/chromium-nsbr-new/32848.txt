<title>Issue 32848 -   chromium -    Should merge same-name bookrmark folders when syncing from two clients at the same time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) Client A and B both had chrome installed  2) Client A has BM folder 'Test BMFolder' with BMs - 'foo1'  'foo2'  3) Client B has BM folder 'Test BMFolder' with BMs - 'foo3'  'foo4'  4) Client A and B  both came online pretty much at the same time with same  account  5) wait for 1 min for sync to complete syncing        There no duplicates on folder  and at the end and 'Test BMFolder' should  have all 4 BMs on both clients. But currently two folders with same name  'Test BMFolder' are created.    Chrome build is 4.0.302.2 (Official Build 36665)       </pre>
