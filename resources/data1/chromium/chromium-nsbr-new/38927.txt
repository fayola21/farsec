<title>Issue 38927 -   chromium -    Change installer enum to put EXISTING_VERSION_LAUNCHED at end - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The enumeration at installer_util::InstallStatus added   EXISTING_VERSION_LAUNCHED at value 3  which offset all of Omaha's error-  status translations and HC articles.    We should modify the enumeration to put the new value at the end of the list   so it does not interfere with the other codes.  Please merge this to the 249   branch too.    Omaha and the HC will need an appropriate error message for this new code as   well. </pre>
