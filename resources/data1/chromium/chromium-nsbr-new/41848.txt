<title>Issue 41848 -   chromium -    &quot;Edit Bookmark&quot; pop-up window opens when user presses down-arrow key on Add Bookmark pop-up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 5.0.371.0 dev and earlier  on Linux and ChromeOS  Does not happen on the Macintosh version.       1. Click the add bookmark star icon at the right end of the nav bar  to  open the Add Bookmark pop-up widget.  2. Press the down-arrow key. Continue pressing until the last item in the  Folder drop-down is displayed (i.e.  &quot;Choose another folder...&quot;).    What is the expected result?  The Folder drop-down should display the &quot;Choose another folder...&quot; choice   but this choice should not become actuated unless the user clicks it  or  presses the Return key.    What happens instead?  As soon as the &quot;Choose another folder...&quot; choice appears in the drop-down   the Add Bookmark pop-up is suddenly closed  and the &quot;Edit Bookmark&quot; pop-up  window opens near the center of the screen. The whole experience is  unexpected and disorienting. </pre>
