<title>Issue 23675 -   chromium -    missing impls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I did a quick search and didn't see bugs for these  seems like we might needs   to work for the devtools (found them when in the file for other stuff):    void BrowserWindowCocoa::UpdateDevTools() {    NOTIMPLEMENTED();  }    void BrowserWindowCocoa::FocusDevTools() {    NOTIMPLEMENTED();  }   </pre>
