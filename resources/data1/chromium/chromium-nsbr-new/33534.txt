<title>Issue 33534 -   chromium -    chrome uninstaller doesn't clean out properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Install Chrome.  Depending on which installer (pack or &quot;stand-alone&quot;)    you'll see different reg keys set.  In any case it'll be two folders named   Clients and ClientState  e.g.    {HKLM|HLCU}Software{Wow6432Node|}GoogleUpdateClients{8A69D3  45-...  HKLM|HLCU}Software{Wow6432Node|}GoogleUpdateClientState{8A69  D345-...    (the middle expression is &quot;Wow6432Node or 'nothing'&quot;)    When uninstalling  the &quot;...Clients{8A69D345...&quot; folder is deleted.  Bug: the &quot;...ClientState{8A69D345...&quot; folder is NOT deleted.    This makes some operations ambiguous and overly-complicated.  For   example  to determine current installed channel  we need to look at   ..ClientState{8A...}ap  but only if ..Clients{8A...} exists.    Please clean up better. </pre>
