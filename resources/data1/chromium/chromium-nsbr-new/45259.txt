<title>Issue 45259 -   chromium -    Google Analytics ga.js code breaks extensions on Mac 6.0.408.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: Google Chrome 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev  OS: Mac OSX      1.  Install the barebones analytics sample attached to this report  2.  Attempt to open the popup window for the extension  3.  Inspect the background page      The popup should open and render.  The background page inspector should show DOM for the   background page.    Instead  the popup page never opens.  The &quot;elements&quot; pane of the inspector is empty (attached   screenshot).  Eventually  the extension crashes (second attached screenshot)    The code in this extension used to work without any issues.  Commenting out the following line   in analytics.js causes the extension to be stable and work as expected (except no tracking   information is sent to GA):        var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga  s);    Indicating that some code in the analytics tracking code is causing the issue.   </pre>
