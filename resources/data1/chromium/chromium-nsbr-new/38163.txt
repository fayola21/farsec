<title>Issue 38163 -   chromium -    Google chrome (linux) defaults to top level window in Kubuntu 9.10 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta      1.  Appears to be default behavior for Kubuntu 9.10        Giving focus to another window should bring that application to the top    but Chrome remains top level window.    Simple work around:     Setting Google chrome to be bottom level window by default allows me to   pack more windows into one screen.     </pre>
