<title>Issue 30697 -   chromium -    SPDY: WebKit Throttling - loader.cpp priorities hold back resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The WebKit loader is designed for a network stack which can not do priorities   on its own.  Now that we have priorities plumbed between webkit and the   network stack  we should remove all throttling.    This is controlled in loader.cpp  and is partially governed by the   REQUEST_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED macro  which we should turn off.  However  the   loader still has more throttling; all the places where it would call   scheduleServePendingRequests should be modified to immediately serve the   pending requests.  The network layer can then sort out when (and in what   order) to actually issue them onto the network </pre>
