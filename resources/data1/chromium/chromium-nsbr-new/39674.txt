<title>Issue 39674 -   chromium -    Bookmarks Bar hover causes window controls hover state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Ensure bookmarks bar is set to show (View-&gt; Always Show Bookmarks Bar)  2. Hover over a bookmark      Hover state triggered on hovered bookmark only      Hover state triggered on hovered bookmark AND window controls (close  minimize  maximize).    This doesn't seem to happen on any other UI elements  and is quite distracting (for example  I   have a Gmail window open in the top left tab and the flickering causes me to think the title is   changing to flag a new email/chat message). </pre>
