<title>Issue 40474 -   chromium -    Close buttons on Chrome OS dialogs are misaligned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The close buttons on dialog windows in Chrome OS are incorrectly placed   flush against the top of the titlebar.  I suspect that this is a result of   the switch to Views -- the Windows version's close button image is aligned   against the top of the window  but the Linux version's close button image   (which we're currently using) needs to be two pixels lower.  I've attached   enlarged screenshots showing the image's position in the Chrome OS About   dialog and in the regular GTK Linux version of Chrome.    Alternately  the correct fix may be to use the Windows images instead of the   Linux images for Chrome OS.    (I am also not opposed to using Glen's head here instead.) </pre>
