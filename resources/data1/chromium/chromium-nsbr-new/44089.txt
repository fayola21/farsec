<title>Issue 44089 -   chromium -    Clean-up required when officially switching to app launcher for new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the app launcher is shown when a new tab is created on  ChromeOS by default and on Windows behind a flag.    When it becomes the official behavior on all platforms  some  browser/ui/interactive ui tests will need to be fixed and we will need to  clean up the extra flags kAppLauncherForNewTab and kDisableAppLauncherForNewTab </pre>
