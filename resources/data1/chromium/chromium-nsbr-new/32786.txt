<title>Issue 32786 -   chromium -    Command-W sometimes closes the entire window instead of a single tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have anecdotal reports of this behavior happening again  after we fixed   <a title="custom frame context menu can be hard to trigger when you have a lot of tabs and no custom frame" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19947"> bug 19947 </a>. My guess is that something else is triggering the AppKit code   that switches the window layering from a background tab and causing the   menu updating flag to get stuck due to the timer never firing.    I have a CL in progress that forces the timer to fire on the main thread  which   should fix the &quot;stuck&quot; issue  and added a DCHECK to try to catch in debug   builds when we get into this scenario.    We should take this for beta </pre>
