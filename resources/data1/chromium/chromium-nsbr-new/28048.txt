<title>Issue 28048 -   chromium -    extensions processes shouldn't run when there is only an incognito window running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open Chrome and install an extension (ie. gmail checker)  2. Open an incognito window  3. Close the chrome window in step 1 so you only have the incognito window  running  4. Open task manager    What is the expected output?   No Chrome extension process running since they are disabled in incognito mode    What do you see instead?  extension process is still running.       </pre>
