<title>Issue 37448 -   chromium -    Chrome unresponsive after bookmark deletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta  URLs (if applicable) : NA  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): NA  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): NA  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested        1. Setup synchronized bookmarks  with at least 1 bookmark  2. Open Bookmark Manager.  3. Right click on a bookmark  and choose 'Delete'.  4. Close the Bookmark Manager window.      The bookmark manager window should close  and the bookmark  deletion should synchronize.      The entire app 'beachballs'.  I can still drag the main window   but the window and menubar are otherwise unresponsive.  When  I kill and restart  it becomes clear that the bookmark deletion  was not synchronized.   </pre>
