<title>Issue 31534 -   chromium -    Chrome does not create or parse DOM node named &quot;title&quot; (innerHTML doesn't work for title element) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  WebKit	532.6  V8	2.0.3.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.6 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.266.0 Safari/532.6            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 6: OK      I have written a test case in the attached html file. Please run it to see   the output.      Should be able to create or parse title node. At least  it works fine in   both Firefox &amp; IE.   I am not sure if its a WebKit issue. Unfortunately  I don't have Safari to   test it.  The same issue exist in Google Chrome Linux as well.      It throws Error: NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: DOM Exception 7     </pre>
