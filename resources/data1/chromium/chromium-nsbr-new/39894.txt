<title>Issue 39894 -   chromium -    Use the XDG cache folder (in linux) for storing the cache files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As of version 5.0.365.0  the cache files in GNU/Linux are stored in the   directory &quot;~/.config/chromium/Cache&quot; and &quot;~/.config/chromium/Media Cache&quot;.    These directories grow quite big and are cumbersome when you want to store   backup copies of your user whole configuration files.    The XDG Base Directory Specification [1] describes an environment variable   named $XDG_CACHE_HOME (defaults to ~/.cache) that could be used for storing   the cache  sepparating the different nature of the data and allowing for   easier user-wide cache cleaning.    Given that Chromium already supports $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (~/.config) for   storing the configuration files  it would be nice if the cache files were   stored in the XDG cache directory so that the data can be treated   differently.
