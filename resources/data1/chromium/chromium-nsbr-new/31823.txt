<title>Issue 31823 -   chromium -    Spell Check Flags Appear in Edit Fields for IE8 with Chrome Frame Active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)    Related URL(s): This site has not yet gone public.      1. Create or find a Web site that has activated Chrome Frame and that has      edit fields (in this case  GWT TextBox widgets).  2. Make sure that Chrome frame is installed and enabled.  3. Type a non-word into one of these TextBox fields.      The non-word would appear in the text field without anything else.      The non-word appears with a crinkly red line under it indicating a spelling   error.  But not all TextBox input fields are for prose - some are intended   to receive numbers or codes or whatever.    This behavior does not appear when IE is used without Chrome Frame enabled.  And it does not appear in the Chrome browser.  It only appears when IE and Chrome Frame are used together.     </pre>
