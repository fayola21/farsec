<title>Issue 30244 -   chromium -    Omnibox is RTLed when Alt+Shift is used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chorme 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992) using regular English interface   under windows XP (EN interface with Hebrew IME installed)        every second try  when i use RightAlt+RightShift in the Omnibox  the   Omnibox is RTLed  (while it should only change the language English&lt;&gt;Hebrew)    it doesn't happens with any other Alt+Shift combination (for example   RightAlt+LeftShift...)  it only happens from LTR to RTL    unlike the plans for automatic RTL&lt;&gt;LTR detection (which might be   inconvenient in a wide field like the omnibox?) here the conversion is   unexpected as it is one sided   </pre>
