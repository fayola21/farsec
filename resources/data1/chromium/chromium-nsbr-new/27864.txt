<title>Issue 27864 -   chromium -    Content scripts doc bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html</a>    The example code says that both the page and the content script can set   things like foo.onclick and that both events will get fired. Alas  this is   not true today. The docs should be changed to reflect the reality. </pre>
