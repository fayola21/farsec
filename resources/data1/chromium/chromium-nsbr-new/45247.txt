<title>Issue 45247 -   chromium -    Rewrite tab_renderer_gtk.cc using cairo instead of skia - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> willchan's recent benchmarking showed that tabstrip rendering takes &gt;= 25ms   (and is one of the few non-disk I/O tasks that janks chrome up).    I assume this is due to the model mismatch between skia and cairo and our   linux skia implementation is stuffing bitmaps over the X connection. The   last time I moved code from skia to cairo I sped up tabstrip rendering up   from 20ms to ~1ms. </pre>
