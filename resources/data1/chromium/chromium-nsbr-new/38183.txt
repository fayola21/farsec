<title>Issue 38183 -   chromium -    Integrate the content_scripts css feature with WebKit user styles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome now supports custom user style sheets.  It would be nice if this   functionality were available to extension authors.  For example  it would be   nice to be able to apply a custom style to a URL pattern.    This would require some WebKit work as well since the webkit API only takes   a single URL to a stylesheet and applies it to all pages. </pre>
