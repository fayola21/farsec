<title>Issue 43891 -   chromium -    Disable toast on 249 and 375 branches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The toast is currently set to appear for 30-day inactives on both the 249 and   375 branches.  We will want to set this back to 3000-day inactives for the   time being because:    - Toast 4 is complete  so it doesn't need to continue running.  - Toast 5 still requires adjustments from learnings in Toast 4.    We just need to change        const int kThirtyDays = 30 * 24;  to      const int kThirtyDays = 3000 * 24; </pre>
