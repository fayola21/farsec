<title>Issue 37473 -   chromium -    Text diffs in layout test svg/text/text-intro-05-t.svg  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While rebaselining tests to fix <a title="Mac pixel tests: SVG expected images have what looks like a &quot;found rectangle&quot; around them" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23482"> bug #23482 </a>  I have noticed that   svg/text/text-intro-05-t.svg produces text diffs versus its baseline. This   has nothing to do with the fix for 23482  and it's not described in that bug    so I'm creating this issue to be able to mark this test as TEXT in   test_expectations.txt.      Test should pass  there should be no diffs      Text diffs.    Someone who knows what the output should look like should take a look   and see if the text changes are expected  and either fix the underlying   cause of the diffs or rebaseline the expected text.   </pre>
