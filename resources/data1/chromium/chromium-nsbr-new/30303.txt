<title>Issue 30303 -   chromium -    Exclude Safe Browsing Bloom filters from Time Machine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because the Safe Browsing Bloom filters are under ~/Library/Application  Support/Google/Chrome  they by default get backed up by Time Machine every  hour.  Since this is ephemeral data that has minimal value in a  backup/restore scenario  excluding them from Time Machine would be handy.    Either moving them to ~Library/Caches or using the method in comment 9 on  <a title="Chrome history &amp; thumbnails fill up timemachine"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25959">issue 25959</a> to specifically exclude them from backup could work.   </pre>
