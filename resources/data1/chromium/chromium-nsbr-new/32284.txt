<title>Issue 32284 -   chromium -    No option to force turn-off &quot;save/discard&quot; prompt message for .dmg downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.49    There is currently no option to force turn-off the &quot;save/discard&quot; prompt message for .dmg   downloads. I understand it's there for security purposes  but savvy users may want to accept the   responsibility of risk without an extra step with each initiated download. </pre>
