<title>Issue 27001 -   chromium -    Changing the view in NTP enables the &quot;Most visited&quot; sites in it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.237.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31086">r31086</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open a new tab page and disable &quot;Most Visited&quot; sites in it.  2. Change the view in the NTP.    Expected:  The view should change and we shouldn't see any &quot;Most Visited&quot; sites.    Actual:  &quot;Most visited&quot; sites are enabled as soon as the user changes the view of   NTP.  Windows and Linux Chrome also exhibit the same behavior.   </pre>
