<title>Issue 36686 -   chromium -    Content settings not applied to databases in single process mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run chrome.exe --single-process  2. Block all cookies  3. Open a page that uses web databases      Access should be blocked      Since sqlite accesses the filesystem directly  access is not blocked    I just checked this on Windows. </pre>
