<title>Issue 46155 -   chromium -    An opened drop down list moves while using auto scrolling feature. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.70 (Official Build 48679)         Safari 4: OK (But  fails when scrolling outside the dropped list borders  with the mouse wheel only &quot;Without auto scrolling feature being activated&quot;)       Safari 5: OK    Firefox 3.6.3: OK           IE 6: Not Tested           IE 7: Not Tested           IE 8: OK    Opera 10.50: OK        1. Look for any website with some drop down lists (hint: A registration form like &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/create_account?next=/&quot;">http://www.youtube.com/create_account?next=/&quot;</a>).  2. Open the drop down list (Keep it opened).  3. Move your mouse cursor away from the opened list  and keep it inside the browser's window.  4. Click the mouse wheel button to activate the auto scrolling feature.  5. Start Moving your mouse up  down ...etc. While holding the mouse wheel button.  6. And the drop down list will start moving as you scroll away from its original position (Moving like a DIV with a fixed position assigned to it!).      The drop down list must not move while doing the process described above. But instead  chrome's supposed to block the 'page' scrolling like what happens in IE8  or automatically close the list when the user starts scrolling outside the dropped list borders like Firefox 3.6.  Note: In chrome  the list closes automatically  when scrolling outside the dropped list borders with the mouse wheel only (Without the auto scrolling feature being activated). That's what's supposed to happen.      The list moves when scrolling like a fixed DIV. </pre>
