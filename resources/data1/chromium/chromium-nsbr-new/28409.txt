<title>Issue 28409 -   chromium -    http/tests/xmlhttprequest/logout.html fails. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium needs a fix similar to what was done for WebKit in   <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49406">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49406</a>    Basically  if a site has credentials stored in the cache  then any new   credentials coming through should replace the old credentials immediately.   (That's what it looks like the WebKit code does.)    Once fixed this test should pass. </pre>
