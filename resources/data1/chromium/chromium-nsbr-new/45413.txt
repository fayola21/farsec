<title>Issue 45413 -   chromium -    ftp5.gwdg.de (please duplicate this into 41467  as the original is closed) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> no more need to say - is this http or ftp site?    I'm asking for duplicate because IMO the best solution is to revert the change. I know it won't happen due to ego or   other issue though. </pre>
