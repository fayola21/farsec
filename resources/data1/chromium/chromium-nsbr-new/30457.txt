<title>Issue 30457 -   chromium -    Many users experiencing hang/crash on KDE but not on Gnome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In kde (KDE SC 4.3.4(from kubuntu-ppa) on Kubuntu 9.10) Chrome loads   several pages but hangs the tab just after the page has loaded. After   sometimes a pop up says &quot;some problem has happend. close or reload the   page&quot;(I have localize(bn_BD) build so I dont know exactly whats the pop-up   in English)  2. But same page on the same chrome on gnome loads perfectly. Its seams its    only problem on Kde.  3. Not only that page  But also many pages hangs. Even extension page of   chrome ( <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions?hl=bn">https://chrome.google.com/extensions?hl=bn</a> ).        <b>Please provide
