<title>Issue 39360 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Facebook for Google Chrome extensions doesn't work in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install extension Facebook for Google Chrome  2. Enable its incognito mode by checking &quot;Allow this extension to run in  incognito&quot;  3. In incognito window  click on its browser action  4. On pop-up  click on &quot;Login to facebook&quot;  4. Follow page instruction to log in facebook      Even you have logged in on the page  in the browser action's pop-up it  still prompts you to log in facebook. This happens only in incognito mode   in normal mode it doesn't happen.    And what's more  if you follow the browser action pop-up to log in in  normal mode  then the pop-up works in incognito mode.    I guess this indicates that in incognito mode it cannot save some session  data/other data/cookies  but it can use the session data/other data/cookie  in normal mode.       </pre>
