<title>Issue 40469 -   chromium -    networkState should return to NETWORK_EMPTY after reporting an error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Force a decode error but pointing an audio/video tag at some random data.    We notify WebKit of the error by setting networkState to   MediaPlayer::DecodeError  which does fire the proper MediaError and set   m_networkState to NETWORK_EMPTY  however I think we fire an additional   networkStateChanged() which causes us to overwrite m_networkState with an   out-of-spec value. </pre>
