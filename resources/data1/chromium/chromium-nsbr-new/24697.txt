<title>Issue 24697 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Support 7-zip or bzip2 compression - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since 7-zip and bzip2 provide better compression than gzip  it will be good  for Chrome to support one of them. There's an increased CPU cost  but most  computers have lot of idle CPU anyway.    There's also increased server cost  but let the server make that decision  rather than the client. For instance  there's no reason it can't be used  for static files.    This especially matters when you take a global perspective rather than a  US-centric one  where a lot of people have lots of local compute power but  little bandwidth. For instance  256kbps DSL metered connections are common  in India. I often browse the web on my Macbook Pro over an EDGE connection  (via tethering  and yes  my carrier officially allows that).    Let the browser not be the bottleneck that drives the tradeoff between CPU  and network and cost (with a metered plan). </pre>
