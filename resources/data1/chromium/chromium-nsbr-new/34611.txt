<title>Issue 34611 -   chromium -    make a virtual keyboard extension  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These are the ideas concerning language features:    1. I have friends in USA who have no ukrainian keyboard therefore they type  ukrainian words using english letters (translit).  It is extremely hard to read such messages because everyone has his own  rules of  translit and i am unaccustomed to read it. And it is much more inconvenient  to write translit.      I type using ten fingers (as a lot of other people) and i look at the text  ive typed and do not look at the keyboard.    I suggest autocorrection of input: you type english letters and get any  other language that was prechosen.    I suggest to make a built in browser  feature - a tiny national flag  displays in the each textarea and &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; and you can choose  the language that you need and continue to type roman letters (do not need  to install system language - a lot of people can not access administrator  panel if they are in the foreign country - internet cafe). Browser makes  autocorrection depending of the location of the key that was pressed (is  you press for instance english key &quot;s&quot; - you get ukrainian &quot;��__&quot;  russian &quot;��_��_&quot;  etc)  - virtual keyboard can be also displayed if someone do not know the  keyboard.    I think it would be more convenient than transliteration feature  (<a href="http://ua.translit.cc">http://ua.translit.cc</a>) - although it exists people dont use it for a  thousand of reasons. Any way transliteration can also be available.    2. Autocorrection of url (vice versa). </pre>
