<title>Issue 33904 -   chromium -    Suggestion: Auto-switch to HTTPS when using HTTP on SSL port - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.ginatricot.com:443/">http://www.ginatricot.com:443/</a>                         <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org:443/">http://addons.mozilla.org:443/</a>      1. Open a URL with HTTP (i.e. an intra/extranet site) but to a SSL-enabled   port.    2. Notice the nice but perhaps unecessary error message saying basically   &quot;click here for HTTPS instead&quot; (for ginatricot)     and for others (addons) you get &quot;Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE)&quot;     The addons URL (and a couple others I tried) also sometimes just got   stuck.      1. A better error message that also non-geeks understand  or better yet:    2. Auto-switch to HTTPS:    * when HTTP won't respond    * when I have specified both http and port 443 in the url    * when connecting to sites (ginatricot  perhaps also typical for   extranets?) that cause error message &quot;we beleive you wanted HTTPS&quot;      An error message that tells me to click on a link  or a long delay  or an   &quot;unknown error 324&quot; which really isn't helpful.    In general  making up a list of error messages that people get to see and   putting a usability team to rewrite or figure out how to get rid of those   errors could be a good thing. </pre>
