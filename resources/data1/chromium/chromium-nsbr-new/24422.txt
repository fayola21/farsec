<title>Issue 24422 -   chromium -    &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; installer infinite loop in AOL reported by my Dad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>    from my dad:     got your invite to install &quot;Wave&quot; and clicked to install it.  However    Google insisted that I first log into GMail (which I did) and install   &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; so &quot;Wave&quot; would work with IE.  I pressed the button and   &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; installed successfully.  However  I was right back where I   started and could not proceed until I again installed &quot;Chrome Frame.&quot;  So I   did.  Predictably  upon successful installation  I was right back to the   message that I had to install &quot;Chrome Frame.&quot;  At this point  I decided to   give up.  I also noticed that IE was running funny.  So I shut down and   restarted.     Now  I get an error when I try running AOL. I can no longer run the regular   version that I have always used and have to click on an older version with   which I am less familiar and which does not have some of teh features I   generally use.     Unfortunately  I installed this on my development PC.  It does not appear   that the &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; installer is very stable.  Is there any way to find   out why it appears to not be compatible with AOL? Actually  I'd like to   find out how to uninstall this.  Don't feel bad.  AOL seems to be the only   thing that's problematic  so far.  So If I can just get that back  I'll be   happy.    Email 2:   I think I'm back but not without a little more adventure.  I uninstalled   &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; and that allowed me to load he standard version of AOL.    However  when I tried to compose a message to tell you  the AOL &quot;Compose&quot;   dialog box never finished loading and reported an error.  This happened   repeatedly.  So  I restarted the PC and was again able to load the standard   AOL plus compose a message.  Yay!  I'm whole again.  But that's an hour of   my life that I'll never get back.     So  just to recap:     1. The &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; installer just continued to loop.  Perhaps it would   detect that it was installed at some point  but I gave up after the third   iteration;     2. With &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; installed  IE would crash and I could no longer load   the standard AOL version.     3. Disabling &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; fixed the IE crash problem.     4. Uninstalling &quot;Chrome Frame&quot; allowed the standard AOL version to load    but the AOL &quot;Compose&quot; dialog would error.  Restarting the PC seems to have   ficed that problem.     Hopefully  the problems are behind me.  I can only hope that there are no   more land mines.  The irony is that I was accepting an invitation to   install &quot;Wave&quot; but never actually got there because of the &quot;Chrome Frame&quot;   installer infinite loop. But the good news is that I appear to be whole   again  so no harm done.                        </pre>
