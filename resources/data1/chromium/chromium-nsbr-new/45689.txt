<title>Issue 45689 -   chromium -    toast experiment writing to  HKEY_USERS.DEFAULTSoftware - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From david dorwin:    &quot;  I just got an assert in Omaha because there is an HKU.DEFAULT key. It   looks like my system-level Chrome just got updated to version 5 (I was OOO   part of last week)  and chrome wrote &quot;TM40&quot; to   HKEY_USERS.DEFAULTSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-D564-463c-  AFF1-A69D9E530F96}pv.  &quot;    The problem is not the HKCU  is the fact that the .DEFAULT user is not a   real user  it is the system account.    Chrome should not be writing there  I should be impersonating the   interactive user.     </pre>
