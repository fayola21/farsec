<title>Issue 26378 -   chromium -    Jank with JavaScript alert versus modal loops. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In one tab  browse around to develop a &quot;Back&quot; history.  2. Open another tab and browser to alert.html (below).  3. Back in the first tab  click-hold Back and leave the menu up.        Eventually you'll end up back at the original tab with the alert dialog up  while your history menu is   still up.  That's icky.  If you select an item  it mucks about unsuccessfully with your current tab's   state (for me I seem to end up at something which may relate to the index of the item I selected in   the current tab  but it's off-by-one or something).     </pre>
