<title>Issue 25008 -   chromium -    Scrollbars are not displayed again when popup is closed at Mint.com. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  URLs (if applicable) : www.mint.com  OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Login to mint.com (assuming you have an account)  2. On top  click on the &quot;Your Accounts&quot; link. This should bring up a popup   window that shows a list of accounts.  3. Close the &quot;Your Accounts&quot; popup by pressing the Close button. The   focus is back on the main page but the scrollbars are not visible.      When the popup is closed and the focus is back on the main page    scrollbars should be shown to allow you to scroll the main page.        Once the scrollbars disappear upon the popup loading  they never appear   again.   </pre>
