<title>Issue 32122 -   chromium -    Dragging chrome window to top of desktop hides top of window behind desktop panel (metacity) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. My linux desktop has a 1/2cm tall control panel all the way across the  top of the physical screen.  I drag the chrome window to the top of the  screen  and I can drag the chrome window underneath the control panel   where it stops at the edge of the physical screen.  This means that chrome  is underneath the control panel  and I can not drag it again  or close it   or iconify it  or ... as all of those controls are underneath the desktop's  top control panel.        The top pixels of the chrome window should refuse to go any higher than the  bottom pixel of the desktop's control panel.  This is what firefox does.        Critical parts of the Chrome window to control the window get buried and  unreachable.    Then what happens?  I use another browser  even though I should be  dogfooding Chrome.      <b>Please provide
