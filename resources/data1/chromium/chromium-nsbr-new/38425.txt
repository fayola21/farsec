<title>Issue 38425 -   chromium -    Feature: Fullscreen mode from extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our extension needs to open a fullscreen window using either the  chrome.windows.create() extension API or regular javascript window.open()  method.    IE currently supports a &quot;fullscreen&quot; parameter to window.open() so this  will provide a measure of feature parity.    I'm planning to produce a patch that will add &quot;fullscreen&quot; as an accepted  and supported parameter to the chrome.windows.create() extension API.     </pre>
