<title>Issue 40721 -   chromium -    Experiment with different kUnusedIdleSocketTimeout values. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Run A/B experiments on kUnusedIdleSocketTimeout values.  Currently it's set   at 10 seconds.  Having this set too high may result in more   ERR_CONNECTION_RESETs  which require at least an RTT to get the RST packet    and then probably result in another RTT to do a TCP connect.  Setting it too   low means we don't take as much advantage of idle sockets. </pre>
