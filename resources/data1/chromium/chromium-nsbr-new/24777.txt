<title>Issue 24777 -   chromium -    Add option to downmix multi-channel audio to stereo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  on systems that support multi-channel audio  we will not downmix   a multi-channel audio stream.    However  if a user only one pair of speakers  or headphones plugged into the   soundcard  they will not be able to get the other channel data mixed in.    We should add an option to force downmixing.  Maybe under the context menu? </pre>
