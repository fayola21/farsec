<title>Issue 27247 -   chromium -    Notifications from extensions should run in extension process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Run an extension that creates an HTML notification using a chrome-  extension:// URL  2. Kill the extension process  3. Notice that the notification is still running    Lots of extension features require all pages for the extension to be in the   same process. This bug prevents all the   chrome.extension.getViews/getBackgroundPage/etc APIs from working  for   example. </pre>
