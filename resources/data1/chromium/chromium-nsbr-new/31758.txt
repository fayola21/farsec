<title>Issue 31758 -   chromium -    Unable to scroll with multiple tabs loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: &lt;from cf:about:version&gt;    chrome doesn't allow me to scroll down/up the website when I load a few   tabs together. So long as any 1 tab has not load finished  other loaded   pages would not be able to scroll.    Related URL(s): any website      1. load multiple tabs concurrently or almost concurrently.      Chrome should be able to scroll given that not too many tabs are loading at   the same time.      The previously loaded pages cannot scroll until all tabs are loaded   finished   </pre>
