<title>Issue 31845 -   chromium -    Make disable JAVA an option (Feature Request) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.294.0 (35803)    1. open an internet site with some JAVA applet  2. it loads up JAVA     Please  make &quot;disable JAVA&quot; a permanent option.     Right now  users have to create a shortcut with a parameter (--disable-  java) to disable JAVA.     It's good  but not enough. Especially  when you click on a link somewhere   and don't have Chromium running. Then the OS starts up the default browser   (without any parameters). That way  it's loading JAVA.     ChromePlus (www.chromeplus.org) already has this parameter as a real option   inside of the browser (see attached SS)   </pre>
