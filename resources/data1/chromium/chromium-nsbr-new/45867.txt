<title>Issue 45867 -   chromium -    XHR Local Network Error (101) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version   : 5.0.375.70  Operating System : Windows XP Professional - Service Pack 3    After updating to Chrome 5.0.375.70 the XMLHttpRequest object throws a   NETWORK_ERR (101) whenever an attempt is made to load a file from the local   file system (i.e. when the file:// protocol is being used).    All of the files are running off-line and they are all located within the   same directory branch (index directory and sub-directories). Both relative   and absolute file paths (URLs) result in the same network error  as do both   synchronous and asynchronous requests.    Firefox and Safari are able to load the requested files without a problem.    The following code will reproduce the error:        // testing off-line XHR file access      var loader = new XMLHttpRequest();      try {              loader.onreadystatechange = function() {                  if( loader.readyState == 4 ) {                      // always empty in Chrome 5.0.375.70                      alert( loader.responseText );                  }              }              loader.open( 'GET'  'data.xml'  true );              loader.send( null );      }      catch( error ) {          // always NETWORK_ERROR 101 in Chrome 5.0.375.70          alert( error );      } </pre>
