<title>Issue 38369 -   chromium -    DebugFlags::ProcessDebugFlags() is not invoked on POSIX platforms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1023005">http://codereview.chromium.org/1023005</a> just added code to pass along the kWaitForDebugger   flag to worker processes on POSIX platforms.    Part of the reason why this is necessary is because the non-windows codepath in   child_process_launcher.cc doesn't result in a call to DebugFlags::ProcessDebugFlags(). It seems like   we should be running this code on posix as well  as otherwise the kWaitForDebugger and   kDebugOnStart flags won't work. </pre>
