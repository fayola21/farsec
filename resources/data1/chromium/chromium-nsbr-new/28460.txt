<title>Issue 28460 -   chromium -    Session Restore is Unreliable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.5 (Developer Build 0)      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Induce what may be a race condition in the GTK+ Open/Save dialogs by   finding a URL that triggers the dialog slowly enough to trigger the dialog   twice before the first one appears.  2. Click &quot;Save&quot; on the second dialog and &quot;Cancel&quot; on the first  3. Watch Chromium freeze  4. Use xkill to kill Chromium and then realize you really need to use   `killall chrome`.  5. Restart chromium and attempt to restore your session      The session should be restored      No tabs are restored but the restore bar vanishes as usual.    If I weren't already used to having a browser that isn't as slow as   molasses  this would be enough of a data loss risk to send me back to   Firefox. As it is  I wrote a quick  hacky Python script to recover   reasonably usable URLs from the session log.    In case anyone else experiences this issue  the emergency solution to   recover your tabs is as follows:  1. DON'T close the browser  2. Copy ~/.config/chromium to ~/.config/chromium.backup  3. Download the attached copy of my script  4. Run it as `python recover_chrome_session.py   &quot;~/.config/chromium.backup/Default/Current Tabs&quot; &gt; ~/recovered_urls.txt`  5. Check the resultant text file. If it lacks the tabs you want  run   `python recover_chrome_session.py &quot;~/.config/chromium.backup/Default/Last   Tabs&quot; &gt; ~/recovered_urls.txt`  6. Open the file in a text editor and delete any trailing garbage (I don't   yet know enough about the format to parse it properly) and any URLs you are   certain are closed tabs.  7. Run `cat ~/recovered_urls.txt | xargs chrome &amp;`    Information on the format of the Current Tabs and Last Tabs files (other   than &quot;read the parser source&quot;) so I can improve my recovery script is   appreciated. </pre>
