<title>Issue 28643 -   chromium -    Chrome V4 eats up CPU and bangs the cache all the time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16 (Official Build 30555)  System: W7 64bit  4 GB RAM      1. Chrome eats up 50%+ CPU. This happened right after Mr. Chrome updated   itself to version 4.  2. When checking ProcMon  it shows that Chrome is nuthugging the   CacheData_[0-1] files reading these two all the time. Like 25 times per   second.  3. See attached pic.  4. Browser is unusable :(.    Expected result: leave the cache alone  dont eat up the cpu. </pre>
