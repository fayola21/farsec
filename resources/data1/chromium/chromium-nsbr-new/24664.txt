<title>Issue 24664 -   chromium -    UI Test ExternalTabTestType.IncognitoMode can freeze when trying to retrieve cookie values - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had to disable the ExternalTabTestType.IncognitoMode ui test  as it would   regularly hang when trying to retrieve cookie values. This resulted in the   entire ui test freezing.    The problem was only observed on Windows  but as it looks timing related  it   is likely to occasionally trigger on other platforms. </pre>
