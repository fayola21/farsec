<title>Issue 43057 -   chromium -    updated images not shown but cached images - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When images are edited using GD libary in PHP or GIMP image editor and   saved in lampp's htdocs folder. When viewing them in a page server via   localhost  images are not refreshed  even emptying the cache doesn't solve   problem. Pressing shift-F5 in Firefox the latest images are shown. The only   way to force chrome to load the updated image(s) is to append a $_GET   variable to the file. for example image.jpg?q=1.      The new updated image (edited image) should be shown instead of the   previous cached version.      A cached image is shown even though the cashe was cleared using options in   Chrome.    <b>Please provide
