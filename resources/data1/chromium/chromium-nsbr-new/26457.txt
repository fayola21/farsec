<title>Issue 26457 -   chromium -    Obtain bookmark folder icon from OS rather than using hard coded lookalike - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ToT at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30684">r30684</a>    1. Look at the shiny new &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; item on the right of the   bookmarks bar    Expected: OS Xy blue folder (like e.g. the folder icons in iPhoto  in Safari's   bookmark manager  or the Finder).    Actual: Windowsy yellow folder.    Since this is very visible (NTP)  I think this is Mstone-4. </pre>
