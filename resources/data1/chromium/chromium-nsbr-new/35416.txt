<title>Issue 35416 -   chromium -    Drag to left to pin tabs  and drag to right to unpin  does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In Chromium 5 I see Pinning tabs has only basically been added back to   Windows... Can you re-add and add these features.    *Drag-to-left - You use to be able to drag-to-left to pin a tab. And to   right to unpin. But now that does not work. You can only right-click to   pin...    *Auto-pin - You used to me able to add (Pinned-tab-count-X) with a number   and have pinned tabs appear on start up. But now that feature is not   working. Can you either add this feature back or add a extension for app   tabs to add this    *Websites loading in Mini Tabs - When you are in a Pin-Tab and enter a web address. It opens it in a new un-pinned tab. But I want it to open up in   the pinned tab. Can you make a extension or something for this    Thanks :) </pre>
