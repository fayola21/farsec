<title>Issue 36710 -   chromium -    Review the default values of Accept-Language list  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a spin-off of <a title="Translation info bar does not appear for English website in localized Chrome except for zh-CN version" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36182"> bug 36182 </a>.     Copied below is my comment #16 on that bug:    At the moment  languages without en-US  en in Chrome are:    bg  ca  cs  el  es-419  es  sl  th  zh-CN    am and sw have 'en-GB  en'  instead.     It seems like I (or Xiaolu) did the 'scouting' of IE. Can you try Spanish   (es) and   Thai (th) Windows?     Anyway  the fact that zh-CN (both IE and Chrome) does not have English   indicates that   there's little compatibility concern. So  I think we'd better be more   consistent   (that is  having English in zh-TW  ko  ja but not in zh-CN seems strange.   So does ru   (Russian) vs bg (Bulgarian))    ----------------------    For 4.1 branch  we took a safe path  but eventually  we'd better review the   default values of A-L list.    There's a CL up (but not landed) at   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/656004/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/656004/show</a>             </pre>
