<title>Issue 24392 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcuts don't work in subwindows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.0        1. Open a subwindow (in the NSWindow sense) with a text field (e.g. find   bar  bookmark bubble)  2. Hit a keyboard shortcut that's defined in global_keyboard_shortcuts   (e.g. cmd-1)        Shortcut should execute.        It's ignored.      In windows  shortcuts work in the find bar but not in the bookmarks bar    but the latter sounds like a bug. </pre>
