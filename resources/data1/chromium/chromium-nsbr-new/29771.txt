<title>Issue 29771 -   chromium -    Chrome provides insufficient info when there's a problem reading the user's profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796)    The dialog box when Chrome is unable to read the user's profile doesn't   provide enough info to debug the problem. All it says is:    &quot;Your profile could not be opened correctly.&quot; It also suggests making the   the files readable  but there's no way for the user to act on this because   Chrome doesn't provide the path to the files it's unable to read.    There's nothing interesting logged to the terminal window either.    Please change Chrome to report the file it's unable to read and what the   error was  so I have a chance of figuring out what's wrong.   </pre>
