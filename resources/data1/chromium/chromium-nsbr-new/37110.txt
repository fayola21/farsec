<title>Issue 37110 -   chromium -    ^T doesn't open new tab in Chrome when I'm in corp gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open google.com mail tab  2. Use it and create/use other tabs for a while (I typically have one open   to google.com mail  one to gmail.com  one to Google calendar  and open and   close other tabs throughout the day - mondrian  codesearch  etc.)  3. Go to google.com mail tab and enter ^T.  No new tab opens.  I can get a   new tab to open from any of the other tabs  but not my google.com mail tab.    FYI I'm running a number of labs.  Let me know if you'd like me to provide   a list of them.    Also  I see this problem on Linux. I believe I've also seen it on MacOS.                <b>Please provide
