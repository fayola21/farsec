<title>Issue 28737 -   chromium -    Full Screen no longer working on OSX - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4    OS version               : 10.6.2    As of the most recent Chrome update  Full Sceen mode is no longer available.   Going to View still has Full Screen in the menu  but it is grayed out. This has   been tested two on different machines  one running OSX 10.6.2 and the other   10.6  both running Chrome 4.0.249.4. This feature worked fine as recently as   2 weeks ago. </pre>
