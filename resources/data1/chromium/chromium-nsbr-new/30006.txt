<title>Issue 30006 -   chromium -    find bar misbehaves - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open two tabs  2. search for &quot;foo&quot; on the first tab (&quot;foo&quot; must be present in the page)  3. search for &quot;bar&quot; on the second tab (&quot;bar&quot; should be present on both tabs   to make the misbehavior clear)  4. switch to first tab again and close the find bar  5. press f3      expected - re-search for foo on the first tab  actual - in the tab contents  the search changes to bar  but the text in   the find dialog remains on &quot;foo&quot;.    So there are two separate problems: we're letting the search and text get   out of sync  and we're searching for the wrong thing.    Repros on windows and Linux. </pre>
