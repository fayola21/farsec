<title>Issue 39984 -   chromium -    SSO: Chrome prompts for username/password when IE does not.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From outersource:    ====  I am still prompted by my site which is using active directory for   authentication. My   application is built using the ASP.NET MVC 1.0 framework and developed in   Visual Studio   2008 (C#). Oh I'm also using Windows 7.    I tested the exact same URL in IE after receiving the prompt still in the   new build and   IE works how it should  it doesn't prompt me at all. Note  Firefox also   prompts me to   enter a username and password  ==== </pre>
