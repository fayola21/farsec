<title>Issue 27304 -   chromium -    Trybots cannot create an empty file during patch. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Any changes that relies on creating a new  empty file will fail on the   trybot.  The trybot's update phase uses patch in a way that will not create   new empty files.    Some of our tests in Native Client use golden output files for   stdout/stderr; sometimes one (or both) of these is empty.  In these cases    we can't test the changes before submitting: they work fine on our   workstations  but always fail during try.
