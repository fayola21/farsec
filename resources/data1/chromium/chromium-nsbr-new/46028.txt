<title>Issue 46028 -   chromium -    NTP changes for apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some general layout changes for apps in the NTP    * Remove the gmail  calendar  and docs preinstalled apps  * If no apps are installed  use the last available most visited slot to show a link to the web store. Note that this is a change to the logic for how the gallery link is currently shown.  * Bring back all other elements that were temporarily (for IO) removed from the NTP when apps are enabled. </pre>
