<title>Issue 27357 -   chromium -    Location box and browser tabs have font size too small - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.240.0  URLs (if applicable) : N/A              Opera: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1.Bring up the browser      Large enough font to read.  Firefox is even bigger than Opera  which I show   in my example.      Font is too small      Viewing this on a TV  rather than a monitor makes this worse.    I am using xorg-x11-7.4-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1">r1</a> from Gentoo Linux.   </pre>
