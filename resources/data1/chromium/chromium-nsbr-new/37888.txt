<title>Issue 37888 -   chromium -    New bookmark indicator (flashing folder) doesn't update if the user selects a new folder. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.4 (Official Build 40199)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    When a user adds a new bookmark and a folder was last used  the folder   will start flashing to show the user where they can find their new   bookmark.  However if the user then moves it to another folder (still   using the New Bookmark UI) the original folder continues to flash and   doesn't update along with it.      1. Start Chrome  2. Create two folders for bookmarks  3. Add a bookmark to one of the folders  4. Add another bookmark that will default to that folder  using the UI   select a different folder.        The new folder will start flashing to show the user where they can find   their new bookmark.        The original folder continues to flash  even though the bookmark no   longers exists there.   </pre>
