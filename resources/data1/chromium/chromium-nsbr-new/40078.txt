<title>Issue 40078 -   chromium -    Tabbed Bookmark manager: The entries in Organize drop-down should be disabled  if the focus is on Search box.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.366.0    -Make sure  you will close the instances of tabbed bookmark manger per   session (i.e for all opened chrome windows)  -Bring up Bookmark manager.    Issue:  Notice the keyboard focus is on Search box. If you click on the organize   drop-down  all the entries are enabled and clicking on them does nothing.     Expected:  As keyboard focus is on search box  all the entries should be disabled.    PS: Repros on Windows and Linux. Need to check on Mac.  Can't repro this  if user has more then one instance of Bookmark manager   (<a title="User can open multiple bookmark manager tabs per window." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39357"> issue 39357 </a>).   </pre>
