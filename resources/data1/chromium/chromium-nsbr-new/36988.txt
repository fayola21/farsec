<title>Issue 36988 -   chromium -    Data race in net/proxy/single_threaded_proxy_resolver_unittest.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi Eric     I've accidentally found <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/561083">http://codereview.chromium.org/561083</a>    Am I correct that you had real race in the unittest  it was detected by TSan and   then you saw it on the waterfall  and fixed it?    // Creating the issue just for the record to show up in the list of our &quot;trophies&quot; </pre>
