<title>Issue 38006 -   chromium -    LayoutTestshttptestsappcacheupdate-cache.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This particular appcache layout test is more quirky than most for some   reason.    * passes in test_shell  * passes in chrome with the inspector open  * passes in chrome provided a breakpoint is set         NotifyAllAssociatedHosts(NO_UPDATE_EVENT) in appcache_update_job.cc    * usually fails in chrome with no break points or w/o the inspector open    That's with DEBUG builds  not sure if release builds are different.   </pre>
