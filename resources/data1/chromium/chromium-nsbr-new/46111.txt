<title>Issue 46111 -   chromium -    Exclude OS-specific images from other OS' DLLs/theme packs/etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Apparently we can add conditionals in e.g. theme_resources.grd to restrict various images to specific OSes.  Doing this  and adding similar conditional logic to browser_theme_pack.cc  could let us shave the size of binaries that include these images on platforms that don't need them.    As an example  in email erg notes that IDR_*_TRANSPARENT are only used on GTK. </pre>
