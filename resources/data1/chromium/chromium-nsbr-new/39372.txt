<title>Issue 39372 -   chromium -    [Extensions] new tab extensions takes effect in incognito mode even without &quot;Allow this extension to run in incognito&quot; option checked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In incognito window install attached new tab extension  2. Click on &quot;+&quot; to open a new tab      The page is displayed as &quot;This webpage is not available&quot;  but it should  display the default incognito new tab page.    This seems because it tries to use the new tab extension' page as its new  tab page  but since new tab extension is not enabled in incognito yet  then  it displays webpage not available error. See attached screen-shot for  reference.       </pre>
