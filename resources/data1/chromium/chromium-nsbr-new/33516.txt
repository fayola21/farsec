<title>Issue 33516 -   chromium -    In IE8 when a new window is created in a ChromeFrame instance  it randomly bypasses the host network stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This happens when a page rendered in ChromeFrame uses a window.open call  to create a new window. In this case we don't get control over the   navigation as window.open calls expect to carry the opener relationship   over to the new window. This basically means that navigation occurs in   Chrome and the new tab/window created by the host attaches to the newly   created ExternalTabContainer instance.    In IE8 the new tab opens in a new IE process  which basically uses a new   automation channel to talk to Chrome. The host network stack implementation   routes network requests issued by registered render views to the host   browser over the automation channel. There is a timing window between the   new window getting created and issuing network requests and the channel   being established with the new iexplore instance. As a result network   requests issued by the new window don't use the host network stack.       </pre>
