<title>Issue 36551 -   chromium -    adobe-flashplugin is using 99% of one CPU  2 hours after last usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev    This is apparently intermittent. I noticed high CPU usage on my system   (Ubuntu 9.10) so I ran top. A chrome process (--type=plugin --plugin-  path=/usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin...) is using 99% of one CPU. I last used it   (watching a video) approx 2 hours ago; the tab from which I watched the show   has been closed.    I think you need a runaway process catcher  or similar - and/or need to   tighten up the existing  if it exists. </pre>
