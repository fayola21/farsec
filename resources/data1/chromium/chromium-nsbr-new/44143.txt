<title>Issue 44143 -   chromium -    Chrome - amharic -  messages show in English  even though they are translated - win 7 / vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38  (beta 5 on Windows)  OS: Win 7 and Vista      1. Load Chrome on Windows vista or win 7 in Amharic.  2. Navigate to the options screens  bookmark sync dialogs  location setting etc  3. Notice several messages still in English (see all attached)      These strings to show up in Amharic.        they appear in English  despite being confirmed as translated and pushed   so these appear to be i18n issues.   </pre>
