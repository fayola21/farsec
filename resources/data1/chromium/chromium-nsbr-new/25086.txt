Open chrome window with enough content to display scrollbars  2. Open another window with enough content to display scrollbars  3. Overlap windows  position cursor over overlapping area  4. Scroll up or down with scroll wheel      Only topmost window should scroll      Both windows scroll. The underlying window appears to receive a small   percentage of scroll events  causing it to scroll up/down as well  though   more slowly. </pre>
