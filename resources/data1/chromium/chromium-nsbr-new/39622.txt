<title>Issue 39622 -   chromium -    The tab bar doesn't correspond to the &quot;good&quot; GTK theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 beta      1. Change your theme for the OS's GTK theme in the option window  2. Ok  chrome is nice like this  3. But the tab bar is filled with the &quot;focus color&quot; of the GTK theme !      The background color/image in this area should be the GTK's default image   for tabs' background. See the screenshot : on the left  the current result.   On the right  what any GTK user expect to see.    Greeds !  And thanks for this great Linux version. </pre>
