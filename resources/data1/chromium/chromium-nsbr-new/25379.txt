<title>Issue 25379 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Scrollbar  tabstrip  minimize  maximize  and close buttons display partially/partly offscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.223.1 (29208)        My OS is windows xp sp3 english version  all the patches are latest.   The screen resolution is 1280*1024  and the chromium version is   4.0.223.1 (29208)  while I maximize chromium  the right scroll bar can   only be shown half  the other half was out of the screen  and seems   the close button on the top right was not fully showed. For other   windows  it can be shown correct  is that a bug?      </pre>
