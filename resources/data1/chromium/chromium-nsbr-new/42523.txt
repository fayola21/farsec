<title>Issue 42523 -   chromium -    Flash performance poor after integrated Flash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev mac    Ever since the integrated flash plugin was enabled in the dev channel  my flash performance has   gone way down. Every time I view a flash video  my fan starts spinning like crazy. I don't have this   problem in other browsers. If I go to about:plugins  it shows both the integrated flash plugin  and   the one I had for all browsers. </pre>
