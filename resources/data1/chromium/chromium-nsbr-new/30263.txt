<title>Issue 30263 -   chromium -    macosx/ppc prompts to install chrome from www.google.com+toolbar on firefox 3.5.5 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : not relevant      I visit www.google.com on my macosx 10.4.11 PPC (Eg  non intel) from  firefox 3.5.5 with googletoolbar installed (I don't know which version).   On some visits of www.google.com I'm prompted to install Chrome; there's an  extra box in the upper right corner of www.google.com asking for this.    This prompt box shouldn't appear.  You (we: I work for Google  rrh@google.com) don't have chrome for the non-intel macs.  Doesn't the  browser report back the HW platform upstream?   </pre>
