<title>Issue 28659 -   chromium -    Popups are not blocked properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to cf:<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a>    What is the expected output?   To see timesofindia webpage    What do you see instead?  It will be redirected to <a href="http://www.shaadi.com/popbehind/index.php?a=1">http://www.shaadi.com/popbehind/index.php?a=1</a>.   Even when I try to go back  I'll be redirected to this webpage again.    From what I see  there are two popups shown when we hit this website.   Chrome4.0.249.11 blocks those popups but ChromeFrame isn't able to do that.   Looks like there's something wrong with popups.   </pre>
