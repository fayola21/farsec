<title>Issue 44704 -   chromium -    Http-proxy settings are not respected/used under Gnome 2.30.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47050) dev  OS + version: Linux 2.6.32-22-generic #33-Ubuntu (10.1 LTS) SMP Wed Apr 28  13:28:05 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux  CPU architecture:: x86_64  Window manager: Gnome 2.30.0  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Does as intended    This is a problem that I addressed at Google IO with one of the Chrome  developers  so I'll do my best to explain the issue again:    1. Run a proxy server (I was doing this from the Android  so I was using  Proxoid (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/proxoid/)">http://code.google.com/p/proxoid/)</a>)  2. Apply the appropriate settings in the gnome-network-properties  (<a href="http://imgur.com/cHMhd.png">http://imgur.com/cHMhd.png</a>) (Using :8080)  3. Run chrome    Chrome shows that it is using the http-proxy settings as defined by Gnome.  However  when you visit a site no activity will occur.    As a comparison  Firefox-3.6.3 will work and use the settings.    Running tcpdump shows no activities on the interface during refreshes or  page changes.    $ tcpdump -l -n -i eth0  0 packets captured  0 packets received by filter  0 packets dropped by kernel    However  running tcpdump on the lo interface shows that it is redirecting.    $ tcpdump -l -n -i lo  16:02:03.261631 IP 127.0.0.1.49714 &gt; 127.0.0.1.8080: Flags [S]  seq  2704113179  win 32792  options [mss 16396 sackOK TS val 637814 ecr  0 nop wscale 7]  length 0  16:02:03.261639 IP 127.0.0.1.8080 &gt; 127.0.0.1.49714: Flags [R.]  seq 0  ack  2704113180  win 0  length 0    Forcing the `--proxy-server` option doesn't change anything.    $ google-chrome --proxy-server=http://localhost:8080/    Just to confirm that this is not some application-specific problem on the  Android  I used a simple proxy http server  (<a href="http://gnucitizen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/httpservers.py">http://gnucitizen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/httpservers.py</a>) and tested it  as well.    Firefox was using the service  but Chrome ignored it entirely. </pre>
