<title>Issue 28784 -   chromium -    Netflix instant play won't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.257.0 (33019)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMessage?msg=51">http://www.netflix.com/WiMessage?msg=51</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works        1. Try to watch any instant play video from netflix          Video plays.        I'm redirected to not supported page.    Now that Silverlight works on Chromium for Mac  there should be a way to   get this working. I'll file a complaint with Netflix too  but I'm wondering if   Chromium might be missing something here. </pre>
