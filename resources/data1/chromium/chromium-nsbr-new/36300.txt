<title>Issue 36300 -   chromium -    No program icon to start Chrome in safe mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/      1. Install Chrome 4 normally      The program group folder for Chrome should have an icon with the   description &quot;Google Chrome (Safe Mode)&quot; which starts Chrome with the   command-line parameter --disable-extensions      No such icon exists.    The description of &quot;program group folder&quot; may only apply to Windows.  But   however this setup is normally done for Linux and Mac  those platforms also   need a Chrome Safe Mode icon that is automatically created on normal   program install. </pre>
