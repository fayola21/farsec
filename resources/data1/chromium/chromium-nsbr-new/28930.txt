<title>Issue 28930 -   chromium -    Flash (libflashplayer.so process) consumes excessive CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome  2. Open multiple sites which use Flash  esp. sites where Flash advertising   is used (newspapers  magazines  etc).  3. Leave the browser inactive but running for a long period -- e.g. 8+   hours.      1. Chromium should realize that the browser is unused (no window or mouse   activity for N minutes (where the user should be able to set N) and stop   all CPU and network activity.  2. If the foreground (active window) contains *no* flash  then the activity   of the libflashplayer.so process should be suspended  if necessary by   issuing a SIGSTOP to the process (so it stops any and all CPU use).  When a   window using flash is activated one can send the flashplayer process a   SIGCONT to reactivate it.      In a nine hour session the chrome libflashplayer.so process consumed 3+   hours of CPU time (even though the browser was simply left running with all   the windows minimized overnight).    <b>Please provide
