<title>Issue 41133 -   chromium -    onDblClick event fired when first click does not occur within same element. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version =============================================  Google Chrome	5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev  		WebKit	533.4  		V8	2.2.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US)  		AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like Gecko)  		Chrome/5.0.371.0 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Load the attached .html test file.  2. Follow the two double click tests described      Only clicking twice rapidly /within/ an element should fire an onDblClick   event.  Clicking once outside the element and a second time on the element   (quickly) should not fire the event.      Regardless of the location of the first click  the onDblClick event is   fired (as long as the 2nd click ends on an element with that trigger).    Additional information:  This has only been tested on Linux. Please help me test on other platforms   to see if it happens elsewhere. </pre>
