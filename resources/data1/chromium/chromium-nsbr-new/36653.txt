<title>Issue 36653 -   chromium -    Mac: Page setup is not part of the print command - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Fail  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A    Chrome currently only allows setting the paper size and orientation for printing in the Page Setup   dialog. The separate Page Setup dialog makes sense where a dialog is not always displayed when the   print command is issued  as on Windows. This is not the case on the Mac  so I see little reason why   these settings should not be moved to the Print dialog.    We should get rid of the Page Setup dialog entirely and show the paper size / orientation settings in   the Print dialog  as Safari does. </pre>
