<title>Issue 24529 -   chromium -    On tab switch  we initially use backing stores even if they're the wrong size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open some tabs that have dark backgrounds and take a while to render.  Make   your window fairly small before looking at them.  Now maximize and switch to   one of them.  The content is briefly drawn at the old size before being   resized.    It seems like this must mean we're using the old backing stores even though   they're the wrong size.  It seems like it would be less disconcerting if we   discarded all our backing stores on window resize.    Darin  please comment if I've misdiagnosed. </pre>
