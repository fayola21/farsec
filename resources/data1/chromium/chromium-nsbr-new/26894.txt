<title>Issue 26894 -   chromium -    Disable &quot;Edit&quot; &quot;Delete&quot; Contextual menu options for &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> latform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.237.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31086">r31086</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open Contextual menu for &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder on BMB  2. Verify &quot;Edit&quot;  &quot;Delete&quot; options     Actual: &quot;Edit&quot;  &quot;Delete&quot; options are enabled.  ( Screen Shot attached )                &quot;Edit&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; functionality on OtherBookmarks folder doesn't effects anything. In fact they doesn't work.    What is the expected output?   &quot;Edit&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; should get disabled  Since OtherBookmarks is a standard folder on BMB. ( not like a ordinary folder )    Windows Behavior?  &quot;Edit&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; options are disabled. To perform Edit  Delete operations on OtherBookmarks they can be done via BookmarkManager.    Note: In Mac  We dont have BookManager completely implemented yet. (It is disabled on Wrench Menu). For now we don't be having any option to delete   OtherBookmarks via UI.           </pre>
