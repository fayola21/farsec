<title>Issue 38342 -   chromium -    Extensions icon has (rows of) pixels chopped off the bottom and other issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (that's extensions_section.png -- it's just the display  the file itself is fine)      1. Go to chrome://extensions/  2. Look closely at the bottom row.      The bottom row should match/mirror the top row  just like in the .png file.    Instead  on a 30&quot; monitor on Mac  it has two rows of pixels chopped off the bottom  making it   look lopsided. On a 24&quot; monitor on Windows and Linux  it has one row of pixels chopped off    making it look slightly lopsided.    Its borders also don't quite match that of the corresponding history icon; the extensions icon   looks a bit fuzzier.    On Mac  the colors of the extensions and history icons don't match (on my vaguely calibrated   monitor) either; does one of them have a color profile? </pre>
