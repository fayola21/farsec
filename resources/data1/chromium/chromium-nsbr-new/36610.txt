<title>Issue 36610 -   chromium -    Always show the menubar when the overlay is down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cole would like to always show the menubar when the overlay is down.  (This would also solve our   extra-14px problem).  The currently planned way to achieve this is to completely hide the menubar   (not auto-hide) and manually show it whenever the overlay is open.    We will need to modify mac_util::RequestFullscreen() slightly to support two fullscreen menubar   modes (AUTO_HIDE and NEVER_SHOW).  Plugins will continue to use AUTO_HIDE  and AUTO_HIDE   will take precedence over NEVER_SHOW (so if we fullscreen flash from within a fullscreen window    the menubar will switch to AUTO_HIDE mode).    We will also need to play around to determine the best time to show the menubar.  For now  I will   show it after the overlay animates in and before the overlay animates out. </pre>
