<title>Issue 24035 -   chromium -    merge the theme dll (default.dll) into chrome.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We originally put the theme images into a separate dll thinking that it   would be an easy way to change themes.  Now that we have themes  it turns   out we're not using separate theme files in the themes directory.    If we're not planning on using the themes directory  we should just merge   all the resources into chrome.dll and kill off the themes directory and   default.dll to get faster startup times.    Alternately  maybe we should come up with a way to pack themes into a single   file to speed up their startup (the perf bots show that start up with a   theme is a lot slower-- about 60% slower with a complex theme on the bot).    Even if we do this  it probably wouldn't be in the themes directory (since   themes are extensions) so we can still merge default.dll into chrome.dll. </pre>
