<title>Issue 37524 -   chromium -    new bookmark panel layout is ugly and broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 (Offizieller Build 40461) dev    The new layout of the bookmark panel is horrible:    The centered text of bookmark names results in different spaces from the favicon which looks   very confusing. Left aligned text with fixed space between the favicon and the text would be   much better.    Long lists of bookmarks that reach beneath the lower end of the screen cannot be scrolled   anymore  so that some bookmarks cannot be reached. This bug makes the bookmark bar   unusable in such cases.    Screenshot is attached.       </pre>
