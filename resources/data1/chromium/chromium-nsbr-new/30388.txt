<title>Issue 30388 -   chromium -    [Extensions] a blank browser action is displayed when install a new chrome build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Uninstall current chrome build (should be a previous build to 4.0.269.0)  2. Install chrome build 4.0.269.0 (Official Build 34401)        When chrome window is launched from First Run UI  there is a blank browser  action displayed. See attached screen-shot for reference.    Restart chrome can resolve this problem  and it seems the blank browser  action actually should be icon of Google Mail Checker extension         </pre>
