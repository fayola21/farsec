<title>Issue 30940 -   chromium -    Support Cancel() in ConnectJob - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ConnectJobs don't Cancel() properly.  TCPConnectJob doesn't have a problem   because the dns resolution jobs cancel properly  and   ClientSocketFactory::GetDefaultFactory() returns a Singleton  so it always   lives beyond the lifetime of IO thread tasks referencing the TCPConnectJob.    However  this isn't necessarily the case with tests which use   ClientSocketFactory members in test fixtures.  We should support   cancellation properly in ConnectJobs. </pre>
