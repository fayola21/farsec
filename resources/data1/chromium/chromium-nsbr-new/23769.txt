<title>Issue 23769 -   chromium -    Option to disable close button on tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> could you give a possibility to turn off ��_��_x�_ button on tabs? because if i   open a lot of them  and tabs become a little - so i always miss tabs and   click on ��_��_close�_ button.    you can make like in Opera - closing tabs only due to middle-mouse button. </pre>
