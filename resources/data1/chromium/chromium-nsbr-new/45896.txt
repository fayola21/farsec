<title>Issue 45896 -   chromium -    Need to figure out how to choose which password store to use on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux  there are (at least) three password stores that we can use: the   built-in (unencrypted) store  GNOME keyring  and (KDE) KWallet. Currently   we use the built-in store.    Recently I've brought the code we had for the other two stores back into   working order  but it remains to decide how to choose between the available   options. At first glance it seems like we should use GNOME keyring on   GNOME  KWallet on KDE  and the built-in store otherwise. However  switching   between desktop environments would then cause you to have multiple password   stores  and access to only one at a time depending on the desktop   environment.    There are a number of questions to work out:    * Should we allow the user to choose the store to use (e.g. between   &quot;current environment&quot;  &quot;gnome&quot;  &quot;kwallet&quot;  &quot;built-in&quot;) with either some new   UI or with a flag?    * Should we have some way to migrate passwords between stores  especially   from the built-in store to one of the other stores when that first becomes   an option?    * Should we remember if any store has saved passwords  and always try to   use that one? (In that case  how does the user force a different store?)    * Should there be some UI to warn when the unencrypted store is in use    e.g. an infobar or icon/text in the passwords and exceptions dialog? </pre>
