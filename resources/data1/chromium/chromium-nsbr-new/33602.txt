<title>Issue 33602 -   chromium -    Odd submit complete behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have one webpage that looks like:  &lt;form action=&quot;[other_page]&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; target=&quot;an_iframe&quot;&gt;    &lt;input name=&quot;Submit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;iframe name=&quot;an_iframe&quot; id=&quot;an_iframe&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;    2. Have the other_page be a link to a page with headers of type:  &quot;Content-Disposition:  attachment; filename = foo.txt&quot;    3. Now  load the first page in Chrome  and click the button.        You will have an opportunity to download the file foo.txt  and then a   'submit complete' event will fire in javascript (I believe this event is   captured using the onload of the iframe - but I'm not sure - an example   exists in the GWT framework I'm sure)        The download still occurs  however the 'submit complete' event will never   be thrown.  You can see this if you set up a similar sort of structure in   GWT and try to add a addSubmitCompleteHandler.  However  you can also see   the absence of an event using speed tracer.  Speed tracer will indicate   that it never received the response headers and will assume it's still   downloading the file.    <b>Please provide
