<title>Issue 26815 -   chromium -    keypresses inside gmail  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In linux chrome  load gmail  and start composing an email. You may need   to have keyboard shortcuts enabled.  2. Start typing an email. I need to type somewhat quickly to trigger the   behavior.  3. Occasionally when you hit space  you will get a &quot;Your message has not   been sent. &lt;two newlines&gt; Discard your message?&quot; prompt. I think that focus   is somehow being transferred to the Cancel button  but I don't know why or   how.        You should be able to type an email. Hitting space should result in a space   being inserted into the email.        The discard-draft dialog in gmail opens instead. The space also seems to be   inserted into the mail.      <b>Please provide
