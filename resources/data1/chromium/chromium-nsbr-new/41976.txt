<title>Issue 41976 -   chromium -    Aw Snap! appears quite often.   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9    First symptom is that it loses keyboard response.  For example  tabbing through a new contact form   in Gmail and suddenly the Tab key has not response.    This has not happened in any previous version - I have been quite impressed with how stable it is.    This is new since the last upgrade. </pre>
