<title>Issue 24337 -   chromium -    Nested message loops don't seem to work on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. sign into gmail  2. start a new email message in a new window (Shift-C)  3. address it to yourself  4. move the focus to the subject field  5. click discard button  6. say &quot;ok&quot; to the alert        The window should go away but it doesn't.  If you try to send an email with   an empty body  the alert from that also doesn't seem to let the message   go.    221.8 acts as listed  my current trunk debug build almost does the same   ting  except a second click on the discard results in sadtab for both the   popup compose and main browser.   </pre>
