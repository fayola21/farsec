<title>Issue 38893 -   chromium -    Trusted Pepper 2D plugins do not paint anything. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.359.0 (42181)    Test: use the pepper 2D test from src/webkit/tools/pepper_test_plugin  make sure that   dimensions=&quot;2&quot; in the &lt;embed&gt; tag in test_page.html.    Run Chromium on the Mac with these flags (note that both the --load-plugin= flag and the file:   option might require an absolute path):    Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --no-sandbox --internal-nacl --internal-pepper -  -enable-gpu-plugin --load-  plugin=/chromium/src/xcodebuild/Debug/PepperTestPlugin.plugin   file:///chromium/src/webkit/tools/pepper_test_plugin/test_page.html    With dimensions=&quot;2&quot;  I would expect to see a gradient rendered on the left-hand side of the   page.  Instead  there is nothing.  Note that events are passed through to the plugin; you can tell   because the log output shows them.    This issue is blocking development of the Native Client SDK.   </pre>
