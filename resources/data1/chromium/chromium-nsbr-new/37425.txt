<title>Issue 37425 -   chromium -    Ctrl+Ins  Shift+Ins  Ctrl+Del don't work with the numpad keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.0 dev        Firefox 3.x: OK  OS + version : Debian Lenny  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : KDE    The Ctrl/Shift+Ins/Del copy cur paste shortcuts don't work using the numpad   keys. They work in most other Linux applications. This is also the standard   behavior on Windows  as far as I remember.    This seems related to <a title="Numpad arrow keys don't work in render view" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19106"> Issue 19106 </a> which was recently fixed (thats for   that!) </pre>
