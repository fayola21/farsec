Enable user settings sync  2. Close the browser while the settings are being transmitted (?).    NOTE: Since I can't open chrome  I can't say that these steps will  reproduce the error correctly. This is only what I believe caused the issue.      Chrome launches without any errors.      Chrome does not launch.    When it is executed from the console (using &quot;/usr/share/google-chrome&quot;)  it  returns the following error:    [15302:15325:32396114600:FATAL:chrome/browser/sync/util/user_settings.cc(39)]  PRAGMA synchronous = 2  file is encrypted or is not a database  When it is executed from the console (using &quot;/usr/share/google-chrome&quot;)  it  returns the following error:    [15302:15325:32396114600:FATAL:chrome/browser/sync/util/user_settings.cc(39)]  PRAGMA synchronous = 2  file is encrypted or is not a database    This error can also be found in &quot;~/.xsession-errors&quot;      Additional Info  Reinstalling Chrome did not help. The browser still can't be opened. I have  not experienced this in the Windows version of Chrome. </pre>
