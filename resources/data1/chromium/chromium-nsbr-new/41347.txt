<title>Issue 41347 -   chromium -    might be able to do all process naming from the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> _LSASNCreateWithPid looks like it might let us do the activity monitor process naming from the   browser so we can tweak names after we start them instead of doing it in the startup path of those   processes.    this would also let us do things like name the extension processes with the extensions because the   knowledge is only in the browser. </pre>
