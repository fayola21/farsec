<title>Issue 44850 -   chromium -    Send notification from webkit when true content size of a page changes to prevent a polling loop in render view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  FrameView::adjustSize sets the content size to the max() of the content's height and   the container height. This means that if the content does not fill the container  the content size   will still be set to the container's height.    It is possible to get the content's true height using frame-&gt;document()-&gt;documentElement()-  &gt;scrollHeight()  but there is no corresponding event for when this changes.    This is required for the extension stuff. Right now  render_view.cc starts a polling timer that runs   at 100 Hz (see RenderView::OnEnablePreferredSizeChangedMode():      preferred_size_change_timer_.Start(TimeDelta::FromMilliseconds(10)  this                                        &amp;RenderView::CheckPreferredSize);    ).    Polling is bad  this should be fixed.    This is more or less the chromium version of <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32807">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32807</a>     so that it can go through triage.    (Due to unintended timer installation  this also caused <a title="Renderers idle at 1.5% cpu on mac" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44494"> issue 44494 </a>) </pre>
