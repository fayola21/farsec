<title>Issue 42235 -   chromium -    WidgetGtk::PaintNew invokes WidgetGtk::Paint recursively on gtk 2.18.6 under certain condition. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Observed with gtk+ 2.18.6  which chromeos is using.  I could not reproduce this with gtk+ 2.12.9  which gHardy is using.    Under certain condition  gtk_wndow_process_updates triggers  recursive calls to PaintNow  which makes drawing really slow.  Exact condition hasn't confirmed yet  but this may be happening when  we move child gdkwindow while painting.      </pre>
