<title>Issue 26025 -   chromium -    Badge overflow issues on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load test/data/extension/samples/make_page_red. When the badge text reaches   four chars  it should render centered  but instead it disappears.    I am not sure if this is happening because we think it overflows and so just   don't render it at all  or if there is a bug in the centering logic. But   four chars should fit  and once we exceed a certain width (see code)  we   should center the badge instead of right-aligning it. </pre>
