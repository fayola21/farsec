<title>Issue 36746 -   chromium -    Add sr_Latn and sr_Cyrl to Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome currently supports only sr UI language  which defaults to cyrillic   script. Both cyrillic and latin scripts are used in Serbia.    We should add sr_Latn UI locale to Chrome to support that fact.    Translation won't be an issue  since there is 1:1 correspondence between   cyrillic and latin (opposite is not true). We can change TC export script to   generate sr_Latn resources from sr.    We could add sr_Cyrl too  and make it equivalent to sr  to match the standard   naming. </pre>
