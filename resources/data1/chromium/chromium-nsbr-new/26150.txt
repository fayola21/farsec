<title>Issue 26150 -   chromium -    Right click on download buttons should show menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Download a file so that the download shelf appears with a button.  2. Right click on the button.        I expect right click to show the context menu. Yes  I can get the context   menu by clicking the button on the right edge  but shouldn't both do the same   thing?       </pre>
