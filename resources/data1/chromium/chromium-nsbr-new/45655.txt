<title>Issue 45655 -   chromium -    Inconsistent font rendering (hinting?) between identically-styled pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1.

I  /think/ that  technically  the Thompson_shell text is lightly hinted and  the Rc text is medium or fully hinted.  Light hinting is my configured  preference.    Please provide
