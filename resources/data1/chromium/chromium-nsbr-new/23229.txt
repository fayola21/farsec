<title>Issue 23229 -   chromium -    Don't make window fill available space unmaximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I keep seeing screenshots like this:  <a href="http://twitpic.com/jdxl5">http://twitpic.com/jdxl5</a>    I think we might  on small screens  be accidentally making the window the   size of the screen.  If the user wants Chrome to look like that they should   maximize it; we should start smaller so that maximize seems like an option. </pre>
