<title>Issue 30275 -   chromium -    About Box Installation No Longer Works - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : prior to (and maybe including) 4.0.266.0    Basically  Chrome refuses to update if its still running. I have to download   ChromeSetup.exe by first going to <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?</a>  extra=devchannel  clicking Accept and Install  cancelling the dialog that   appears and clicking &quot;If you are having trouble with the download  click   here.&quot; Then I close Chrome  run ChromeSetup.exe  and watch all the lovely   processes doing their thing in Process Explorer  and it installs it nicely   and runs Chrome again for me. </pre>
