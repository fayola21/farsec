<title>Issue 30736 -   chromium -    Extension pack dialog crashes chrome on non-ASCII characters in message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chrome with --lang=sr (or any other language with non-ascii success   message)  2. Try to pack an extension (go to chrome://extensions  enable developers   view)    What is the expected output?  Extensions crx and pam files are created and message   IDS_EXTENSION_PACK_DIALOG_SUCCESS_BODY_NEW is shown in dialog box.    What do you see instead?  Files are created  but Chrome crashes with WideToASCII check failure.       </pre>
