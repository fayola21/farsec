<title>Issue 45670 -   chromium -    Opening a new Chrome window does not take focus from other apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. In Ubuntu (tried in Karmic and Lucid)  make a link to Chrome and a link   to Terminal [or any other windowed app] in the Ubuntu menu bar.  2. Press the Terminal icon to open and focus a terminal.  3. Press the Chrome icon to open Chrome.        The address bar is focused in Chrome.        The terminal is still focused.    If no other applications are focused on the desktop [e.g. there are no   other open applications or the desktop itself is focused]  Chrome will be   focused upon startup.  Also  if another Chrome window was focused when I   clicked on the Chrome icon (or pressed Ctrl-N)  the new window is correctly   focused.    The same behavior happens if I use keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse   clicks to start Terminal and Chrome.    This is the most annoying when I press a keyboard shortcut to start Chrome    realize I needed to do one more thing in my other application  and press   Ctrl-W -- closing my other application instead of the new Chrome window.   </pre>
