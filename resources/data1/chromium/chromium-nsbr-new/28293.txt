<title>Issue 28293 -   chromium -    Need to release source code along with binary releases - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Downstream distributors of Chromium want to be able to check out the code   used in version x.y.z.  That is  if we make a security fix  we need a branch   containing both the version number and the security fix.    It sounds like people are working on making us have regular release branches   but the infrastructure is not quite yet in place. </pre>
