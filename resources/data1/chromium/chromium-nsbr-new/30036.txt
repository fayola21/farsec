<title>Issue 30036 -   chromium -    Bundle changs by datatype before dispatching to ChangeProcessor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In certain cases  such as initial sync  we end up with a heterogeneous batch   of updates. We want to invoke each ChangeProcessor with and only with the   changes to its associated type if and only if these are present.  Probably   something like the ChangeReorderBuffer (or it itself) needs to be   responsible for bundling up all the changes to a particular type into sets   of input for ApplyModelChanges just prior to dispatch (when the   ChangeReorderBuffer is currently invoked).   </pre>
