<title>Issue 39350 -   chromium -    Ctrl-click on link sometimes follows link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Never seen it happen  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Never seen it happen      The problem isn't reproducible reliably. When I hold Control and click on a link (intending to copy   the link target) sometimes Chrome will follow the link. It still brings up the right-click menu  so I   can still copy the link. If I go back and right click the link again  it doesn't make the same mistake.   One time I got it to happen again by closing the browser without the page in a tab  restarting    reopening the page  and then right clicking on the link  but that hasn't worked again. </pre>
