<title>Issue 25822 -   chromium -    Omnibox goes really wrong when we fail to load the history database - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Simulate a sqlite failure by making your history unreadable (i.e. chmod -  r profile/Default/History*).  2) Start Chrome.  3) Observe that even for URLs you've never visited  like entering &quot;test.com&quot;   into the URL bar  Chrome will do a search instead of loading the URL.    Without having looked at the code I'd guess something early-exits.      I guess we should either:  1) refuse to start if we're in this state  2) put up the scary &quot;your history is screwed dialog&quot; that Tony says we have   for other circumstances; not sure if that trudges onward or not      This is likely the mystery bug that has been affecting Googlers for months! </pre>
