<title>Issue 29835 -   chromium -    Allow PermanentItemPopulator to be triggered for other data types independently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently trigger the PermanentItemPopulator (to create top level   singleton folders for a user) when a get updates request from timestamp 0   occurs.  It is safe to trigger this code path more than once per user for a   particular set of folders (like Bookmarks)  but the user can decide to 'start   syncing' a particular data type independently of others (in development    this could be a per-type command line flag. In prod  this could be a dialog   box UI for selecting synced types).      Proposals include:  storing data on the cosmo user object (blocked on   issue 29834)  or sending a bit (or timestamp  see note) in protocol buffer   requests that a client could set to 1 if it believes the populator may need to   run (e.g a new data type is now being synced).  For the latter  the bit would   be reset by the server once the folders necessary have been created.    Note: timestamp may be useful to solve the case where the client enables   an Nth type before the server has responded saying the N-1th type top   level folders were created. </pre>
