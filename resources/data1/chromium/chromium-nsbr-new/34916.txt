<title>Issue 34916 -   chromium -    HTTP Authorization - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.24 (Official Build 27347)  URLs (if applicable) :  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. login is using normal 401 Authorization (HTML Auth.). that require   username and password..  2. just login to any of these  and try to logout.. well it won't logout   just visiting the page again will not ask for username and password it will   enter the site normally even thought you already logged out.  3. I thought it was a website glitch or the webmail app. I use bug  so I   tried other webmail apps. but the same goes  then I tried the whole website   cpanel ( which uses another access port ) and the same goes again.  4. I thought it maybe some unstandardized scripts/code they use  so I tried   Firefox and IE but both of these works normally. Safari in another hand had   the same <a title="Java not working yet" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5"> issue  5 </a>. After more search I found that 401 Auth. it self has no standard logout    so the apps that uses this method will have to make some workarounds  and   one of these is to resend a non-working username and password. so it will   refuse the access but not logout.  6. This issue is already found in cPanel discussion forum and several other   sites/forums with workaround.  7. I know this is not a Chrome/Webkit bug as it's the standard way to do   things but just to report it. I think you may want to contact cPanel   developers so they can find the solution for it    What is the expected result?   - It must logout.    What happens instead?   - It won't logout.    Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  possible. </pre>
