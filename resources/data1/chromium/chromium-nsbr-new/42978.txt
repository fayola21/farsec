<title>Issue 42978 -   chromium -    Issue with &quot;Most popular&quot; extension list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As of today's stats  my extension (   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ibhehjeahclandhcpbajhdfje..">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ibhehjeahclandhcpbajhdfje..</a>.   ) has 1107 users and 28 ratings  but it doesn't appear on the &quot;Most   popular&quot; list.    The &quot;Most popular&quot; list has extensions on it that only have a few user   and ratings - the most extreme case has only one user and one rating.   I would expect my extension to be regarded as more popular that this   extension  so I'm confused as to why it's not above it on the list  or   on the list at all. </pre>
