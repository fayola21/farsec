<title>Issue 28240 -   chromium -    Request: option to keep the process running even if there is existing browser instance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 31796 (google-chrome-unstable debian package:   4.0.245.1-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31796">r31796</a>)  OS + version : Debian (mixed testing  unstable  experimental)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : metacity (as part of gnome)  URLs (if applicable) : -  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): -  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): -      1. Configure Google Chrome as &quot;preferred application&quot; for web browsing   using Gnome preferences dialog.  2. Have an existing instance of Google Chrome open.  3. Run webhttrack      webhttrack's server should stay up-and-running.      Since Google Chrome process immediately exits after informing an existing   instance to take over  webhttrack wrapper concludes the user has closed the   browser and exits the server. It is not possible to keep using webhttrack.          It would be neat if there were an option in Google Chrome to make the   process stay open even if the request is just redirected to an existing   instance. It would be even better if the process stayed open for as long as   the tab (and its children  if possible) exists  thus keeping any calling   program informed that the operation is not yet complete.    While the only program I can currently think of that depends on this   behavior is webhttrack  there is probably other programs that do.    Demo of chrome+webhttrack's behavior:  :~$ webhttrack  /usr/bin/webhttrack(8535): launching /usr/bin/x-www-browser  /usr/bin/webhttrack(8535): spawning regular browser..  Created new window in existing browser session.  /usr/bin/webhttrack(8535): browser exited  /usr/bin/webhttrack: line 158:  8550 Killed                    ${BINPATH}/htsserver &quot;${DISTPATH}/&quot; path &quot;${HOME}/websites&quot; lang &quot;${LANGN}&quot;   $@      Workaround: under debian  directly call /usr/lib/httrack/htsserver    /usr/share/httrack/ </pre>
