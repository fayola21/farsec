<title>Issue 31306 -   chromium -    Find next/previous buttons in find bar not enabled/disabled properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See &lt;<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/518009">http://codereview.chromium.org/518009</a>&gt; (committed) and also   &lt;<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/500082">http://codereview.chromium.org/500082</a>&gt; (defunct).    Currently  on Windows and Linux  the buttons are enabled all the time (the   first CL mentioned above changed the behaviour on Windows to this).   Apparently  the reason this is preferred over disabling the buttons (when   there are no search results found) is that the state of the buttons isn't   properly updated if loading continues and new search results are found.   (Side note: I believe Mac still has the old  broken disabling behaviour.)    Leaving the buttons enabled is understandably preferable to having   buttons disabled when they shouldn't be (since the former does no harm   whereas the latter takes away functionality from the user). However  it may   be preferable to properly enable/disable the buttons  in particular re-  enable the buttons if new search results are found. </pre>
