<title>Issue 42404 -   chromium -    Feature request: Domain Correction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For example a domain is only available under &quot;www.test.com&quot; but I typed   &quot;test.com&quot;. It would be very useful if it could add the &quot;www.&quot; on it's own   if it can't find a connection. Of course it should be also the other way   around.   </pre>
