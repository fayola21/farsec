<title>Issue 38705 -   chromium -    Status bubble sometimes gets detached when dragging tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have a consistent repro for this  but every now and then when I drag Chrome windows on   Mac OS X  the status bubble gets stuck on the screen and stops following the window as it is being   moved.    After releasing the mouse  the bubble generally pops back into place.  I am using 5.0.342.1. </pre>
