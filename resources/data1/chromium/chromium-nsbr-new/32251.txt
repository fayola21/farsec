<title>Issue 32251 -   chromium -    Drag n' drop folders to the Extensions page and load theme as unpacked extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/                          It would have been really helpful and time-saving if (when in developer   mode) dragging and dropping folders in Extensions page would load then as   unpacked extensions.    This way  a great deal of clicks+browser+(re)select could be skipped   resulting in way smoother development workflow.    Thanks. </pre>
