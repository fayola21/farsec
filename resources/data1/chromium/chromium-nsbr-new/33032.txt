<title>Issue 33032 -   chromium -    Namespace cleanup: Rename all misnomers of the current Autocomplete feature (Autofill  FormFieldHistory  etc.) to Autocomplete - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently there are several different names in the code to describe the   Autocomplete feature  among them being Autofill  FormFieldHistory.  These   should be renamed to Autocomplete*  where Autocomplete is the completion of   a single control element in a form. </pre>
