<title>Issue 40623 -   chromium -    Typo in any try bot name silently fails to run any try jobs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. git try -b linux -b linux_views    What is the expected output?   Error like &quot;linux_views is not a valid try bot&quot;    What do you see instead?  Results will be emailed to: mattm@chromium.org  Patch 'r-tfarina-gtkundupe1-4ddfd3' sent to try server: linux  linux_views    (but no try jobs run  not even on the correctly spelled bots.)    Running with -vvvvv I see the http try fails:  WARNING:root:('http protocol error'  0  'got a bad status line'  None)  And then it falls back to svn try  which &quot;succeeds&quot;   </pre>
