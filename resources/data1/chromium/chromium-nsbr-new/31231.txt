<title>Issue 31231 -   chromium -    Alert before closing all tabs when using CTRL+SHIFT+W - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;4.0.266.0&gt;    Some time I am closing 1 tab by pressing CTRL+W.  Then I trying to restore it by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+W (insted off   ctrl+shift+T)  and BOOM all chrome tabs dissaper without any notice.    I think that it's will be usefull to add an alert when Chrome going to close   more than 1 tab  when using a shortcut.   </pre>
