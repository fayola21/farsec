<title>Issue 25104 -   chromium -    Plugins that crash during initialization hang the entire renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So far that I'm aware of  both the Move Networks media player and Shockwave   for Director hang the render if you visit a page with their content and have   the plugin installed.    Neither plugin works in Safari on 10.6 in my testing  and we have bugs for   having real support for them at some point  but we really shouldn't hang the   whole renderer. Since the same thing happens with multiple plugins  and it's   on the renderer side  I'm assuming this is a general problem.    Tentatively marking as beta-blocking  since the experience is pretty bad   (although it may be that the beta solution is just to blacklist any plugin that   has this problem). </pre>
