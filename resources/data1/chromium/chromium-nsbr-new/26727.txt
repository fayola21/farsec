<title>Issue 26727 -   chromium -    Plugin library loading/reloading/unloading lifecycle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install an extension with a plugin with &quot;library loaded/unloaded&quot; hooks  2. Do a &quot;reload&quot; on chrome://extensions         a1) library loaded   a2) library unloaded    a3) library loaded   a4) library unloaded   a5) library loaded    (a1) and (a2) account for the MIME detection phase (I think).       a1) library loaded   a2) library unloaded    a3) library loaded   ...   a4) library loaded    In other words  it seems Chrome just performs dlopen() without going   through the intermediate step of unloading.  This causes some problems with   plugins relying on global variables.      <b>Please provide
