<title>Issue 44495 -   chromium -    Error code 0xc0000135 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Installed Counter-strike : condition-zero (but my brother also has it  installed and his chrome works perfectly)            The URL must proceed without any error messages.      When Chrome opens up  this error dialog is flashed :  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FlkHh.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/FlkHh.jpg</a>    The first tab page works  but when I try to open up more than one tab  the  error msg again flashes and I'm not able to go to any URL from that Tab page.    One more issue  I tried running chrome under 'XP compatibility mode (SP3)'-  then the error code differs - its 0xc00000a5 then .. but still  I'm not  able to go to the desired URL (after the error dialog appears)    Also  I've tried restarting the whole system  still the error persists..  I've tried uninstalling (I have done a complete uninstall - by deleting all  types of 'browsed data' as well as manually going and deleting the data in  C:UsersxxxAppdataGoogleChrome) and re-installing Chrome back as well.  The error code still persists. All other browsers work fine though.    also  I tried uninstalling and trying the new BETA release. It also suffers  from the same error msg.    <b>Please provide
