<title>Issue 32234 -   chromium -    evangelism - thanks for trying chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you download Chrome  this page  <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/thankyou.html?oneclickinstalled=">http://www.google.com/chrome/thankyou.html?oneclickinstalled=</a>  says the message:    &quot;Thanks for trying Google Chrome!&quot;    I feel this is poor wording  which encourages people to give it a try  and   then switch back.  A more committed message would be good.    &quot;Thanks for downloading Google Chrome!  You are on your way to a better   internet experience&quot;    Mainly its the word 'Try' I don't like.  We dont tell people they should   &quot;Try&quot; google search and other products.  A closer equivalent would be   Picasa:  <a href="http://picasa.google.com/thanks.html">http://picasa.google.com/thanks.html</a>  It says &quot;Thank you for downloading Picasa 3.6&quot;    and shows a bit more about why its great  and a button &quot;Get Started with   Picasa Web Albums&quot;.  That plunges them in    A bit of careful wording could help reduce attrition.     </pre>
