<title>Issue 27177 -   chromium -    remove the multiple profile code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Does the multiple profile code even work these days?  If not  it should be   removed (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=6333">r6333</a>)    I noticed it because the changed added a member variable to BrowserProcess    which is supposed to be an abstract interface (it should be in   BrowserProcessImpl).   </pre>
