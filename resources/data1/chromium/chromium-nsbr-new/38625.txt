<title>Issue 38625 -   chromium -    Default fonts are weired in the development release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.0 dev  OS                   : Ubuntu Lucid     Just updated to the latest development release of google chrome and now the   fonts look weired. Its clearly noticeable that the fonts are not Times New   Roman  Arial and courier and I suspect it to be ttf-liberation and I have   used Liberation many times. It would be great if chrome uses the opensource   fonts but at the moment these theme dont look good. </pre>
