<title>Issue 41390 -   chromium -    Can��_��_��_t tab away from &lt;select&gt; pop-ups that have been opened  breaks other content keys like backspace  arrows  back/forward  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps to reproduce:    1. Visit any page that has a &lt;select&gt; pop-up  such as this one   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>).    2. Click on a &lt;select&gt; pop-up and make a choice.    3. Press tab.    Observed result: focus stays on the &lt;select&gt; pop-up.    Expected result: focus should advance to the next element.    This regressed in the 371 dev build.  The problem is still present in 375.6. </pre>
