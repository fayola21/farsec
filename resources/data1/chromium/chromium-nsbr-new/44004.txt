<title>Issue 44004 -   chromium -    &quot;Show as Tab&quot; option for popups on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  you can right click on a popup's title bar and choose &quot;Show as Tab&quot; to give the popup   a tab that can be dragged around (e.g.  into other windows).  There does not appear to be any UI for   this on Mac or Linux  and copy/pasting the URL doesn't always work (e.g.  Gmail message windows).    Can we add UI for this (in an appropriate way for each platform)? </pre>
