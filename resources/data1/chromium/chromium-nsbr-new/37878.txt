<title>Issue 37878 -   chromium -    Report Bug or Broken Website��_��__ not accessible from outside of page menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The page and wrench menus aren't visible by default on the Mac  but the Report Bug or Broken   Website��_��__ command is only available from the page menu.  We should stash it somewhere in the   menu bar too.  As it stands now  the command is completely non-discoverable.    Where to put it?    Either View or File seem like the only viable options  although it doesn't really fit well within either.    View would make sense because it's where we've put this item's neighbors from the page menu   (zoom  encoding  and developer). </pre>
