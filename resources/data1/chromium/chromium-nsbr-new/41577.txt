<title>Issue 41577 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager - Show address and path - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.7    I really like new one row per item in bookmark manager. But I think it   should always show address. I need it.    I need to see bookmark path when make a search.    Address text is too transparent. Please make it more visible.    In long named bookmarks I can't see address. What do you think about a   resizable columnlist? So I can resize &quot;name&quot; column and I can see &quot;address&quot;   column well. And it becomes more similar to old manager. And maybe   columnlist solve bookmark path problem?  Also with columnlist I can sort bookmarks name  address or path. </pre>
