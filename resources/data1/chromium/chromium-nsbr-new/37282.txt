<title>Issue 37282 -   chromium -    password and exception - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Password and exception list in option menu  should be better protected with   password or similar security layer to prevents easy access for other. It is   storing my online banking details there which is easily visible to other.     Perhaps a password to de-encrypt the Password and exception list (64 bit   protection).     This is major major security breach and must be addressed ASAP. I preferred   to store password there but need much better security.     So far  so good...very smooth and fast. Would be good to make all bookmark   text hidden  which only show text when my mouse hover above them and have multi-row bookmark (like I use in firefox). This would be most popular.      </pre>
