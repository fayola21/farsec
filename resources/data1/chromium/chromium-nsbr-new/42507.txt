<title>Issue 42507 -   chromium -    Closing currently tab returns focus to (subjectively) wrong tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 (Official Build 45275) dev             Safari 4: activates tab directly left of closed tab    Firefox 3.x: activates tab directly left of closed tab             IE 8: activates tab directly left of closed tab      1. Go to any page (call this tab A).  2. Open two tabs from it (B and C).   3. Optionally move B out of the way  to verify whether tab order has any   influence on the issue (seems it doesn't).  4. Activate then close tab C. Focus returns to tab B. Seems ok this time.  5. Reactivate tab A  and open another tab from it (D).  6. Activate and close tab D. Focus again returns to tab B instead of A.  7. Keep repeating. Focus always returns to old tab B rather than parent (and   most recently active and adjacent) tab A  forcing you to keep manually   reselecting A.      When closing tab  focus should return to either an adjacent tab (as all other   browsers seem to do)  or even the most recently &quot;created or activated&quot; (vs   just &quot;created&quot;).      Focus returns to most recently created tab still open  even if it was opened   long ago  has not been recently active  and has no relation to the tab just   closed.    </pre>
