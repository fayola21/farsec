<title>Issue 38380 -   chromium -    Can't type ��__  ��__ and ��__ in the address bar when using U.S. International ��_��_��_ PC keyboard layout on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5.0.307.11 beta @ Mac OS 10.6.2    Reproduction:    1. Cmd + T (to open a new tab)  2. Cmd + L (to switch to the address bar of the newly generated tab)  3. now type: &quot;google m��__nchen&quot; (you can type the &quot;��__&quot; by typing &quot;&quot;&quot; and   pressing &quot;u&quot; afterwards)    As you see  you have to type the &quot;��__&quot; REALLY fast to type it at all. In all other   fields you have plenty of time for it. Basically after typing &quot;&quot;&quot; the double quotes (a modification in this case) are removed immediately and you have   almost no time to press the &quot;u&quot; key.    A really disgusting BUG(!) for &quot;International Germans&quot;. </pre>
