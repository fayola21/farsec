<title>Issue 40844 -   chromium -    Crash in autofill model associator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I get this crash intermittently.  This was before I filled in my autofill++ stuff  so I think it's related to   regular autofill:    [36845:14343:83411561174756:FATAL:/Users/akalin/src/chromium/src/chrome/browser/  sync/glue/autofill_model_associator.cc(386)] Check failed: id_map_.find(*autofil  l) == id_map_.end().  </pre>
