<title>Issue 25547 -   chromium -    Allow GCF to &quot;fake&quot; Chrome UA for testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be helpful for testing sites that may not have been refitted for GCF   yet to allow a developer to send the Chrome UA from IE to defeat browser   sniffing. It'd be awesome if this could be done with a registry setting or   similar. </pre>
