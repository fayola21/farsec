<title>Issue 26733 -   chromium -    Use of freed Blacklist pointer during shutdown. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Profile owns a Blacklist pointer.    This pointer is shared with a ChromeURLRequestContext.    The problem is that during shutdown  things happen in this order:    (1) Start destroying the Profile  (2) Post a task to release ChromeURLRequestContext on the IO thread.  (3) Delete the profile's BlackList  ...  (4) Stop the IO thread.    Until the IO thread has been stopped  the ChromeURLRequestContext   could still be used. If it is used after step (3)  then it may be using freed   memory. </pre>
