<title>Issue 42129 -   chromium -    Cannot drag bookmark star to bookmark bar like before - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9  URLs (if applicable) : Any           Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: -           IE 7: -            IE 8: -       1. Open page  2. Try to drag bookmark star to bookmark bar/folder        I should be able to drag the star and make a bookmark in the desired   position/folder        The bookmark popup is activated on mouse down and I cannot drag it to the   desired position. I have to bookmark it first  browse through a list of   several hundred bookmarks (as it's bookmarked at last position) and drag it   to the desired position on the bookmark bar.    The idea behind this report is that i bookmark a lot of stuff I need to   read through the day and use the bookmark bar as a simple &quot;to-read&quot;. When i   read an article I remove it from the bookmark bar or do whatever is needed   with it. So I need the latest To-Read stuff to be visble on the bar. This   was possible before changing the bookmark star.       </pre>
