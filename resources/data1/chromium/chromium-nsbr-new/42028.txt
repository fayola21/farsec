<title>Issue 42028 -   chromium -    Mac BMB UI review: m6 tasks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Did UI review with Cole of the bookmark bar (and folders et al).  Here are the items for M6 (not for   M5).  - type a key to pick a new item (prefix match) of a bookmark when a folder is open  - use a 1-pixel border  not 2 pixels  for the bookmark folder menu (and use 50% grey)  - scroll faster  - pulse a new bookmark once created to show it's new  - animations for DnD   </pre>
