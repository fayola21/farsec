<title>Issue 33063 -   chromium -    Allow SyncerThread to be paused - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to allow pausing where the current SyncSession is allowed to finish   up (in other words the call to SyncMain in ThreadMainLoop should run to   completion first)  and the thread can then check some condition to decide   whether or not it needs to pause momentarily.  This might be similar to what   it has to do at startup  e.g CheckAllActiveTypesAreAssociated()  and would   probably be easiest to implement by using the same condvar used throughout   ThreadMainLoop  and signalling once the condition is met (in this case  that   all active types are associated). </pre>
