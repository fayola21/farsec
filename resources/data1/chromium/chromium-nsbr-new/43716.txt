<title>Issue 43716 -   chromium -    Mac: IDNs not displayed if language isn't the first option in Language list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to System Preferences-&gt;Languages &amp; Text  2. Set Arabic as the second language in the list.  3. Navigate to http://��_��_��_��__.��__��__��__��_��_��_��_-��__��_����_��_�����__��_��_��_��_.��_����_��_��_/ (an arabic IDN)        Arabic is on the language list so the IDN shouldn't be changed to punycode.    Instead it's changed to punycode as if Arabic is on the list.    For security reasons that are out of the scope of this bug (See <a title="New Arabic domain does not display properly in omnibox" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43519"> issue 43519 </a>) we change IDNs to   punycode if the language isn't on the accept language list.    Sidenote: On the Mac we only use the first language in the system prefs to form the accept language   list (not on file in our bug tracker - only <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3510">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3510</a>).    The new Arabic IDNs are pretty high profile  it would be nice to do the right thing here esp. if it can   be decoupled from the WebKit issue. </pre>
