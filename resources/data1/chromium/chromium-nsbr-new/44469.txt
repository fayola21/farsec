<title>Issue 44469 -   chromium -    Zygote-Sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Description of problem:  Google Chrome's Zygote-Sandbox chroots each and every new tab as it is  being created. A Super User is required to set a chroot. If an obfuscated  script prevents the tab from dropping root the entire system is  compromised. Please force a change in Google's behaviour on Linux.    Additional info:  The zygote_main_linx.cc (src/chrome/browser) file contains code that calls  the sandbox.h (src/sandbox/linux/seccomp) header. The header declares an  external variable &quot;C&quot;  which to the sandbox.c (src/sandbox/linux/suid)  translates too 'chroot' me (line 63). This happens with every fork and it  must stop! It is a compromise of the total system  the root! </pre>
