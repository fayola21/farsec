<title>Issue 32565 -   chromium -    No way to remove the download status bar using the keyboard. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some people prefer to use only the keyboard (when possible).    Chrome already has decent keyboard support (even better with extensions like   Vimium)  but I couldn't find a way to clear the download bar  or to open the   &quot;Show all downloads&quot; page. </pre>
