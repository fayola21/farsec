<title>Issue 27591 -   chromium -    Chrome extensions need a way to repost a page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    I'm doing a page reload extension  similar to the functionality in Opera.     I've got it all working nicely  except for POSTs.     In Opera  if you auto-reload a page which was obtained via a POST it will auto-post to the URL   periodically. This is the behavior I'd like to emulate.       chrome.tabs.update(tab_id  {url: url}); doesn't work (that does a GET  which I guess makes sense   as a default)     chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab_id  {code: 'window.location.reload()'}); should probably work  but   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6429">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6429</a> means this is actually done as a GET.     I'd like either   1) an API to repost the page  or   2) access to the POST-data (parameters) which were used to generate the page.    Option (1) is easier for me  but option (2) could be useful in other situations (and I could   dynamically generate a form and submit that to emulate reloading  so it would work for me  too)  </pre>
