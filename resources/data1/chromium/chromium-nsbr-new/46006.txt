Open multiple tabs.  2. Login as a GAIA user  sign out and relogin as some other user - GAIA or   corp.  3. Open Bookmarks manager.   - Try showing/ hiding bookmark bar and open Bookmarks manager again.    What is the expected output?   Bookmarks manager should either list Bookmarks of logged in user or prompt   for user login.    What do you see instead?  After opening Bookmarks manager a few times  it appears blank.     # Reboot or signout of Chrome OS fixes the issue.  # Issue has been seen more than 7 times. I will try to give more consistent   steps. </pre>
