<title>Issue 44911 -   chromium -    Make app tab entrance/exit work beautifully - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Launch (eg  from launcher)    * Refocus existing app tabs in the same browser when launching an app from the launcher    * Extra points: Navigating a tab with no history should count as launching (so ctrl+t  m/  which   eventually redirects to the extent of gmail  should count as launching)    * Navigating into an app    * If the URL of a tab changes (including redirects) so that it enters an app's extent  and the   current tab is not an app tab for that app  create a new app tab for that app and complete the load   there.    * Do not copy the history.    * We can end up with multiple app tabs for a single app in the same browser. New app tabs   should be initially positioned to the right of any existing app tabs for the same app.    * Navigating out of an app    * If the URL of an app tab changes (including redirects) so that it leaves that app's extent and   browse extent  open a new tab (either normal or the corresponding app) and continue the load   there.    * Do not copy the history.  </pre>
