<title>Issue 26542 -   chromium -    Using CSS to resize Canvas results in incorrectly sized backing store - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug follows <a href="http://crbug.com/26515">http://crbug.com/26515</a> .      1. Visit <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/603/webgl-now-available-in-webkit-">http://webkit.org/blog/603/webgl-now-available-in-webkit-</a>  nightlies/ on Windows with a build of Chrome supporting WebGL and --no-  sandbox --enable-webgl passed on the command line.  2. View one of the samples like &quot;spinning cube&quot;.    Expected:  See full resolution rendering.    Actual:  Rendering results are blocky.    The root cause is that the backing store of the Canvas (the SkBitmap) is   apparently its default size of 300x150  but the Canvas's rendering context   thinks that the Canvas is roughly 900x900. The OpenGL rendering results are   necessarily being scaled down to the size of the backing store  and then   are being scaled up during the page rendering process.    The same issue should appear with 2D content rendered into a Canvas which   has had its width and height modified via CSS.   </pre>
