<title>Issue 24329 -   chromium -    release memory on minimize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.6      1. Minimize Chrome        Chrome releases some memory.        Chrome continues to use the same amount of memory.    Firefox by default acts in the same way  but provides the   config.trim_on_minimize option to aggressively release memory when   minimized - the trade-off is sluggishness on restore.    It would be nice if Chrome could work out some compromise - perhaps by   releasing memory in background tabs or something. </pre>
