<title>Issue 35077 -   chromium -    Translate infobar shouldn't disappear and reappear when translating - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a page in a language you don't speak (lemonde.fr)  2. Choose &quot;Translate&quot; on the Translate infobar    Notice that the infobar disappears and then reappears once the translating   finishes.     Instead  we should replace the &quot;Translate&quot; and &quot;Nope&quot; buttons to   &quot;Translating...&quot; and then  once the page is translated  change the text to   the &quot;Page has been translated&quot; text WITHOUT hiding/showing the bar.    NOTE: We probably don't have &quot;translating...&quot; as a string. One option would   be to use &quot;loading...&quot; for the initial release. </pre>
