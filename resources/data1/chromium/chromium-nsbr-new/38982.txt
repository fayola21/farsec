<title>Issue 38982 -   chromium -    Implement final Core Animation drawing trigger - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  we drive IOSurface updates for CoreAnimation on a 50 Hz timer  which isn't ideal. There   are discussions happening on plugin-futures about the right way for browsers who need to know   when the layer has been update to find that out  but it's still up in the air.    Once there's a solution  we need to remove out timer and use the new approach instead. (And if we   are somehow stuck with a timer  we should use a shared timer like we do for Carbon idle events.) </pre>
