<title>Issue 40933 -   chromium -    back button issue w/ jsMath - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load URL above.  2. Wait for jsMath to render.  3. Try to use back button... it won't work!      The jsMath rendering engine is supposed to continually reprocess the page    but the browser should not treat these reprocessings as loading new pages.   In particular  the back button should take me to the previous page I was   visiting  not keep me on the page I'm at.      The back button doesn't work. (This is similar in effect to issues which   existed years ago when using Google Books on Firefox: each time one paged   up or down in the book  the browser treated this as going to a new webpage    presumably for some javascript reason. So when one tried to use the back   button  there could be tens or hundreds of pages of the same google book in   the queue  making it impossible or inconvenient to navigate back to the   REAL site that was one back from the google book.)    <b>Please provide
