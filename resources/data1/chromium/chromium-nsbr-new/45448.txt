<title>Issue 45448 -   chromium -    Relative sized SVG backgrounds should adapt to viewport when the document doesn't fill the viewport - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0 (48577)         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: Unsupported           IE 7: Unsupported           IE 8: Unsupported    Opera 10.5x: OK      1. Set a SVG image using relative dimensions as background-image for a   document.  2. Load the document in a browser window bigger than the extent of the   document content.      An absolute sized background image  vector or raster  will occupy the necessary space in the viewport  regardless of the dimension of the   document. Likewise  one would expect a SVG background with a height of 100%   to at least cover the height of the browser viewport.      When the document doesn't fill the viewport  relative sized background   images will be sized according to the document dimensions  leaving an   arbitrary sized gap. See attached test. </pre>
