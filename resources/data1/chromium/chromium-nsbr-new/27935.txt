<title>Issue 27935 -   chromium -    Worker processes can be left in a zombie state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you sit in a tight loop creating workers/reloading a page  eventually the   process table fills up with zombie worker processes  and you can't create any   more. I've attached my test that does this (dworker.html).    We need to reap these child processes when they exit.   </pre>
