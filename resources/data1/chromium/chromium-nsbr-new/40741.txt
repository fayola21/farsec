<title>Issue 40741 -   chromium -    Crash dump of Chrome extension process is not uploaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many extension crashes reported on our bug system (for example <a title="LastPass javascript only extension crashing often in 4.1.249."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38857">issue 38857</a>)   don't have any crash dumps in crash server.     I can repro the issue by the following step:     1. Install Chrome beta 342.7   2. Install sidewiki extension   3. Use sidewiki on some web site like nytimes.com. Due to a known <a title="Chrome crashes on closing browserAction popup" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36562"> issue   36562 </a>  sidewiki will crash frequently.   4. Crash dump is not uploaded. I saw a &quot;Google Error Reporting-last.dmp&quot;   file under GoogleCrashReports. The event log says: &quot;Crash not uploaded.   Error=0x8004fffe&quot;. The error code 0x8004fffe is GOOPDATE_E_CRASH_REJECTED.    It seems the extensions crash does not specify a product property and Sorin   thinks that's the reason the crash server rejects the crash.  See b/2578253 for more info.       </pre>
