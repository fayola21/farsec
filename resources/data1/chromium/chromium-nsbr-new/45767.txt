<title>Issue 45767 -   chromium -    Use Arial/Arabic Transparent as the default font for Arabic - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I got updated about the Arabic font preference. I chose Tahoma based on the   old research  but recently I heard that Arabic glyphs in Tahoma is not liked   very well by most Arabic speakers.     Arabic in Arial  Times New Roman and Arabic Transparent are liked much   better by Arabic speakers (they're all identical).        </pre>
