<title>Issue 37410 -   chromium -    Installing when Chrome is already installed should launch Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Install Chrome.  2.  Attempt to install Chrome again.  3.  User sees an error message indicating the problem.    The current behavior is that setup returns an error message to Omaha that   says Chrome is already installed.    The new  desired behavior is that setup should launch Chrome.    Please contact me offline for details.   </pre>
