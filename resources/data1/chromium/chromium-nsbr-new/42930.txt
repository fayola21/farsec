<title>Issue 42930 -   chromium -    Bad explanation: &quot;Would you like to translate it?&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.heise.de/">http://www.heise.de/</a> (for example)      1. Go to a webpage in a non-English language.    What's wrong:    Chrome puts a bar at the top says &quot;This page is in [German]. Would you like   to translate it?&quot;    My brain parses this question as &quot;would you like to provide a crowd-sourced   translation of this page into English?&quot;  I think a better message would be   something like &quot;This page is in German. Would you like Chrome to translate   it for you?&quot; </pre>
