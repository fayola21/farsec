<title>Issue 32427 -   chromium -    Mac: Flat folder list in add-bookmark bubble makes it hard to find folders in big trees - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The add-bookmark pop-up bubble has a menu for selecting a folder to add the bookmark to.   However  the menu contents are just a flattened list of all your bookmark folders. If you have a   large tree of bookmarks with a lot of nesting  as I do  it becomes hard to find your way through it. It   also just looks wrong  because it shows none of the structure that the other bookmark views do.    I've written a very simple patch to fix this. It simply sets the NSMenuItem's indentation to match its   nesting level. </pre>
