<title>Issue 29490 -   chromium -    Status updates displayed when chrome is minimized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.264.0 (33782)  URLs (if applicable) : &lt;&lt;attached&gt;&gt;  This is an example page I created to be noticeable.... it's a complex web   page (a snapshot of the front page of boingboing) with a META REFRESH   added to reload the page after 15 seconds.  Put it on a web server and use   it for tests  especially behind a slow link.  Or make your own in the same   way... complex page with a REFRESH in the headers.  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Go to a page with an embedded META REFRESH tag  2. Minimize the chrome window      No elements of the window are shown on the screen when it is minimized      In the middle of the screen  with no window there  updates of what chrome   is doing appear at the bottom of the screen  approximately where they   would appear if the window were not minimized. </pre>
