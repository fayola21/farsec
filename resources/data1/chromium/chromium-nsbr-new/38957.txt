<title>Issue 38957 -   chromium -    rendering problems of html area on armel/dove/ubuntu lucid - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Check Ubuntu bug:  <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/539245/">https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/539245/</a>    Seems to be specific to the board.    Epiphany-browser as another webkit consumer renders appropriately.    The problem is not caused by Xserver as I also see this when starting  chromium-browser through ssh.    Not sure where this points us. I would think it has something to do with  how we do floating point stuff. Maybe in skia?    Also maybe useful info: Ubuntu armel builds do not use NEON.      </pre>
