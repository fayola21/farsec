<title>Issue 39001 -   chromium -    Attempting to drag text totally locks up renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Guessing that this is something in webkit / webkit API  but not honestly   sure. Really easy to reproduce. Open up a tab that has some text on it (any   will do). Create a reasonably sized selection (a few sentences) by dragging   your mouse over the text. Let the mouse button up  and then click and drag   somewhere within the selection. Release the mouse button again. Now try   clicking any links on the page  or getting anything else on the page to work.   No go. </pre>
