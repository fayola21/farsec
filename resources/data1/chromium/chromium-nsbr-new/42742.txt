<title>Issue 42742 -   chromium -    It would be nice to ignore unknown permissions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently in extensions  we ignore unknown features of the manifest  except   for permissions. If we encounter an unknown permission  we fail.    This is unfortunate because it makes it hard for developers to gracefully   support multiple versions of Chrome with a single crx.    For example  we added notifications in Chrome 5  and it requires a   &quot;notifications&quot; permission. But this permission is rejected from Chrome 4.    We can't just ignore unknown permissions though because an extension might   request the &quot;deathray&quot; permission  which is unknown in Chrome X  but known   in Chrome X+1. If the extension is installed into Chrome X  the user won't   be prompted  but will suddenly have an extension with that enabled when   they upgrade to Chrome X+1. </pre>
