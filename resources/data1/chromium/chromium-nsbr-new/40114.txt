<title>Issue 40114 -   chromium -    Space bar not captured properly in flash-based chat window (Tinychat) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.4 dev on Mac OS X  URLs (if applicable) : tinychat.com/chromeerror         Safari 4 mac: OK       Firefox 3.x mac: OK      1. Visit <a href="http://tinychat.com/chromeerror">http://tinychat.com/chromeerror</a> . This is a chat room set up only for us  there shouldn't   be anyone untoward in there.   2. Log in; use any nickname you want.  3. Make sure that the height of the Chrome window is short enough that the scrollbar appears on   the right.  4. Try to type a sentence into the text box.      You can type a sentence without the screen jumping      As soon as you hit the space bar  the screen jumps down a page. Note also that if you have a   space character on your clipboard  you can paste the space into the text box without a screen   jump.     This used to work in Chrome dev  but changed sometime in the last few weeks. I am using the   Flash 10 beta 3 if that makes a difference. </pre>
