<title>Issue 37911 -   chromium -    Better domain matching needed for JavaScript  cookie  popup and plugin permissions / per-site preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.351.0 (Developer Build 41211)      1. Preferences &gt; Under the hood &gt; Content settings &gt; Cookies  2. Block sites from setting any data  3. Add Exception  google.com  Allow      - The expectation is that there's some way to allow all cookies from Google.      - Instead  you have to individually add checkout.google.com   groups.google.com  and so on.  - This makes it really tedious to whitelist sites  making the functionality  not very useful.  - In particular  I need to be able to whitelist all work sites  anything  under my employer's domain  and there are hundreds of servers on our Intranet.    Ideally there would be some form of regexp or glob matching. However  a  cheaper option would be to allow a leading dot on the hostname pattern  and  if a dot is present  do a substring match on the right part of the domain.  So google.com would match only the host google.com  but .google.com would  match everything ending .google.com. I'm guessing this would (a) be easy to  implement and (b) not break anything. </pre>
