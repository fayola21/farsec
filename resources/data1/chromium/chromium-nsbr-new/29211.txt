<title>Issue 29211 -   chromium -    [www.cgsteetimes.com] Chrome is blocked on IE-only site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open <a href="http://www.cgsteetimes.com/">http://www.cgsteetimes.com/</a>  2. Click on any of the links.  3. Chrome is blocked (plus rendering looks a bit off?)    spoofing the user-agent string doesn't seem to work.  This looks to be an IE-  only site.   </pre>
