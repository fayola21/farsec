<title>Issue 32152 -   chromium -    Refactor layout test scripts to prepare extending the dashboard work for other test types - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're planning to get the layout test dashboard work for other test types   (e.g. unit_tests  browser_tests and etc).  There will be several steps  and   probably that would look like:  1) refactor run_webkit_tests.py and related Python files so that we can use   the same code to generate JS files for other test types.  (This bug is   opened primarily for this one)  2) somehow hook a script to generate JSON files for other test types  e.g.   by polling from appengine or hooking a script from buildbot  3) extend the dashboard code to process other test types too  We also need to prepare for upstreaming at some stage.
