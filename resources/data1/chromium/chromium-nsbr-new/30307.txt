<title>Issue 30307 -   chromium -    ChromeBrowserProcessId is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeBrowserProcessId seems to be flaky.  I've seen a lot of the following fatal errors on buildbot &amp; trybots (in   WorkerTest.LimitPerPage or WorkerTest.FLAKY_LimitTotal)    FATAL:/b/slave/chromium-rel-  linux/build/src/chrome/test/chrome_process_util_linux.cc(33)] Expected   exactly 1 process to have socket open: 2606 2727    It might be race condition to open kSingletonSocketFilename by multiple   process?   </pre>
