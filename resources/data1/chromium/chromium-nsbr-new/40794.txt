<title>Issue 40794 -   chromium -    CTRL+ARROW and CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW behavior broken when cursor is in form fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open several tabs  one of them should have a form  2. in this form  write something and try to select the text using CTRL+ARROW  3. Chrome switches to another tab as if CTRL+TAB keyword was used      The normal behavior under Windows (I don't know if it applies to Linux or Mac   OsX though) is that when you navigate a text line with the arrow keys  the   CTRL+ARROW key serves to jump from word to word. CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW allows to   select a whole word in a text.      Chrome switches to neighboring tab (if CTRL+ARROW is used) or moves the tab   in the stack (in case CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW is used).    Please provide
