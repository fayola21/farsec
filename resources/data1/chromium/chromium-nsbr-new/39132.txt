<title>Issue 39132 -   chromium -    Browser fails to reach internet after IP address changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I am connected to the internet by wireless card. I open Google Chrome   and browse to any web page.  2. I plug in an Ethernet cable and receive a new local IP address (I'm not   necessarily able to reach the internet). I do not touch my browser's page.  3. I unplug the Ethernet cable and get back the same IP address I had   before through my wireless connection.  4. I try to use my open browser to navigate to a new page. I fail.      I should be able to continue browsing normally.      I am unable to reach the Internet. I have to close Chrome and restart it to   be able to use it again.    <b>Please provide
