<title>Issue 43400 -   chromium -    using analytics in extension causes it to not work on Mac and Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 dev    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm</a>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hndfgfengoiooldicmmapepfdamlceio">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hndfgfengoiooldicmmapepfdamlceio</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: The very same extensions DO work      1. Install one of the extensions above (I assume those are just a few examples of extensions that   won't run on (my version of) Chrome for (my version of) Mac OS)  2. Click the browser_action or page_action button (popup)      The popups can't be accessed  so the extension isn't usable      Most of the time nothing happens  sometimes an empty popup opens. When trying to acces the   console log of the background page  often the extension crashes or the console is completely   empty. </pre>
