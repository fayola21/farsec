<title>Issue 24837 -   chromium -    Status bar should show hostname during DNS lookups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.1 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 28248)    Currently  during DNS lookups  Chromium says &quot;Resolving host...&quot; in the   status line without saying which host it is resolving (cf. Firefox  which   will tell you &quot;Looking up chromium.org...&quot;). It should say the name of the   host(s) it is resolving  for two reasons:    1. Sites that load several scripts/stylesheets from external resources can   have their loading delayed for considerable time if the host of one of   those external resources takes a long time to resolve. It's useful for both   web site owners (to whom it would offer an immediate diagnosis of their   site loading slowly) and users (who can blacklist persistent offenders    e.g. via a hosts file entry) to know which site is delaying page loading.    2. It gives the name of host that it is waiting for in other stages of page   loading (&quot;Waiting for chromium.org&quot;)  so doing so would be consistent. </pre>
