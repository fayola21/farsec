<title>Issue 42753 -   chromium -    Tab tear-off to another split should open the new window on that split - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 (Official Build 45554)  OS + version : ghardy desktop  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : ratpoison 1.4.2      1. Have a two-split ratpoison configuration (e.g. C-t : only RET C-t : split RET)  2. Run chrome in one split  open tabs.  2. Drag a tab out of a chrome window onto the other split.      New chrome window opens on the split that the tab was dragged to.      New chrome window opens on the split that had focus before the tab-drag   was started.    This is similar to <a title="Cannot drag a tab onto another monitor"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18580">bug 18580</a>  but whereas that was for dropping tags on other monitors (and is now fixed)  this bug is   for dropping onto a WM split  even on a single monitor.    User impact is obviously tiny (this only affects tiling WMs like ratpoison/ion). </pre>
