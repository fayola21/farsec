<title>Issue 33337 -   chromium -    Netflix queue drag-reordering janky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Log into a Netflix account with at least a few items in the queue. Show the   queue and attempt to drag-and-drop an item to change the order.    The action is slow to start (it takes a few seconds for the dragging to begin)    and the cursor changes to an I-beam rather than staying a hand.    I saw this in 4.0.249.49 (35163) beta. Problems also reported in XP 4.0. Not   everyone sees the problem  though; either there's another factor (queue size?   mine's ~330 items)  or some people are more tolerant of the jank. </pre>
