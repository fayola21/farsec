<title>Issue 41596 -   chromium -    (Reopen 41461) Autofill tries to fill every field on the page instead of previous entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.7 (Official Build 44408) dev        1. Create autofill address profile  2. Try to fill address fields with autofill (fills correct).  3. Try to fill non-address fields with double click - to have previous   variants  that were entered to this filed. Instead of previous variants of   filling offers autofil profile.      Show several variants  that were entered before.        Offers only autofill profiles. But doesn't offer previous values.  Offers previous  only if you enter first symbols of previous values (see   screenshot).    Ticket 41461 (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41461">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41461</a>) was   put to duplicate of 41013.  But in fact these are different problems. And 41013 is already fixed  but   problem from 41461 is still reproduced.   </pre>
