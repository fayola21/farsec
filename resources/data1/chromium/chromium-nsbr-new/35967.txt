<title>Issue 35967 -   chromium -    Mac bookmark bar (empty) revisit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Follow-up for <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/551226">http://codereview.chromium.org/551226</a>    An empty bookmark folder has an &quot;(empty)&quot; item in it.  For the Mac (with the above CL) it's a disabled button.  It needs to be a real (empty) with better highlighting for drop onto it.   </pre>
