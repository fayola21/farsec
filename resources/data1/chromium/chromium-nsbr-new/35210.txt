<title>Issue 35210 -   chromium -    Spaces in system/configuration filenames are undesirable. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Attempt to backup or save the &quot;browser state&quot; of Chromium under Linux.  2. The $HOME/.config/chromium/Default directory contains &quot;Current Session&quot;   and &quot;Current Tabs&quot; files in addition to a number of &quot;History Index-yyyy-mm-  *&quot; files.  3. Attempt to backup or copy said files and it will not work without   dealing with the spaces.      Google/chromium developers should be selecting filenames which are   sensitive to the various operating system environments.    Spaces in filenames are *HIGHLY* incompatible with Unix/Linux shells and   typical argument processing.  The spaces in Google filenames should either   be eliminated or replaced with underscores.      The Google config directory cannot be backed up using &quot;standard&quot; scripts    such as those which would find files modified in the last week  month  etc.   due to the fact that Linux shells view a space as a filename separator.  It   is impossible to manipulate these files without going to extreme measures   to modify pre-existing scripts to deal with the spaces (in other words   Google chromium installations will break &quot;typical&quot;/&quot;common&quot; backup   procedures under Linux).    This is an &quot;in-your-face&quot; example of Windows developers who have failed to   consider the Linux or Mac environments.    If I were the manager  I would take the individuals responsible out in back   of the Google HQ and if I were inclined towards a NCIS paradigm whack them   in the back of the head  or if I were inclined towards a &quot;That's 70s show&quot;   paradigm  tell them in no uncertain terms what dumb-a*** they were.  In any   case I would make it clear that we live in a multi-operating-system world.    In the meantime it needs to be fixed.  I would suggest migrating the space   to an underscore with the file opening routines sensitive to the portable   vs. non-portable encodings so the transition can be handled with minimal   difficulties.    <b>Please provide
