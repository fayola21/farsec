<title>Issue 41175 -   chromium -    Password Auto-complete Confused On Sites with Multiple Passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Goto usaa.com (account required).  2. Log in and choose &quot;yes&quot; to auto-complete.  3. Go to checking account  which them prompts for a second password (a PIN).  4. Chrome then incorrectly auto-populates the second hidden text box with the first password.    But the second text box is used for a PIN  not a password.  So  the password is incorrect.  5.  If you then enter the pin  the password record for the keychain is updated to include the PIN.    This means that the next time you go to usaa.com it will attempt to (incorrectly) auto-complete   the user login password using the PIN  not the password.        Chrome should maintain stored passwords on a per-page basis  not a per-domain basis.  That   way the keychain can store multiple passwords for the same site.          Chrome only stores one password per site always applying the previous password to the current   login.      <b>Please provide
