<title>Issue 40287 -   chromium -    Clicking Chrome window w/app-modal dialog should bring dialog to front - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Today I changed virtual desktops back to my Chrome-containing desktop and   found my Chrome window dead.  After much clicking on it to no avail  I   clicked the taskbar icon  and lo and behold  an app-modal (JS alert) window   appeared!  It would have been a lot more helpful if my earlier clicks on the   main window would have brought that dialog to the top of the Z-order. </pre>
