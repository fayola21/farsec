<title>Issue 30018 -   chromium -    CHECK in a test causes the process to end  other tests are skipped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The issue was found during writing and reviewing <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/482001">http://codereview.chromium.org/482001</a>    On Linux and Mac  failed CHECK results in process being terminated.  If CHECK happens in the middle of some single-process test  the following tests are not executed.    Before <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/482001">http://codereview.chromium.org/482001</a> was commited as  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=34273">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=34273</a>    we had a different behavior on Windows.  The CHECK have not being ending the process  so the failing test continued to execute together  with the following tests.  Once it was commited  the behavior on Windows became the same as on Linux and Mac.    However  I believe it may make sense to use some technique to run tests in such a way  that a CHECK-failure of one test doesn't result in skipping further tests.  The first thing that comes to my mind is to run tests in separate processes   but it's likely to be an overkill. </pre>
