<title>Issue 26383 -   chromium -    The message &quot;Sign in with your Google Account&quot; is not structured correctly in certain languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you open the Sync setup dialog (by going to the Wrench menu -&gt; Sync my   bookmarks...) you'll notice that  in English  the following two lines   appear above the email and password text boxes:    &quot;Sign in with your&quot;  &quot;Google account&quot;    The problem is that in some languages structuring these two sentences in   that manner does not make much sense. If you visit the Google Accounts   login page in different languages  you'll notice that for some languages   the top line is translated (<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?</a>  hl=ru) and for others it is omitted altogether   (<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?hl=ar">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?hl=ar</a>).    If we wanted to fix this quickly  we could just omit the &quot;Sign in with   your&quot; line for all languages. If we want to follow exactly what the Google   Accounts page does  then we'll need to let the translators know that the   translated string should be blank in certain languages and translated in   others. The code will also need to change such that we omit the HTML   element for the top string altogether when the string is empty.   </pre>
