<title>Issue 42738 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame doesn't have a clean page for SSL installs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using SSL exclusively on a site  it's not possible to add the chrome   frame plugin without getting a message dialog from IE.    This is because not all resources are served from SSL.    The only option we have to making it work is host the installer ourselves but   that would be a breach of the license   </pre>
