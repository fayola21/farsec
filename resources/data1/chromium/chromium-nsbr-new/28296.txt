<title>Issue 28296 -   chromium -    ChromeFrames IE Host network stack implementation should not automatically follow redirects. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame's host network stack implementation for IE automatically  follows any redirects. We also send these notifications back to Chrome  which also does the same. This causes issues with sites like   <a href="https://webbranch.techcu.com">https://webbranch.techcu.com</a> which end up failing the subsequent redirect  followed request issued by chrome.     </pre>
