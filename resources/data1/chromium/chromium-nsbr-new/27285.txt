<title>Issue 27285 -   chromium -    Omnibox doesn't show bookmark name if URL is too long - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 3.0.195.27 (Official Build 28507)      1. Start typing the name of a bookmark in the omnibox.  2. Look through suggestions to find the complete bookmark name. Bookmark   suggestions are formatted as &quot;&lt;url&gt; - &lt;name&gt;&quot;.      Find the complete bookmark name and select it to go to that URL.      Can't find the complete bookmark name because the URL is long enough to fill   the entire width of the suggestion box.    Screenshot attached showing how it looks with one of my bookmarklets. All you   see is the bookmark link (JavaScript code). The bookmark name  &quot;readability&quot;    isn't visible at all. </pre>
