<title>Issue 36704 -   chromium -    Implement Nagle-like approach for Client initiated SPDY requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Matthew Lloyd and I were looking at a wireshark trace of how SPDY reacts to   server hints (aka X-Subresrouces).    Essentially  after the response is received  20 SYN_STREAM requests were   initiated within 2 msec  each in a separate IP packet (and TCP segment).    With compression enabled  the total size of each packet was around 130 bytes    so nearly 30% was spent on IP/TCP headers.    We could coalesce 14-15 of these requests into the same TCP segment and only   spend ~3% on IP/TCP ove. </pre>
