<title>Issue 27165 -   chromium -    would like a way to attribute renderer crashes to content scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> from today's product review:  In order to measure the stability impact of extensions on Chrome  it would be   good to have a way to attribute which renderer crashes were caused by content   scripts.  This is likely impossible to do accurately  but we may be able to   add some extra data to crash reports to help:  - are there any content scripts injected into this page?  (which extension   ids?)  - is the current stack in an isolated world context?    Maybe there are other ideas.   </pre>
