<title>Issue 23585 -   chromium -     Gmail tab losses connectivity  while background tabs are fine. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open Gmail in one tab. Open several tabs with Gmail (various labels).    Whichever tab is on top looses connection to Gchat and connection to Gmail    in general  is very flaky (i have to wait for a long time for emails to be   sent  open  etc). If I switch to another tab I have gchat active and can   contact people and connection is fast for a little bit. This never happens   in Firefox. </pre>
