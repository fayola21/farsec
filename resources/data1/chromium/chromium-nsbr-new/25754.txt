<title>Issue 25754 -   chromium -    Mac: sheets still hang from the incorrect place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With the bookmark bar active (on a normal  non-NTP) page  attached sheets   (e.g.  Cmd-O to open file) hang from the bottom of the omnibox. It's even   stranger if an infobar is present. If the bookmark bar is present  sheets   should hang below it since it's visually contiguous with the toolbar.    Note: One has to be careful in fixing this  since the NTP displays a bookmark   bar which pretends to be a part of the content area (so it looks weird to hang   stuff below it).    Question for UI people: Should we really hang sheets below the infobar (which   is a different colour from the toolbar)? (We currently do  and it looks slightly   odd  but I don't know if the alternative is better. My current patch continues   hanging stuff below any infobar.) </pre>
