<title>Issue 26913 -   chromium -    Downloads bar / tab is showing the wrong icon while downloading exe files under windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. download an exe file using chrome  2. look at the download progress in the downloads bar/tab before the process is complete.      Under windows XP  i should be seeing the icon attached below as   &quot;expected.gif&quot;    instead  i see the default windows &quot;unknown file&quot; icon  as shown in the   &quot;instead.jpg&quot; file    tested using 4.0.238.0 (Developer Build 31211) under windows XP    i am guessing this goes for other file types too? (.bat? .cmd?)    other browsers:  FF 3.5.3: OK  showing the expected icon  IE8: not showing any icon  Opera: GREAT  somehow showing the real icon of the exe  the one that other   browsers show only after the download is finished.  Safari: FAIL  showing the &quot;unknown icon&quot;  same as chrome </pre>
