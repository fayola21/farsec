Repro  -----  1. In that tab  make download shelf appear by downloading a file.  2. Start to drag the tab.  3. Abort the drag operation by dropping the tab onto the desktop.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  The download shelf should remain visible in the window.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  The download shelf goes away.  I think the shelf should only disappear  after a successful drop onto another Chrome window.   </pre>
