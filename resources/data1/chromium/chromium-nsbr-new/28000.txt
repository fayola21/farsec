<title>Issue 28000 -   chromium -    Flash 10.1 alpha doesn't stay running except while the mouse is moving over it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new Flash alpha stops updating video and buffering new audio if the   mouse isn't constantly moving over it  causing it to get new events via   mouse-moved (it works only in 249 because we were accidentally still using   the Carbon event model). </pre>
