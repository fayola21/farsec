<title>Issue 25251 -   chromium -    clicking on tab switches focus to background application - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Have several tabs and click on different tabs      Every time I click on a tab  that tab should be opened/brought into focus.      Once in a while  ~5% of the time  clicking on a tab will bring the   application below / behind Chrome to come to the front.  When I had   Terminal in the background  once in a while  when clicking on tabs to   switch to  it would open up Terminal.  After minimizing terminal  the   behavior was to switch to Finder.    I am certain that I'm clicking on the tab itself  and not clicking outside of   the chrome window.  This is consistently reproducible by clicking on tabs   one after another  though it can take 20+ tab switches before encountering   this.    The problem occurs on various tabs  and there doesn't seem to be anything   specific on those tabs that stands out.  E.g. The last one for it to happen on   was a relatively plain html page with search results on it. </pre>
