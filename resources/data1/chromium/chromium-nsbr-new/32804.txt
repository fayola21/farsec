<title>Issue 32804 -   chromium -    BrowserInitTest.BlockBadURLs fails consistently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This test is failing on pretty much every platform all the time.  It is   erroneously marked Flaky.    This test either needs to be disabled or fixed.  False flakiness makes life   hard on the sheriffs.  Frankly  even checking in a test that was purposefully   marked flaky is poor practice; none of our tests should ever be knowingly   flaky.    Please take some kind of action. </pre>
