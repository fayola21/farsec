<title>Issue 40021 -   chromium -    Chrome Locked up on opening  70+ tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Restarting Chrome after bootup with 70+ tabs.          For the last 3-4 months  I have an extreme number of tabs open (I use each  window as a workbook full of relevant tabs  with 12 windows open).   Restarts and reboots always work fine.      All windows and tabs open  but do not load.  Chrome spikes in CPU usage.   There is minimal network traffic in the beginning but then all traffic ends  and all tabs show the active loading symbol but goes nowhere for over an  hours. Network connection is fine on the laptop  all other browsers work fine.     This seemed to start after a windows auto update restart in conjunction  with the new 5.0.342.8 beta version.      <b>Please provide
