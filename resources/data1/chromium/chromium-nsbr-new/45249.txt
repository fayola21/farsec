<title>Issue 45249 -   chromium -    Flash content hangs render since 5.0.375.55 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 on Mac OS 10.6    <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8707908.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8707908.stm</a>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>             Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:no test           IE 8:no test      1. Open a page with flash content. Page will hang either before render or just after      Page renders  flash content plays      Page unresponsive to clicks or scrolling. Eventually times out. Occasionally does not render at all    This started for me immediately after the 5.0.375.55 update rollout. I was using flash version   10.0.42.34. An upgrade to the latest flash player has not helped. The crash seems not to happen   on very first load. Killing the Flash Player process in Activity monitor solves the freeze but breaks   the flash plugin. </pre>
