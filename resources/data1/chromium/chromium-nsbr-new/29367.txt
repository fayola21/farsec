Clicking on play button doesn't   do anything. Video plugin and all tab controls are responsive.  (Nothing appears to be hung)    Today I was playing individual youtube video and it happened 3-4 times with different videos.    Video I was playing : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsYjeo0PHlU&amp;NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsYjeo0PHlU&amp;NR=1</a> (Works fine with Safari)    GDB stack trace for plugin:  (gdb) bt  #0  0x9209346e in __semwait_signal ()  #1  0x920be3e6 in _pthread_cond_wait ()  #2  0x920e39f8 in pthread_cond_timedwait$UNIX2003 ()  #3  0x02844e7f in ChromeMain ()  #4  0x02883b4e in ChromeMain ()  #5  0x0285f3bf in ChromeMain ()  #6  0x0285cdf4 in ChromeMain ()  #7  0x03704c94 in ChromeMain ()  #8  0x023667c2 in ChromeMain ()  #9  0x00001fc6 in ??
