<title>Issue 32955 -   chromium -    Timezone Lost - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A    Chrome occasionally displays times in GMT rather than my system default    PST.  I'm running Chrome dev on Leopard.  The behaviour doesn't seem to be   predictable and can vary from tab to tab  suggesting it's due to individual   helper processes.    Screenshots attached showing system time and Chrome's time. </pre>
