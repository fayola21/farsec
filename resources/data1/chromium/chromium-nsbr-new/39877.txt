<title>Issue 39877 -   chromium -    Expose folders only getter to the bookmarks API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the bookmarks manager needs to get all the folders to show the   fully expanded tree. The bookmarks API does not expose a way do this so we   get the entire tree. We have reports of people with thousands of bookmarks.    We should add a new method to chrome.bookmarks or   chrome.experimental.bookmarkManager that only gives us the folders back. </pre>
