<title>Issue 35126 -   chromium -    Page reload shortcut doesn't work when Inspector has focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the Inspector pane/window has focus  Command+R to reload the page   doesn't work. I have to focus the page. It'd be really awesome if this'd work   from the Inspector.    (With Chrome version 5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev  on OS X 10.6.2). </pre>
