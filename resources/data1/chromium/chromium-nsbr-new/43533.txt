<title>Issue 43533 -   chromium -    Chrome logo does not fit the new google design - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  Google changed their logo (and more importantly the colors of their logo).  The Google Chrome logo and icon should be modified to reflect these changes.  Moreover  the Chrome icon does not fit into the OS X dock very well  as it contains a lot of   highlights (unusual for Mac icons).  Especially the reflection on top of the icon makes it look not round and smaller than the other dock   icons. (See attachement)  Besides  the icon's saturated colors prevent it from fitting into the color scheme used by Mac icons.  An example for a Chrome icon that fits into the Mac dock better is a wonderful icon created by   J.max  available at <a href="http://www.morcha.net/post/46.html">http://www.morcha.net/post/46.html</a>    P.S.: I know that this is probably the wrong place to file this issue  in this case  it would be nice if   you could tell me where to file this issue at! </pre>
