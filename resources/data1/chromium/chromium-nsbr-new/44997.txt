<title>Issue 44997 -   chromium -    SSL port other than 443 produces error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1  Other browsers tested:    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    I am using SSL port 444 on my server. When I open the SSL secured page in   Google Chrome on port 444  browser shows skull next to URL address (see   screenshot). All resources on the page are open safely via https protocol.   When I use standard port 443 on the same page  all works fine. The problem   is  probably caused by unstandard port 444.     Firefox and IE do not have problem with port 444.     </pre>
