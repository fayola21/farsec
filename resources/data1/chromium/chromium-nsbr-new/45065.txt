<title>Issue 45065 -   chromium -    UI feature requests -- visual effects  color schemes  stop button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I propose color scheme support  ability to control visual effects  and a   stop button in the UI.    My justifications are the following:    Sometimes I find the color scheme strains my eyes a bit. The ability as a   user to change the colors to something a little more neutral would help   greatly.    The tab open/close sliding effect looks cool  but sometimes I just want my   tabs right then and there. The ability for power users to turn these   features off would be spiffy  and would probably just be a couple of added   lines of code in the right places (plus the API code to implement the   checkbox).    Last but not least  the stop button would be a good feature to keep on   standby in case of an unresponsive web page. Yes I realize it isn't   necessary in most cases  but a stop button that terminates an attempt to   connect to a webpage and closes the socket attached to the attempt saves on   CPU cycles and memory and keeps users from experiencing issues with   TCPIP.SYS. </pre>
