<title>Issue 25336 -   chromium -    Safe browsing updates should be throttled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 3.0.195.27      1. Turn on computer in the morning  2. Chrome auto-grabs new safe browsing data  3. Disk is absolutely hammered for the next hour    What is the expected output?  We observed this on a Google laptop.  procmon showed the disk grinding in   the &quot;Safe Browsing Bloom&quot; database.  He reports that his disk is so loaded   his mouse cursor stops moving.  (There's also antivirus grinding away    which may have made the problem worse.)    This is likely to be a cause of the very common &quot;Chrome slows my computer   down&quot; uninstall reason. </pre>
