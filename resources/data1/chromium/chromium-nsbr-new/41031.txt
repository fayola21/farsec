<title>Issue 41031 -   chromium -    Add password sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice to have all saved passwords synchronized between browser.   Now I have to enter them manually on all computers because I can't sync them   or export.    Mozilla Weave and XMarks for Firefox has this feature  why Chrome doesn't?    Extensions sync would be nice too :) </pre>
