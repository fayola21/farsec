<title>Issue 33907 -   chromium -    unable to resize columns in bookmark manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the bookmark manager and try to resize the columns (title  URL) by   click+dragging the column divider.  It doesn't resize.  However  if I select   any bookmark on the right side other than the first one  it does resize!    I'm not sure why having the top bookmark selected prevents the resize.    Sometimes  I get a drag bookmark cursor when the first bookmark is selected   and I try to resize.    This is on 4.0.302.2 dev.   </pre>
