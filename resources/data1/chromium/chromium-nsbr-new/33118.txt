<title>Issue 33118 -   chromium -    checkdeps.py should work in a git checkout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set up a git checkout for chromium.  2. Run &quot;python src/tools/checkdeps/checkdeps.py --root src&quot;  3. It says &quot;SUCCESS&quot; but does not check anything.        checkdeps.py should work in a git checkout  but  checkdeps.py does not work in a git checkout.    This is because the script assumes that it's unsed inside a SVN checkout:    def ApplyDirectoryRules(existing_rules  dir_name):    ...      # Check for a .svn directory in this directory. This will tell us if it's    # a source directory and should be checked.    if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(dir_name  &quot;.svn&quot;)):      return (None  [])         </pre>
