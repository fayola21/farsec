<title>Issue 42790 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame fresh installs need IE to be restarted for switching to work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a fresh machine  launch IE and navigate to go/wave and go through  the chrome frame install process. Once install completes observe that  IE does not switch to ChromeFrame.    This probably regressed when we switched from the protocol sink patch to  http equiv and subsequently the IMoniker patch  where we rely on the BHO   to detect top level URL navigations. </pre>
