<title>Issue 35302 -   chromium -    Add &quot;last hour&quot; to clear browsing data. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I want to rethink the following two issues with history:    - should we allow for more granular control  i.e. delete history of the last   hour  delete a specific history entry? Adding shorter ranges should be easy    but deleting a single item also requires to rethink the following    - deleting history right now will also delete cache and cookies (where the   latter refers to html cookies  local storage  web databases  and soon app   cache and others). This is a bit inconvenient  since on the history page    cookies are not displayed. Still  if you want to delete traces to a certain page    you probably want to include cookies? </pre>
