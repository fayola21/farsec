<title>Issue 26792 -   chromium -    Can't hide 'Make this my home page' and 'Bookmark Sync' on the new tab page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : Chrome://newtab/  Other browsers tested: n/a    On the new tab page you see two shortcuts:  &quot;Make this my home page&quot;  and  &quot;Bookmark Sync   You can sync your bookmarks across computers using your   Google account   Start now&quot;    The shortcut 'make this my home page' should not be here  therefore is the   options page.    The bookmark sync is also in the wrench menu  so this one is also double.   And for somebody who doesn't want to synchronize his/her bookmarks  it is   just annoying. </pre>
