<title>Issue 32406 -   chromium -    Http cache: expose metadata stream for a given entry. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A disk cache entry has support for adding a meta-data stream to a given   entry (in addition to the http headers and response data).    We need a way for the Http cache to expose this to the rest of the world :)    The issue is that currently there is no way to access a particular http   cache entry: a network request simply asks for data and the cache locates /   creates an entry  reads / writes to it and closes the entry automatically.    A possible solution is to create some sort of unique identifier at the http   cache level (and return it with the response) so that at a later point a   client of the cache can just request data to be read / written to the same   entry that was used to fulfill the original request.    The time-stamp for the creation/overwrite of the entry may be enough. In   case that two entries for the same url share the same time-stamp (a fast   create / doom / create sequence)  the actual content of the entry should be   the same (unless the server also modified the response within the timer   granularity of the client!) so even if the metadata is set to the wrong   entry  it will be set to the right &quot;resource&quot; (because in this case it will   be associated with the newest entry  as opposed to a doomed one).    So we are talking about adding a few methods to the HttpCache interface   (read/write/delete metadata for a given url+identifier)  and adding an   identifier to the returned response. </pre>
