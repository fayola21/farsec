<title>Issue 36458 -   chromium -    Font-rendering inside page different from browser menu and Gnome interface - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.307.9 beta    Is this the most recent version: Yes    OS + version: Linux charles-desktop 2.6.31-19-generic #56-Ubuntu SMP Thu   Jan 28 01:26:53 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux    CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32 bits    Window manager: X.org      1. Install SharpFonts (www.sharpfonts.com) and Microsoft fonts to have the   same font rendering as in Windows XP.  2. Open Chrome and open a web site that has text.        Text should be rendered as it is in other browsers and in Gnome  using the   SharpFonts configuration files.        Text is different from the rest of Ubuntu: Fonts are polished inside the   web page. Even Chrome's menus follow SharpFonts's font rendering   information  as you can see on the attached screen shot.    Thanks. </pre>
