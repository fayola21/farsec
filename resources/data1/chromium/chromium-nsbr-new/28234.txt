<title>Issue 28234 -   chromium -    Status Bar hides extensions / download area on mouse contact. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install Gmail Extension  2.

As the pages load  a grey bar appears in the bottom left of the screen   while a page loads  saying &quot;Waiting for www.bla.com&quot;  4. Move your mouse from top to bottom over this grey bar.        I expect nothing to happen  or at least my gmail extension icon not to get   covered by this grey status / loading bar.      The grey bar will move down vertically as if your mouse is pushing it. It   will move down approx 100 pixels max and will revert back upwards when the   mouse is moved away.    <b>Please provide
