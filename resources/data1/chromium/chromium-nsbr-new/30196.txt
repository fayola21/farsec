<title>Issue 30196 -   chromium -    motocar.co.il: drop-down disfunctional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25  URL : <a href="http://www.motocar.co.il">http://www.motocar.co.il</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : ?  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Also broken      1. Select a car-maker name from the rightmost drop-down (&quot;_��__��__��_ _��____��__��_&quot;  i.e.    &quot;choose manufacturer&quot;)  2. Second drop-down should contain list of models by that maker; it does not.    Seems like the JS is IE-only. Note: this is a key functionality in this   popular website (it has ~1M daily pageviews according to AdPlanner public   data). </pre>
