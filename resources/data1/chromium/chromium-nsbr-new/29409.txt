<title>Issue 29409 -   chromium -    usability problem with as-you-type history display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The developers of chrome made the following design decisions in the  as-you-type history display which I believe are adversely affecting usability:       1) one line per history item - Both URL and page title are placed on the  same line.  This is likely to lead to a high degree of truncated text.  I  can appreciate the real estate compromise made here  but when combined with  point #2 the situation is pretty bad.  (Note that Firefox uses two-lines  per history item and IMHO works better assuming you have a good matching  algorithm.)       2) URL placed before page title - I'd argue that page title is more  important and human-readable (and should probably play the stronger role in  matching)  so it should be displayed first.    Please change the ordering of page title and URL  and perhaps consider a  two-line item display.   </pre>
