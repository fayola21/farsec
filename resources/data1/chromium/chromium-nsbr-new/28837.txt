<title>Issue 28837 -   chromium -    When clicking a bookmark folder that is open  it should close itself - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a folder of bookmarks in the bookmark bar  2. Click it once to open it  3. While the list of bookmarks inside it is open click the folder again      I expect that clicking it again will close it as that's the behavior of all   other apps on both mac and windows         </pre>
