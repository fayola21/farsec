<title>Issue 23603 -   chromium -    Themes Gallery hotspot in corner of NTP can overlap other page elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.220.1 (Official Build 27713)    Precondition:    1. Have 8 pages showing in Recently Visited Pages section of NTP.        1. Open the New Tab Page.  2. Click inside the bottom-right thumbnail near the bottom-right corner of  that thumbnail (near the curled-up corner of the page).  See attached pictue.    What is the expected output?     Should navigate to the page associated with the thumbnail.  Should only  navigate to the Themes Gallery when the peeled-back corner is clicked.     What do you see instead?    Navigates to the Themes Gallery instead.  Apparently  the hotspot for the  Gallery may overlap an area containing other page elements.    Also  if you size the page so that the &quot;View Full History&quot; link is close to  the lower right-hand corner of the page  you can wind up navigating to the  Gallery when clicking on that link  also.   </pre>
