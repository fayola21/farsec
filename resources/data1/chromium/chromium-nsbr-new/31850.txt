<title>Issue 31850 -   chromium -    RFE: Ability to add private nodes to DOM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.16  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5  (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.43 Safari/532.5    Hello  I would like to inject content into a webpage's DOM; however  I  do not want said webpage to have access to any of the injected  content.  Here are several use cases:    a) xmarks smarter search  <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/about/features">http://www.xmarks.com/about/features</a>    b) coolpreview's site preview  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2207">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2207</a>    c) another site preview extension  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189</a>     In the case of smarter search  top search results could be chosen based on  user's bookmarks.  This is information that should be kept private from  websites.    The Gleam API offers functionality that is similar but not exactly the  same.  For example  creating webpage mashups such as the xmarks smarter  search feature is not possible (it should appear integrated into the page  when the user visits a site).
