<title>Issue 44010 -   chromium -    If WIFI is turned off  geolocation provides a bad approximation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.396.0 dev  OS version: Snow Leopard    If WIFI is turned off  geolocation provides a bad approximation; In my case Istanbul is selected    although I am in Munich.  I assume it does select Istanbul  because it is also in the GMT+1   timezone.  However this is not an acceptable guess. Even without WIFI a much better   approximation should be possible. For example Berlin would be much better  because at least   this would be in the same country.    I suggest something like this:    * Chrome should probably store all relevant signal information in memory and periodically   recollect it by checking the WIFI signals - say  on startup and every 30 minutes  whether a page   has already requested the location or not. If WIFI is turned off or no signals are available  older   information can be use for a certain amount of time.    * If WIFI is turned off  some other internet connection is likely available. In fact this is the case   for my computer; A fairly good approximation is often possible by using the IP address for   geolocation.    * If even that is impossible  a good approximation would be to determine the location of the   user by checking one or more of the following settings:    1. The Region set for &quot;Formats&quot; in System Preferences.  2. The language selected in System Preferences.  3. The currency set for &quot;Formats&quot; in System Preferences.  4. The City (if set) on the default User contact of the Addressbook application.    Some privacy issues may apply  in particular for (4). </pre>
