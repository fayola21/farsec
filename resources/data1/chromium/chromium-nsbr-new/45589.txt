<title>Issue 45589 -   chromium -    gcl diff doesn't work from withing chrome directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Simple repro steps:    1) Modify a file  such as srcchromeVERSION and add it to a changelist  ie. changelist &quot;test&quot;.    2) Observe:    D:codesrcchrome&gt;gcl opened    --- Changelist test:  M      chromeVERSION    D:codesrcchrome&gt;gcl diff test  svn: 'chromeVERSION' is not a working copy  svn: 'chromeVERSION' does not exist    D:codesrcchrome&gt;cd ..    D:codesrc&gt;gcl diff test  Index: chrome/VERSION  ===================================================================    (VERSION file is shown in the diff).      This problem is fairly new (started noticing a few days ago) and reproduces for both me and   nsylvain every single time. </pre>
