<title>Issue 28116 -   chromium -    Permissions of downloaded files are incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249  URLs (if applicable) : ANY  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): correct  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: NOT TESTED      1. Download any file  e.g. ZIP or DMG.  2. Check file's permissions      File should have read/write permissions for owner and to be read only for   others to allow its copying to network shares without additional user   actions.      File has read/write permissions for owner and 'no access' for others. This is   unacceptable  because owner will need to edit file permissions manually   prior putting it to network share.  Safari  Firefox and Opera all set correct permissions. </pre>
