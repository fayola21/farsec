<title>Issue 32124 -   chromium -    perf summary.dat files require cleansing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The perf dashboard's summary.dat files require cleansing.  The issues are:    1. All rev trace data are float literals.  Most of this data when parsed by   a local JSON module causes the trace data to be reinterpreted due to   processor floating point differences.  The rev trace data should be   converted to string literals.    2. Some rev data is literally 'None'.  Most of this occurs in the linux-  release-webkit-latest directory.    3. Some rev data is out of order in the file.  The files should be sorted   descending by rev.    I've listed the cleanups in the order I plan to pursue them.  #1 first so   this change can be examined in isolation (it will affect all lines in the   .dat files).  #2 will occur in parallel with #1 (it is the exclusion of   some bad perf data.  #3 will allow spot-checking when comparing snapshots   before and after.    #1 requires a change to the buildbot to prepend trace data as a string   literal and plotter updates to ensure all trace data is converted to float. </pre>
