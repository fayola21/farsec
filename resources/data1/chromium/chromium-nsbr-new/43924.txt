<title>Issue 43924 -   chromium -    Notifications on-screen block new browser windows on mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a page on the mac that displays a notification   2. Leave the notification onscreen  but close all browser windows  3. Click on the chrome dock icon      Expected: New tab page is brought up (essentially the normal Mac behavior when you click on a   dock icon for chrome and there are no open browser windows)  Actual: nothing happens. It's as if Chrome thinks there's already a browser window open because the   notification is on-screen.     </pre>
