<title>Issue 28102 -   chromium -    Write comprehensive keyboard system tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I need to write a test that hooks up a complete browser/renderer combo    sends several keys via |NSApp sendEvent:| and then checks that these keys   produce the right effects. For the most parts  this means having a test html   script with some javascript hooked up.    There's also <a title="Keyboard handling needs unit tests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22515">issue 22515</a>   but this bug here is supposed to be mac-specific. </pre>
