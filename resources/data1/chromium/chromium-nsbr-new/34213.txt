<title>Issue 34213 -   chromium -    Personal passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a bug  it's more like a bad design and for sure it has been   reported but is always important report it again.    It seems to me a relatively big problem that saved passwords could be shown   without introduce no master password &quot;Options &gt; Personal things &gt; show   saved passwords&quot; (i'm spanish  the english version may have another path   but sure you know what i mean). That could give an attacker with physical   access to the victim PC the possibility of wath her/his passwords    possibles scenarios:    1- A (not so) friend that comes to the victim's house and use her/his PC.  2- THE DANGEROUS ONE: Work mates in the office or similar situations.    SOLUTION:    Just as mozilla does with firefox  make chromium/chrome the possibility of   has a master password that is required when the browser or a user try to   access to a saved password. </pre>
