<title>Issue 25268 -   chromium -    Mac menu-bar application name includes &quot;Helper&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)  WebKit	532.2  V8	1.3.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.2 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.222.5 Safari/532.2  URLs (if applicable) : N/A    Chromium.org (mac) 4.0.223.5 (Developer Build 29420): OK       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    This issue appears only with the official Mac builds of Google Chrome   NOT with the Chromium.org mac browser builds      1. Launch mac application &quot;Google Chrome.app&quot;  2. Menu bar name of the application  3. (it does not matter whether the foreground window is about or a browser   window)      &quot;&lt;Apple&gt; Google Chrome  File  Edit ...&quot;      &quot;&lt;Apple&gt; Google Chrome Helper  File  Edit ...&quot;    Screenshot attached.    I'm pretty sure this bug was not present in earlier official Google Chrome Mac   (beta) builds  but thanks to the hyper-efficient updater  I can't say what the last   non-broken version was.    Renaming the .app has no effect on this bug.    Deleting the app and replacing with a freshly download copy (4.0.222.5 in   Finder:Get-Info) has no effect on this bug. </pre>
