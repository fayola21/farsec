<title>Issue 31854 -   chromium -    Context menu deselects current selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Linux  selecting text and then bringing up the right-click context menu   in order to &quot;copy&quot; requires that the user positions the mouse on top of the   selection.    If the mouse has since move outside of the selection  the selection is   deselected prior to bringing up the context menu  and the &quot;copy&quot; action is   then unavailable.    This is different from what other Linux programs (including Firefox) do  but   Evan suspected that it matches Mac. </pre>
