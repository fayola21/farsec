<title>Issue 26618 -   chromium -    Mac: placement of tab modal sheets (e.g.  http auth sheet) defective with NTP and floating bookmark bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a NTP and don't display the normal bookmark bar (so that the   &quot;floating&quot;  &quot;in-content&quot; bookmark bar is displayed instead).  2. Enter  e.g.  &quot;<a href="http://hiphop.ie/">http://hiphop.ie/</a>&quot; in the omnibox and press return.      It should hang like a normal  window-modal sheet  from below the toolbar --   i.e.  from the top of the apparent content area. Instead  it hangs from below   the floating bookmark bar -- i.e.  from the top of the real content area.    I have code that can fix this -- it just requires me to get code into GTM.    Leaving as untriaged to determine priority. </pre>
