<title>Issue 39725 -   chromium -    testing_profile.h should maybe not need a real GetAutocompleteClassifier() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had to add GetAutocompleteClassifier() on TestingProfile because   tab_strip_controller_unittest.mm builds classes with a real location bar and   runs through them.  By comparison  Windows and Linux use a stub BrowserWindow   object which doesn't do this.  We should make sure the Mac test is testing   something unique and important or remove the test and the body of the   autocomplete classifier getter. </pre>
