<title>Issue 30688 -   chromium -    Pin BrowserAction Popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Users should be able to &quot;pin&quot; <a title="Proposal for Implementation of Browser Actions" href="/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">BrowserActions</a> if the developer enables it in   the manifest.    Example:  I use the Chromed Bird extension (<a href="http://chromedbird.com/">http://chromedbird.com/</a>) as my main   Twitter application. The biggest problem I have is that I like to go   through my tweets and open all the links that interest me before actually   spending time to read each page that I open.  Currently (at least in the   Windows version) when you click a link  the popup is closed so I end up   clicking a link  opening the popup again  finding where I left off  rinse   and repeat.    Solution 1:  Add a &quot;Pin this&quot; icon somewhere along the popup UI (or maybe just add a   &quot;pin-up&quot; API so developers can place it where they want it). This would   cause the popup to stay open no matter what the user did (including   clicking links  switching tabs  etc). The BrowserAction popup wouldn't go   away until either the user clicked &quot;unpin&quot;/close OR the if the user opens a   different BrowserAction popup.    Solution 2:  Add a context menu for <a title="Proposal for Implementation of Browser Actions" href="/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">BrowserActions</a> (see <a title="Allow extensions to edit the context menu for their Browser Action" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28335"> Issue 28335 </a>) and have an option   to &quot;Pin this to the side&quot;.  Pinning would then stick the popup on the right   side of the browser (similar to side panels in other browsers). It would   close only if the user clicked close or if they tried to pin a different   BrowserAction popup. </pre>
