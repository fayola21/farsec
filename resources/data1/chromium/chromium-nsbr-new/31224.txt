<title>Issue 31224 -   chromium -    Minimizing a window of Chrome makes my hidden taskbar disappear completely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Hide my taskbar (Windows Vista)  2. Open a maximized window of Chrome  3. Minimize that window    What is the expected result? I will be able to re-maximize the window and   then view my taskbar by moving my cursor to the bottom of the screen.      What happens instead? The taskbar permanently disappears when I'm working   on any window of Chrome until I: restore the current window down  open a   different window of Chrome  open a new tab in both windows of Chrome  and   then maximize both windows. Awkward.      <b>Please provide
