<title>Issue 43358 -   chromium -    Misspellings in Chromium-IPC-Code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I made a patch for Mozilla Firefox and I got told that the IPC Code is  partly from Chromium. The attached patch is a patch against Firefox code  but I guess it won't be too hard to convert it to a &quot;normal&quot; patch that you  can use?    Please feel free to ask if you should have any questions.   </pre>
