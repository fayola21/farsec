<title>Issue 46277 -   chromium -    buildbot should highlight links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Secnario 1  1. Go to build.chromium.org  2. Open the waterfall  3. Codereview links or any other link on that page is not clickable (e.g. <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/changes/17773">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/changes/17773</a>)    Scenario 2  1. Go to build.chromium.org  2. Open the console view  3. Notice how http:// based links are clickable in the descriptions  but https:// based links are not.    The second scenario is more important as there is a workaround for the first scenario: Click on the codereview link from the console.   </pre>
