<title>Issue 27373 -   chromium -    The Ctrl+Shift+I/J shortcuts are not disabled when the inspector files are absent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Delete the resources/inspector directory containing the Inspector JS   files.  2. Start chrome via the command line.  3. Press Ctrl + Shift + I (or J).    What is the expected output?  Nothing happens (or some sort of visual feedback is provided to the user to   inform about the disabled inspector).    What do you see instead?  A new window is opened  stating &quot;Error 6 (net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)&quot; for the   URL chrome://devtools/devtools.html   </pre>
