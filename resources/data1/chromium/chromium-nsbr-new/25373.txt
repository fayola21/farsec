<title>Issue 25373 -   chromium -    print to google docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I use mozilla to do shopping and banking so that I can print receipts to a   PDF or PostScript file; it'd be really awesome if Chrome could &quot;print to   Docs&quot; and then I wouldn't have to download/convert the page and then re-  upload it (well I expect chrome would upload it  but there wouldn't need to   be any conversion or extra download done).    Thanks! </pre>
