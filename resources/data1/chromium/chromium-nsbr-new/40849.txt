Install an extension that uses localstorage and open its background page  2. create an entry in localstorage (say  test/test for the key and value)  3. make sure that in Content Settings the option to clear cookies and other site data is not   enabled  4. restart the browser  5. open the background page from step 1. and view its localstorage entries      The entry created in step 2. should have persisted      Localstorage for the extension is completely empty    It appears that data stored by an extension in localStorage doesn't persist between browser   restarts; rendering it completely useless. </pre>
