<title>Issue 40553 -   chromium -    Oh snap on page load for part of john deere website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac 5.0.370.0 (Developer Build 43710)  didn't try other platforms      0. Make a clean profile  1. Load <a href="http://www.deere.com/en_US/deerecom/usa_canada.html">http://www.deere.com/en_US/deerecom/usa_canada.html</a>  2. Click &quot;Dealer Locator&quot; in the top left  3. Language and Country are auto set to English and US for me  for Product Category  select   &quot;Walk-Behind Equipment&quot;  page will update  4. For type into the Zip code box &quot;20148&quot; and hit enter        Expect a listing to show up  instead almost always get the &quot;Oh Snap&quot; page.  Some times I get the   Dealer locator again making me pick a language  but starting with a clean profile seems to always   give the Oh Snap.   </pre>
