<title>Issue 25368 -   chromium -    Omnibox completion popup is too transparent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5      1. Go to a page with a dark background  e.g. <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/">http://jwz.livejournal.com/</a>  2. Start typing in the omnibox  so that the popup opens        Omnibox should be subtly transparent.        Omnibox is offensively transparent  the background bleeds through and   distracts me.    This is obviously subjective  but maybe the rest of you agrees? Safari is   considerable less transparent (a bit too opaque in my eyes  but that's   probably just me). The alpha value should be somewhere in [.95  .97] I'd   guess (don't know what it is now). </pre>
