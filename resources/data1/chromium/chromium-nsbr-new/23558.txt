<title>Issue 23558 -   chromium -    Mac: bookmarks bar (and its off-the-side menu) doesn't have all the icons it should - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have bookmarks to pages which don't have a favicon (on bookmarks bar); a  bookmark to &quot;about:version&quot; will do.  2. Display the bookmarks bar and look.      Pages without bookmarks should get a generic page icon displayed on the  button (as on Windows; see also the icon in the back/forward dropdown).    The same applies to the off-the-side (chevron) menu. Moreover  on the  off-the-side menu  folders don't (but should) get folder icons also. The  lack of some icons leads to bad alignment of text in the menu. </pre>
