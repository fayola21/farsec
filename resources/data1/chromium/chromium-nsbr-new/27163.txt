<title>Issue 27163 -   chromium -    need to differentiate crashes from extension processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There needs to be a way to distinguish extension process crashes from normal   renderer crashes so that we can understand the effect of extensions on   stability.    Probably the easiest way to do this would be to add a new ptype - that way   the crash backend doesn't need to change its reporting as much.     </pre>
