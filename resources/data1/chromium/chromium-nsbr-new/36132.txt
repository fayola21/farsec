<title>Issue 36132 -   chromium -    Multiple User Name / Password Req on igoogle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Added multiple gadgets on the home page  2. Proxy configuration ON   3. While loading the page - it asks for user name / password 4-5 times  4. If I enter all time correctly - sometime it works / sometime it does not  5. If I skip entering the password  the proxy server locks account    This problem started happening after upgrade to Chrome 4.x only. Earlier I   was using the same configuration / gadgets it was asking password only once   and had no issue.    B'cos of this now I have to take out the igoogle from home page.                <b>Please provide
