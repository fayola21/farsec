<title>Issue 24149 -   chromium -    gcl presubmit should do svn pset - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Would be really nice if the gcl presubmit checks would do something like:    Need to run &quot;svn pset svn:eol-style LF &lt;item&gt;&quot; on these files:     [...]    Want me to go ahead do it for you now?  (y/n)    (same for svn pset svn:mime-type)    Since they know what needs to be done anyway.. </pre>
