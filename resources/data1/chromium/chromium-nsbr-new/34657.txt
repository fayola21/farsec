<title>Issue 34657 -   chromium -    Back-Forward: transitions between CF and IE do not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When navigations include mix of pages loaded chrome frame and IE  back   forward does not work correctly.     There are two issues here:  1. When chrome frame is loaded and the previous page was in IE  it     does not have idea of back forward history in IE. So Rt click     and 'Back' menu item in Chrome Frame works incorrectly.  2. When navigation transfers from chrome frame to IE  IE does not     have idea of all the previous page navigations happened inside     chrome frame. So it can go back to the last page loaded in chrome     frame but it cannot go back further.     </pre>
