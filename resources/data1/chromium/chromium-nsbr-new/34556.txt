<title>Issue 34556 -   chromium -    Inspector: Remember line position in Scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev    Open Inspector. Make sure the console at the bottom is NOT visible.  Debug a Javascript by setting a breakpoint under Scripts in Inspector.  Now go to Console (the tab  not the console at the bottom).   Go back to Scripts.  The line position is not what is was before. </pre>
