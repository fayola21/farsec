<title>Issue 33081 -   chromium -    Bookmark sync reversed the order of all my folders! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 dev  OS version               : &lt;10.6.2  or 10.5.8&gt;    I enabled bookmark sync on my MacBook Pro  on which I've been using the   dev channel of Chrome for a while (and which has a ton of bookmarks    originally imported from Safari.)  I downloaded the latest dev channel build to my Mac Pro  which I haven't   been using Chrome on yet  launched it  and immediately enabled   bookmark sync (without importing any bookmarks.)    Soon thereafter I noticed that  on both machines  the order of items in   almost all of my bookmark folders is reversed. This effect goes down to all   nesting levels. For some reason one folder in the bookmark bar was left   unaffected (and its subfolders).    (Almost certainly related: For about 10 minutes  Chrome on both machines   was very unresponsive  locking up for 10-30 seconds at a time before   handling input. This is probably a symptom of the sync code shuffling all   the bookmarks around -- <a title="[Mac] Changes to multiple bookmarks lock up UI thread for seconds" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30600"> bug 30600 </a> causes very slow performance when   any bookmark is modified  if you have a lot of bookmarks  which I do.) </pre>
