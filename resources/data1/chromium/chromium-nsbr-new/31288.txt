<title>Issue 31288 -   chromium -    migrate google chrome xp/mac/linux builds from fyi to main waterfall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we have builders on the fyi waterfall which match official builds   fairly closely. These should be on the main waterfall  possibly gating. That   way we can catch regressions sooner  and also can incorporate the result into   the score used for selecting when to branch release candidates.   </pre>
