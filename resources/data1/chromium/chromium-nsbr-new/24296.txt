<title>Issue 24296 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox popup text tightens spacing before truncating when resizing window. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Enter some text in omnibox so the popup is up.  2. Resize the window smaller until things start truncating.        When you're sizing smaller  the text is stable until it reaches the current width  then it starts   compressing until it truncates  at which point the remaining text is the same as before things were   tightened.  I think this might be janky  though not the sluggish kind of jank.    [I believe the fix is a trivial addition to the paragraph style for the text involved.] </pre>
