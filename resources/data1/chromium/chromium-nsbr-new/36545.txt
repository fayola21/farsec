<title>Issue 36545 -   chromium -    you can no longer use keyboard arrow keys to go through alternatives in drop down menues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)  URLs (if applicable) : the &quot;template&quot; dropdown on this page is a good   example.         If you click on it twice so the selections are no longer expanded  you   can't use the arrow keys to browse through the alternatives.      You should be able to use the arrow keys. it is superannoying i.e when   selecting month / year for your credit card when you are purchasing stuff   online.      nothing     </pre>
