<title>Issue 44751 -   chromium -    Adding own favicon ability - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm sad  that I have to request this feature  but let me explain the way I   use the bookmark-bar (under address-bar).  I have there links to my most-use webpages (like bank  administration of   whatever) and because the number of my important webpages is counting  I'm   now trying to make bookmarks smaller. I just delete the title and can have   here only the favicon.  Obviously  there is a problem with webpages  which have no favicon (like my   bank). I'd love to have link to my bank only with favicon (without text   title)  but now I can't  because my bank don't want add the favicon to their   web and I'm now not able to add my own favicon  which could help me to   recognize this bookmark. </pre>
