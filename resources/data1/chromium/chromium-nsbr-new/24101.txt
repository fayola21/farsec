<title>Issue 24101 -   chromium -    Can't install the theme &quot;Greyscale &quot; other themes work correctly (hosed profile) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.25    <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/google.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/google.html</a>        1. Go to <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/google.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/google.html</a>  2. Install Grayscale theme.      Theme installs and switches to the new theme.      I get the &quot;installed theme: Greyscale&quot; message  but it never switches from   the default theme.  All other themes I've tested seem to work.    I've go as far as renaming my default profile to something else and trying   it with a fresh profile  and it works correctly.  This happens on multiple   machines with the same profile. </pre>
