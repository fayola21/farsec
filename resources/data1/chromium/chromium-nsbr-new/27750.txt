<title>Issue 27750 -   chromium -    Mac: find on NTP with detached bookmark bar causes visual cruft - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to the NTP and make sure the detached bookmark bar is displayed   (Shift-Cmd-B if necessary).  2. Cmd-F to display the find bar (or is it a &quot;box&quot;?).  (3. Cmd-F again to hide it  making the cruft more visible.)      Nothing special is expected. Instead  we see a black (or green on a debug   build) around/under the find bar.    (On 10.5.8  on both the 4.0.245.0 dev channel release and on a local ToT   debug build.) </pre>
