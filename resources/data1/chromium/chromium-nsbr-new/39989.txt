<title>Issue 39989 -   chromium -    crashing tabs on hitting home/end/page up/page down keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.365.0 (Developer Build   42923) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: it is in the ubuntu PPA I think ...  OS + version: ubuntu 10.04 beta  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  Window manager: metacity (+gnome)    It seems now it's quite a frequent issue (I haven't noticed that earlier)   that tabs are crashing if I hit keys on the keyboard like: home  end  page   up or page down. I can see things like the following in the kernel log:    [712716.802665] chromium-browse[21051]: segfault at 0 ip 08ffd696 sp   bfddab40 error 4 in chromium-browser[8048000+23ab000]  [714234.344225] chromium-browse[23617]: segfault at 0 ip 08ffd696 sp   bfddab40 error 4 in chromium-browser[8048000+23ab000]   </pre>
