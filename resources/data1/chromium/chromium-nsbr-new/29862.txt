<title>Issue 29862 -   chromium -    Use SSPI on Windows clients for automatic login to generate tokens for NTLM and Negotiate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a sub-issue for solving <a title="Automatic integrated windows authentication (aka automatic NTLM / Negotiate Auth support)"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19">issue 19</a>.    On Windows Chrome  once a Negotiate or NTLM challenge has been issued from   an Intranet server  Chrome should use SSPI to generate the auth token rather   than relying on a user to manually enter username/password.     </pre>
