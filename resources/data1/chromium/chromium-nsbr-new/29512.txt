<title>Issue 29512 -   chromium -    In extension only: addEventListener when called from context where element wasn't created has incorrect event.target in handler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.25      1.Install extension  2.Open test.html  3.Click on Button A which doesn't work  Button B does work      When onClick is called from Button A it should identify the source via   (event.target == a) and pop up the message 'a'.      When onClick is called from Button A it doesn't identify the source via   (event.target == a) and pops up the message 'none'.    This only occurs when loading the javascript via an extension. Normally   this isn't a problem. Button B works b/c it is created in the same context   as the addEventListener call. </pre>
