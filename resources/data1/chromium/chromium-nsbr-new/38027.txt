A shortcut to Chrome was added to the &quot;autostart folder&quot;.  2. Two home pages were selected (URL as above)  3. Loging out  and log in again  4. Chrome starts with two tabs  5. Both tabs fail to load anything.  6. After a while  I get the option page not responding  wait for the page   to load or cancel it. If I cancel it  nothing happens (dialogue stays). If   I chose to wait  dialogue closes but no page will load.  7. I click on wait  but nothing will happen.  8. After 5 minutes  still no page loaded.  9. The page is shown as &quot;busy&quot; all the time (rolling symbol in tab header)  10. If I start a new tab  it will work as expected.  11. If I restart Chrome manually  all is fine (the two URLs load as   expected)  12. If I do not use automatic start of Chrome  everything loads as expetced   when I start it manually.  13. There are no extensions installed. </pre>
