<title>Issue 27347 -   chromium -    WidgetWin destruction needs inspection  reworking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you let a WidgetWin be destroyed  but not deleted  various bits of state   aren't reset: hwnd_ (in WindowImpl) isn't cleared and thus points to garbage    and the class is still a MessageLoop::Observer... there may be other things   too.    As a result  you can't really do anything safely with the class at this point   other than delete it (calling Init() again will checkfail on re-adding the   message loop observer)  and even having it around is dangerous since it's   still observing things.    Either we should mandate that all widgets are delete_on_destroy_  or we   should make it clean itself up enough that you could Init() again.  Note that   WidgetGTK seems to do a bit better in this regard. </pre>
