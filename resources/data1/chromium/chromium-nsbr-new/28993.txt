<title>Issue 28993 -   chromium -    Clean up Chromium media layout test results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to kinuko@chromium.org  linux tests will refer to windows results   if not present.    We have a TON of duplicated layout test results:  /webkit/data/layout_tests/platform/chromium-linux/LayoutTests/media/  /webkit/data/layout_tests/platform/chromium-mac/LayoutTests/media/  /webkit/data/layout_tests/platform/chromium-win/LayoutTests/media/    ...if linux/mac refer to chromium-win layout tests  we can delete ~66% of   our results :) </pre>
