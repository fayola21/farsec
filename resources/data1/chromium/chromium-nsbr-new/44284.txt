<title>Issue 44284 -   chromium -    Chrome extensions will not permit DOM manipulation when inside of an iframe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1    <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/chromeiframeproblem/home">http://sites.google.com/site/chromeiframeproblem/home</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. First  install the chrome_iframe_problem extension (attached).  2. Confirm that the paragraph on the &quot;I am the iFrame&quot; page is removed (by   the extension).  3. Visit the Home page and notice that the paragraph is not removed.      Since the iframe is loading that web address  the paragraph should be   removed. In Firefox  when I create a Greasemonkey script to do the same   thing  the script will still execute inside of the iframe.      The paragraph is not removed. I remember seeing a security error in   previous versions of Chrome that told me I couldn't modify the contents of   the iframe.    I've attached the extension to this report. </pre>
