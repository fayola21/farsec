<title>Issue 30163 -   chromium -    LoadLog get polluted by new-tab page requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Most often users get to the load log by opening a new tab  and then typing   &quot;about:net-internals&quot;.    The problem is  the new-tab page does some 20 or so odd requests  which   end up evicting lots of the interesting stuff from our bounded log. </pre>
