<title>Issue 33726 -   chromium -    The password should disappear when the nickname changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      ======================================  1. A user goes to the login page of a website (Gmail  adsense...) and   presses the &quot;save password&quot; button.  2. So  from now on  every time a user visits that URL  the login form will   be pre-filled.  3. A second user visits the same URL and just changes the 'username'  but   the password from the stored account remains.       ============================  That every time a user clicks the 'username' field  the 'password' field is   cleaned.      =====================  As a security bug  the second user discovers that the user whose pair   nickname-password was pre-filled and he have the same password!.     From my point of view this issue is specially relevant as long as is not   the same just accesing to a website (the user freely decided to store his   credentials) than getting the password!. With the password the second user   could change the first user's account password so that the first couldn't   access to the website any more. Or even he could try to access to other   websites where the first user had chosen the same credentials (on-line   banking  eMail...). </pre>
