<title>Issue 41561 -   chromium -    Rotation with Scaling artifact - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In player_wtl rotate 180 and scale to 4x  An artifact on the edge appears.  This is likely a symptom of fixed point math inaccuracy when filtering was  added.    Rotation is not exposed in chrome  so this is low priority for now.  Rotation and aspect ratios can be in the movie and/or CSS   </pre>
