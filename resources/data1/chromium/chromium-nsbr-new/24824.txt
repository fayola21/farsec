<title>Issue 24824 -   chromium -    &quot;bookmark all tabs&quot; can't be cancelled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a browser with 2 or 3 tabs  - control-shift-d  - click cancel in resulting dialog    expected:  - no new folder    actual:  - a folder is always created.    This is because the browser implementation adds it to the model before   showing the dialog  and never takes the ok/cancel into account. </pre>
