<title>Issue 28724 -   chromium -    Browser action button ui does not get pressed/depressed correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Click the browser action button repeatedly in fast succession on the same  pixel  or  1.Click the browser action button once where it presses/depresses correctly  2.Do not move the mouse one pixel. Wait for as long as desired  click again.      Expected: The button ui will be pressed and depressed for each mouse click.  Actual: The button ui is pressed and depressed only for the first click.      This has nothing to do with functionality  just minor UI issue. Mac UI does  not have this problem. Linux not tested.    Note  when the case occurs where the button ui is not pressed  keep the  mouse button down. If you move the mouse a pixel  the button ui will  suddenly be pressed. </pre>
