<title>Issue 27548 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/fast/dom/HTMLAnchorElement/* new and failing. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> These tests were added in <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/50784">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/50784</a>.  Most of   the failures are minor differences in our url parsing from vanilla webcore   (differences in when we convert characters to %xx representation)  but I think   there are some legitimate bugs here too. </pre>
