<title>Issue 33472 -   chromium -    The UI test LayoutTest controller needs some attention - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The UI test LayoutTest controller needs some attention.  It only works by   making some big assumptions about the LayoutTests we're running (for   example  assumes every one uses dump as text and/or notification when   done)  is clunky (uses cookies to store the results...which doesn't work for   some layout tests that have more results than can be stored in a cookie)  and   generally is a hack.    It seems like a v8 extension could make a pretty good LayoutTestController   implementation.    Currently the DOM Storage and Worker tests are run this way.  Probably others   will in the future.  Making this more solid seems well worth the effort. </pre>
