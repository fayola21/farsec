<title>Issue 35996 -   chromium -    Apply cookie settings domain-wide - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cookies are domain wide settings  and therefore  access to cookies should be   handled domain wide  not host wide    e.g. if you have a cookie for foo.com and you go to www.foo.com  the browser   will send the cookie with the request. So if you then add a setting to block   cookies for foo.com  the cookie should not be send when you open   www.foo.com. </pre>
