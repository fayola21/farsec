<title>Issue 29395 -   chromium -    opening new tabs with Flash causes browser to hang? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I've noticed recently that opening 3-4 tabs from (say) Techmeme  the   browser will become unresponsive. I can't scroll  but I can switch between   tabs. The tabs that were opened keep trying to load forever. Shift-escape   doesn't bring up the task manager  but you can open the task manager with   (Page)-&gt;Developer-&gt;Task Manager. Then kill the Shockwave plug-in and   suddenly all the tabs start loading and the logjam is cleared and I can   scroll again.        Shockwave/Flash problems shouldn't keep tabs from loading.      See above.    <b>Please provide
