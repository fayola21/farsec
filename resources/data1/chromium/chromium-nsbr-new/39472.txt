<title>Issue 39472 -   chromium -    Install bubble does not display. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Google Chrome  5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta  WebKit  532.9  V8  2.0.6.6  User Agent  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_2; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.9   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.11 Safari/532.9    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://chromeadblock.com">http://chromeadblock.com</a>  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: correct behavior      1. Visit chromeadblock.com (or any Extensions Gallery install page)  2. Click Install  click OK in the warning message.        You see a install bubble.        No install bubble appears.    I don't have a mac to reproduce this myself  but several AdBlock users have   reported not getting an install bubble on a Mac; the only Mac install I've ever    watched got no bubble; and a friend just repro'd the above for me and got no   bubble (the version and OS info are his). </pre>
