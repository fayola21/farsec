<title>Issue 26049 -   chromium -    Debugger keyboard shortcuts produce no effect when the Console view is opened. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. While the debugger is suspended  bring up the Console view.  2. Press any of the debugger shortcuts (F8  F10  F11)      The debugger state should change (Continue  Step Over  Step In). Nothing   happens instead.  The shortcuts work as expected when the console view is hidden.   </pre>
