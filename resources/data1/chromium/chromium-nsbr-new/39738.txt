<title>Issue 39738 -   chromium -    Middle-dragging on Chrome Linux bookmark bar leaves buttons in hover state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to the new tab page where you can see the bookmark bar. Press the middle   mouse button and drag off of the button (either out of the toolbar or onto   another button). The button will stay in the hover state and not go back to   the regular one. You can make all the buttons be painted in the hover state   simultaneously if you do this to each one. </pre>
