<title>Issue 36064 -   chromium -    newer versions of Chrome chg setup of mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)    This newer version of Chrome changes the settings for my mouse - logitech   marble mouse.  My setup on my computer changes the acceleration of the curser    and the programing for the buttons.  This version of chrome reverts these   settings to the mouse default settings.  I use v 2.0.172.30 on another   computer and this does not occur.  I have tried to reload an earlier version   of chrome and keep getting this version.  Help.
