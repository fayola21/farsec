<title>Issue 27101 -   chromium -    Printed payment at American Express Website.  Computer froze  then slowly recovered.  Chrome memory usage shot to 8gb and even with all windows closed  keeps a shell process running that holds 8gb of memory open. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Printed payment at American Express Website.  Printed to Network Brother  9840CDW printer as I have on this workstation many times before upgrading  to 3.0.195.32 on the Amex website.  2.Computer froze  then slowly recovered (1-2 min).  Chrome memory usage  shot to 8gb.  3.  Closed all chrome windows and closed chrome.  Memory usage stayed high.   Looked in Windows task manager and found a chrome process still open but  not with 8gb of memory usage.  Killed this process and memory dropped to  1.5gb used immediately.      Normal Chrome use since Chrome was released.      Every time I start Chrome now the memory jumps to 8gb of usage regardless  of what is opened.  This is unchanged by a reboot in Windows 7 x64 or a  printer spooler restart.    <b>Please provide
