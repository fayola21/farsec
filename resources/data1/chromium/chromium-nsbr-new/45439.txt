<title>Issue 45439 -   chromium -    WebGL does not work on 64-bit Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using the Mesa driver for <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=500">R500</a> cards  with OpenGL 1.5 and support for   the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension (I checked with glxinfo)  and WebGL   still doesn't work. I'm running the latest dev channel build on Ubuntu Linux   64-bit (6.0.408.1 dev)  and I tried with and without compositioning on.   WebGL does not start  and I get a message saying   &quot;WebGraphicsContext3DDefaultImpl: glXChooseFBConfig failed&quot; when trying to   load WebGL pages. </pre>
