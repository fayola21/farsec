<title>Issue 31603 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot; to context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature/Enhancement Request    Google has done a good job at making Chrome feel &quot;native&quot; on OS X  but   one thing you're missing is the &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot; option in the   context menu.  In Safari (and many other native OS X applications)  this   option passes the highlighted text to Dictionary.app  and is something that   I find very useful.    Another option (which might be more appropriate for Google/Chrome)   might be to have &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot; conduct a &quot;define:term&quot; search on   Google.  In other words  if I highlighted the term &quot;code&quot; and selected &quot;Look   Up in Dictionary&quot;  the following would open in a new tab:    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:code">http://www.google.com/search?q=define:code</a> </pre>
