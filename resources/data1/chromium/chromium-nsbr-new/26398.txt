<title>Issue 26398 -   chromium -    Queue of app-modal dialogs may get corrupted  blocking future dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the TabContents that creates a dialog (e.g.  window.alert()) navigates   away before the dialog is shown  the queue of dialogs to show gets corrupted   and grows forever from then on. Observable symptom is that the affected tab   will stop showing any dialogs  because it thinks it has one up already.    I'm not sure how to make this show up in the wild. I encountered it with some   debugging code in place that tricks the alert queue into thinking the page   has navigated when it hasn't. </pre>
