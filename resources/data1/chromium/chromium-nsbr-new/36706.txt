<title>Issue 36706 -   chromium -    Feature: user-agent string API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Users can modify the user-agent string from the command line  but not from   within an extension.  It would be nice to have an API to do this.  It would   be nice to also modify the navigator.vendor string too.    Perhaps this request fits under the larger &quot;API to modify HTTP requests&quot;   umbrella. </pre>
