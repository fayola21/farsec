<title>Issue 40356 -   chromium -    Whish: use system open/save file dialog instead always gtk dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.366.2  OS + version: Kubuntu 10.04  Window manager: KDE  Behavior in Linux Firefox 3.6: Firefox always use GTK open/save dialog  Behavior in Konqueror 4.4: Konqueror use default system open/save dialog  Behavior in Midori 0.2.2: Midori always use GTK open/save dialog  Behavior in Arora 0.10.2: Arora use default system open/save dialog  Behavior in Opera 10.10: Opera always use GTK open/save dialog      1. Try to attach file from network share to e-mail in gmail (or any other   web-site).  2. Not see in &quot;open file&quot; dialog &quot;network&quot; link.  Another example:  1. Try to upload the photo to image-hosting from folder where stored many   photos.  2. You see list of photos but not previews of this photos - you must click to   each photo to see preview.      For first example  if user use KDE  use see system open file dialog  and can   open files from network share.  For second example user can enable preview-mode and see previes of all photos in   folder.      Google Chrome always display uncomfortable and non-functional GTK dialog who not   allow user just upload/download file from/to network share or just look at the   folder in preview-mode  when preview of all images in folder is displayed and   visible for user. </pre>
