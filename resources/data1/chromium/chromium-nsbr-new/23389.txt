<title>Issue 23389 -   chromium -    ThreadSafeHistogram is not thread safe. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ThreadSafeHistogram inherits from Histogram and the constructor of Histogram   registers the histogram with the (global) StatisticsRecorder.    This pattern make it so that this construct:       static ThreadSafeHistogram my_histogram(...);     my_histogram.Add(value);    is not thread safe because the registration is racy.    The only user of this code will be removed shortly so there is not an urgency   to fix it.   </pre>
