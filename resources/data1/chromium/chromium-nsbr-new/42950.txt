<title>Issue 42950 -   chromium -    SVG: text-rendering:geometricPrecision or :optimizeLegibility breaks font substitution - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Load attached chrome_glyphs_reduction.svg; note that it assumes that Tahoma   and Arial Unicode MS fonts are installed. This repeats the same snippet of   Kanji text 4 times with different styling. If the Unicode gets mangled in   transmission  I took it from   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system</a>    Case 1 uses Tahoma and text-rendering:geometricPrecision  Case 2 uses Tahoma and text-rendering:optimizeLegibility  Case 3 uses Tahoma and text-rendering:optimizeSpeed  Case 4 uses Arial Unicode MS and text-rendering:geometricPrecision          Tahoma doesn't contain glyphs for Kanji  so Chrome should substitute   another font for these characters in cases 1-3. Arial Unicode MS does   contain these glyphs  so case 4 should always appear correctly.          Font substitution only happens in cases 3 and 4. Cases 1 and 2 just show   the standard missing-glyph box for the Kanji characters.      <b>Please provide
