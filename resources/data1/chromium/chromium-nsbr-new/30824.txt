<title>Issue 30824 -   chromium -    HTML5 storage databases could be used to track users who have the setting &quot;block third party cookies&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tried iframing a demo site that simply sets a little data in local   storage and web database facilities (where available).    <a href="http://scary.beasts.org/misc/iframe_storage.html">http://scary.beasts.org/misc/iframe_storage.html</a> frames this:  <a href="https://cevans-app.appspot.com/static.storage.html">https://cevans-app.appspot.com/static.storage.html</a>    State of the art is terrible here. All of IE8  FF3.5 and Safari4 fail to   block the iframed database storage  even with the &quot;block third party   cookies&quot; option set. None of the decent mitigations in the privacy section   of &quot;<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/</a>&quot; seem to be used.    This is very cross-browser since although only Safari4 has Web Database    everyone has Local Storage.    Just because state of the art is bad  there's no reason we can't be better.   Out of the possible implementations  I'd recommend disabling the database   support when:  - It is accessed from a &quot;third party domain&quot;  - And the user is blocking cookies from third party domains    This  IMHO  best represents the spirit of that setting  which is &quot;don't   make it trivial for ad networks to track me&quot;.   </pre>
