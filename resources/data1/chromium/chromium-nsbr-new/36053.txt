<title>Issue 36053 -   chromium -    Command line option to alter host resolutions for spdy testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We'd like more flexibility for routing test configurations to specific   servers.    Specifically  we'd like simple inclusion and exclusion rules such as:      EXCLUDE *.bat.foo.com    INCLUDE *.foo.com 1.2.3.4    These rules would cause *.foo.com  with the exception of *.bat.foo.com  to   be diverted to host 1.2.3.4.    We don't need port mapping; although that might be helpful in the future   for other testing.    The exact syntax of this feature is completely flexible; it can be as   cmdline options or as a file or whatever.  It is only for testing. </pre>
