<title>Issue 42754 -   chromium -    Bookmark Drag &amp; Drop Should Give Better Indication of Operation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Bookmark bar and folder drag and drop operations should give a better indication of the actual   operation that will occur  much like the Finder.    - If making a copy  then the cursor should have some kind of 'copy' tag.  - If dragging to a disallowed location then a 'no drop' cursor should be shown. (This will occur if   one attempts to drag a folder onto itself or one of its children.) </pre>
