<title>Issue 42899 -   chromium -    autofill not triggered if different username is entered other than saved username/password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 5.0.375.28 (Official Build 45883) dev Ubuntu 8.04 64 bit      1. Login to gmail with username1 and logout(Make sure autofill is enabled)  2. Login to gmail with username2 and logout  3. Login to gmail with username1 and save password for it  Logout  4. Now the username/password fields will be auto-filled  5. Delete username/password fields entries   6. Try to login with username2     What is the expected output?   username2 should be seen in autofill dropdown    What do you see instead?  No drop down seen.   Is this expected behavior? Will autofill not be triggered if the   username/password is already saved and user tries to enter another   username?        </pre>
