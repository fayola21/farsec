<title>Issue 23241 -   chromium -    DevTools debugger is slow on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When debugging a web app using DevTools debugger on Mac  the interaction   feels very slow. Stepping to a next line  and expanding an object in variables   pane can take up to several seconds between making a click in UI and seeing   the result.    In the Windows version of Chrome  and in Safari on Mac the same operations   feel like being instant. </pre>
