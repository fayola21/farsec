<title>Issue 45745 -   chromium -    Remove omnibox ears. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should detach the ears from the omnibox like so:    - Reload becomes its own button again and combines with Stop. I will not stab   anyone if this is done the way it's combined with Go now. (i.e. using logic   so it doesn't change state if the mouse is over it).  - We kill the go button.  - The omnibox gets rounded rect edges matching the shape of adjacent buttons   on either end.     </pre>
