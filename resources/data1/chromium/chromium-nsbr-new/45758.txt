<title>Issue 45758 -   chromium -    New style tab animations for Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is sort of the Linux version of <a title="TabStrip animation parity with Windows"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45737">issue 45737</a> except that there's probably   less work to do... just:    - match the new &quot;new tab&quot; animation that Windows has  once Scott is done   tuning it  - be able to run multiple concurrent animations. </pre>
