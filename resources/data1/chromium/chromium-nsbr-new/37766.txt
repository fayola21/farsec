<title>Issue 37766 -   chromium -    Keychain does not handle dynamic keychains for SSL Auth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : Any HTTPS site requiring a client cert  OS version               : 10.5.8 Build 9L30    It seems that Chrome dosnt handle dynamic keychains well.  For example  when I plug in my   smartcard  a new keychain is created with the cert and key in it.  When I remove the card the   keychain goes away.  If I start chrome with my smartcard plugged in  sites work fine. Removing the   card and re-inserting renders chrome unable to find my certs.  Also starting chrome up without my   card plugged in seems to have the same affect. Is chrome caching  the list of keychains somewhere?   </pre>
