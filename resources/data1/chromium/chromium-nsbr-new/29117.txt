<title>Issue 29117 -   chromium -    Make it easy to post feedback on gallery extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a user:    &quot;I had to re-search for the extension I wanted to give feedback on.  It'd be   much easier if there was a clear and easy way to get back to the extension's   page via the &quot;Extensions&quot; manager page - right now it seems I can only   Disable and Uninstall from that page.  Making the icons and/or titles links   to that page would be a quick and easy fix.&quot; </pre>
