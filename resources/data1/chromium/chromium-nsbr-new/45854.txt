<title>Issue 45854 -   chromium -    Race condition in launching browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Create 2 different shortcuts - one for browser with a bunch of tabs to   automatically open (mine restores sessions for about 10 tabs in 2 different   windows)  one for gmail as application.  2. Put those shortcuts into Startup menu along with some other heavy-  loading stuff (mine has Visual Studio  Outlook  Winamp  XWin32  MS Office   Communicator).  3. Reboot your PC.        When all browser windows are opened they should belong to the same main   browser process.        For some reason gmail has its own main browser process and a bunch of   processes for each extension installed.    <b>Please provide
