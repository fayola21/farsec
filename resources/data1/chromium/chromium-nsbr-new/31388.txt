<title>Issue 31388 -   chromium -    XHR requests containing username and password executed from the extension fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (dev channel)      1. Create an extension which executes an XHR request to an url containing   the username and password e.g. https://username:password@www.example.com/  2. Execute the request against a webpage requiring a basic authentication.   The request fails silently. No request is being sent to the server. The XHR onerror method is not launched.  3. The same url works well when executed from the Chrome Tab.      The XHR request should complete successfully or report 401 if   authentication fails.      The request fails silently.     </pre>
