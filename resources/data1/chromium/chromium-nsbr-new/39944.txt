<title>Issue 39944 -   chromium -    Create complex regular expression object bug in Chromium 5.0+ ( excluding Chrome 4 ) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 5.0+ (I don't found this bug on Google Chrome)    <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/Calendar/Calendar.asp">http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/Calendar/Calendar.asp</a>           Safari 4: pass    Firefox 3.x: pass           IE 7: pass           IE 8: pass  Chrome 4.1.249.1045 (42898): pass      1. Go to   <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/Calendar/Calendar.aspx">http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/Calendar/Calendar.aspx</a>   or other web page that use Microsoft AJAX Calendar.  2. Click textbox that has calendar behavior.  3. Calendar control will be displayed but title of current calendar view is   missing.      Calendar control must correctly display its title of current calendar view   like 31 March  2010.      Calendar title is missing.    After I try to solve this problem  I just found that Chromium can't create   Regular Expression object from string like   &quot;//|dddd|ddd|dd|d|MMMM|MMM|MM|M|yyyy|yy|y|hh|h|HH|H|mm|m|ss|s|tt|t|fff|ff|  f|zzz|zz|z|gg|g/g&quot;. But this error only occur in my local website and   offical example of this control. But I don't found this bug in   <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/HOW%20TO%20Use%20the%20Calendar%20Control.as">http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/HOW%20TO%20Use%20the%20Calendar%20Control.as</a>  hx that use all non-minify source code.   </pre>
