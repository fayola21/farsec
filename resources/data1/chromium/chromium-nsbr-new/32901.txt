<title>Issue 32901 -   chromium -    Shouldn't inline autocomplete when case doesn't match - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We do a case-insensitive match for inline autocompletion right now.  We   should do a case-sensitive match.  In many web forms case matters  it looks   extremely weird to have your word completed in the opposite case from what   you're typing  and if you accept that completion the result isn't the same as   the completion target string. </pre>
