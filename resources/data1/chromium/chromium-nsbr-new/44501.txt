<title>Issue 44501 -   chromium -    Consider changing connections per proxy server limit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently both Firefox and Chrome limit the number of connections per http   proxy server (not to be confused with the 6 connection per _endpoint_ host   limit which is the same regardless of whether or not you go through a proxy)   to 15.  Chrome uses the same limit for SOCKS proxy servers.  My understanding   is this limit is desirable to prevent overloading a proxy server (similar to   how to use a 6 connection per endpoint host limit).    See <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45896">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45896</a> for the   implementation of this.    Should we be use a different limit?  15 came from Firefox.  Some people (at   least pinkerton  with a SOCKS proxy) report issues with http transactions   stalling  due to hitting this limit.  Do we need to raise this?  Also  I'm   not sure what Firefox does for SOCKS proxy servers.  Do they even have a   limit?  Do we want to treat HTTP and SOCKS proxy servers differently in terms   of connection limits?  I don't see a reason to offhand.    My personal feeling is we should probably raise the limit from 15 to   something like 32 or 64 or something.  I said powers of 2 chosen since wtc   likes them :P  Then we can run A/B experiments to lower the limits and see at   what level we can tighten them to  before transactions start stalling (I   think we can guesstimate this by seeing the effect on PLT  which will   probably increase dramatically for a percentage of users).    Thoughts? </pre>
