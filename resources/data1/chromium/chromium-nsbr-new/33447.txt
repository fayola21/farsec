<title>Issue 33447 -   chromium -    Monospace font not monospaced with slight hinting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Font settings:  Subpixel smoothing  then Hinting -&gt; Slight.    It appears the &quot;l&quot; glyph is getting 1px too wide  making the L76 in this   screenshot not line up properly.    Will claims he builds trunk regularly and this only started recently  in the   last few days probably. </pre>
