<title>Issue 27232 -   chromium -    Chrome can't start because can't load t2embed.dll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0   Vista 64  SP2    For some reasons I ware unable to run ant version of Chrome. After   debugging I findout that chrome can't load t2embed.dll.     t2embed.dll was present but permitions was set incorrectly. After fixing   permitions in system dirrectory it was fixed.    So may be this is the bug in some microsoft update. Other software was not   affected. </pre>
