<title>Issue 26342 -   chromium -    [sync cleanup fixit] browser_sync PathString should use UTF-8 everywhere - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Make PathString be an alias for std::string and use UTF-8 everywhere   (PathString works this way on Mac and Linux already).  Use base::FilePath   when we're dealing with an actual  factual filename (e.g. &quot;Sync   Settings.db&quot;). </pre>
