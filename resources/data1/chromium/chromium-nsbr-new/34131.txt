<title>Issue 34131 -   chromium -    Issues (probably) caused by using an NSButtonCell to have tables with icons per row - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open task manager or other places that use NSButtonCells to show tables   with one icon per row (hung renderer dialog  search engines dialog  ��_��__ are   there more?)  2. Hit tab a few times  3. Make the column with the icon very small  mouse over  and wait for tooltip   to appear.      After 2.  the table cell in the current row is drawn with a focus ring. After 3    no tooltip appears. </pre>
