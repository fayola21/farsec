<title>Issue 37609 -   chromium -    Extensions gallery should notify developer of comments (and should be able to star extensions) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On gallery pages for extensions  being alerted of comments would be useful    rather than having to frequently check for comments.  Arbitrary users should   be able to star extensions to be notified of comments  much like bugs on   Google Code. </pre>
