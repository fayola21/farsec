<title>Issue 41996 -   chromium -    Sync setup process should not depend on the window  from where it is launched. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:249.1059.    Also repros on DEV channel.    --Open two or more windows.  --Bring up sync dlg and enter login credentials and hit on sign-in button.  --While sync process is in progress  close the window from where sync is   initiated.    Issue: Interestingly  sync process also terminates  even though I've other   chrome windows running. I guess  We should continue Sync setup process as   long as Chrome is running.    PS: The bug is also applicable to sync dialog also.  i.e  -Open two windows.  -Bring up sync login dlg and close the window.    Issue: Sync dlg is closed. </pre>
