<title>Issue 28924 -   chromium -    In cPanel  after closing edit tab  can not open new edit tab because required pop-up won't come up again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Within cPanel  click file.   2. click edit button    3. Pop-up comes up to ask you language code is in. Click ok when pop-up   comes up.  4. look at file  then close file.  5. click link to bring back to 'main' page  and close the edit page tab.  6. attempt to repeat.      Pop-up won't come up 2nd time  and hence  no new edit tab. cPanel requires   this pop-up in order to validate the new tab. Necessary for me because I   use utf-8  which is not the default within cPanel.     <b>Please provide
