<title>Issue 31896 -   chromium -    Monospace tab rendered too short with hinting disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.291.0 (Developer Build 35606) Ubuntu    The pipes on the following lines should line up when rendered:                  | - &quot;tt|&quot; correctly rendered width  i               | - &quot;itt|&quot; correctly rendered width  iiiiiiii        | - &quot;iiiiiiiit|&quot; renders as if there is no space  iiiiiiiii       | - &quot;iiiiiiiiit|&quot; correctly rendered width    data-URI:  data:text/plain;base64 CQl8CmkJCXwKaWlpaWlpaWkJfAppaWlpaWlpaWkJfAo=      The pipes line up when rendered.      In Ubuntu  with Hinting set to None or Slight in System-&gt;Preferences-  &gt;Appearance-&gt;Fonts-&gt;Details  the third line looks to be missing a space.    I'm using DejaVu Sans Mono  13pt for monospace font in Chromium  and in   the above mentioned dialog I've set 116 dpi and Subpixel rendering    Hinting set to None and Subpixel Order set to RGB (attachment uses these   settings). I didn't try out all the possible config permutations of each   of these parameters  but I got same behaviour setting font to Courier   New  setting resolution to 96 dpi (didn't seem to change the font size in   chromium)  disabling smoothing  changing subpixel order  and setting   Hinting to Slight  restarting Chromium with each change in configuration.    With Hinting set to Medium or Full  the problem disappears  and the four   lines render correctly.    I can select the tab character in the third line  and a single column of   pixels are highlighted. </pre>
