<title>Issue 31957 -   chromium -    two chromes on the same profile opened - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555)     I managed to click on Chrome icon twice in such way  that it started two   identical separate chrome instances. The second instance complained that it   can't access profile. &quot;Exit&quot; from menu closed half of windows (from one of   two chromes).    As I understand Chrome  second click on the same icon should just open new   window in the same instance  not start completely duplicate instance. </pre>
