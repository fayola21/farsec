Move the Chrome window down and partially offscreen so that the omnibox   is just above the bottom of the screen.  2. Click the star button.      The bookmark bubble should appear above the omnibox with its arrow pointing   down  so that the whole bubble is onscreen.      The bubble is always opened below the omnibox  facing to the right. </pre>
