<title>Issue 36567 -   chromium -    Tab Between Autofill Text Fields on Mac Broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Chrome on Mac   2. Open Preferences dialog   3. Navigate to Personal Stuff panel   4. Click on &quot;Setup Autofill...&quot; button   5. Click in an address label text field   6. Hit the tab key.    Notice:    - tabbing between fields works as expected.    7. Create a new address with the &quot;Add an Address&quot; button   8. Click in new address label text field   9. Hit the tab key.    Notice:    - tabbing between fields now does NOT work.    Expected:    - tabbing between fields should cycle through all text fields in a   reasonable way.  Preferably left-to-right and top-to-bottom.   </pre>
