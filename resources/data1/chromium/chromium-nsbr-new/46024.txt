<title>Issue 46024 -   chromium -    extern &quot;C&quot; { ... } around #include - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome/nacl/sel_main.cc contains    EXTERN_C_BEGIN    #include &quot;...&quot;    EXTERN_C_END    where EXTERN_C_BEGIN is extern &quot;C&quot; { when compiling C++ code.  this is almost always wrong (except when the header files are C only).  in particular  the included files are also bilingual and do their own extern &quot;C&quot; { ... } wrapping. </pre>
