<title>Issue 26814 -   chromium -    Cells go into edit mode when switching to a google docs spreadsheet tab using the keyboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.233 ToT      1. Open a google docs spreadsheet in one tab  something else in another  2. Use cmd-shift-[ or ctrl-tab to switch tabs to the spreadsheet tab        Tab should become active        Tab becomes active  and the currently selected cell enters edit mode.    I guess that's because the tab receives a keyup event for [ or tab without   ever having seen a keydown for that. </pre>
