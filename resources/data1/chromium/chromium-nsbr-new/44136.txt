<title>Issue 44136 -   chromium -    Can't set Chrome as default browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install Chrome on a standard user account on Windows 7 (non-  administrative account).    2. On startup  click &quot;Set Default&quot; on the yellow information bar on the top   of the Chrome window  just below the address bar.  Supply credentials for   an administrative Windows User Account when prompted by Windows UAC.    3. Exit Chrome.  Restart Chrome - note that the yellow information bar   reappears  asking you once again whether to set Chrome as the default   browser.  Repeat step 2 and 3  infinitely.        Clicking &quot;Set Default&quot; sets Chrome as the default browser.        Chrome cannot be set as the default browser  probably due to UAC   incompatibility.      <b>Please provide
