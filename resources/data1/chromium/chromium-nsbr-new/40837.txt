<title>Issue 40837 -   chromium -    ExtensionApiTest.Bookmarks.getRecent timing flakiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Bookmark creation date is stored with millisecond resolution.  In the   getRecent test  we do some comparisons that assume that the results from   getRecent are in the same order as we created the nodes.  If they got created   in the same millisecond  then sort order is non-deterministic. </pre>
