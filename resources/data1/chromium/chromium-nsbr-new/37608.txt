<title>Issue 37608 -   chromium -    Calendar app (calvis) gives a mismatching event description - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta (Mac)  URL : <a href="http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/event/calendar/">http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/event/calendar/</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : As expected  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: As expected      1. Click &gt;&gt; to see the events in the next months  2. Mouse-over any event listed    Expected behavior:  The mouse-over loads the correct description    Actual behavior:  The event description on mouse-over does not match that of the event.   Mouse-over for the second time  and the description gets loaded.    While this could be a big in their calvis  the problem does not reproduce on   Safari  Firefox  or MSIE8. So probably related to something in V8 or our   event handling mechanism. </pre>
