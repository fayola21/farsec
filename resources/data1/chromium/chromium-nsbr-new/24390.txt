<title>Issue 24390 -   chromium -    Mac: &quot;Full Screen&quot; menu item needs help - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Note that the menu can be accessed even when in full screen mode  and   selecting the &quot;Full Screen&quot; item leaves full screen mode  of course.)    Options:  - Replace it with the more accurate  but no more helpful  &quot;Toggle Full   Screen Mode&quot;.  - Replace it with &quot;Enter/Exit Full Screen Mode&quot; (which changes depending   on context). This is what Apple's HIG suggests   &lt;<a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/</a>  Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGMenus/XHIGMenus.html#//apple_ref/  doc/uid/TP30000356-TPXREF121&gt;.  - Go for a checkmark  which is apparently what we have on Windows.   Apple's HIG doesn't approve of this (it suggests a checkmark when one can   choose between multiple items).   </pre>
