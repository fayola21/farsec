<title>Issue 24463 -   chromium -    Weird bookmark bar showing on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1) Open chrome set with a theme  always show bookmarks  and the NTP as the   home page.  2) Hit fullscreen.  3) Note that the floating bookmarks bar is sort of displayed  but is only a   few pixels tall and doesn't contain bookmarks.    I'm not sure what it's supposed to do here  but this is wrong. </pre>
