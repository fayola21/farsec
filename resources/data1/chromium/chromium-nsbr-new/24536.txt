<title>Issue 24536 -   chromium -    Resource leakage makes OS do strange stuff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.8  OS version               : 10.6.1      I keep chrome open a long time (several days  and through stand-by   actions)  Then at some point chrome starts to act funny:  * entering an url in the bar and pressing enter does nothing  * the bookmarkbar gets 'loose'  * select-controls are buggy    If I try to start safari  or a open a new terminal-window  I get an error   (terminal says something like can't create pty or tty)    I'm pretty sure by now that the problem is chrome. If I quit all apps  I still   have problems opening a new shell.   Everything returns to normal if I quit and restart chrome.    Also I've seen chrome corrupt all my history at one point and eating all cpu   when emptying the cache)  I'm not sure how to dump a stacktrace when this happens.    Is there some kind of memoryleak tool built into chrome? So I can send   something like a list of allocated objects?   </pre>
