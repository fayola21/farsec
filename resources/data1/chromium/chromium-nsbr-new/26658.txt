Enable gmail or docs to use gears and create an application shortcut in  desktop or quick launch bar  2. Uninstall Chrome and delete all browsing data (app shortcut with correct  favicon should still be there )  3. Re-install Chrome  (After step 3  the favicon is not correct anymore)  4. Delete the incorrect favicon   5. Enable the same application in step 1 again and create an application  shortcut    What is the expected output?   correct favicon is displayed       What do you see instead?  Incorrect favicon      This looks like it's only happening on Vista and not in XP.  Environment: VMWare Vista SP1 </pre>
