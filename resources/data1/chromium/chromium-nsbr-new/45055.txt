<title>Issue 45055 -   chromium -    Folder/Group behavior in the bookmarks bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    OS version               : 10.6.3      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't tested...      1. Always show the bookmarks bar  2. Add more bookmarks than will show in the current width of the window (so there are the two   little arrows indicating that there are more bookmarks to show)  3. Click on that pair of arrows to show the other bookmarks  4. Move the mouse to the right to hover over the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; button  causing it to   expand.  5. Move the mouse back over the two little arrows.      The extra bookmarks that were first revealed by the two little arrows should be revealed again   through the drop down list (in the same fashion as a folder would  like the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot;   does when you hover over it)      It does not reveal the extra bookmarks  but instead  the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; stay visible on the   screen.    I  personally  think that expanding any folder in the bookmarks bar on hover is not an intuitive   behavior  but instead  the folder  or group  of bookmarks should only expand if actually clicked.   For example  when clicking on a bookmark folder in the bookmarks bar and then hovering over a   folder next to it  the next folder should not expand unless actually clicked (this is how all   extensions behave). In the case I mentioned above in the bug  this sort of behavior would be   beneficial because the two little arrows are so small in width. Currently  if you don't move the   mouse straight down from the arrows  the focus moves to &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; to the right of it.    Sorry for the wordiness of all that and I hope it made sense. If I can clarify somehow  please let   me know how to be more specific. </pre>
