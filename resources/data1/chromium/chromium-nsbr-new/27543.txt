<title>Issue 27543 -   chromium -    On sync setup wizard  'Cancel' button jumps vertically on gaia login error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of fixing <a title="need to handle all Google Accounts login error states"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19738">issue 19738</a> I noticed that the 'Cancel' button jumps  around vertically on the 'Error signing in' page that is shown if you enter  invalid credentials on the first gaia login page.  Basically when you hit  submit  the error message disappears (the style is set to 'none')  so the  cancel button moves up.  I tried setting it to 'hidden' but that had the  same effect.    This should be fixed before stable. </pre>
