<title>Issue 43267 -   chromium -    Chrome Mac is very slow to change address bar when clicking link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev         Safari 4: OK      1. Go to any page.  (Use <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/57956">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/57956</a> as an example.)  2.  Click on a link.  (In this case <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37643.">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37643.</a>)        Should update the address bar immediately to show that its received your click and it's working   on loading the page.        Chrome only changes the address bar right before displaying the page.  You have no clue what   it's doing (or even that it's doing anything if it was still loading the previous page when you   clicked the link since the loading indicator never changes).     </pre>
