<title>Issue 28349 -   chromium -    submit button bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. create a form containing this code:  &lt;form&gt;  &lt;input ... /&gt;  ...  &lt;button onclick=&quot;document.dbinfo_form.target='_self';   document.dbinfo_form.action='index.php?  option=com_verlihub&amp;amp;task=dbinfo_save';   document.dbinfo_form.submit();&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;button onclick=&quot;document.dbinfo_form.target='_blank';   document.dbinfo_form.action='index.php?  option=com_verlihub&amp;amp;task=dbinfo_test';   document.dbinfo_form.submit();&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  ...  &lt;/form&gt;    As you can see its a simple form which has 2 buttons in the end  which   should each submit a form in a different way. The test button makes a   form's target &quot;_blank&quot; (opens new window).    2. Click Test button with your mouse (to submit form in a new window)  3. Close that new window and try to click Test button again. Does it open a   new window again (as it should do)? It doesn't open it for me.  4. Now try to press any keys on your keyboard (ctrl for example) and   release it. Try now to click Test button again :) It works now  right? :)      The expected result was to submit form in a new window each time the Test   button has been pressed.      The form submits in a new window only once and all the other times    clicking again the Test button doesn't do anything (until you press   something on the keyboard before another click). If you press any button   before any further clicks on Test button  then it again submits form in a   new window.    <b>Please provide
