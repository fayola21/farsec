<title>Issue 42780 -   chromium -    AutoFill Help Link needs to be added. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Launch Chrome  2.  Open Preferences  3.  Open AutoFill settings dialog  4.  Wonder what happens to my credit card info and address information (Privacy  Security).  And   in general how AutoFill is supposed to work (Functionality).        Expected:  I would expect some kind of &quot;Learn more&quot; link that takes me to a page that helps to   address my curiosities and concerns.    Actual: No link or help button currently.    There is a help article at:     <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=142464">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=142464</a>  but it is Windows-only and doesn't describe the (1) functionality in enough detail  and (2)   address issues of privacy or security (i.e. where and how is my data stored.).     </pre>
