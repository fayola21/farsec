<title>Issue 28610 -   chromium -    Find should refresh after DOM change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.252.0 (Developer Build 32428)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/90723/bob-aman">http://stackoverflow.com/users/90723/bob-aman</a>    Currently  if you do a Find on the current page  and an AJAX call updates   the page content  the previous results of the Find operation are still   displayed.  This also confuses the Find window's counter.  For example  if I   search for &quot;foo&quot; on a page and get five results  three of which are in a   transient section of the page that gets updated by an AJAX operation  after   the update  it might say &quot;2 of 5&quot;  and cycling will move through only the   two results outside the transient section  but it will increment all the way   from 1 through 5.  It's even more confusing if the AJAX update actually   inserted the term you had searched for.  It won't highlight the terms on the   page or update the counter  but it will still cycle through them.    Chrome should detect that the DOM content has changed and rerun the   current search  ideally maintaining the currently highlighted occurrence.    So the expected result in this case would be that after the DOM change  it   would say &quot;1 of 2&quot; instead of &quot;1 of 5&quot;.   </pre>
