<title>Issue 31430 -   chromium -    tab-completion races with suggest results in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Type 'wi' in the omnibox  2. See &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; completion showing briefly  with the &quot;press tab&quot;   hint  3. Wait ~200ms for the suggest results to appear      The completion stays in place  and the tab hint stays as well. Pressing tab   goes into 'Search wikipedia.org:' mode.      The completion and tab hint go away  can't tab to search on wikipedia  It's a race condition  if I type 'tab' slightly too slow  say  in 250ms   instead of 200ms  then I tab into the first item in the new tab page   instead of completing wikipedia.org.      <b>Please provide
