<title>Issue 37334 -   chromium -    HostResolver leak on chromeos build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looks like global HostResolver instance is leaking somewhere and causing  the crash at exit (occasionally). I could reproduce this on my machine and  this sometimes happens on try bot as well (see below). The global   HostResolver is created and destroyed in IOThread::Init and   IOThread::CleanUp. This instance is ref counted  and (I believe) is   supposed to be deleted in CleanUp (this is what I see on gtk/toolkit_view   build). On chromeos build  however  the ref count is 6 instead of 1 when   IOThread releases it. I just started investigation  but if anyone has an   idea  let me know.      <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-</a>  server/builders/linux_chromeos/builds/738/steps/ui_tests/logs/OpenBrowserWi  ndow    [26697:26705:5575355790:WARNING:/b/slave/linux_chromeos/build/src/ipc/file_  descriptor_set_posix.cc(18)] FileDescriptorSet destroyed with unconsumed   descriptors  [26697:26705:5575355837:WARNING:/b/slave/linux_chromeos/build/src/ipc/file_  descriptor_set_posix.cc(18)] FileDescriptorSet destroyed with unconsumed   descriptors  [26697:26705:5575355856:WARNING:/b/slave/linux_chromeos/build/src/ipc/file_  descriptor_set_posix.cc(18)] FileDescriptorSet destroyed with unconsumed   descriptors  [26697:26705:5575363954:FATAL:/b/slave/linux_chromeos/build/src/base/observ  er_list.h(196)] Check failed: ObserverListBase&lt;ObserverType&gt;::size() == 0U   (3 vs. 0)       </pre>
