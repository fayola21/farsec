<title>Issue 33316 -   chromium -    http/tests/xmlhttprequest/redirect-cross-origin-tripmine.html fails with a text diff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This started happening between <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37311">r37311</a> and <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37313">r37313</a>.  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37311">r37311</a> looks to be the   most likely culprit.  Here's the text diff output:    Test that a cross-origin redirect does not result in a non-simple request   being sent to the target.
