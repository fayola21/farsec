<title>Issue 30759 -   chromium -    CJK characters not shown under @font-face with opentype embedded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Using @font-face technique with opentype font on the latest Chrome dev  2. If the context applied with @font-face rule contains cjk characters  the    browser fails to render the cjk characters with the fallback font-family   setting  3. However  apply @font-face rule with ttf font to the webpage  the cjk   characters display correctly.      The cjk characters should be rendered with the fallback local cjk font-  family even we use roman font as the primary font-family.      Using opentype font  the cjk characters will not be displayed  whereas the   English characters work well.     Both English and cjk characters work well with truetype font.    <b>Please provide
