<title>Issue 42121 -   chromium -    [Native Translator] UX : Translation toolbar UI need redesign - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://calendar.google.com">http://calendar.google.com</a>      1. Visit a page on a foreign language  2. Toolbar will appear to confirm which language was detected and ask with button if the user   want to translate it  and there's the option drop down for &quot;never translate this language&quot; or never   &quot;translate this site&quot;  finally a cross to hide the toolbar.      This needs to be simpified :   1. Make the hidden options more visible (add checkboxes for Never translate this site/language...   note that sometime someone may need to check both)  2. Remove the Nope button and just add the usual Apply/OK/Discard  3. A turn off would be very handy (rather than having users going in the deep options)      basically nothing ... A lot of people just disable the translate feature.  Most users that were trying to say &quot;never translate this language&quot; (in example) checked it  then as   nothing happened... tried the Nope button.  Then toolbar would reappear in similar cases  so they would try ticking again  but using the cross   to hide the toolbar...  Here again it would fail.    Additional information below.
