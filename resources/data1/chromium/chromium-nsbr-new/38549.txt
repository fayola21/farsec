<title>Issue 38549 -   chromium -    No way to tell what extensions are loaded on a given page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.354.0 (Developer Build 41560)  URLs (if applicable) : any    I have a lot of extensions (up to 40) running. Occasionally a website will   break as a result of an extension update (page is rendered incorrectly    buttons/links don't work).  It's quite a time consuming task to go through   and disable each extension to see if it fixes the issue.  What I'm after is   a simple way to see what extensions will be loaded on a given URL  so that   I can test only those extensions.    I do not know if any other browsers have such a feature��_��_��_I just think it's   something that would be very useful to those of us who like to find out why   things break (and therefore be able to submit bug reports to the creators   of relevant extensions). </pre>
