<title>Issue 24976 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't prompt about in-progress downloads when closing final tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28108)  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture: 64-bit  Window manager: ion3  URLs: <a href="http://video.linuxfoundation.org/video/1578">http://video.linuxfoundation.org/video/1578</a> has a big ogg file in the   &quot;Share this video&quot; section (need to right-click  save-as to avoid   displaying inline)   Behavior in Chrome for Windows: works  kinda (see below)      1. Have just one window with one tab in it.  2. Start downloading a large file.  3. Try to close the window via your window manager.  4. Now instead click on the tab's close button in the tab strip.      Steps 3 and 4 should both display a dialog warning me that I have a   download in progress.      The dialog appears when I try to close the window  but not when I close the    tab -- Chrome exits and discards the download in that case.  On Windows    the dialog is displayed in both cases (but it's kinda crashy there -- sky   indicated that he's going to ping someone about this). </pre>
