<title>Issue 24661 -   chromium -    Full Screen NSView disables tab-switching key bindings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;4.0.222.1 (28317)&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : &lt;10.6.1&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Unknown  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Functions Properly      1. Open two or more tabs  2. Switch to full-screen mode  3. Attempt to switch tabs with cmd-[0-9] shortcut      Tab Views are selected in a manner parallel to the normal Windowed   NSView       Views are not switched. Users are forced to cmd-[arrow] through the tabs.    Though it should be a simple fix in the nib file for the full screen view  I'm   not familiar enough with the code base to either do it myself or know   exactly where the problem lies  the above is my best guess. </pre>
