<title>Issue 41021 -   chromium -    [Content Settings] Per source domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Developer Build 43360)    So noscript allows us to define per 'source' domain scripts/plugins where   the script actually comes from. so allowing youtube for example would allow   all youtube videos on any site to work. However with 'content settings' we   allow everything on the page that we're viewing to come in. This helps with   security but is not as secure as in theory I could allow a normally   perfectly good page that's been hacked and had something nasty added to it   that's included from offsite and now it loads. where with noscript those   offsite's content won't load unless I allow their domain.    I hope this is clear. </pre>
