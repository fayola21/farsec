<title>Issue 30943 -   chromium -    Need a single DEPS file to describe all chrome builds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As a temporary workaround for chrome for chromeos builds  we have started   building a unique DEPS file for the chromeos platform.    The issue is the chromeos cros_deps dependencies introduce a dependence on   git  and git is currently not available on our windows or mac official   builders.    We currently build 6 versions of chrome (windows  chrome frame  mac  linux   32&amp;64  chromeos) and soon will be adding chrome for arm. Whenever we need   to create a patch build for chrome  we manually edit the DEPS file and   check it in  and builds start automatically on all platforms. Having a   single DEPS file that describes all platforms minimizes opportunities for   human error. We also only publish a single DEPS file when describing a   release (i.e. 4.0.266.0).           </pre>
