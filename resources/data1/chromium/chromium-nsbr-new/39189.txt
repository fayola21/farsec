<title>Issue 39189 -   chromium -    Under certain conditions  we paint a rectangle of garbage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="https://tm.sureclose.com/brands/default.asp?BrandCode=TitleSouth">https://tm.sureclose.com/brands/default.asp?BrandCode=TitleSouth</a>  2. Enter username/password  3. Hit enter        Next page should load cleanly    Instead  I see briefly see a patch of pixel garbage (which sometimes looks like the entire contents   of the page)  positioned just to the left of the &quot;Login&quot; button. Then the next page loads.    It feels like a stale buffer paint  but I can't repro it reliably on any other machine and the repro   requires actual login/password. I'll work to reduce this to a reliable repro.       </pre>
