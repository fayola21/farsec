<title>Issue 28322 -   chromium -    Nacl's build/common.gypi wants some output to go to Debug-Win32 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Nacl's build/common.gypi alters the output directory.  This might be the right choice for everyone long term  but currently it clashes with a lot of bake in   assumptions in chrome's infrastructure. We should change this in nacl  roll forward the change  and    cleanup and leftovers.   </pre>
