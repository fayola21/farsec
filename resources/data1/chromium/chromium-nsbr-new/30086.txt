<title>Issue 30086 -   chromium -    Save/Discard buttons invisible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.gbridge.com/">http://www.gbridge.com/</a>    This bug is probably the same as <a title="download confirmation for dangerous files is not displayed for small windows"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15533">Issue 15533</a>  Other download shelf UI defects are <a title="UI messed up on small dispays when downloading more than one &quot;dangerous&quot; file"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13953">Issue 13953</a> and <a title="can't see dangerous download box when browser window is narrow" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23297"> Issue 23297 </a>.    The above issues might be solved or very reduced by implementing <a title="Modify &quot;dangerous downloads&quot; prompt algorithm"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9044">Issue 9044</a>   to remove the warning at several occasions.      REPRODUCE  1. Open URL  2. Click green button Download  3. When download of .exe begins  the buttons are clipped/invisible  so I   can't choose to save the .exe-file.    Expected: Save/Discard buttons should be there    Happens instead: Save/Discard buttons clipped/invisible    Current workaround is to either maximise the popup window  or to open the   Dowloads page and click Save or Discard there. </pre>
