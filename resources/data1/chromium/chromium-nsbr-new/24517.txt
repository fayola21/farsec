<title>Issue 24517 -   chromium -    Add system spellchecker support for Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The major current Linux distributions (Ubuntu[1]  Fedora[2]  openSUSE[3])   all have the concept of a &quot;system&quot; spellchecker  via hunspell and normally   implemented by using the enchant library    I attached a patch which adds support for enchant (though it could use some   minor reworking)    (1) It adds enchant to the linux buildsystem and depends on it from browser   when OS == Linux  (2) It adds a TearDown() method to SpellCheckerPlatform and calls it from   ~SpellChecker. Mac and Windows have it stubbed out  (3) It implements spellchecker_linux.cc in terms of enchant  (4) it disables -fno-exceptions since enchant++.h requires exceptions to be   enabled -- an alternative is to include a modified copy of the c++   interface in chromium and disable use of exceptions there (its just a   wrapper around the C enchant.h anyway)    References:  [1] <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ConsolidateSpellingLibs">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ConsolidateSpellingLibs</a>  [2] <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureDictionary">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureDictionary</a>  [3] <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/305688">https://features.opensuse.org/305688</a> (among other fate requests) </pre>
