<title>Issue 24668 -   chromium -    Don't UpdateDWMFrame so often. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We call UpdateDWMFrame when the window so much as sneezes. We actually only   need to call it when the window is shown and hidden  and when the frame type   changes. We do NOT need to call it when the window is sized. That's why   DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea takes MARGINS not absolute pixel position   values. I am not sure what the downsides of calling it lots of times are but   it's unnecessary and there's probably not zero cost. </pre>
