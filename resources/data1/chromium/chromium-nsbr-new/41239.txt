<title>Issue 41239 -   chromium -    Sqlite.* error histograms aren't useful - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Looking at the Sqlite.* error histograms  the numbers seem to indicate that   the total number of corruption errors is 40-60% of the number of times Chrome   has been launched.  The total number of all errors in the History database is   2x the total number of launches.  These numbers probably mean that our code   will keep trying to do a bunch of operations even in the face of these fatal   errors.  This in turn makes the error histograms unhelpful since there's no   way to actually figure out their frequency.   </pre>
