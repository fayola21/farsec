<title>Issue 29244 -   chromium -    gcl: deal better with newline differences in change message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> gcl gets CL descriptions from rietveld with rn appended to each line.  It   then appends lines with n (no r).  Some editors get confused at the   mixture and save a file with rn newlines.  gcl then can't parse apart the   line markers.    From an email thread on this issue  current plan is (maruel  please confirm   if this is correct):  - get CL description from rietveld -&gt; write to local file  - FileRead local file with 'rU' (will normalize newlines)  - update uses of n in gcl with os.linesep    Bonus points:  - replace uses of ReadFile with gclient_utils.FileRead  - remove gcl's ReadFile </pre>
