<title>Issue 30350 -   chromium -    YouTube videos missing on extensions gallery in latest chrome dev build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just got updated to the latest dev build (4.0.266.0) and noticed that YouTube videos are not showing up in the   extensions gallery.     Examples:    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/noocneohefmdhonidldnlhaainpiomkp">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/noocneohefmdhonidldnlhaainpiomkp</a>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fafnphfmggfjfjgoahpnfkpbmgpfcofk">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fafnphfmggfjfjgoahpnfkpbmgpfcofk</a>    This seems to still work in the Chrome beta channel and in Firefox  so the cause is likely something that broke in   Chrome. These videos are served in a frame from a separate origin  and I also tested another simple site with youtube   videos in iframes from a different origin and that seemed to work ok. Carl mentioned that we're using the X-Frame-  Options header in the gallery response  so perhaps the Chrome-side bug has to do with that.      </pre>
