<title>Issue 43990 -   chromium -    Chrome clobbers systemwide proxy settings in GNOME - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) beta      1. On Ubuntu  set proxy settings in Chrome.  2. Observe other programs that use GNOME proxy settings  such as Pidgin    suddenly start acting strangely because you wanted Chrome to use the proxy   you set  not every other program on the system that uses GNOME proxy   settings.  3. Realize that Chrome changes GNOME proxy settings without warning and   there is no usable GUI option to tell it to use local proxy settings   instead.       - Chrome should use the proxy I tell it  without changing the behavior of   other programs on the system by setting a systemwide proxy setting  and   CERTAINLY not without warning me that it is doing so.  If this   functionality is retained  there needs to be a warning and an EASY (read:   not changing one's launchers to include command line switches) way of   telling Chrome to use a locally defined proxy.       - Chrome causes unexpected behavior by clobbering systemwide proxy   settings.    This is intentional behavior  according to this page:    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxProxyConfig">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxProxyConfig</a>    I am submitting this bug report because it is broken behavior. </pre>
