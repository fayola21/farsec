<title>Issue 30678 -   chromium -    Use stock IDs for all icons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.274.0 (Developer Build 34827)  OS + version : Linux      There are a few things I would like to customize in the GTK theme for myself   (namely  the color of the start/go/stop/etc glyphs). For the classic theme    I can just change the color in a somewhat minimal theme and the rest is   taken from classic. For the GTK theme  this is not possible as far as I can   see...    It would be very helpful if there was a way to set the GTK theme as the   &quot;base&quot; theme to allow easy modification. Maybe something like &quot;inherit: gtk&quot;   in manifest.json?  </pre>
