<title>Issue 40853 -   chromium -    changelog.html does not display for everybody - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've heard of a few user reports that changelog.html consistently does not   display for them (both internal and external).  Unfortunately I have not been   able to reproduce this on any machine that I have access to  but if we have a   way to fix it (or at least diagnose the problem) it would most certainly be   worthwhile. </pre>
