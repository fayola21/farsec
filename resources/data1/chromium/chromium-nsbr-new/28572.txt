<title>Issue 28572 -   chromium -    suggestion: remember password: &quot;Never for this login&quot; button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16    Currently there's only the following options provided for saving a just-  entered password:    = Save Password    = Never for this site    For shared computer  a third option is required: &quot;Never [ask again] for this   login&quot;. When I'm a frequent guest on someone else computer  I neither want to   save my password  nor I want to affect web site behavior for the computer's   primary user with &quot;Never for this site&quot;. However  I don't want to be asked   again for saving a password when I submit the same login on the same computer   and web site. </pre>
