<title>Issue 36779 -   chromium -    Iframe not changing when using browser history (back/forward  ect. ) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jsbin.com/ocupi/2">http://jsbin.com/ocupi/2</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. click 'iframe 1' button  2. go to some other wbesite  and then click the back button.  3. now click on 'iframe 2' button.      should rebuild the iframe2 with its source url. (ninjawords.com in this case).      the first iframe that was opened  now is opening always no matter what.    about this:  A div holds the iframe. the Div is cleaned from content  then an iframe  object is built via &quot;document.createElement(&quot;iframe&quot;)&quot; then appended to the  Div.   </pre>
