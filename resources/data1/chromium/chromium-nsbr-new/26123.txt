<title>Issue 26123 -   chromium -    Make sure icons are not scaled up in the Extension installation dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The code on Windows that sets up the icon in the Extension install dialog   (see constructor of InstallDialogContent in extension_install_prompt.cc) now   only scales images down if they are too large.    I'm not sure the Linux version of this file   (browser/gtk/extension_install_prompt_gtk.cc) does this as well (I glanced at   the code and didn't see any scaling)  but we need to investigate it and make   sure it doesn't scale images up to 85x85.    A good test case is installing an extension with no icon from a .crx  in   which case you'll get the default extension icon (puzzle piece)  which is   67x67. It should display as 67x67. </pre>
