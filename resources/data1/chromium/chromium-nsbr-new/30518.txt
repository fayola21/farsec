<title>Issue 30518 -   chromium -    Unusual animation when moving bookmark to itself (Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make the bookmarks bar is always visible (via Ctrl-B)  2. Create three bookmarks (URLs) on the bookmarks bar.  3. Select and drag the middle bookmark.  Position it so that the bookmark is   still in the middle position.  Release the bookmark.    There is an animation that happens in this case  the middle bookmark slides   back in from the right  underneath the other bookmark.  This animation is   inconsistent with what happens for other kinds of drags.  It is a minor   distraction.   </pre>
