<title>Issue 36331 -   chromium -    mouseclick event on dropdown fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (and developerVersion Chromium 4.0.293.0)   (35704)  URLs (if applicable) : www.archinform.net           Safari 4: OK (tested on Windows)    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: not tested           IE 8: OK          Opera: OK    In the navigation area (top right) of all www.archinform.net pages there is   a notice about the language version and style (desktop or mobile). If You   click on the text  it changes to a dropdown field. You should be able to   select another version now. This works in all browser except Chrome. If You   click on the dropdown button the whole field will be removed instead of   opening the dropdown list! Selection of items by keyboard is working. It   seems that there is the wrong mouseclick event fired  if You click on the   dropdown button (doesn't recognize that mouse is on the dynamically created   input field).         </pre>
