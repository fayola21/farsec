<title>Issue 40232 -   chromium -    Long pages from session restore get longer on startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2 dev  but also exists since 3 or 4 or even prior to those    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/typesandpropertyclasses.html#datetime">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/typesandpropertyclasses.html#datetime</a>  <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queriesandindexes.html#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queriesandindexes.html#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes</a>      1. Go to that page (it maybe too long for the GoogleCode text wrapping algorithm  try to re-create the address   yourself).  2. Have session restore enabled.  3. Close the browser.  4. Open the browser.  5. Go to the restored tab.      The view shows either the same position the page was when it was closed  or the beginning of the page and the   height of the page is the same as it was.      The page is longer  the height gets ridiculously bigger and the view shows a bottom position of the page. </pre>
