<title>Issue 24873 -   chromium -    Chrome frame crash with Wave - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I got this from someone that I sent a Chrome invite to (maybe there is  enough detail to be helpful):    Google��_��_��_s insidious attempt to vilify Microsoft won��_��_��_t work with me. Nice  attempt to use Wave to sneak a Trojan called ��_��_��_Chrome Frame��_��_��_ into my system.  Of course  my browser was rendered virtually unusable  as I'm sure you  planned. While most people would be cursing Microsoft I checked the Windows  Event Viewer and found hundreds of entries like this:    ��_��_��_Faulting application iexplore.exe  version 8.0.6001.18813  time stamp  0x4a6621ae  faulting module npchrome_tab.dll_unloaded  version 0.0.0.0   time stamp 0x4ab83764  exception code 0xc0000005  fault offset 0x64a0f895   process id 0x14a0  application start time 0x01ca4d150230eb62.��_��_��_    I've uninstalled your Trojan and now  of course  everything works fine.  (Well  except Google Wave  I guess.)    NICE TRY! </pre>
