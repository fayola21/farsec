<title>Issue 45042 -   chromium -    Lose history entry for a window if two windows are open and you close some tabs before closing both windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open two chrome windows (same profile)  put lots of tabs in each  2. Close a few tabs in one of the windows (4+  I believe)  3. Close both windows        Next time I start chome  I'd like to see history entries for &quot;17 tabs&quot; and   &quot;15 tabs&quot;  or whatever.        I see one history entry for &quot;17 tabs&quot;. The last few tabs I closed on the   other window mean the &quot;15 tabs&quot; entry isn't in the Recently Closed list    and clicking &quot;View full history&quot; won't show me an entry for that group of   tabs either.    This is especially annoying when you've had two windows open with several   tabs in it for a few days  where you've been opening both windows  then   closing them without closing tabs  then opening again.. e.g. when you start   up your computer and shut it down at the end of the day.    I find that I'll have two windows with tabs open from possibly up to weeks   ago  and then if I forget about this bug and close a few tabs on one of the   windows (e.g. I was reading a news site at the end of the day)  then close   the windows  I lose the history for that window.    Of course  all the individual tabs are in the history  but I can't remember   what ones they are  let alone on what days I opened them.    <b>Please provide
