<title>Issue 35944 -   chromium -    Task Manager freezes if child process uses a lot of CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev  URLs (if applicable) : (not applicable)  Mac OS X version     : 10.5.8      1. Find a rogue child process - triggering <a title="Regression: Glitchy &quot;vibrating&quot; extension popup behavior" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31970"> Issue 31970 </a> would cause the RSS   extension process to use a lot of CPU  2. Start Task Manager  3. Wait for several seconds (more than 2 seconds)      Task Manager functions properly  showing the current resource usage for   all processes.      The Task Manager opens but there are no updates in the list  as long as the   rogue process is still running. With the Task Manager openend  killing the   RSS Extension process will bring back updates.    Also  for some unknown reason  there are times when the RSS Extension   uses 2 entries in the Task Manager (I assumed two things use the same   process). One entry shows no stats  the other one shows something. Killing   the entry showing something leaves the other around.    <a title="Extension popup remains on screen even if extension process is killed" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35940"> Issue 35940 </a> was noticed after killing the extension process (Extension   popup remains on screen even if extension process is killed).    This entire issue might not be Mac only  but it's the only platform I can test   for the moment. </pre>
