<title>Issue 38594 -   chromium -    Odd gray bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) dev  Other browsers tested: N/A  Operating System     : Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit    This is the strangest bug I've seen  and it's definitely a graphic rendering   problem. An odd vertical gray bar about 4mm in length appears after the   address bar (see attached screenshot). At first I thought it was something on   my screen  it's not. It follows the Chrome window for sure. I disabled all   extensions to test it  and other such things  and it's still there. </pre>
