<title>Issue 28366 -   chromium -    Need set of PDFs for testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To adequately verify that PDFs/Adobe Reader function as desired  we need a   set of &quot;test PDFs&quot; that illustrate various functionalities of PDFs... text    hyperlinks  forms  etc.  Someone will run through these manually and verify   that they look correct when new versions of Reader are released. </pre>
