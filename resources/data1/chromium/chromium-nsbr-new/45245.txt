<title>Issue 45245 -   chromium -    Chrome should pass the HTML5 test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1   URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://beta.html5test.com/">http://beta.html5test.com/</a>     I think this should be a tracking bug for the remaining HTML5 standards to be   implemented. Maybe setting the missing HTML5 feature already planned as   blockers for this issue will give user some clues of what are current   chrome's plans in HTML5 implementation.     currently Chrome scores 212/300 and is already the best browser in this test.     Hope this can be a good HTML5 tracking bug.  </pre>
