<title>Issue 38784 -   chromium -    Need to support 64-bit binaries in differential installer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See line 74 of   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/courgette/ensemble.cc">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/courgette/ensemble.cc</a>    This will become more important as more 64-bit binaries make it into the   product.    Stephen: if this is not something you can get to  set the status to untriaged   (or just ping me) so I can find a new owner. </pre>
