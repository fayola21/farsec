<title>Issue 25247 -   chromium -    Extension samples need to be easier to search and download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  you can't easily search the source code for our samples without  first using SVN to download the files. And although it's relatively easy to  find the files for individual samples  viewing the files isn't as easy (you  shouldn't have to go through the log view to see source code  e.g.). Also   the tip-of-tree samples don't always match what you can do with the current  dev (or whatever) release.    We need easy ways to:    * Download a zipfile containing the source code for all samples  * Download a zipfile (or .crx?) containing the source code for a single sample  * Search the samples' source code online    (being able to download the all-sample zipfile would make this less  crucial  but still desirable)  * Choose which version of the samples you want (very latest  current dev  channel  etc.)    It'd be really cool if we could have a dynamically generated page that  would help you find  view  and download the sample(s) you need. I can  create sample pages  but the more automated everything is  the more  up-to-date the sample pages will be. </pre>
