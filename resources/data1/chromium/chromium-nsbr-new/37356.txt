<title>Issue 37356 -   chromium -    Tabbed bookmark manager should show chrome://bookmarks/ in the URL bar/Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This only happens with the new bookmark manager which is implemented as an   extension that use the chrome_url_overrides to redirect chrome://bookmarks/   to chrome-extension://&lt;extension-id&gt;/main.html    I understand the reason why this happens but it is pretty bad from a user   experience.    Another option is to hide the URL altogether. It is better than showing the   chrome-extension URL but it just seems like a work around. </pre>
