<title>Issue 23402 -   chromium -    Default install experience not overwritable by installerdatas - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Delete Chrome profile.  2.  Create/modify master_preferences to have:    {    &quot;browser&quot; : {      &quot;show_home_button&quot; : false    }     &quot;homepage_is_newtabpage&quot; : true  }      3.  Delete First Run Sentinel  4.  Launch Chrome    Chrome will launch with the home button on and the home page set to   google.com  even though the master preferences was set otherwise.    I believe the issue is that in browser_main.cc  we call    Browser::SetNewHomePagePrefs  which overwrites what got imported from the   master preferences.  Ideally  we wouldn't overwrite these settings if they   are already set.    The fix may be as simple as checking if the preferences are already set in   SetNewHomePagePrefs before they are overwritten.   </pre>
