<title>Issue 28331 -   chromium -    Dual Boot w/ Shared Home Partition Breaks on unclean shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Builds are from Spot's repos: <a href="http://spot.fedorapeople.org/chromium/">http://spot.fedorapeople.org/chromium/</a>    Chrome Versions:    * chromium-4.0.227.0-0.1.20091027svn30269.fc11.i586 (Fedora 11 i386)   * chromium-4.0.227.0-0.1.20091027svn30269.fc12.x86_64 (Fedora 12 x86_64)    Running a dual boot system where both mount the same home partition.   Chromium isn't very happy sharing files across OS instances.    Start-up fails with a message about $HOME/.config/chromium/SingletonLock.   Removing the singleton files fixes the problem (rm  $HOME/.config/chromium/Singleton*)    On the face of things  it looks like this would affect users with my use  case  with NFS-based home drives  or after a change of the hostname.   Mostly corner cases.    Also  gmail kept logging me out after loading up the web GUI with a message  about being logged in from a different browser on the same computer.  I had  to clear my cache (interestingly  deleting cookies alone from google.com  didn't fix it).  I'm not sure if this is over-zealous/incorrect security  from gmail or a problem based on the shared cache. </pre>
