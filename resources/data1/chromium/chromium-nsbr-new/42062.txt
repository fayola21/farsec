<title>Issue 42062 -   chromium -    different color for different protocols (http  https  ftp) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just a propose. Why don't use different color scheme for different protocols   instead of hide the http protocol (which make a lot of people angry). Since   the chosen https color is green  why not use the blue color for the http and   onother one for ftp (in my mock violet). Other protocols can still use the   gray.      </pre>
