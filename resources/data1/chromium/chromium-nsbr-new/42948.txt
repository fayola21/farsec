<title>Issue 42948 -   chromium -    Chromium Refuses to Connect Locally When There is no Network - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.391.0 (Developer Build 45775) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : http://localhost http://127.0.0.1        Firefox 3.x: OK         telnet: OK      1. Disable all internet connections  2. Start up a local http server on localhost  3. Try to connect to localhost        Successful connection        &quot;Could not resolve name&quot; error.    This seems similar to some other errors that were corrected with the   Windows version of Chrome/Chromium. This is really annoying because I do   offline development on my laptop  so not being able to connect to a local   server is a big issue. I'm also confused as to why Chromium tells me there   is a name resolution error when I provide an IP address (127.0.0.1). I   shouldn't need DNS to connect to a server if I have the IP.    This is a regression because I was using a dev build from a few months ago   that had no issues with this. When I decided to upgrade because I was   experiencing some other bugs  I landed this issue.    I remember having a similar issue with a version of Firefox that would   automatically enter 'offline' mode when Network Manager didn't have a   network connection. At least in that case  there was a remedy (namely  the   ability to toggle 'offline mode' by the user). </pre>
