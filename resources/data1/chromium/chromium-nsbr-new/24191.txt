<title>Issue 24191 -   chromium -    Support transparency in text drawing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ( migrated from http://buganizer/issue?id=700464 )    arv on May 04 2007 11:30  (New)  Summary     rgba does not work for CSS color property  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; WebKit &gt; Layout  Reporter     arv  CC     chrome-team  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Notes  Given the following CSS rule:    seletor {   color: rgba(0  0  255  0.5);  }    the text should be blue and 50% transparent. However the text is fully opaque.  temp.html  darin on July 11 2007 16:01  (New)  Notes  I believe this is particular to our text drawing code.  The same style rule  works properly when applied to the background color of a DIV.  mal on July 11 2007 20:06  (New)  Hotlist     Cr__Rel_1.0  brettw on July 13 2007 11:15  (New)  Summary     Support transparency in text drawing  Notes  Unfortunately  I don't thing GDI supports drawing non-opaque text. Does  anybody know a way?    We can hack this by making a copy of the background where the text is (so  ClearType does the right thing)  drawing the text opaque  and combining  that layer with the background with the correct transparency.  darin on July 13 2007 13:06  (New)  Notes  We should look at how Firefox implements this on Windows.  mal on March 22 2008 14:40  (New)  CC     chrome-bugs  eseidel on May 01 2008 12:44  (New)  Hotlist     Cr__Rel_Future  Cr__Untriaged  Notes  This is a real bug.  Not sure it's critical for Beta.  But it would be nice  to have.  upstream webkit will also have to fix this for their GDI text path.    I agree  this would be nice to fix  but punting out of Beta for now.  We  can pull it back if someone actually finds a website which depends on  having transparent text.  eseidel on May 01 2008 16:36  (New)  Notes  mitzpettel (Dan Bernstein  apple employee) has added support for  transparent GDI text in upstream WebKit.   We'll definitely want to unify  our text drawing code with Safari post-beta.  brettw on May 01 2008 17:57  (New)  Notes  Also note that mitzpettel (Dan Bernstein  apple employee)'s transparent GDI  text drawing code in WebKit is wrong. We should write a correct one and  give it to them rather than copying theirs.  mal on July 17 2008 11:17 </pre>
