<title>Issue 32997 -   chromium -    extensions use too much RAM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> At present  if a extension wants to show a page/browser action icon  or just   save a option value  background page must be used and a separate process   must be created for this extension. I guess more than 95% present   extensions have a separate process. Task Manager shows every extension   process uses at least 6-7M RAM.     Memory may be cheap but there's more to it than that. If all developers   went the cheap memory route  there would be no advantage for memory   being cheap. Because you would have to buy more and more.    Can Chrome run different extensions in a process? for example  add a   boolean option in manifest file to let extension developer to indicate   whether this extension can share process with others. </pre>
