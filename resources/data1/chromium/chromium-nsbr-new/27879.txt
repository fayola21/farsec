<title>Issue 27879 -   chromium -    Add buildbots for Mac OS 10.6 (Snowleopard)  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are some snowleopard-specific bugs ( e.g. <a title="[Snow Leopard][new.google.com] Arabic fonts are visible as gibberish text" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27195"> bug 27195 </a>) and we'd rather  catch it sooner than later.     For that  adding a buildbot or two running on Mac OS 10.6 would be nice.      </pre>
