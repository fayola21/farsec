<title>Issue 36285 -   chromium -    Remote access (mouse  keyboard  video  audio) should be scriptable via html5 in chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are several web-based remote access products on the market  which use plugins  Java code  and/or native code.  (And users are having trouble with at least one of these   see <a href="http://crbug.com/1913">http://crbug.com/1913</a> )  Chrome should let excellent remote access clients be programmed entirely in   Javascript/HTML5.    There are a few subissues:    - Many remote programs (e.g. games) need to be able to control the   mouse in ways that Javascript have don't allow.  For instance    games may need XInput2-style relative motion events where no  mouse cursor is displayed  and absolute mouse position is not   computed or maintained  but relative mouse motion events are reported.  (You can't simulate that by hiding the mouse cursor and taking the  difference to the last absolute position; that breaks once the mouse   hits the edge of the window.)  Also  remote apps may need to move  the mouse position (something Java allows  but I don't think Javascript  does).    - There should be a standard way for users to ungrab the cursor   as there is for virtual machines.  e.g. VMWare does it with one  key combination  HTML5 should define its own ungrab key combination  so users have a standard way of switching between the remote and  local systems.    - In remote access clients  latency is of utmost importance  so great  attention should be paid to avoiding extra latency wherever possible   for instance  the amount of network and protocol buffering done by the  codecs should be configurable via javascript.    - HTML5 foresees using Websockets for all network I/O  which will be fine  for some remote access purposes.  (Other use cases might require some  other style of networking  but that's a different issue  and should  not block this one.)   </pre>
