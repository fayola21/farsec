<title>Issue 44072 -   chromium -    Upload tool statistics for googlers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Similar to how breakpad for python was implemented  gcl  git-cl and  gclient.py should upload randomly non-anonymous profiling statistic. This  would help fixing when the tools take more than 5 secs to execute.    This will only be enabled for googlers due to privacy concerns. The way  breakpad does it check has proved to be working perfectly  there has been  no false positive up to date. We don't mind about false negative. </pre>
