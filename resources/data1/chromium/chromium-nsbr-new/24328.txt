<title>Issue 24328 -   chromium -    NTP: show the bookmarks synchronization (&quot;Start now&quot;) line as a normal tip line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Offizieller Build 27713)    The bookmarks synchronization feature is permanently exposed (1) on the New   Tab Page on its own line  (2) in the Wrench menu and (3) in the Options   dialog. This is more exposure than any other feature gets and I don't see why   it can't be exposed on the New Tab Page as all the other features: as one tip   of many. </pre>
