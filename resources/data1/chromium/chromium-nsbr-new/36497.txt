<title>Issue 36497 -   chromium -    Check IDS_OPTIONS_DIALOG_HEIGHT_LINES for all languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spinoff from <a title="Dialog windows need correct localized sizes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35118"> bug 35118 </a>.  We've made the Options dialog have less stuff on the   second page  so it can potentially be shortened.  In English  we went from 39   to 36 lines. </pre>
