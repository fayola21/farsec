<title>Issue 36546 -   chromium -    Ctrl-F search always highlights with the same background color  which makes it unreadable under some situations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://formation.upyupy.fr/html-xhtml/couleurs-html/">http://formation.upyupy.fr/html-xhtml/couleurs-html/</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK (changes text color if the background one is too close)           IE 8:OK (same strategy as firefox)      1. open the same url above  2. type ctrl-f and type &quot;example&quot;  3. try to read the text (highlighted with something like light yellow  and   white text)    Cheers    Chrome should analyze the foreground and/or background to try and find a   highlighting color that'll let the text readable.      The text can't be read.     </pre>
