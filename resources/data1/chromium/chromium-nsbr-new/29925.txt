<title>Issue 29925 -   chromium -    move perf test results into a slave-accessible datastore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Move the perf test results into a slave-accessible datastore.    <a title="add simple build step to our buildbot that can parse basic program status from output"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29921">Issue 29921</a> requires moving the perf test results into a location where   slaves can directly update or add new results.  Investigate alternatives for   the current design that allows us to take the Buildbot master out of the   critical path. </pre>
