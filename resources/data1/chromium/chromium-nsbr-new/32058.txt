<title>Issue 32058 -   chromium -    Have an option to hide icons on bookmark bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.288 dev1                    on bookmark bar I have folders (categories) and then inside the folders   url's. I think the icons (folder icons) on the bookmark bar need to have   options to not display them because of save some space. These icon eats   space with no reasons. I think with right click on bookmark bar need to be   option &quot;hide icons&quot; below the option &quot;always show bookmark bar&quot;. also right   click on bookmark bar does nothing. here right click here need to to display the same popup like right click on folder or link on bookmark bar   item. </pre>
