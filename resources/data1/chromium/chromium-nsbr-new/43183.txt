<title>Issue 43183 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox copy-all does not match location-bar-icon drag. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse to www.google.com.  2. Select-all in omnibox.  Copy.  Paste to TextEdit.  3. Drag globe to TextEdit.        Both versions result in a link.  In the drag case the title is &quot;Google&quot;  while in the copy case it is   &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot;.    If the field has not been edited  these should probably be identical.  If the field has been edited    then the URL should be used.    [Marked OS-Mac because I haven't verified elsewhere  but I believe it applies to OS-All.] </pre>
