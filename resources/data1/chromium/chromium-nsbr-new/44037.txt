<title>Issue 44037 -   chromium -    Appearance of select element is incorrect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently do not paint select elements (the dropdown version) correctly on   Windows.    I've attached screenshots.     There are 2 issues:    1. We are not using the theme from the OS.  2. Select elements are not editable comboboxes so they should not be rendered   as editable comboboxes. The should look like the first (combobox.png)   attachment. </pre>
