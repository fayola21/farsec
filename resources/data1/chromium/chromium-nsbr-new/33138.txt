<title>Issue 33138 -   chromium -    Extension name context menu selection goes to the gallery page for non gallery based extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2      1. Right click on a browser action of an extension that was not installed from   the gallery.  2. Select the first menu entry (the name of the extension).      The home page of the extension comes up  or nothing at all.      The Google Chrome Extension Gallery page of the ID of the extension comes   up  saying there is no such extension or it was removed.      Suggestions -  - Add an &quot;homepage&quot; property to the manifest  so that menu entry is fed on it   whenever it is set.  - Detect whether the extension was downloaded from the gallery (either by   saving the source when you first download it  or looking at the &quot;update_url&quot;   and see that it references the auto update URL of the gallery) and make the   menu entry click-able if it were.  - Like the one above  but choose the &quot;homepage&quot; if it were not downloaded   from the gallery and it has a &quot;homepage&quot; property. </pre>
