<title>Issue 39683 -   chromium -    html5 video loop property ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a web page that uses the html5 video tag to play a video and set loop property to true.   2. Prior to the 5.0.342.7 release  the video would play in a continuous loop.  3. With 5.0.342.7 the loop property appears to be ignored.    &lt;video width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; autobuffer=&quot;true&quot; autoplay=&quot;true&quot; loop=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;   &lt;source src=&quot;/mov/spaceweather.mp4&quot; type='video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E  mp4a.40.2&quot;'&gt;   &lt;/video&gt;         Video plays in a continuous loop until the browser page is closed.    I use Google Chrome to run a video kiosk. Of the various items on the kiosk page  is a video that   should play when the browser loads the page and continues playing until the kiosk shuts down at   the end of the day.    My workaround for now is to use the html meta tag to force the page to reload every 30 minutes.          <b>Please provide
