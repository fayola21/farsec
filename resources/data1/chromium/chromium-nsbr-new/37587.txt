<title>Issue 37587 -   chromium -    Display &quot;More extensions from this developer&quot; in the extension page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As the title suggests  such a feature would for one thing prevent us   (developers) from injecting &quot;unstructured&quot; links pointing to our other   extensions in the description field  and two  would help developers   (properly) promote their other work. </pre>
