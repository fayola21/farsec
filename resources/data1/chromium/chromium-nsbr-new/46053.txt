<title>Issue 46053 -   chromium -    Suggestion: use cached CSS then try to load a new - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0 (Vers��_��_o oficial 48573) beta    This is a suggestion.  Well  I don't know how Chrome works in this case  but maybe not how I think.    Sometimes in a site visit  you visits more then one page that uses same CSS and Images. This datas are cached by default. Then if I visit another page from the same site  the Chrome (I think) will try load from server  &quot;asking&quot; if this be updated  if not  use from cache  if yes  download and cache.    My idea is: use from cache  try get infos from server  if diference  update change.    Currently (I think that) is:  [Opening site]  1. Get &quot;test.css&quot; [don't cached]  2. Cache &quot;test.css&quot;  3. Use &quot;test_cached.css&quot;    [Opening site  again]  1. Get &quot;test.css&quot; [don't changed]  2. Use &quot;test_cached.css&quot;    In my version  this (two cases) will be:  [Opening site]  1. Use &quot;test_cached.css&quot; [empty! does nothing!]  2. Get &quot;test.css&quot; [don't cached]  3. Cache &quot;test.css&quot;  4. Use &quot;test.css&quot;    [Opening site  again]  1. Use &quot;test_cached.css&quot; [now use!]  2. Get &quot;test.css&quot; [don't changed]  -- not is does --    If test.css is updated  then the case 2-2  will be:  1. Use &quot;test_cached.css&quot; [now use!]  2. Get &quot;test.css&quot; [updated!]  3. Remove previous &quot;test_cached.css&quot;  4. Apply new &quot;test_cached_2.css&quot;    Get it?  Sorry by the bad english :/    Bye. </pre>
