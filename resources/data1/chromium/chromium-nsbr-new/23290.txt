<title>Issue 23290 -   chromium -    Plugin finder service doesn't prompt about the missing plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I neither see 'Info bar' nor 'Get Plugin' link when a plugin that's required   is not available.   This happened only once though. Once I started to use new profile it worked   fine again and now I can't reproduce even with the old profile. I have to   find out the repro steps.    This happened with 195.24 </pre>
