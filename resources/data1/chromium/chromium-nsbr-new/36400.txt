<title>Issue 36400 -   chromium -    Load content scripts in already-open tabs upon extension installation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  extension content scripts are NOT loaded into already-open tabs   upon extension installation. This is confusing for users; there's no   indication that extensions with content scripts will only work in new or   reloaded tabs.    This behavior should be changed  at least for content scripts with   run_at=&quot;document_idle&quot; (the default). </pre>
