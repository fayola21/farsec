<title>Issue 37967 -   chromium -    endDrag called twice when canceling a bookmark button drag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Drag a bookmark button around.  Press esc to cancel the drag  then let go of the mouse button.    |endDrag| is called twice  once when pressing esc and once more when letting go of the mouse   button.    (This is causing one of my DCHECKs to fire  because I assume that there is exactly one |endDrag|   per |beginDrag:|). </pre>
