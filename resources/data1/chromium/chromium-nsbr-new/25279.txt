<title>Issue 25279 -   chromium -    No way to examine a bad cert from SSL warning interstitial - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/account/register.php">https://alioth.debian.org/account/register.php</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox  Safari         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to a site with a bad SSL cert (CA not in keychain  expired  whatever)      The interstitial warning page should allow advanced users the ability to   examine the cert and the reasons the cert failed  so that they can make an   informed decision about the risk.       The page says there's something wrong  and gives a layman's description of   what an SSL error is  but no indication of the specific problem.    Screenshot attached. </pre>
