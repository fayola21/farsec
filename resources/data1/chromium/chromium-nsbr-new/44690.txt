<title>Issue 44690 -   chromium -    Need SendKeyEvent for RenderViewTests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac needs an implementation of SendKeyEvent for some RenderViewTests   (OnHandleKeyboardEvent and InsertCharacters). These unit tests make sure   that the render view correctly handles (international) input. Enabling these   tests will require implementing SendKeyEvent and MockKeyboard on Mac (see   <a title="Need to improve keyboard input for RenderViewTests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44687">Issue 44687</a> for an explanation on Linux).    you can contact me or hbono if you have questions about these tests. </pre>
