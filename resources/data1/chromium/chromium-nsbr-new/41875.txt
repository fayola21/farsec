<title>Issue 41875 -   chromium -    Tab locks up after logged-in to scottrade.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. log in to one of my 4 accounts at scottrade.com  2. use the site for a while  3. wait a few minutes (don't do anything on scottrade.com)  4. scottrade.com tab becomes unresponsive;        No lock-up.        The tab locks-up.  I can still view the page  but I can't interact at all--  -mouse cursor doesn't change  clicking on a button has no effect  even   clicking the tab close (&quot;X&quot;) button has no effect.  The only way I can get   rid of the tab is to send two sets of SIGTERM signals to all running chrome   processes (first one kills all tabs  second one brings down the browser).    <b>Please provide
