<title>Issue 26024 -   chromium -    Badge update does not cause repaint on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Install test/data/extensions/samples/make_page_red  * Each time you hover  the badge text changes    It is supposed to update on its own. I think that what is happening here is   that we aren't scheduling a repaint when the badge text changes on Linux?    I may have broken this in my recent refactor. </pre>
