<title>Issue 45490 -   chromium -    Improve URLWord parsing in omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796) beta [only tested   on Linux]     <a href="http://example.com/foo123-bar/baz/?">http://example.com/foo123-bar/baz/?</a>  hash=5702a941ad71ae65ae1c802addde82210c7adbe4    This is something that has bugged me for a long time. Omnibar word parsing   and textarea/textinput word parsing are different. This may be a GTK   artifact  but here's the issue:  When selecting (eg. doubleclicking  ctrl-arrow cursor movement)  the   omnibar behaves very oddly. the URL above for example will split [foo 123   bar baz hash 5702 a 941 ad 71 ...].  What I'd expect it to do instead is either split the same way as textinput   and textarea widgets  or otherwise properly parse the URI (split on   subdomain  domain  tld  port  slash chunks and GET arguments).  Former solution will more or less implement that anyway  except for exotic   slash chunks. </pre>
