<title>Issue 46054 -   chromium -    Multiple chrome.exe processes in Task Manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.simply opening the software  2.the more you search the more chrome.exe's appear in the taskmanager.  3.close tabs some of them will disappear.      I'd like to have only one chrome.exe...currently i have 3 1) 54mb 2) 23.3mb  3) 23mb of usage.  so in total that's 100mb more or less.  I don't like feeling that chrome is trying to appear to be a small footprint program by splitting up it's usage.  It's still doing better than my ff 3.6.3 but that's besides the point.  I was hoping to move to Chrome to fix the memory issues but it appears to be equal if i do keep open 10 plus tabs i have a feeling it will be as big a memory hog as ff.   if you happen to have any idea what is going on or if this is supposed to be a feature rather and a bug let me know.  thanks   diana          <b>Please provide
