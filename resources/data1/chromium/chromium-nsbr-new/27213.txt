<title>Issue 27213 -   chromium -    We need a &quot;nodoc&quot; tag for APIs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to be able to eliminate documentation  at least at the method/event   level. For example  i18n.getMessage() has bugs  so we shouldn't generate doc   for it yet.    We'd talked about using some sort of &quot;nodoc&quot; tag for this. It would also be   useful for avoiding generating pages for no-longer-supported APIs such as   toolstrip. </pre>
