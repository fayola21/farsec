<title>Issue 29997 -   chromium -    Clean up suppressing DCHECK failure error boxes code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently in base/test_suite.h we set a logging assert handler  which changes   the way we react to DCHECK  so that on the bots we don't get stuck with an   error box that Windows displays.    It could be a good idea to just move that logic into base/logging.h. </pre>
