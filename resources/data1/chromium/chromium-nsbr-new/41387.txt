<title>Issue 41387 -   chromium -    Images not displayed when attempting to rotate them in ImageShack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Official Build 42199)             Safari 4: --    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: --           IE 8: OK    Logged on behalf of Noopur Pandya    ImageShack has some internal tools for editing images  among them is a   feature that will rotate an uploaded image.  However when attempting to   use it  the uploaded image never renders and there's simply a void with   rotate buttons at the top  as seen in the attached screenshot.      1. Login to ImageShack  2. Go to My Images  3. Click on the rotate icon next to an image (you may have to upload an   image  if none have been uploaded yet)        The image will render in the rotate page  and rotated versions will appear   as the user rotates it.        The image isn't displayed at all  and instead there's simply a void with   rotate buttons at the top.   </pre>
