<title>Issue 30075 -   chromium -    New &quot;Times Skimmer&quot; page crashes Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.269.0 (Ubuntu build 34249)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">http://nytimes.com/timesskimmer/</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK          1. simply hit the URL; nothing ever happens  and if other tabs are also   running any NYTimes.com pending pages  they'll hang too.    Once  the &quot;hung page&quot; dialog came up  but only once  out of several   attempts.    Nothing is showing up in the console for me to provide more details. Sorry.    It's likely that this URL is using very cutting-edge techniques  but it   certainly shouldn't crash the tab ;-)   </pre>
