<title>Issue 36246 -   chromium -    Kiosk mode displays user dialogs when plugin crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start Chrome in kiosk mode  2.

I don't want to have any dialogs in kiosk mode   unless they respond to an actual click (i.e. there is an actual user interacting with the page).

The javascript app can't proceed showing   movies.    <b>Please provide
