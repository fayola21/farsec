<title>Issue 34426 -   chromium -    Google Chrome does not seek it issue conditional HTTP get. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. We go to page on our servers for the first time.     Servers respond with:     Cache-Control:	public     Last-Modified:	Wed  03 Feb 2010 09:31:46 GMT     Etag:	&quot;BA3CB20F6B863B42B9E793C586A83427&quot;     Vary:	If-None-Match  2. We go to the page again  and FF &amp; IE issue a conditional GET and   correctly get an http 304 response and use the content from their caches.  3. Chrome does not add any conditional http headers and just fetches from   the server all of the time  so our servers are taking additional load from   Google Chrome users.      That Google Chrome issues a conditional GET  we return a 304 response  and   Google Chrome will use the page from its cache.      Google Chrome always issues a plain GET  and no use of cache.      <b>Please provide
