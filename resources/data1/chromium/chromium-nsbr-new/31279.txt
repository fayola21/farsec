<title>Issue 31279 -   chromium -    tab's close button stuck in hover state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.285.0 (35334)  OS version               : 10.6.2    I'm not sure how to reproduce this reliably  but every so often  a tab's close   button (that i'm pretty sure i haven't hovered over) get stuck in the hover   state. As far as I can tell it always the tab second to the end on the right side.    I have attached a screenshot (I opened two additional tabs after the second to   most right tab got stuck)   </pre>
