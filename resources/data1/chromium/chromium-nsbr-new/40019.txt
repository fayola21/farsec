<title>Issue 40019 -   chromium -    Don't block downloads on inline scripts which follow stylesheets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is an opportunity to improve page load time for some pages.    Chrome currently fails the &quot;|| CSS + Inline Script&quot; test at <a href="http://www.browserscope.org/?">http://www.browserscope.org/?</a>  category=network&amp;v=top    Test description:  &quot;A lesser known performance problem is the problems caused when a stylesheet is followed by an   inline script block. If a browser doesn't block when downloading stylesheets (as measured by the   previous test)  then a stylesheet followed by an image could both be downloaded in parallel. But   suppose an inline script block was placed between the stylesheet's LINK tag and the image IMG   tag. The result  for some browsers  is that the image isn't downloaded until the stylesheet   finishes. The reason is that the image download must occur after the inline script block is   executed (in case the script block itself inserts images or in some other way manipulates the   DOM)  and the inline script block doesn't execute until after the stylesheet is downloaded and   parsed (in case the inline script block depends on CSS rules in the stylesheet). It's important to   preserve the order of the stylesheet rules being applied to the page  followed by executing the   inline script block  but there's no reason other resources shouldn't be downloaded in parallel and   not applied to the page until after the inline script block is executed. A subtlety of this test is that   if the test is determined to be a failure if the inline script is executed before the stylesheet is   done downloading - although this is faster it could lead to unexpected behavior.&quot; </pre>
