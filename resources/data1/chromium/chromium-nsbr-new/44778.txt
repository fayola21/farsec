<title>Issue 44778 -   chromium -    Flash API docs don't expand properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.53    <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/dns/AAAARecor">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/dns/AAAARecor</a>  d.html?allClasses=1  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works properly  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): not sure  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not sure      1. Go the URL specified above.  2. Under the &quot;Public Properties&quot; section  click on &quot;Show Inherited Public Properties&quot;    What is the expected result? The table should expand with all the inherited public properties.    What happens instead? Although the anchor works  the table doesn't expand.    Note that this works properly in Safari  and this works on my friend's computer running the same   version of Chrome  but OS 10.5 rather than 10.6. </pre>
