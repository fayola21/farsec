<title>Issue 40709 -   chromium -    Shift-Home and Shift-End don't change selection as expected in textarea with wrapped text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Linux 5.0.366.2 (Official Build 43280) dev      1. Type a few lines' worth of text into a textarea (let the text wrap).  2. Click to place the text cursor near the center of one of the middle   lines.  3. Hit Shift-Home.  4. Hit Shift-End.      After step 3  the text between the beginning of the chosen line and the   cursor should be highlighted.  After step 4  the text between the cursor and   the end of the line should be highlighted.    Instead  the text is highlighted as expected after step 3 but nothing   happens after step 4.  The Windows version has the same problem. </pre>
