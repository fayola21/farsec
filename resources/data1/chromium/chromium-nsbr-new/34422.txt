<title>Issue 34422 -   chromium -    Autologon not available with HTTP IronPort's (version s650) proxy and NTLMv2 authentification - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Install Chrome on Windows 7 Professional.  2.Set up the proxy options according to the local system.  3.Save our credentials for the first use.        Normally with IE browser  once you've save your credentials for the first   time  you don't have any other confirmation  even if you close your web   browser or shutdown your system.        For the first connection  we save the correct credentials  but once we   close the browser or shutdown the computer  we have to confirm again the   credentials by clicking on the OK button of the window.    Once we have confirm the credentials we are able to surf over internet   without any other window except if we interact with a Java interface.    <b>Please provide
