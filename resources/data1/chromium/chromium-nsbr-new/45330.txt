<title>Issue 45330 -   chromium -    Alert window doesn't have focus when refreshing a form using POST method - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    Step to reproduce the problem:  1. Go to <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jbs/resources/perl/perl-cgi/programs/form1-">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jbs/resources/perl/perl-cgi/programs/form1-</a>  POST.html  2. Hit &quot;Do it&quot; submit button  3. a new page loads  4. Hit &quot;F5&quot; to refresh the post request  an alert window pops up with   &quot;Continue&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons in it. The &quot;Continue&quot; button seems to be   focused.    Expected result:  The keyboard should have the focus on the alert window.    Actual result:  When hitting the keyboard  nothing happens. We need to click on the button   with the mouse to close it.    See enclosed screen capture    Note: This wasn't happening in previous Chrome version.     </pre>
