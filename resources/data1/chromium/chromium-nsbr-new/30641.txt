<title>Issue 30641 -   chromium -    &quot;Save Link As...&quot; can't save extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome/Windows: 4.0.269.0 (Official Build 34401)  Chrome/Linux: 4.0.272.0 (Official Build 34628)        1. Have a link to a Chrome extension (.crx) on a web page  i.e.    &lt;a href=&quot;sample.crx&quot;&gt; Install my extension &lt;/a&gt;    Of course  the sample.crx file should exist  also.    2. Right-click on link.  3. Select &quot;Save link as...&quot; from context menu.  4. In &quot;Save As&quot; dialog  press &quot;Save&quot; button.    What is the expected output?    Extension should be installed.    What do you see instead?    Windows XP: File is saved  but error dialog pops up  &quot;Windows cannot open   this file ...  etc.&quot;  and extension not installed.    Linux: Animated download arrow appears  file is saved  but extension not   installed.   </pre>
