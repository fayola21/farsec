<title>Issue 35785 -   chromium -    border-left: 1px dotted black - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.322.2    <a href="http://www.leniel.net/2010/02/model-view-presenter-mvp-castle-asp-net.html">http://www.leniel.net/2010/02/model-view-presenter-mvp-castle-asp-net.html</a>    I have a CSS property as follows set in #sidebar element:    border-left: 1px dotted black     It should display a 1px dotted black border in sidebar but it is not the  case as can be seen in screenshot1.    In Firefox and IE the border is shown correctly as can be seen in  screenshot2 and screenshot3.    If the property is set as    border-left: 2px dotted black    the border appears. </pre>
