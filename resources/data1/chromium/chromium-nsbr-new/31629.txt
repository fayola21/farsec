<title>Issue 31629 -   chromium -    Ajax POST failing under ChromeFrame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.266.0 build 33992 webkit 532.6 V8: 2.0.3.1    Related URL(s):  <a href="https://demo01.workbooks.com/">https://demo01.workbooks.com/</a>      1. Using your browser log into the test system at  cf:<a href="https://demo01.workbooks.com/">https://demo01.workbooks.com/</a>  2. Ensure that ChromeFrame is rendering the following page which is a web  desktop.  3. Click 'Start' then choose 'New' and 'Person'. A form appears on the desktop  4. Enter 'Adam Ant' in the 'Name' field.  5. Click 'Save &amp; Close'.   6. The message 'Saving. Please wait' appears and does not go away; the form  is not submitted successfully.    If you try the same test omitting the 'cf:' from the URL and therefore not  using ChromeFrame the system works as expected and a new record is created.        The form should be submitted successfully.        The form is not submitted and the server does not see a transaction from  the browser.      Login details to be supplied on request.
