<title>Issue 40053 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox resetting cursor rects and editing rect are done separately. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> -[StyledTextField resetFieldEditorFrameIfNeeded] should be called anytime that programmatic   changes are made which might change the editable area of the field.    -[AutocompleteTextField updateCursorAndToolTipRects] is a similar method which is being used to   reset rects for purposes of showing tooltips.  It is being called from LocationBarViewMac and   ToolbarController  and I suspect that they really should call -resetFieldEditorFrameIfNeeded  and   that method should call -updateCursorAndToolTipRects as part of its implementation.    Entering this as a tracking bug to make sure the change is someday made.   </pre>
