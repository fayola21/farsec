<title>Issue 37026 -   chromium -    Implement DisplayDebugMessageInDialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When stuff goes really bad we LOG(FATAL) and abort.  In these situations we   call DisplayMessageDialog so the user knows why their browser disappeared.    This function should bring up a dialog  it shouldn't just log to stderr.    Search logging.cc for this bug number to find where to fix. </pre>
