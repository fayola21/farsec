<title>Issue 35335 -   chromium -    Themes bizarre  if current theme images are deleted. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build:5.0.322.0 (Official Build 38504)  OS: XP    -Install a theme-x  -Delete theme images from profile   (/path/to/profile/Default/Extensions/theme_extension_id/ver/i )  -Apply another theme-y    Issues:  I can see two issues here.  1) After theme-y is applied  clicking on Theme 'undo' should not set back   to theme-x. In this usecase  once a theme is applied  then it is   permanent -&gt; user can't undo the theme.  2)After above repro steps  restart browser window.    User is set to default classic theme -&gt; theme-y is also gone.   But 'Reset to default theme' button is enabled under Options/Personal   stuff tab. This is really annoying.      PS: Need to check  it's a regression or not !!   </pre>
