<title>Issue 40455 -   chromium -    Flush ClientSocketPool correctly on network change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's not quite accurate.  We close all idle sockets.  But sockets might be   held by consumers that haven't returned the socket back to the pool yet.    After the network change  if these sockets are returned to the pool without   being closed  then we might try to reuse a broken socket.  The correct   behavior is to throw away the old pools and create new ones. </pre>
