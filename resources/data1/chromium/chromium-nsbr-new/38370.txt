<title>Issue 38370 -   chromium -    git-try --dry_run is silent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. git try --dry_run        I expected it to print the diff per the help message:        --dry_run           Just prints the diff and quits    However  it didn't print the diff. I needed to pass -vv as well to see the diff.        I thought about writing a patch but was not sure which way would be nicer:    1. Change the help like &quot;Just prints the diff (with -vv)  and quits&quot;   2. Add -vv implicitly if --dry_run is specified.     </pre>
