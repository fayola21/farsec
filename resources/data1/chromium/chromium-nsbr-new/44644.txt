<title>Issue 44644 -   chromium -    base/registry.h code isn't great in its current state. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This code is a shame. It doesn't even have a function to read a string value!    There is 11 callers of RegCreateKeyEx and 21 calls to RegOpenKeyEx outside base/registry.cc since   the code in base/registry.h is not that useful.    This issue is about:  - refactoring base/registry.h to make it more useful and remove all (if possible) users of the raw   apis.  - remove #include &lt;windows.h&gt; from the header (HKEY should be typedef'ed) and &lt;tchar.h&gt; and   friends. </pre>
