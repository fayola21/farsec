<title>Issue 46047 -   chromium -    Installing with shortcut name collision causes strange shortcut problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Create a shortcut on the desktop with the name &quot;Google Chrome&quot; and some random image  2.  Install Chrome  go through the FRUI and create shortcuts  3.  The shortcuts that are created &quot;bump&quot; the old shortcut and inherit its image.    It would be nice if the installer handled this better  and perhaps named the shortcut something else if there is a name collision.  This is probably a rare occurrence  however. </pre>
