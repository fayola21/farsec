<title>Issue 41559 -   chromium -    BBC iPlayer regression - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6  URLs (if applicable)   :<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00s1vc8/The_Delicious_Miss_Dahl_Melancholy/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00s1vc8/The_Delicious_Miss_Dahl_Melancholy/</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): static page shows  is clickable and plays programmes        1. Go to URL  2. Look for the video playack box  3. Don't find it    What is the expected result? Should see a playback box in the middle of the screen. Clicking on it   should show the programme.    What happens instead? No playback box displayed  page looks broken somehow    This worked just a few minutes ago when Chrome was running an earlier dev version  probably   one released in the past two weeks. Then the laptop crashed and I had to reboot. When I started   the new release of Chrome  it didn't work on iPlayer so I checked on Firefox and that continues to   work.    NOTE: iPlayer only works for users in the UK  but the initial view should render nicely -- only   when you click on it will it tell you you're not in the UK. </pre>
