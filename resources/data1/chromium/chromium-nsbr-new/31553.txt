<title>Issue 31553 -   chromium -    All new tabs opened from a Google Reader tab share a process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (33992)  OS + version : Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  window manager : xmonad  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a      1. Open up Google Reader in one tab  2. Browse a number of unrelated RSS feeds  middle-clicking their links to   open them in new tabs.  3. Crash any one of those child tabs      Only that child tab should crash  or at least only the tabs at the same   domain as that child tab.      Every single tab opened from the Google Reader tab  as well as the Google   Reader tab itself  crashes.    I know that Chrome reuses a process when opening a new tab with the same   domain as the old tab  and that Google Reader's external links are wrapped   in a Google-based click-tracker (so when the tab first opens  it still   going to a Google domain)  but wasn't it supposed to swap out processes   when the domain changes? The above behavior continues even if I follow   links in the children tabs on their new domains. </pre>
