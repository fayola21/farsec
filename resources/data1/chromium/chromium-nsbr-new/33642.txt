<title>Issue 33642 -   chromium -    MAC problem: Browser doesnt pop up to clicking the icon on the set dock list.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. If you minimize google chrome  2. Then click on the application on the set dock        Usually the browser should pop up from the right side of the dock just like   with any other program.       What happens instead? The program is just sitting on the dock   unresponsive to the clicking of the application instead of the minimized   active icon on the right side of the dock usually. Only chrome does this. If   a program is active and minimized  clicking on the application on the dock   should bring it back up  but for google chrome it sits there and you are left   wondering why the program isnt maximizing or starting up a new window.     <b>Please provide
