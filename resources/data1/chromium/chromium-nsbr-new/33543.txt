Open  Incognito window  Start downloading from URL   <a href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora/releases/12/Fedora/i386/iso/Fedora-">http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora/releases/12/Fedora/i386/iso/Fedora-</a>  12-i386-DVD.iso    2. When download in progress  with only Incognito window open  Quit the   browser.    What is the expected output?  Similar to windows and linux should present user with a dialog to Continue   or Cancel Downloads.     What do you see instead?  Quits without presenting user with confirmation.    This is only for Incognito window  works fine in regular window.  Mac only shows confirmation dialog in for incognito in Windows and Linux. </pre>
