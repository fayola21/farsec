<title>Issue 33927 -   chromium -    Tab problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   This is NOT a security bug  it is a general nuance bug.    All too often when one clicks on a TAB the page will jump off completely lose   from the rest  and into a half-reduced size of itself. This is completely   irritating. One then needs to take time to reattach the detached page    dragging the tab back into place. There needs to be a delay implemented in   relationship to the click  so that the moved mouse pointer is not seen by   Chrome as a drag  like as not.    Apart from this  I like Chrome  and no longer use crash-prone Foxfire  and I   only IE when I have to.   </pre>
