<title>Issue 42144 -   chromium -    Sync DB not reloading correctly after chrome restart? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> User is on:    5.0.342.9.    We see initial sync = true after starting and stopping sync in a browser   session. After closing and reopening the browser  we see initial sync =   false. Log file analysis shows that the browser is able to load the GAIA   credentials but either can't load the sync DB or is improperly loading the   sync DB. In the case where it works we see:    [5688:5020:358943808:INFO:auth_watcher.cc(345)] LoadDirectoryListAndOpen   returning 0    In the case where it's broken (after restart) we see:    [5688:5020:358943808:INFO:auth_watcher.cc(345)] LoadDirectoryListAndOpen   returning 1    In this version  the code looks like:    bool AuthWatcher::LoadDirectoryListAndOpen(const std::string&amp; login) {    DCHECK_EQ(MessageLoop::current()  message_loop());    LOG(INFO) &lt;&lt; &quot;LoadDirectoryListAndOpen(&quot; &lt;&lt; login &lt;&lt; &quot;)&quot;;    bool initial_sync_ended = false;      dirman_-&gt;Open(login);    syncable::ScopedDirLookup dir(dirman_  login);    if (dir.good() &amp;&amp; dir-&gt;initial_sync_ended())      initial_sync_ended = true;      LOG(INFO) &lt;&lt; &quot;LoadDirectoryListAndOpen returning &quot; &lt;&lt; initial_sync_ended;    return initial_sync_ended;  }    Examining the sync DB yields a mostly valid looking sync DB with initial   sync complete in the DB set to true. It looks like either we could not open   the sync DB or have an issue loading it otherwise. Several users have   similar symptoms. </pre>
