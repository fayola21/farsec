<title>Issue 24699 -   chromium -    Feature request: Support HTTP over SCTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be good for Chrome to support HTTP over SCTP (  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP</a> )  since it supports multiple streams  within a single physical connection without the head-of-line blocking  problem that TCP suffers  especially over noisy wireless links that are  becoming common nowadays in some places  at least. I often browse the web  on an EDGE connection (via tethering  which my carrier officially supports)  and many of my friends at Bangalore are getting CDMA/WiMax modems. On such  noisy channels  SCTP can help with the head-of-line blocking problem.    A relevant RFC is  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-natarajan-http-over-sctp-02">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-natarajan-http-over-sctp-02</a> . Thanks. </pre>
