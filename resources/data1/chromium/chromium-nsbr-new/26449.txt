<title>Issue 26449 -   chromium -    Alert popups cause window lockout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.195.27  Issue: Alert popups cause window lockout.      Open a page with javascript alerts. When the alert shows up  it is not   possible to close the tab  close the window  or do any other interaction   with chrome other than clicking a button on the alert popup.      1. A page with Alerts should not prevent other tabs from working. It should   not prevent tab switching.  2. A page with a popup should not have any effect on the browser window    such as closing chrome  resizing chrome  clicking on a bookmark to go to   other page (in the same tab)  etc. Currently none are possible when the   alert is visible.        The browser stops responding entirely until one of the popup buttons is   pressed.    Sample HTML to reproduce problem:  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;Before Alerts&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;  alert(&quot;Alert 1&quot;);  alert(&quot;Alert 2&quot;);  alert(&quot;Alert 3&quot;);  &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;After Alerts&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt; </pre>
