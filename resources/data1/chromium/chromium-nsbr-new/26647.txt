<title>Issue 26647 -   chromium -    Folder view in bookmark editor dialog is wacky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the bookmark editor view we seem to be using a column view for folders. I   understand Finder sometimes presents files/folders in this view but I think   it's a bad use of space for this context.    We should use a tree view of folders instead. </pre>
