<title>Issue 34386 -   chromium -    Doesn't reconsider proxy after failure connecting to SOCKS proxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> HttpNetworkTransaction::ReconsiderProxyAfterError() does not check for   SOCKS-specific errors  so it will not falback if SOCKS gets a failure during   its Connect() method.    To reproduce this configure chrome to use the PAC file:      function FindProxyForURL(url  host) {      return &quot;SOCKS localhost:6233; DIRECT&quot;;    }    Now run a proxy server at port 6233:    while [ 1 ]; do    echo 'fail connect' | nc -l 6233  done    Load www.google.com in Chrome. Expectation is for Chrome to attempt   the SOCKS proxy  fail it  and then fall-back to DIRECT. So google.com   loads. Instead  Chrome fails with ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE. </pre>
