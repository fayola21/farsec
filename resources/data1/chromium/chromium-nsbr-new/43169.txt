<title>Issue 43169 -   chromium -    Chrome Rendering slow (compared to IE7) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Try the attached sample  which contains a very large table - a timer is   set to measure the time from the beginning body tag to the end body tag.    Test in Chrome  test in IE (IE 7 was tested in my case).          I would expect Chrome to perform faster than IE 7 in this area.  And if not   faster  at least on par.      In IE 7 - my average load time (over 10 tests) was 62.6ms.  In Chrome  my   average was 160.3ms.  Also  my standard deviation was much higher in   Chrome: 66.26 in Chrome vs 7.56 in IE7.        <b>Please provide
