<title>Issue 39913 -   chromium -    floating elements with shadows leave artifacts when scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=39572">r39572</a>      1.  Go to nytimes.com  2. don't close the &quot;times people&quot; floating thing at the top  3.  scroll down the page  the back up.      No artifacts.      It seems the shadow part never gets redrawn.  See the attached screenshots.    One is a result of dragging the scrollbar (lots of lines)  the other is a   result of using the srollwheel (fewer  evenly-spaced lines).    Note: I've also seen this with a floating element on the bottom of   economsit.com articles. </pre>
