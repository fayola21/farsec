<title>Issue 31319 -   chromium -    Problem with using facebook apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.285.0~svn20091229r35334-0ubuntu1~ucd1~karmic  OS + version : ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : metacity/gnome  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/..">http://apps.facebook.com/..</a>.    It seems many facebook apps does not work this version of chromium. When   facebook site makes chromium to navigate URLs begin with   <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/">https://apps.facebook.com/</a> nothing happens (not even the loading indicator   is shown)  and after some time of high CPU usage  chromium reports to kill   the tabs because it does not responding. I've tested it with firefox 3.5   and it works without problems. </pre>
