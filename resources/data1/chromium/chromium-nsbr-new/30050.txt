<title>Issue 30050 -   chromium -    Chrome hangs for 2-3 seconds upon loading Web pages outside of current page's TLD  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new web page either by clicking a link on the Chrome bookmark bar   or by typing it into the omnibar -- not by clicking a link on a web page.          The page should immediately start loading  with the status bar popping up   at the bottom of the Chrome window instantly  starting with &quot;Resolving   proxy&quot; (if necessary)  &quot;Waiting for [web page] &quot; &quot;Loading &quot;... etc.       Chrome hangs for 2 or 3 seconds before even starting to fetch or request   the page.. it doesn't even show the status bar. Sometimes  but not always    this is accompanied by the &quot;spinning circle&quot; icon on the active tab   indicating that the site is loading  but this doesn't actually correspond   to the site actually starting to load. Also  this is sometimes (but not   always) accompanied by a general browser hang; i.e.  the cursor remains the   &quot;click&quot; regardless of what I hover over. This will happen for 2 or 3   seconds until the browser &quot;wakes up&quot; and starts to fetch the web page.    <b>Please provide
