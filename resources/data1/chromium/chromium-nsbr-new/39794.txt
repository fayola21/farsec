<title>Issue 39794 -   chromium -    When double-clicking to select text  the visual selection should be what you get if you copy and paste - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 unknown (42199)      Browsers tested:  * Safari 4: OK  (Excellent: always the word and nothing more)    * Firefox 3.6: OK  except when selecting newlines (test: doubleclick on   &quot;not&quot; at end of line on crbug.com/72)    * IE 7: OK  (=you get what you see blue-marked  i.e. sometimes a space if   the word is followed by space or newline  otherwise you don't get any space   marked and also not copied)    * IE 8: ?      1. Double click to select a word  2. Copy  then paste in notepad/similar text editor  3. Notice that you need to stay alert to know if you get a space  no space    or even an extra newline together with the copied word.      What you get if you do Copy (Ctrl-c) should be what you see is selected   (=marked with blue background).      Sometimes you get a newline  sometimes you get a space. It is hart for the   user to predict what will be copied.
