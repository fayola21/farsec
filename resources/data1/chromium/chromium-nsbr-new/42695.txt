<title>Issue 42695 -   chromium -    Need to improve sync diagnostic capabilities - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now our ability to diagnose sync failures in clients is woefully inadequate.  Some ideas:    Beef up about:sync:  - Display per-datatype data.  - Use NetLog (net/net_log.h) or something similar to track XMPP/sync frontend connections and   display info about them.  - Display more detailed information on XMPP failures.  - Add &quot;Test Sync&quot; and &quot;Test Notifications&quot; buttons that try each with full logging enabled.  - Use Chrome notifications as a debugging aid.  - Write a stand-alone XMPP/notifications client to make debugging easier.  - Actively check XMPP status instead of relying on network monitors.   </pre>
