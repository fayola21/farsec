<title>Issue 26832 -   chromium -    Omnibox popup should close on mouse clicks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's a couple of scenarios that should trigger closing the omnibox's   popup:    . Right clicking on a tab/bookmark that shows a context menu.  . Clicking to show a menu (page/wrench)  or bookmarks.    Perhaps when the popup is shown we should add a listener to the message loop   and any time the user clicks outside the popup/omnibox we should close the   popup. </pre>
