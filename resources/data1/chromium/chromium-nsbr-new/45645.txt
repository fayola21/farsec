<title>Issue 45645 -   chromium -    HTML5 Video - Setting currentTime on some videos fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (mac)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: n/a           IE 7: n/a           IE 8: n/a    When setting the currentTime attribute on the attached video  Chrome behaves very strangely.    The behaviors don't appear to be exactly consistent  but in general:    1. Setting currentTime to a value of &lt; currentTime:  - The value of currentTime is set properly  - The video returns to position 0 (despite currentTime reflecting the time set)  - Playback resumes starting from position 0. Timeupdate events do not fire until the playback   position reflected is greater than the value of currentTime (as set).    2. Setting currentTime to a value &gt; currentTime  - The value of currentTime is set properly  - A timeupdate event is fired at the correct currentTime  - Playback resumes from some arbitrary position later in the video (example: if currentTime was   set to 15  playback will resume from 22) timeupdate events fire immediately reflecting the later   time indices.    Whether the video is currently playing or paused doesn't seem to matter. I have tried other videos   and don't have this issue; I feel like it may be something to do with *how* this particular video is   encoded but I'm not an expert at video codecs.      I used the following code as a test in the console (URL removed for simplicity);    var url = &quot;&quot;; // path to the video  var video = document.createElement(&quot;video&quot;);  video.src = url;  document.body.appendChild(video)  video.play()      ...wait for video to play for 10 seconds.  video.currentTime = 5; // see error case 1 above    video.currentTime = 15; // see error case 2 above </pre>
