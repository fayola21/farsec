<title>Issue 26824 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar shortcut button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to have a button (that I would place after the address bar)   that shows the bookmarks bar  and once a bookmarked is clicked or an empty   area is clicked the bookmarks bar would hide. So in other words  this button   should behave like a menu (like the Page button or the Options button) but   instead of showing a menu it would show the bookmarks bar.    Why? Because the bookmarks bar is useful but it takes space from the webpage   area. So it would be nice to be able to show it momentarily to select a   bookmark and then it hides itself.    The button could be configurable  like the Home button which is only shown   if you check the &quot;Show Home button on the toolbar&quot; checkbox in Options. </pre>
