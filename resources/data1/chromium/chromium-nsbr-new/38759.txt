<title>Issue 38759 -   chromium -    Aero Peek shows new tab  but doesn't change tab/url bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2      The screenshot shows better.    I'm active on one tab  then use the Aero Peek to view another tab. The   document window shows the new site  but the old URL and tab bar is shown.    I'm not sure if this is intentional  but as Aero Peek is essentially showing   a different tab/window.     </pre>
