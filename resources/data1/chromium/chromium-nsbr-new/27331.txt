<title>Issue 27331 -   chromium -    move chrome frame gyp rules into chrome.gyp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the GCF gyp rules are contained in a separate .gyp which is   transitively pulled in via a dependency in chrome.gyp:chrome. This sucks.   Pull the main GCF rules into chrome.gyp instead.    Also investigate how the xulrunner-sdk is getting distributed and figure out   if there's a way to handle this a gyp time. </pre>
