<title>Issue 44048 -   chromium -    Can't submit a form with &lt;input type=checkbox required&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Just try to submit any form on any website using chrome  2. Or else log on to our website www.floraindia.com and click on buy along   with any item and try to place a dummy order. The checkout form is not   working. Earlier we had image as submit button and we thought chrome might   have developed some issue with &quot;input type=image&quot; so we changed it to   simple submit button to test. But its still not working. It was working   fine till few hours back. We use chrome in our office and never ever faced   any issue with form submit. We have not made any changes in the code which   might have affected it.          It should simply submit the form.        It doesn't work. Just stays on that page and form is not submitted.    <b>Please provide
