<title>Issue 40994 -   chromium -    Windows dev channel show up as unknown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Just a minor annoyance. My Z600 came with Chrome and I upgraded it to the dev   channel. I noticed in about:  it doesn't say dev channel  instead I get:    Google Chrome	5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) unknown  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.2.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)   AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.371.0 Safari/533.4  Command Line	&quot;C:Program Files (x86)GoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot;      This is not a recent regression. I think it was like this in 366.2 as well. </pre>
