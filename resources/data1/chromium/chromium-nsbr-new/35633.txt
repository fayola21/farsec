<title>Issue 35633 -   chromium -    How do I stop getting emails from this group? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported by JeffTillett  Jan 20  2010  I just today started getting bombarded with emails from this group. I have   no   desire to be a part of it and never asked for it. I have all of my updates   turned off  but the link for subscription settings takes me to a page where   my google account password will not work. What is going on?      Comment 1 by phajdan...@chromium.org  Jan 22  2010  Not a Chrome bug.  Status: Invalid      Delete comment Comment 2 by JeffTillett  Today (moments ago)  So why am I getting thousands of emails from this group when I never asked   for be a   part of it and have no option to unsubscribe? </pre>
