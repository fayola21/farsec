<title>Issue 43418 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] &quot;Sticky&quot; setting for fullscreen view? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta    Just thinking it'd be nice if the View &gt;&gt; Enter Fullscreen option were sticky  so that if you exit   Chrome while it is in fullscreen mode  then when you re-open it it will enter full-screen mode   automatically  on the same screen (if possible).    I just really hate wasted space when I'm browsing the web  so being able to get rid of title and   menu bars is just great =) </pre>
