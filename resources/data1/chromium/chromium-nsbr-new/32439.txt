<title>Issue 32439 -   chromium -    bubbles don't animate out when closed by clicking on their button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : r 36424      1. Click bookmark star or a browser action; bubble animates in  2. Click bookmark star or browser action again        The bubble should animate out.        It just disappears.    It's more visible if you press &quot;shift&quot; while clicking (this plays animation in   slomo)  but it's pretty visible without too.    Clicking &quot;done&quot; or &quot;remove&quot; in the bookmark bubble animates it out as   expected. </pre>
