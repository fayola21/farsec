<title>Issue 36734 -   chromium -    Reinstate PERF tests waterfall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's quite embarrassing that we are approaching beta but do not have a   consistent measurement of basic performance metrics like startup time and   memory usage.     So logging this as a tracking issue to fix the perf bot and dashboard.     Marking it as  beta blocking to raise attention. </pre>
