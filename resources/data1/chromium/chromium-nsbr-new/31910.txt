<title>Issue 31910 -   chromium -    Removing Extension Directory Should Uninstall Extension from Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     This isn't necessarily a &quot;bug&quot;  but more of a suggestion re: how Chrome should   handle extension uninstallation.  When a .crx packed extension is installed into   Chrome  a directory is created under &quot;ChromeUser DataDefaultExtensions&quot; (the   name of this directory is the ID of the extension itself).  The contents of the   extension .crx are unpacked to this directory.    So  if this directory is removed either by the user or by an external application    it seems logical that Chrome should simply uninstall the extension (or consider it   uninstalled and do whatever it needs to do to clean itself up).  In other words    if I need to manually remove an extension outside of Chrome  I can simply delete   the directory corresponding to my extension's ID.  On the next start  Chrome would   scan the &quot;ChromeUser DataDefaultPreferences&quot; file and see that an extension   with that ID no longer exists and do what it needs to do to uninstall it.  This   may involve removing any entries added into &quot;ChromeUser DataDefaultPreferences&quot;   during the installation.          If Chrome expects to see an extension's directory under &quot;ChromeUser   DataDefaultExtensions&quot;  and it's not there  Chrome should consider the extension   uninstalled.          Chrome opens  and appears to continue to run as normal.  My extension placed a   &quot;default_icon&quot; into the toolbar  but since I deleted the extension directory under   &quot;ChromeUser DataDefaultExtensions&quot; there is just a block of empty space left   behind where the icon used to be (see screenshot).      <b>Please provide
