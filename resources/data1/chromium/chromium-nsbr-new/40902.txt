<title>Issue 40902 -   chromium -    [Bookmark Manager] Scroll bar issues (with steps to repro) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.372.0 (44036)    Open the bookmark manager. I have a lot of bookmark in the bookmark bar so I   have a scroll bar. then open a sub-folder with a lot of bookmark in it (so   that it needs the scroll bar). You'll see that the scroll bar is 5-6 cm more   to the left than what is supposed to be. Clicking on the scrollbar brings it   back to its spot.     please see graphical steps in the attached files.     </pre>
