<title>Issue 39256 -   chromium -    Alert users of out of date plug-ins using HTML5 notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When a plugin is out of date  the user should be notified via an HTML5   notification. That notification should contain   * a message  &quot;$plugin_name is critically out of date.&quot;  * a link to &quot;Update&quot; which takes the user to the plugin download page so   they can get the latest version  * a link to &quot;Manage plug-ins&quot; which takes the user to the full-tab plugin   manager (should look like   <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~glen/chrome/spec/90_secbrowsing/1/03_flat.png">http://www.corp.google.com/~glen/chrome/spec/90_secbrowsing/1/03_flat.png</a>   but replace the &quot;enable&quot; links with a enable checkbox.)    If multiple plugins are out of date  just show the link to &quot;Manage plug-  ins&quot;.    Note that this depends on having a list of database of plugins and which   versions are out of date (separate bug).   </pre>
