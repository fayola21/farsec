<title>Issue 37212 -   chromium -    -http page cyclers named incorrectly in perf step class - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The -http page cyclers were named incorrectly in the perf step class for a   couple of days.  This led to the Windows perf regress/improve issue noted in   <a title="page_cycler_moz-http is broken" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36871"> issue 36871 </a> and caused the bloat-http results to be written to the bloat perf   directory. </pre>
