<title>Issue 44904 -   chromium -    AeroPeek &amp; &quot;pin tab&quot; suggestion. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Good time of day to all   I would like to offer new solution of AeroPeek &amp; Google Chrome...  Also i bring big apology that this post is separate issue in security bugs    but it's not requirement to &quot;remove it immediately!&quot;. It's really new look   on this topic.    In fact  i don't know how many people use the &quot;pin tab&quot; feature in chrome    but i use (also due missing &quot;favicon&quot; of website if the count of tabs more   than 40-50  and pinning the tab is way to save &quot;favicon&quot; visible)... So  i   suggest connect these two feature to maximize usefull of AeroPeek to   Chrome.    I think that only those tabs must be shown in aeropeek-preview that were   pinned. Also every separate window must be shown too. So  if i use   &quot;incognito&quot; feature or &quot;a set of entirely different in content tabs&quot;  i   wish to load needed tab or window so fast as possible.    Please look at attachment. I used to comment some points.    ��_��_��_ if thumbnail is a window  we must see count of tabs in it - we will   easily call to memory in which window we going to operate; this point will   be usefull for people with good photographic memory;  ��_��_��_ if photographic memory is not so good  we used to remember when needed   window was created. So the number in square brackets is a sequence of   creating or opening this &quot;tabs set&quot;;  ��_��_��_ if thumbnail is a pinned tab  we must see word &quot;pinned&quot; or something   similar. I suggest it can be additional icon or special symbol at   begining/ending of title-string.  ��_��_��_ also i suggest that incognito-mode must be easily distinguished (as   example i used picture &quot;man in hat&quot; familiar to all ever using Incognito in   Chrome)  ��_��_��_ as you sight  thumbnail which are &quot;pinned tabs&quot; also have number in   square brackets. I think it's necessary 'cause incognito-mode often used in   conjunction with traditional mode for visiting one and the same site (for   example  if anyone wish to know how looks his site with and without login   to account). So may happen that one and the same tab in normal and   incognito-mode will be pinned. So the person will lose time to find only   one needed tab.  ��_��_��_ if human click on thumbnail which is a window  he must open last-active   tab from this window...      P.S. I also afraid of my suggestion will be greeted with hostility as once   the application of aeropeek in Google Chrome  so i think it must be option   to use browser... :  1) without aeropeek feature at all;  2) with standart aeropeek-mode a.k.a. &quot;all tabs in thumbnail&quot; ;  3) &quot;all tabs in thumbnail&quot; if only one window openned  else -&gt; &quot;only   separate windows shown&quot; ;  4) with my suggestion + &quot;pinned tabs also shown&quot; ;  5) with my suggestion in variant &quot;only separate windows shown&quot;    WBR   PycoBeg��_�� </pre>
