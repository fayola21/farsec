<title>Issue 23940 -   chromium -    [Feature Request][Tabs] Remove support for closing if active tab is the only tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.2 (Developer Build 27944)        A user should not be allowed to close a tab if it is the only tab open. As   Chrome is tab-oriented  instead of removing the &quot;tab bar&quot; (which is   inherently not possible)  simply remove the &quot;x&quot;.    Similarly  it should not be draggable since branching it out to create   another window defeats the purpose.    This provides a safeguard against users with such bad habits (below).          If a user unsuspectingly clicks on the &quot;x&quot; of the only tab  the   &quot;application&quot; closes. This may not be what the user wants. He may just be   feeling the need to clear out all tabs &quot;for the time being&quot;. This is a   habit ported over from other browsers whereby the tab bar is not viewable   by default (behaviour can be changed). Opera  for instance  just displays   its Speed Dial (akin to Bookmark Bar here). </pre>
