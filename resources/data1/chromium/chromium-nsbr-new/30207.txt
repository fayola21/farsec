<title>Issue 30207 -   chromium -    Clicking the Chromium icon does not bring up minimized windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928)      1. Start Chromium. Have only one window of it running.  2. Minimize the window.  3. Click the Chrome button on the Dock.      The normal Mac behavior is for the minimized chrome window to come   back to focus.      Nothing.   </pre>
