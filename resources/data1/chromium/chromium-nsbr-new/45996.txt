<title>Issue 45996 -   chromium -    omnibar does not fill in initial / of URL's pathname - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.428.0 (Developer Build 49044)    Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Visit a few URLs frequently:     * <a href="http://host.tld/">http://host.tld/</a>     * <a href="http://host.tld/aaaa/">http://host.tld/aaaa/</a>     * <a href="http://host.tld/bbbb/">http://host.tld/bbbb/</a>  2. Start typing &quot;h&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;s&quot; in the omnibox (the base URL fills in)  3. Press End or (for GTK w/Emacs theme) Ctrl-E        I can type &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; to fill in one of the subdirectory URLs.        At some point (in the past few days)  the omnibar started hiding the   trailing &quot;/&quot; on a URL with a pathname component of just &quot;/&quot;. This arguably   looks much nicer  but it means that I have to type it myself if I want to   get to a sub-URL via omnibar completion.    I know this is just a matter of one character (typing &quot;/&quot; &quot;a&quot; instead of   &quot;a&quot;)  but this change has made me realize that I've been getting to some   sites purely by muscle memory. As a compromise was made for hiding the   initial &quot;http:// (i.e. it still copies if you select the whole hostname)    maybe something could be done here (the &quot;/&quot; appears if you move the   cursor?).    I may be the only person who does this  so it's not high priority. </pre>
