<title>Issue 41626 -   chromium -    default browser setting doesn't store --user-data-dir - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download a chrom(e|ium) build which supports --user-data-dir  2. execute with --user-data-dir  3. In options  choose &quot;Set Chrom(e|ium) as default browser&quot;  4. Open a web shortcut  or click a link in any other app that supports   launching the default browser for links.  5. The new Chrom(e|ium) window opens up using the default location for user   profiles.      The default profile should be storable as a registry option or a text file   in the chrom(e|ium) binary directory so that testing and continued use with   a nonstandard profile directory can be performed with externally launched   links.  Alternatively  offering to embed the --user-data-dir in the default   browser launch mechanism (registry  alternatives script  etc) might be an   option.      The new Chrom(e|ium) windows fired off as default browser rather than by   modified shortcut/script opens up using the default location for user   profiles.    <b>Please provide
