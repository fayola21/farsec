<title>Issue 43609 -   chromium -    Chrome Browser does not respond - windows 7 OS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Browsing web pages on multiple tabs in Chrome (Possibly (not sure) with   Flash running in atleast one tab in all these cases)  2. Windows 7 Ultimate OS   3. Dell XPS M1530 Laptop 3 gb ram (Probably not relavent)      - Browser Functioning okay      I use chrome on a daily basis at home. On more than one occasion I get into   a situation where I have 3 - 4 tabs open in chrome  and all of a sudden the   browser freezes. I cannot do anything in chrome  windows seems to work   okay. It takes about 45 secs - 1 minute for it to start responding again. I   can hear unusual hardware noise in the background (processor/hard disk?)   right throughout the 45 sec period and at the end of the problem there is a   noise again.  Iam not sure I have seen this behaviour in other browsers at all.  It may/may not have to do something with flash. I cannot provide any screen   shots because that would not contain any information on the behaviour as   such.    <b>Please provide
