<title>Issue 39341 -   chromium -    Audits doesn't show any results when Web Page Performance is checked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to www.google.com  2. Launch Inspector  3. Click on Audits tab  4. Click on Run    What is the expected output?   To complete loading and show the results    What do you see instead?  Loading doesn't complete and results are not seen.     This seems to be an issue with Web Page Performance. Network utilization   seems to work fine.    Google Chrome 5.0.360.0 (Official Build 42309) </pre>
