<title>Issue 44518 -   chromium -    GPU process rendering doesn't handle window resizing properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using the GPU process for rendering into a window (e.g. doing h/w   accelerated compositing)  content fails to draw properly when window is   resize beyond its original size. Areas that fall outside the original   window's rectangle don't get painted. This appears to be a bug with GL on   windows (probably related to 5.121:   <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/mswindows.htm">http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/mswindows.htm</a>)   </pre>
