<title>Issue 35323 -   chromium -    Build step link to flakiness dashboard should point to canary results when clicked on canary waterfall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The results are really useful  but when you're looking and regressions in the   canary  you have to make an extra click to switch to the canary results.    Gardeners get confused.    It would be like super-awesome to not have to do that.     </pre>
