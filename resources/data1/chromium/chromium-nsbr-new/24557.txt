<title>Issue 24557 -   chromium -    Should not show tabs in recently closed on quiting chrome  if Session restore is enabled ?? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   -Enable session restore.  -Open few tabs with any webpages  -Exit Chrome and relaunch Chrome    We will show all the tabs opened in step2 in Recently closed section of  NNTP. Pls note all the tabs are reopened as part of session restore  though  we are showing then in &quot;recently closed&quot; section.    I believe  we should not show them on session restore ??    Pls feel free to close this  if it makes noise :)  but it looks like a odd  behavior for me :).       </pre>
