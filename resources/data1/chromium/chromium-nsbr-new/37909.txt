<title>Issue 37909 -   chromium -    Clear browsing data from Incognito's window  should clear the downloads history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.342.3    -Have some entries in Downloads page.  -Click on 'Clear all' link from Incognito's Downloads page.    Issue:  Actually the entries in the downloads page got cleared  but not physically.  I mean to say  after clicking on Clear all link  the entries in Downloads  page in Normal/Incognito windows still show up. This requires to restart  the browser window to get the list to get cleared.    PS: Repros on Windows and Linux. Need to check on Mac. </pre>
