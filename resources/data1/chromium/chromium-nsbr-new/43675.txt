<title>Issue 43675 -   chromium -    Ought to truncate sync node titles above 255 characters/bytes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The server will truncate the post-commit size of a sync node's title property   at 255 bytes UTF-8 Normalization Form C.  Currently  the client sends up a   full  untruncated string and relies on the server to do the truncation.  For   a really long autofill entry name (eg. because of <a title="Non-ASCII character display garble text in saved autofill data after browser relaunch" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38364"> Bug 38364 </a>)  it's silly to   send all those bytes across the network.    The safest place to do the truncation might be BuildCommitMessageCommand.  If   we did it at the syncapi layer  clients might fail if they look at the value   of syncapi::WriteNode::GetTitle and expect it to match a recently written   value to syncapi::WriteNode::SetTitle.    We could truncate to 255 bytes; or we could more conservatively truncate to   255 characters. </pre>
