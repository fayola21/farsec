<title>Issue 40041 -   chromium -    Need a way to warn about the trailing/leading new line characters in translation resource - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Lately we've been seeing lots of those trailing new line in new Chrome UI    cause bad string alignment. I will file a feature request for the TC tool   team to have this option. Meanwhile  we should have some way when   extracting translation from TC   to generate warning in log file about   these cases. </pre>
