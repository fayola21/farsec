<title>Issue 24843 -   chromium -    Last added auto search engine disappears from search engine list when tried to make default. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try to browse any search engine which adds to search engines list automatically         Example: hulu.com ( Make sure it is not added before )  2. Go to Preferences --&gt; Manage --&gt; Search Engines window  3. Try to make default of newly added  one. ( It will show as last entry to select in the list )    Actual: The search engine entry disappears from the list.    What is the expected output?  Windows and Linux behavior?  Entry should stay or show in the list even after making default.    Note: Reopening of same window helps to see the entry back on the list.      What happens if it is a User added search engine?  Currently on this build its a blocker to verify ( Cant add custom search engine ) . Verified with   previous builds   the last user added search engine ( last entry in the list ) when marked as   default it jumps one entry top of other search engines in list. Default search engine drop down in   preferences goes blank. We had a bug for this. </pre>
