<title>Issue 43335 -   chromium -    It would be nice to be able to make anonymous cross-origin requests from extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  we ignore the |withCredentials| flag of XHR because in WebCore  we   go down the same-origin path.    This is unfortunate -- it would be really nice for authors to be able to send   anonymous requests if they want.    I'm not sure how to fix this compatibily  though. Maybe   XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials should have the value |true| when they will   actually be sent (currently it always defaults to false  even in the same-  origin case). Should consult spec. </pre>
