<title>Issue 28736 -   chromium -    Statusbar does not move up when we get the download shelf. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.12 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32876">r32876</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Make sure you don't have a download shelf already.  2. Move your mouse over the &quot;download&quot; link below the attached blank.zip file. So that you get a statusbar showing you the link to   the file at the bottom left corner of your window.  3. Click on Download without moving your mouse.    Expected:  We get a download shelf and the statusbar should move up  and sit above the download shelf.    Actual:  We get a download shelf and the statusbar does not move up and is in front of the download shelf overlapping it.    Note:  Statusbar works as expected on Windows.   </pre>
