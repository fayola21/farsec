<title>Issue 29508 -   chromium -    No window un-minimizes when clicking on dock icon of running Chrome to re-activate it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.264.0 (33782)  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Open a couple chrome windows  2. Minimize them  3. Click on some other application to activate it  4. Click on Chrome icon in dock      Chrome will become the active application and un-minimize a window      Chrome becomes the active application and all windows stay minimized    On Safari and Firefox  this behavior would un-minimize one window.  If no   windows are open  clicking on the dock icon of Safari or Firefox  when they   are already running  would cause them to create a new blank window.     I think this worked in the nightlies a week ago  but I'm not 100% certain.  It   may be intermittent.  Also  I haven't checked the other case that I would   suspect is also broken....  clicking on the dock icon of Chromium when it is   already running but no windows are open (which should create a new blank   window) </pre>
