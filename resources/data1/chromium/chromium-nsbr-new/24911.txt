<title>Issue 24911 -   chromium -    Trim exported symbol table to reduce the download and on-disk size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I run nm on our framework dylib  I see a handful of exported symbols   that don't need to be there.  We can shrink the symbol table a bit by getting   these marked private_extern and having them stripped.    There are some ICU symbols that are the biggest offenders  but there are a   bunch of others too. </pre>
