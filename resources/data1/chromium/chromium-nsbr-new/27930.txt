<title>Issue 27930 -   chromium -    Support crash reporting for chromium build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="Daily Auto-Updating Google Chrome Build"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22158">issue 22158</a> for more background.    We need to modify Chromium code so that it performs in-proc crash reporting   if the chromium notifier extension (see <a title="Provide an extension that notifies chromium daily update and enables crash reporting" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27929"> issue 27929 </a>) exists and is enabled.    - This does not work with renderer process with sandbox enabled. It is ok   for now.    - When sending the crash dumps  we can append the version with revision   number when filling in the version field so crash dumps from different   revisions are separated in crash query server. </pre>
