<title>Issue 43151 -   chromium -    Improper modal popup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=147">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=147</a>    Safari 4: OK; Firefox 3.x: OK; IE 7: OK; IE 8: OK      1. Read design philosophy stated in <a title="Warn when closing with multiple tabs open" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=147"> Issue 147 </a>  2. Begin downloading a file  3. Attempt to quit Chrome        ben.at.chromium.org has stated definitively in comment 11 on <a title="Warn when closing with multiple tabs open" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=147"> Issue 147 </a> that Chromium   developers DO NOT allow for modal popups  even to protect against severe data loss. It then   follows that a user quitting Chrome while downloading a file must not be warned that quitting   will interrupt their download. Ben has noted  for example  that it would be useful to fix 147  but   unfortunately the design philosophy is paramount.        The user is shown a modal popup  warning them that their download will be interrupted  in   violation of Chrome's design philosophy.    Attached is a picture of the modal popup that must be removed  as well as Chrome's inviolate DP. </pre>
