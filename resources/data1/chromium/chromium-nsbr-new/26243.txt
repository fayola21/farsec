<title>Issue 26243 -   chromium -    User reports exponentially exploding duplicate entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split off from <a title="Duplicate bookmarks + disable/enable sync = bookmark explosion (NEED UNITTEST)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24995"> bug 24995 </a>.  User fjbuch reports:    I started using bookmark sync a few weeks ago when one still had to add an &quot;enable sync&quot; suffix. All worked well at first but then I   started getting duplication. It was massive duplication similar to rabbits reproducing (exponential growth). I have tried to to clear   the duplications from Chrome's bookmark manager and I have tried stopping sync and then restarting it. My success has been spotty at   best. I have a gazillion shortcuts in my Google Docs&gt;my folders&gt;google chrome&gt;bookmarks&gt;one or other subdirectory. One cannot delete   from Google Docs. The message is &quot;sorry  you can't delete items from read-only sources&quot;. I believe that the gazillion bookmarks in my   Google Chrome folder is slowing the loading of my Google docs file list.     Are you experiencing this? What should I do? Wait for a fix? Kill sync on my 3 computers? </pre>
