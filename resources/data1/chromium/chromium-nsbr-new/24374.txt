<title>Issue 24374 -   chromium -    Lines on Webkit's horizontal scrollbars should be vertical - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28108)    On Linux  the &quot;grippies&quot; on Webkit's horizontal scrollbars are oriented   incorrectly.  They should be vertical lines  perpendicular to the   scrollbar's direction of travel; instead  the same code is used to draw   horizontal lines for both horizontal and vertical scrollbars.    The code change for this is trivial (the positioning of the lines on   vertical scrollbars is a bit off  so I fixed that too)  but this requires a   bunch of rebaselining of Webkit tests (which I haven't done before).  I   spent a day on it but ran into trouble with test failures that seemed   unrelated to my change -- someone more familiar with the process will   probably fare better. </pre>
