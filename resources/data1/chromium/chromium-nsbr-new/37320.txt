<title>Issue 37320 -   chromium -    Dragging over an element with scrollbars should scroll the element when dragging near edges - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Have an element with overflow auto/scroll which has enough content to   require scrollbars to be shown  2. Drag an item (bookmark from the bookmark bar or a file from the desktop)   near the edge of the element with the scrollbars.    What is the expected output?    The element should scroll so that the user gets access to things outside the   viewport. The scrolling should be smooth.    What do you see instead?    On Windows this works when dragging near the top edge but not near the bottom   edge. On Mac and Linux it does not work at all.       </pre>
