<title>Issue 26340 -   chromium -    it is too hard to set up an interesting test state for the Syncer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From nick:  + Approach A is: add a BookmarkBuilder object  that allows for higher level   control of the parameters (settings like &quot;Add new items to the parent    starting from the end of the position&quot;  &quot;Create items on the server  on the   client  or both&quot;  &quot;Create items as unsynced and/or unapplied.&quot;  &quot;Generate   random positions&quot;  &quot;Generate random names&quot;  &quot;Generate local or server Ids&quot;).    With a properly configured  reusable Builder class  we could have tests   supply complete and fully-populated object states by default  and then   customize the states   + Approach B would be to add a little parser a la PopulateNodeFromString in   bookmark_model_unittest.cc.  This allows a test to specify position and   hierarchy as a string like &quot;a (b c (d e) f (g))&quot;  where for example d and e   are the first and second children of c. </pre>
