<title>Issue 33670 -   chromium -    Chrome repeats the last XHR request when reloading page regardless if that request is GET or POST - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 (Official Build 36665) dev         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: Not tested           IE 8: Not tested      1. Fire an POST XmlHttpRequest  2. Reload the page -- at this point  that POST request will be fired again        XHR POST shouldn't be fired again because if the POST corresponds to the REST-Create action    then the server will likely to create the same thing twice.        If the last request before reloading is an XHR POST  CHrome will fire it again  causing the server   on the other end to create the same thing twice.   </pre>
