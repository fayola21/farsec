<title>Issue 26330 -   chromium -    Closing multiple open tabs with Cmd-Shift-w crashes Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.230.0 (30584)    OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Open a new window  2. Open several tabs with content  3. Press Cmd-Shift-w to close the window with tabs.      The window closes.      The window closes  followed by a Chromium crash. This does not happen if   the window is closed by pressing the red button in the top left corner.   Also  if there is one tab open  cmd-shift-w does not work  cmd-w will   close the tab and the window without crashing.   </pre>
