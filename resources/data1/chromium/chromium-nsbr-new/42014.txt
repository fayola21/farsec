<title>Issue 42014 -   chromium -    Asian characters do not appear when copying and pasting into some forms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Copy some chinese or japanese characters from another site (I used   google translate to create some)  2. Paste them into the search form on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/</a>.    Nothing appears.  3. do the same on the search form on <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">http://book.cakephp.org/</a> and the   characters appear just fine.      I expected the characters to appear on both sites.  I have a site that is   acting like the yui site.  The characters do not appear when I copy and   paste them into the form fields.  I can't give you that address because it   is within a login area.      The characters do not appear in the text box on one of the sites  but they   do on the other    <b>Please provide
