<title>Issue 29107 -   chromium -    NTP thumbnails don't have colors assigned - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the trunk (not the 249 derived dev channel)  the &quot;titlebars&quot; on the   thumbnails on the NTP don't have color. (Current trunk is <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33457">r33457</a> for   bisecting purposes if you don't get to this for a while).    Tested with the Chuck Anderson theme. </pre>
