<title>Issue 30056 -   chromium -    Menu doesn't trigger full-screen mode properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.5.24.0 (Official Build df90a8a6**)  Chrome: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)        1. Wrench menu &gt; Full Screen    What is the expected output?     Chrome should go into full-screen mode properly.    What do you see instead?    Chrome thinks it's in full-screen mode  but the browser window does not   change appearance. The full-screen bubble may appear. Some UI elements on   the tabstrip don't work (New Tab +  Close Tab x).    This is about 90% reproducible.  You may have to switch in and out of   fullscreen mode a couple of times to get Chrome into this state.    This bug does NOT happen if you enter full-screen mode using F11.      </pre>
