<title>Issue 44361 -   chromium -    Table row (TR) background is repeat separately on every cell - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Create a table  a row  and some cells.  2. Set a css background image to the row.      Image to be painted as background to the table row...      The image is rendered separately for each cell  causing an ugly repeat   pattern.    This looks ugly on every other browser that I've tested  but thats no   reason to stay ugly...  The specs AFAIK do not say anything about this  and we should be able to   apply a background image to a TR.   </pre>
