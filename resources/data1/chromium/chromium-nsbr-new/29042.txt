<title>Issue 29042 -   chromium -    sometimes autocomplete popups have blank white areas - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I have text in input field with some autocomplete entries and I backspace   so I would get more matches  the bottom part of the popup is blank (i.e.    paints white).    I bet the render widget popup is getting resized and we're not resizing the   widget.  I think I assumed that popups can't get resized.   </pre>
