<title>Issue 31683 -   chromium -    &quot;show cookies and website permissions&quot; in prefs should have ellipsis at the end - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In prefs  the &quot;Show cookies and website permissions&quot; button should have an   ellipsis because it opens a dialog that requires additional user information.   This is per the Apple HIG.    Mind if I add it? I can ifdef the string just for Mac if you like. </pre>
