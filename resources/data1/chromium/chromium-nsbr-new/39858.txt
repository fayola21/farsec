<title>Issue 39858 -   chromium -    Compact location bar unittest broken after NTP focus change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In compact_location_bar_host_browsertest.cc  TestOnNewTab is partially   disabled because a recent change of mine made us unconditionally focus the   location bar when we navigate to the NTP.    After discussing with oshima  the right behavior here may be to change the   test from this:    ctrl-l -&gt; CLB visible  navigate to NTP -&gt; CLB invisible  (this is the broken step)  ctrl-l -&gt; CLB visible    to this:    ctrl-l -&gt; CLB visible  navigate to google.com -&gt; CLB invisible  navigate to NTP -&gt; CLB visible  navigate to google.com -&gt; CLB invisible  ctrl-l -&gt; CLB visible    This tests the new behavior explicitly. </pre>
