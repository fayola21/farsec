<title>Issue 38208 -   chromium -    Mac: privacy - content settings UI review - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac UI for content settings and the modal cookie dialogs need to be reviewed and changed to   be more &quot;maccy&quot; where appropriate and conform to Mac HIG. Examples:    * Cookie prompt dialog  - modal dialog with no icon identifying application. This violates the HIG.  - radio buttons for &quot;enable&quot; state wraps and looks like ass even on the shortest website urls. Radio   buttons should be written to not wrap.  - ui doesn't match any other yes/no/remember on the OS (which uses a checkbox  not radio   buttons).    * Clear browsing data dialog </pre>
