<title>Issue 39864 -   chromium -    Refactor GLEW initialization in command buffer server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently Linux  Windows and Mac OS X all initialize GLEW slightly   differently. Because of how Linux creates the GLX context it requires GLEW   to be initialized even before the GLES2CmdDecoder is. The code should be   refactored to initialize GLEW in one place.   </pre>
