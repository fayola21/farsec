<title>Issue 44407 -   chromium -    Bookmark Folder Menus Improperly Remain Active after Drag Move of Bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have folders and regular bookmarks on the bar.  2. Choose a bookmark and start dragging it.  3. Drag it onto a folder and wait until the folder opens.  4. Drag the bookmark back to its original position and drop it  making no change.  5. Without clicking the mouse  move it so that it is over one of the folders on the bar.    What is the expected output?  - The folder should not expand into a folder menu.    What do you see instead?  - The folder is still active  expanding into a folder menu.    Note that this also occurs when dragging a bookmark from within a folder. </pre>
