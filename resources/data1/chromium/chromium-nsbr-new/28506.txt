<title>Issue 28506 -   chromium -    New-tab fav hover feedback not cleared - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. go to new-tab  2. click one of the fav bookmarks (best use a slow server)  3. hover another fav bookmark    Now there are two favs which show the hover feedback (&quot;window&quot; border). Only   the currently hovered fav should show the border.    This is on Linux in case it is platform specific.   </pre>
