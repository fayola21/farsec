<title>Issue 30478 -   chromium -    Renderer histograms discard flag settings when transitioning to the browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a UMA_* histogram that is grown in the renderer (such as any   Renederer4.* histograms)  2. Visit some pages  3. Examine about:histograms.  To the far right of each UMA_* histogram there   should be a &quot;flags = 0x1&quot;  but instead in there is no mention of the flags    as there were discarded.    This was a regression induced by   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/377028/diff/26001/26015">http://codereview.chromium.org/377028/diff/26001/26015</a>  where line 417 was not properly translated in this migration. </pre>
