<title>Issue 45090 -   chromium -    Mac version missing keyboard shortcuts for developer tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 6.0.415.0 (Developer Build 48136)    On both the Windows and Linux versions of Chromium  there are keyboard shortcuts to each of the   actions inside the Developer menu  yet there are none to speak of on the Mac version.  Even if they   don't perfectly align with the values for their other OS counterparts  the Mac version should have   these shortcuts enabled for web developers  such as myself  who need to be able to quickly debug   code.   </pre>
