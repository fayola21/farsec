<title>Issue 34660 -   chromium -    Linux font fallback should choose appropriate &quot;style&quot; of font - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Use chromium on fresh ubuntu install  which doesn't have non-free fonts   installed.  2. Visit page which doesn't specify any fonts or which specifies the non-  installed fonts.  3. (Also  open font options and see what fonts it has fallen back to   there.)    What is the expected output?  Fonts should fallback to appropriate types (arial -&gt; sans  times new roman   -&gt; serif  courier new -&gt; monospace)    What do you see instead?  Everything falls back to Sans.           </pre>
