<title>Issue 27236 -   chromium -    typing &quot;Google XYZ&quot; in the address bar should search for &quot;Google XYZ&quot;  not for &quot;XYZ&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.223.16 (Official Build 30555)  WebKit	532.3  V8	1.3.16.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.223.16 Safari/532.3        1. Type &quot;Google Maps&quot; (without quotes) into Chrome's address&amp;search bar  2. As soon as you finish typing &quot;Google M&quot;  the prompt changes to &quot;Search   Google Quicksearch: M&quot;  3. Once you have finished typing &quot;Google Maps&quot;  hit &lt;Enter&gt; to search.        It should search for &quot;Google Maps&quot;. I personally would prefer if you had to   press &lt;Tab&gt; to override the search engine  e.g. &quot;Google&lt;tab&gt;Maps&quot; should   search for &quot;Maps&quot; regardless of what search engine you have set. If that's   not possible  then I'd like &quot;Google Maps&quot; to at least search for &quot;Google   Maps&quot; (rather than &quot;Maps&quot;) when my default search engine *already* is   Google.        It searches for &quot;Maps&quot;  and I have to go back and search for &quot;Google Maps&quot;   (in quotes) to prevent it from misinterpreting my request.   </pre>
