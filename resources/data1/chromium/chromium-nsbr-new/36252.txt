<title>Issue 36252 -   chromium -    Update server not available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Officiell version 38071) unknown      1. Click wrench-menu  About Google Chrome  2. Notice error message      Chrome should say the newest version is installed.      Earlier today it said &quot;Chrome has been updated&quot;. Reinstalling Chrome didn't   get that message away. I find no way to verify that I have the latest   version. </pre>
