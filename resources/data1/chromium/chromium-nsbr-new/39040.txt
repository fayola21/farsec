<title>Issue 39040 -   chromium -    kernel panics on the 10.6 bots  probably caused by ui_tests and/or browser_tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It feels like we have atleast one panic a day from the 10.6 bots.  We've seen this happen on both debug and release bots.  The release bot runs a   bunch of tests  but the debug bots only runs ui_test or browser_test (each bot only runs one).    We've tried swapping hardware  and the release failures repeat  but the debug failures have not yet repeated.    Here are the last tests running according to the logs.  Remember  this doesn't completely point the finger at these tests because there is some   buffering of the logs as they move back to the master in real time  so it's possible a test after these are what was really running when the panic   happened.
