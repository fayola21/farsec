<title>Issue 31369 -   chromium -    Drop Thumbs.db from uploaded extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I noticed at least one extension on the extension site has a stray Thumbs.db   in it.    This file is hidden on Windows so it's easy to accidentally pack it into   extensions.  We should drop it like we drop other magic files (like   __MACOSX__ or whatever that one is called). </pre>
