<title>Issue 35040 -   chromium -    Extend the SessionService to provide a way of snapshotting the current session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To sync open tabs  we need a way to snapshot the current sessions (windows    tabs  back/forward history). The SessionService already holds that   information but doesn't expose it publicly.    Look into adapting SessionService::BuildCommandsFromBrowsers into a public   method. </pre>
