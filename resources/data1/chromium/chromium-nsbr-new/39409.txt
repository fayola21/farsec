<title>Issue 39409 -   chromium -    Implement Chrome sandbox tests for NaCl loader process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to add a test that will verify that NaCl loader processes run in the   sandbox. The test should similar to sandbox test that exists for the renderer   process and use kTestSandbox command line flag. See   RendererMainPlatformDelegate::RunSandboxTests for implementation. </pre>
