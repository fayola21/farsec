<title>Issue 45582 -   chromium -    Losing Session Variables in PHP With SEF &amp; URL Rewriting with Apache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. PHP website setup using SEF (search engine friendly) URLs  and routing all requests through a front   controller. htaccess file that will rewrite URL to remove front controller.  2. Page 1  set values in the session (using cookies).   3. Navigate to Page 2. Try to access values stored in session      Should be able to access the values stored on page 1      Values are randomly lost.    This is in my htaccess file:    Options +FollowSymlinks   RewriteEngine on  #allow cool urls   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d   RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]   #allow to have Url without index.php     If I remove the htaccess file  and add index.php to the URL  everything works great  Session values are   maintained correctly.  Once the htaccess file is enabled  session values are randomly lost.      It seems like with the re-written URL  Google Chrome isn't always identifying the correct cookie to use?  I'm not   sure...but every other browser works fine with the SEF urls.  This issue was also happening in 4.x. </pre>
