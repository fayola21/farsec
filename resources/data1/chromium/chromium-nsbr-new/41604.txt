<title>Issue 41604 -   chromium -    interrupted large file download (caused by laptop sleeping  for instance) results in partial file  listed as done in Downloads (no resume option) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. use Chrome on a laptop that can sleep  2. start a large file download in Chrome  switch to Downloads   3. put the laptop to sleep for awhile (enough to kill download)  then   resume  4. in Downloads area  the file will be listed as (effectively) 'done' -   clicking on it will attempt to open it (even though it's not finished   downloading)  and there's no 'resume' option      option 1 (best) - chrome notices file size does not match the original   content length  automatically resumes (or prompts for resume).    Alternatively  just keeps a bit of data for when it's done (rather than   storing/trusting content length) so any incomplete downloads are easy to   track.  Alternatively  just write the files to a different filename than   the original download (foo.blah.partial or whatever) and just rename when   it finishes (many existing progs do this last one)    option 2 (not as good as 1) - allow user that knows the download didn't   successfully finish to have a &quot;resume download&quot; option to finish   downloading the file.    option 3 (not as good as either 1 or 2) - even if resume isn't implemented     don't leave the file in place at the 'final' filename  at least at a   'partial' filename place  better yet killing the partial file (again  this   is assuming resume isn't an option to fix this  so your only Chrome option   is re-doing the download)        The 2 'violations' of expected (IMHO) behavior that stick out here:  a) the Downloads UI shows it as 'done' when it didn't finish  b) (more important) we end up with a 'corrupted' (incomplete) file on disk   with no indication that it's in such a state.    <b>Please provide
