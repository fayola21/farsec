<title>Issue 28511 -   chromium -    Overlapping Keyboard shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : ALL  OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Open two tabs  2. Click Option + Command + Left/Right Arrow key (to switch to the   left/right tab)      It will switch focus to the tab on the left/right.      It goes back or forward a page    -- Possible that since Command + left arrow key goes back a page   Chrome is ignoring the option key or the code that interprets those keys   have a glitch that asks for some argument that obviously has a flaw like   asking as long as command is down instead of if command and option or   command or option is down. I think the best plan of action is to remove   the ability to go back or forth a page from command and arrow keys and   move it to command square bracket because that is already common on   the mac and it will get us out of this glitch. That should be done as well as   fixing any weak code arguments. </pre>
