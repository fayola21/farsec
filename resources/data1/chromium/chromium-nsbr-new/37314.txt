<title>Issue 37314 -   chromium -    Mac: Don't keep asking which client cert to use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new SSL client-cert support for Mac always prompts the user which cert to use when making a   new connection. This gets annoying. I just compared with Safari: it will automatically use the same   cert you specified the first time. (You can clear this by going into the Keychain Access utility app and   deleting the corresponding 'identity preference' item.) We should work the same way.    See also <a title="User Interface Improvement for Client Certificate Usage"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29784">issue 29784</a>  a UI enhancement request to display the identity in the address bar. This   would provide an affordance for switching identities. </pre>
