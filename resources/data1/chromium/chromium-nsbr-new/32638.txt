<title>Issue 32638 -   chromium -    Fade animations are too slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Hover the tab strip (equiv behavior for toolbar buttons)  2. Compare the time the fade happens against Windows/Linux      Expected: tab highlight occurs so quickly you almost don't notice it   animates  Actual: slow fade in of prehighlight      I pick on *everyone* about this because I really notice it (just played   with Chrome Mac for the first time recently).  It is especially important   for Chrome because it makes the browser *feel* slow when animations are   slow.    This is hopefully just a constant somewhere you can flip. </pre>
