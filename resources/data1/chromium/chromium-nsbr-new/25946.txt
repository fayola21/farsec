<title>Issue 25946 -   chromium -    global_keyboard_shortcut_macs uses keycodes for all shortcuts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While working on that |cr_firesForKeyEvent:| CL (<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/319001">http://codereview.chromium.org/319001</a> )    it occurred to me that global_keyboard_shortcuts_mac is keycode-based. That is fine for   shortcuts that are on the same physical position on all keyboards (e.g. arrows keys    backspace) but less fine in other cases.    The most problematic shortcut is probably cmd-shift-[/]. On US layouts  this is cmd-{/}    which makes sense. On German keyboards  this is cmd-��_��_/* which is worse. On French   layouts  it's cmd-��_��_/*. And so on. (cmd-* is a system shortcut for &quot;evaluate selection as   applescript&quot;  so this even conflicts with a system shortcut). Doing this by character match   instead of by keycode match is not much better  because &quot;{&quot; is pretty hard to type in german   (but that's ok  that's why we have cmd-opt-left/right and ctrl-tab  I guess).    Another conflict is cmd-1-9 for &quot;switch to nth tab&quot;. On some keyboards (e.g. italian and   french)  you have to press shift to get a number and get some glyph if you just hit the &quot;1&quot;   key (e.g. &quot;&amp;&quot; for 1 on a french layout). Doing this by keycode might actually be ok (it's more   convenient to type  and I couldn't see any shortcut conflicts for french and italian ��_��_��_ cmd-&amp;   and friends don't seem to be used often). In Safari however  cmd-&quot;1&quot; doesn't do anything   with an italian keyboard (neither does cmd-shift-&quot;1&quot;).    All the other shortcuts look fine.    Thoughts? I'd say leave cmd-1-9 as is  but change cmd-{/} into a character-based instead   of keycode-based shortcut.    Please cc people who might have an opinion here. </pre>
