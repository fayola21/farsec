<title>Issue 38491 -   chromium -    Omnibox completion is in a weird state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta      1. Type character in omnibox  2. Watch history-based completion appear  3. Be happy  and be ready to hit enter  4. Something happens and the completion disappears  5. Get annoyed  type another character  6. Go to 2.        The completion appearing in step 2 shouldn't disappear.        Step 3.    See the attached movie.    This will probably work fine after a browser restart  but I've heard other   people complain about this too.    Leaving this as OS-Mac  but I think the people who I've heard complaining   about this used Linux. </pre>
