<title>Issue 33965 -   chromium -    Rounded corners are too think (Mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 (Official Build 37331) dev           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Create any generic HTML document and add rounded corners to a div   using CSS3 &quot;border-radius&quot;.  2. Add a solid 1px border to the said div (any color) as well as a different   background for visibility.      The background should be contained fully by the border  and the border   radius should be smooth and the same thickness as the rest of the border.  If the corners were as thick as the rest of the border  then the background   would not show outside of the boundary of the div.      Portions of the background extend beyond the curved border because the   border's radius is around 1/2 the thickness of the rest of it.    (NOTE: Yes  I know that there are already issues about this! I was told by   user evan@chromium.org to start a separate one for Mac  because the OS X   version of Chrome was not affected by recent changes in Skia to alter the   thickness of rounded corners.)    Notice in the screenshot below how thin the border becomes when it   enters curvature. :) </pre>
