<title>Issue 25426 -   chromium -    Crash reports should let user provide more information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Users who are experiencing a crash sometimes want to provide  more information.  We should make this possible because  sometimes the crash reports don't have enough information  to reproduce or fix the bugs.    Ideas:  - add an 'include email address in crash reports' option in     Wrench / Options / Details / Privacy.    - ditto  in first run dialog (same  but would get more users)  - add a way for users who have experienced crashes to see and   comment on their crash reports via a web app (shown via     Developer / crash report manager? )             </pre>
