<title>Issue 31449 -   chromium -    Mouse doesn't switch to I-Beam when hovering over the Omnibox while it is out of focus. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.0 (35431)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. write for example <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list</a> into   the urlbar  2. PRESS ENTER  3. move the mousepointer to the link in the Url-Bar      The mousepointer should switch to a &quot;text-pointer&quot; when I hove over the   link      The mousepointer stays as the &quot;default-pointer&quot;. (Only if you move to a   extension-icon  it should be the default-pointer!)    Even if I click into the Url-bar (and mark the link) the mousecursor   switches from the &quot;default-&quot; to the &quot;text-pointer&quot;      In Firefox/Safari/Camino the behavior is ok!    Thanks and regards  Mehmet </pre>
