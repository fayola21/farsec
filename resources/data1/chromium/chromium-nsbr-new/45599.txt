<title>Issue 45599 -   chromium -    URL not shown in links opened in new tabs until response received from server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): As expected  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): As expected  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unsure      1.  Either use a slow internet connection or visit a server that is taking a long time to respond for   some reason (high traffic  perhaps).  2.  Open a link to that server in a new tab (either by middle-clicking or clicking a link set to open in   a new window/tab)  3.  Go to the new tab and observe that the URL bar reads &quot;about:blank&quot; until the server starts   responding.      The URL bar should give the URL of the page being loaded  so that if a user has opened several new   tabs when a server is responding slowly  he or she can tell which tabs are which.  (Chrome does   ameliorate this a bit by showing &quot;Waiting for domain.com...&quot; at the bottom  but this is useless if   opening several tabs on the same domain.)      The URL bar reads &quot;about:blank&quot; </pre>
