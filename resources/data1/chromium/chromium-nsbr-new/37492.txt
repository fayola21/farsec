<title>Issue 37492 -   chromium -    HTML5 drag/drop: dragend is emitted before drop. Spec says drop event should be first. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 dev (Windows)      1. Load the attached file  2. Drag/Drop fruits  3. Look at the console        A fruit gets repositioned permanently when dropped (drop emitted  then   dragend) and replaced to its original location when the DandD operation is   cancelled (only dragend emitted).      A fruit is always replaced to its original location because on drop the   dragend gets emitted before the drop. Console displays confirm the sequence   of events.     </pre>
