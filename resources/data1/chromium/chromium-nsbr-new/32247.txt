<title>Issue 32247 -   chromium -    Cursor sometimes disappears from the location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.297.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36007">r36007</a>  OS + version : ALT Linux Sisyphus  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager : KDE4    Sometimes cursor stops to appearing in the location bar until restart. It   affects all tabs simultaneously. Blind editing is still possible  though it   is not just as if the cursor just wasn't shown: the editing position doesn't   always move with the arrow keys etc. </pre>
