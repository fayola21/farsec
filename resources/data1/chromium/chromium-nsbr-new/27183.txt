<title>Issue 27183 -   chromium -    Page pretty much locks up the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm on mac 4.0.237.0.  When I go to   <a href="http://www.sriraminhell.com/2008/09/review-of-google-chrome-slow-">http://www.sriraminhell.com/2008/09/review-of-google-chrome-slow-</a>  and.html I see the fav icon changing back and forth between something very   rapidly.  I also see the go button turning into a stop button and back at the   same rate.  Any interactions with pages become very slow  yet tearing off   tabs  hover effects on the close button  etc are still quite fast.  While things   are locked up  both the browser process and one of the renderers have very   high CPU usage and the memory usage slowly is climbing up.  The close   button will work after some time.  Other tabs are unresponsive until the bad   tab is closed.    I'm guessing it's a browser backend issue. </pre>
