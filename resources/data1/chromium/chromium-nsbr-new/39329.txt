<title>Issue 39329 -   chromium -    DCHECK when proxy requests auth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In a debug build  set a proxy server that requires authentication.  2. Load any web page.    What is the expected output?  Proxy auth login prompt should be displayed.    What do you see instead?  The NOTREACHED() line in login_prompt.cc:MakeInputForPasswordManager() is   reached.    This was introduced by <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=36829. Switching the order if the if statement so that   (auth_info_-&gt;is_proxy) is checked prior to   (net::GetHostAndPort(request_url)_ != host_and_port) fixes the problem.   However  I'm nervous about reintroducing crbug.com/32718. Tim  could you   please confirm whether the suggested fix is safe? If so  I'll mail you a   patch. </pre>
