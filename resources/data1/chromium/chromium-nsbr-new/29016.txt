<title>Issue 29016 -   chromium -    Official builder archive step should abort if copy to directory exists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'll be very brief...    We've run into issues where the VERSION file hasn't incremented properly   (which is another issue) and we kicked off an automated build.  The bad   part is  the revisions have been different and the archive step copies over   new binaries on the second build  but fails to copy symbols... which   basically ruins any release we might have.  This has already happened twice   (it's more likely on the beta branch since we are dealing w/ fewer change   sets).    What I want:    Let's add a very early pre-step that stops the entire build (there is no p   if the directory exists on chrome-  master.mtv.*official_builds&lt;version&gt;&lt;platform&gt;   </pre>
