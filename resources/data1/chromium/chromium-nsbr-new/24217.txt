<title>Issue 24217 -   chromium -    Merge and Sync dialog contents shift up by 1 line after success for a few seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The attached screenshots shows the Merge and Sync dialog before and after   hitting the accept action.    When the &quot;All Done!&quot; notification appears  everything shifts up by 1 line.    This is unintended and potentially jarring. </pre>
