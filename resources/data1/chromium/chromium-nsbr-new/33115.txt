<title>Issue 33115 -   chromium -    Sometimes &lt;base&gt; tags are ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit   <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?">http://translate.google.com/translate?</a>  hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=es&amp;u=<a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/">http://www.vancouver2010.com/</a>  2. The bottom frame on the page contains a translation of vancouver2010.com  which has a   &lt;base&gt; tag so that the relative URLs refer to vancouver2010.com  not the host name we proxy   the translation on.  3. Thus none of the images  css  or JS load.      All the relative URLed content should load correctly from www.vancouver2010.com      None of the images  css  or JS load      Note: this doesn't happen with all translated pages.  For example:    <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=es&amp;u=http://www.google.com/">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=es&amp;u=http://www.google.com/</a>  That page contains a &lt;base&gt; tag as well  yet everything seems to load correctly.    <b>Please provide
