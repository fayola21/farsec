<title>Issue 35014 -   chromium -    suggestion: custom &quot;headlines&quot; for each tab in the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I often have many many tabs open on my computer- and would prefer to customize the name   for each tab on my browser. I would prefer this to the automatically generated summary   (example: auto summary for google calendar is: Google.com-Calendar. I would instead like to   customize this name to &quot;social calendar&quot;  while i keep another calendar tab open which i would   call &quot;work calendar&quot;.)    Further  I dont like the fact that tabs opened thro my bookmarked pages are named by the   bookmark name I gave them. I would like to customize these as well based on what im viewing.   For instace  I have a bookmark for gmail called &quot;M&quot;. I always have 2 or 3 mail tabs open- in   which i view different labels. I woudl like to customize these tab names to reflect the same-   instead of seeing them all called &quot;M&quot;)                    <b>Please provide
