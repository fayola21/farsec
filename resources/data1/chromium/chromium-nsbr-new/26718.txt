Launch chrome. Open &quot;Add Page&quot; sheet from contextual menu of bookmark bar      ( Screen shot -1 to view the standard folders on the sheet )    2. Double click on the standard folders &quot;Bookmark Bar&quot; and &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; -  clear the       titles completely.      ( Screen shot -2 to view the page sheet after deleting the titles of standard folder titles )    Actual:   Standard folder titles can be editable.     What is the expected output?   Standard folder titles should always stay read only.    - Windows and linux have the different folder structure   and they never allow titles to edit.    Note: On editing these folder titles it doesn't effects any of our functionality.   </pre>
