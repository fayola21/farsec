<title>Issue 39422 -   chromium -    Crazy devs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37957">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37957</a>    ^ There's my issue. Was reading over the &quot;fix&quot; for the stupid Aero Peek   functionality added in one of the recent updates. They're talking about   &quot;improving&quot; it so that it's less onerous.    I don't want it improved. I want it gone. There are plenty of users who agree   with me.    Feel free to &quot;improve&quot; all you want--just make it a checkbox under options so   that we can ditch it. </pre>
