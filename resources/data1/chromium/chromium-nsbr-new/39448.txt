<title>Issue 39448 -   chromium -    Mouse events and context menus behave differently on Mac compared to Windows and Linux. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have two extensions installed: Chromed Bird and One Number.    On Windows and Linux  both extensions show up with nice fade-in when I click   them and disappear with a nice fade-out when I click their icon the second   time.    On Mac  however  the second click does something strange - the extension   window immediately disappears and then re-appears with glitchy fade-in.    Also  on Mac the text field in Chromed Bird doesn't allow Command+C/V   keyboard shortcuts and doesn't show context menu on right mouse   click/secondary click. </pre>
