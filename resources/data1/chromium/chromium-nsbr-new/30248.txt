<title>Issue 30248 -   chromium -    Problem with the find function - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I use the &quot;find&quot; method  and as a result chrome scrolls to a different   position in the page  sometimes when I click on an inputbox (usually of type   text)  chrome scrolls back to my previous position in the page  as if it   didn't log the scrolling action. </pre>
