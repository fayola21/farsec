<title>Issue 41515 -   chromium -    infobars.show() should not allow tabId to be optional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the optional id is really &quot;the selected tab in the current browser&quot;. The   problem with this is that when called from the background page  our notion of   current browser is a little weak.    the suggestion is to encourage developers to always be explicit about what   tab gets the infobar. if they really need the above  they can always use    chrome.windows.getCurrent(function(window) {    chrome.tabs.getSelected(function(tab) {      chrome.infobars.show(tab.id  ...);    });  });   </pre>
