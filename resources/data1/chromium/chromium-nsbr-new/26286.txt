<title>Issue 26286 -   chromium -    http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php slider is extremely slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.223.11 Safari/532.3  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php">http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Go to <a href="http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php">http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php</a>  2. Slide the top slider (&quot;Slide for level&quot;)        Page text should change almost instantly      Sliding is slow  extremely sluggish    Safari does not suffer from the same problem. Looking at view-  source:<a href="http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php">http://quickarmory.com/heirloom.php</a> - the &quot;scrollevent&quot; function   contains a lot of DOM re-creation with innerHTML  i suspect this is the   culprit.  I'll work on a reduction today or tomorrow. </pre>
