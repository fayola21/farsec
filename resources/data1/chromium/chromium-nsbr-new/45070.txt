<title>Issue 45070 -   chromium -    provide parsed view of get params - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)    Firebug parses the sent parms  as well as any responce (think: json) so that   they can be viewed in a clean key:value table. This is in addition to the raw   request url and response  making finding the value your looking for simpler.   Would be nice to have this as well!    cross-reference to: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39711">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39711</a> </pre>
