<title>Issue 34956 -   chromium -    Builtin translate has no settings for resetting settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193) dev    As title.  For one thing if I set not to show the translate bar for one website  I   couldn't undo the change.    In a retrospect is there any way to modify chrome settings  for those   settings that are buried under the hood (and for extensions as well)?   </pre>
