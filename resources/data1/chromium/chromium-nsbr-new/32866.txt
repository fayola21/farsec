<title>Issue 32866 -   chromium -    highlight color grey  then blue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.CTRL+A an article page on nytimes.com          When select-all is executed  the initial highlight coloring should be a   light blue.      On first execution  the highlight coloring is grey (which I prefer to   blue). Once unselected  re-selecting-all will result in the light-blue   highlight coloring  and the grey coloring is no longer available unless the   window is closed and reopened. I like the grey background/white text   contrast  and find it much easier on the eyes. I don't like the blue. I   wish there were a way to change highlight color in the settings.    <b>Please provide
