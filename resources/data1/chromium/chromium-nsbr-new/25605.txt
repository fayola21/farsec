<title>Issue 25605 -   chromium -    Having two copies of 64-bit flash player causing flash to not work at all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Tested on a 64-bit OpenSUSE 11.1 machine running 64-bit Google Chrome  4.0.223.5 with 64-bit Flash 10. Problem doesn't happen on my 32-bit Ubuntu  Hardy test box with Flash 9 / 10.    Install the flash plugin to ~/.mozilla/plugins  make a second copy in the  plugins directory. Two copies of libflashplayer.so should show up in  about:plugins now. Visit Youtube and the Flash crashes. Remove one copy  makes it work again. The &quot;bad&quot; configuration works fine in Firefox.      Note: the test machine has a P4 CPU  which causes a SIGILL due to the lack  of the LAHF instruction  so I added the workaround from  <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=535548">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=535548</a>. </pre>
