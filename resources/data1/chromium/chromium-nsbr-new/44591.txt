<title>Issue 44591 -   chromium -    Arrowing to keyword in omnibox dropdown does not prevent ctrl from making search UI disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376)    when using the addressbar it is possible to search on sites other than google   by entering the website. Eg. I was looking up a word in an online dictionary   by entering: &quot;dict.leo.org&quot;. The problem I am facing now is that it is not   possible to use any crtl key combinations as this erases the address bar. So   it is also not possible to use the crtl+v key combination to copy/paste a   word from somewhere else.    Its not a major issue but would indeed help if fixed.    regards   Edmund </pre>
