<title>Issue 27219 -   chromium -    Colors get extremely bright when scrolling.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  OS Version:  10.5.8    What's Happening?  Hard to reproduce on demand  but it's happened to me more than once.     There is an issue where colors on the page become extremely bright and   distorted after scrolling. When the text in question goes out of view and   comes back  it generally comes back in normal colors. Attached   screenshots - This actually happened both on websites  and in the 'view   source' page. If I restart  it goes away. Noticed it most on sites with a white   background. (this page  google news  etc.)     Screenshots attached.     Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  possible.   </pre>
