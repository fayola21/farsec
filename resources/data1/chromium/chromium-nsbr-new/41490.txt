<title>Issue 41490 -   chromium -    Copying urls / dragging urls behavior  clarified - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using the new http hiding behavior  the following should occur:    A. Copy a url:  Rich text is &quot;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&quot; and whole string is linked to that url  Plain text is simply &quot;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&quot;     B. Drag a url:  Rich text is &quot;Page Title&quot; and string is linked to url  Plain text is &quot;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&quot;     If users have modified the text in the omnibox  we use behavior A all the time (since we don't know   the page title) and we should make sure that http is included if a URL navigation action would have   resulted.       For Queries:  C. Drag an unsubmitted query:  Rich text is &quot;Query string&quot; and string is linked to the google.com search url  Plain text is simply the query string.    Seem reasonable? </pre>
