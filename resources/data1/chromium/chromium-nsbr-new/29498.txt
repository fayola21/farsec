<title>Issue 29498 -   chromium -    Notes will be lost when moved up out of renderer  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/">http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/</a>  2. Create a note by clicking on New note  3. Hold at the bottom of the note and move till you reach tab strip  4. Unhold the note    What is the expected output?   It shouldn't be allowed to go out of renderer    What do you see instead?  While moving a note down we get scrollbars as needed. But a note is moved   up above the renderer it's lost. There's no way we can bring that note   back.    Happening with Google Chrome 4.0.249.25 (Official Build 33676) </pre>
