<title>Issue 44009 -   chromium -    Tabbing away after you highlight an autofill entry results in the label for the autofill profile getting included in the field - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to &quot;options -&gt; personal stuff -&gt; change autofill settings&quot; and create  an address profile with the label &quot;Home&quot;. Let the name be &quot;John Doe&quot;  2. Navigate to a web page with name and address fields.  3. Click in the empty first name field on the web page.  4. Hit the down arrow key on your keyboard until &quot;John (Home)&quot; is highlighted.  5. Hit the tab key on your keyboard to move to the next field.    What is the expected output?   The first name field is filled with the text &quot;John&quot;.    What do you see instead?  The first name field is filled with the text &quot;John (Home)&quot;.    Additional information: If you click on &quot;John (Home)&quot; with your mouse  the  correct name is entered in the first name field. It is only when you tab  away from the selection that the label gets added to the name. It looks  like the Autofill++ entry is being treated like an Autofill classic entry  when you tab away from the field. </pre>
