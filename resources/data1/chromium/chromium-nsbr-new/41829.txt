<title>Issue 41829 -   chromium -    Audit sql usage to find subtle corruption cases. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The histograms show various returns which may be corruption but may not be treated as such.    Things like SQLITE_NOTADB or I/O errors may not be handled by our corruption handlers.  Erik   noticed that it seems like we hit more SQLITE_CORRUPT errors than we launch browsers  which   probably means we're hitting the error and not handling it.    Track these cases down and nail them. </pre>
