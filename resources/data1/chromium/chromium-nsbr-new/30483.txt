<title>Issue 30483 -   chromium -    Security issue -- Session Cookies are not deleted after restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Had setup a session on server  2. Cookie was later altered on server to be a session cookie (so it should   expire when browser closes)  3. Chrome (eventually) reflects that it should expire at end of session   (see cookie1.png)  4. Restart browser  ensure no chrome.exe's are running (nochrome.png)  5. Cookie hasn't been deleted after restart  still gets sent to the server   (after_start.png)    Other users have complained to us that sessions are not expiring on exit.      Cookie deleted.      Cookie not deleted.    <b>Please provide
