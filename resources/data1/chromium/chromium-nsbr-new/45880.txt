<title>Issue 45880 -   chromium -    Windows Proxy Settings Silently Ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0 (Official Build 48573) dev      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: FAIL      1. Browse the web with an adblocking proxy configured  2. After some hours  proxy is silently bypassed by Chrome and IE  3. Firefox continues using proxy.    I know there has been requests before that Chrome use an independent proxy   setting like Firefox.  However it currently uses the windows settings like   Internet Explorer.    There is a failure on my Win7 Pro x64 where the windows proxy settings   suddenly start being ignored.  In mid browsing session  ads started   appearing.  Both Chrome and IE show that they are bypassing the configured   proxy for all traffic.  Firefox still correctly uses the proxy. </pre>
