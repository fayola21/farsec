<title>Issue 36754 -   chromium -    Number of Bytes downloaded is not being updated in MB  it's done in GB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.I am trying to download a file of size 2.8 GB in size. Initially the download screen in Chrome   browser was showing me the total download size in KiloBytes. However when the number of   dowloaded bytes gets close after 2.0GB  it rounds of the figure in 100 MB and just shows   something like 2.6GB of 2.8GB and says how long it's going to download. It's awfully frustrating   to see the number just stay  there and waiting for next 100MB to be downloaded  The wait for the   user gets really worse when the download speed is in mere ten's of kB's.      As I know it  other browsers show the download bits in units of MB. I would suggest that chrome   does the same thing too.          <b>Please provide
