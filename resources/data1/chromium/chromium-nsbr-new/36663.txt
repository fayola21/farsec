<title>Issue 36663 -   chromium -    Have &quot;fast-build&quot; build setting be a target along side debug and release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> fast-build is roughly debug without symbols  to reduce cycle time on try   slaves.    Instead of using environment variables during the GYP run  it should be new   configuration targets in the gyp common.gypi target.    Since it'll break everything  I recommend doing this in two phases:  - Modify common.gypi to add this new target and modify compile.py to use it.  - A few days later  modify the try server to not hack the update step with   environment variables.    Very similar to <a title="Have official build setting be a target along side debug and release"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36662">issue 36662</a>. </pre>
