<title>Issue 35358 -   chromium -    Never ending waiting of page load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Official Build 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : all           Safari 4: not tested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: not tested           IE 8: OK      1. Google for Paris  for example  2. Open a lot of new tabs using the results  3. Open another  non-related google page ( www.cnn.com www.sapo.pt www.anything.org)  4. the new non-related google page tab takes a lot of time to load      Even that another tabs are still loading  opening a new tab with a non-related address should load clean   and fast.        Even that google image results in tabs are loading  new tabs using non-related addresses should load   without problems. Instead  they keep &quot;Waiting for anything.com&quot; for ever    When this happens can take up to 5 minutes to new tabs  after the tabs with google image result  to load.    Closing chrome and opening www.anything.com loads without problems. It seems some connection limit   problem or something (half open limit maybe?)    Other info:  This can happen with only 2 tabs opened. It's easier to replicate when multiple tabs are opened in a   small amount of time. There are no reasons that new tabs take forever to load  waiting for website   response  since there is nothing to wait on that tab. </pre>
