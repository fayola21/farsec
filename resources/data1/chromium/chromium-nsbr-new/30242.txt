<title>Issue 30242 -   chromium -    [Leopard] Playing Multiple MP3s via HTML5 Audio Causes Crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    <a href="http://weston.ruter.net/projects/test-cases/chrome-mp3-audio-crash/">http://weston.ruter.net/projects/test-cases/chrome-mp3-audio-crash/</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Load and play multiple MP3s via HTML5 Audio (try test URL above).  2. Repeat until tab becomes unresponsive.      The tab shouldn't lock up but should continue playing audio.      After numerious MP3s have been read  the tab will stop responding. Clicking  the ��_��_��_Kill pages��_��_��_ button on the dialog box does nothing  and the browser can  only be restored after Chrome has been Force Quit. </pre>
