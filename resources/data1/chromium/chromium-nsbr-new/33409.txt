<title>Issue 33409 -   chromium -    JavaScript is unable to detect and intercept certain keyboard commands - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 on Mac (but really all versions of chrome   since October 2009)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://280slides.com/Editor">http://280slides.com/Editor</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to 280 Slides  2. Close the welcome screen  3. Press cmd-n on the keyboard        You should be prompted to create a new document in 280 Slides.        Chrome opens a new browser window.    Pursuant to the fix for <a title="Figure out how to deal with sluggish renderers blocking accelerators" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5496"> issue #5496 </a>  the relevant keystrokes were simply   blocked from ever going to the renderer. This breaks all Cappuccino   applications  and probably some of Google's own Docs apps. It is   reasonable to expect a document editing program running in a browser to   want to override common commands like N and W.    I think the resolution for #5496 is invalid  and should be replaced with a   solution that actually addresses the sluggishness issue  rather than simply   removes the feature.   </pre>
