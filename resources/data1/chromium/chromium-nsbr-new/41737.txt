<title>Issue 41737 -   chromium -    Delete Sync-Data completly/partly also from GDocs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.7 (Official Build 44408) dev    I have the problem  that some of my passwords which where - by accident -   saved in AutoFill have been saved to GDocs through the Sync.  They appear in plain text when searching GDocs now.  I can't delete the data from GDocs  because I get a message &quot;you may not   delete data from a read-only source&quot;      I need an option to delete that data now.  Disabling Sync has not worked.  Deleting all auto-fill data has not worked either.    Please provide an option to  (permanetly) delete synced data.     </pre>
