<title>Issue 26146 -   chromium -    Mac: single click in the omnibar does not select all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is like <a title="Chrome Linux single click does not select all"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26140">bug 26140</a> for the Mac.    If <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/348002">http://codereview.chromium.org/348002</a> is committed  we will use this bug   to track feedback from that change.  This is an experiment to gauge whether   or not there is any reaction to allowing the Mac omnibar to behave as normal   Mac text fields do on single-click.    If you don't like this behavior  please leave feedback here. </pre>
