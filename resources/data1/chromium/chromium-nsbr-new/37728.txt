<title>Issue 37728 -   chromium -    breakpad doesn't work within the seccomp sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. google-chrome --enable-seccomp-sandbox  2. visit about:crash    No crash dump.      Markus says it will be hard to let breakpad fiddle with signals in something   as sensitive as the seccomp sandbox.  He had this idea: we allow the renderer   to write a core file then have the browser kick off a helper that   reads/uploads data from the core file.    Lei  do you know how hard it would be to adapt breakpad to that sort of   design? </pre>
