<title>Issue 30801 -   chromium -    &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; dialog is missing an option for HTML5 storage facilities (Local Storage &amp; Web Database) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not a security bug per-se  so not filing as security.  But people are likely going to be peeved if we don't take care of this   before Mstone-4 stable.    The &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; dialog is a nice one-stop shop to permit deletion   of any and all persistent state (that could be used to track users).    No option to clear the HTML5 storage facilities seems like a serious   omission. </pre>
