<title>Issue 32258 -   chromium -    Sending keyboard/mouse input to flash or flex is goofy at first - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1    <a href="http://www.tink.ws/blog/files/flex/PositionedTabNavigatorExample.html">http://www.tink.ws/blog/files/flex/PositionedTabNavigatorExample.html</a>           Safari 4: unsure    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: unsure      1.  Load the URL above  click on a tab  2.  OR  after clicking on a tab  move the focus left/right with arrow keys   and hit the space bar to select        Tab focus changes.      This first 5 clicks or space bar presses on tabs will send 3 change events   to flex.  If you click and hold the mouse button you sill see the focus of   the tab change and then immediately revert back to the original tab   selected.  Upon letting go  the tab will change to the one you are clicking   on.  For keyboard controls  you must hit the space bar twice to get the tab   to change.  This behavior goes away after &lt; 10 clicks  so it is not the   code of the flex demo itself.     </pre>
