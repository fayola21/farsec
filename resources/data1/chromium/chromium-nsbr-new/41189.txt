<title>Issue 41189 -   chromium -    Clean up location bar in gtk mode for Mstone-5 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - Keep chrome-theme mode looking exactly like windows.  - Modify GTK mode so the omnibox popup is aligned with...anything really.   (It currently isn't visually connected with any widgets).  - Move the reload back out of the omnibox in GTK mode (keeping it attached   in chrome-theme mode). </pre>
