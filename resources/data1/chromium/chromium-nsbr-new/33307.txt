<title>Issue 33307 -   chromium -    Chrome causes multiplying zombie processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 (Official Build 35163) beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      The longer I leave Chrome running  the more of these &quot;(ps)&quot; processes I   find running.  It doesn't seem to have any relation to how many tabs I have   open  or what I'm doing in the browser.  As hours turn to days  these   processes multiply out of control  preventing launchd from forking new   processes.  When I first start up Chrome  I find ZERO of these weird ps processes:  ! ps ax | grep &quot;(ps)&quot; | wc -l  1  Now it's been a few hours   I find 3 of them:  ! ps ax | grep &quot;(ps)&quot; | wc -l  4  This morning  Chrome had been running for about 14 hours  and I found   32 of them:  ! ps ax | grep &quot;(ps)&quot; | wc -l  33  Please note  I'm subtracting one from the total returned by wc -l to account   for the grep process.  For anyone curious of what it looks like if I don't   pipe to wc -l:  ! ps ax | grep &quot;(ps)&quot;  27930   ??  Z      0:00.00 (ps)  27982   ??  Z      0:00.00 (ps)  27993   ??  Z      0:00.00 (ps)  28106 s001  S+     0:00.00 grep --color (ps)  # To print the parent process  ! ps alx | grep &quot;(ps)&quot;  0 27930 27879   0   0  0        0      0 -      Z      ??    0:00.00 (ps)  0 27982 27879   0   0  0        0      0 -      Z      ??    0:00.00 (ps)  0 27993 27879   0   0  0        0      0 -      Z      ??    0:00.00 (ps)  502 28112 25410   0  31  0  2435032    536 -      S+   s001    0:00.00 grep -  -color (ps)  # To see the parent process (pid 27879)  ! ps -xl -p 27879  UID   PID  PPID        F CPU PRI NI       SZ    RSS WCHAN     S     ADDR TTY             TIME CMD  502 27879   332     4000   0  48  0   701156 190676 -      S     adcbd20 ??           1:44.96 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google   Chrome -psn_0_6960803    You might notice that there is a big &quot;Z&quot; under where the &quot;STAT&quot; column   would be for each of these processes.  That means these are ZOMBIE   processes created by Chrome  but never killed.  From man ps:    Z    Defunct (&quot;zombie&quot;) process  terminated but not reaped by its parent.    This is the bug I created in the Google Chrome support forum:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=5f0ac59e37bd8a75&amp;hl=en   </pre>
