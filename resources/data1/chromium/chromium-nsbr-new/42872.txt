<title>Issue 42872 -   chromium -    [Geolocation] Should provide function to change location tracking/blocking settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Check &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Location&quot; -&gt; &quot;Do not allow any site...&quot;   this means user prefer to turn off location tracking for all sites by default.  2. Now access <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a> and click &quot;Show My Location&quot;  3. Click on the location tracking blocked notification icon to open the bubble      Now user wants to allow location tracking for just given site  <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a>  but in current situation user could not do it.    So  we should:  provide option like &quot;Allow this page to track your location&quot; in the bubble  or:  provide &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Edit&quot; function to Location's Exception UI.       </pre>
