<title>Issue 30903 -   chromium -    Attempt to navigate popup is silently ignored... should be logged to console as error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  WebKit	532.6  V8	2.0.3.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.6 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.266.0 Safari/532.6        1. Create an extension with a popup  2. Have the popup attempt to navigate itself with a simple HTML link or   location.href        The navigation is blocked as noted in the following linked thread:    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/44680501a83986ae?pli=1    It would be nice if an error was also logged to the console to tell the   extension dev that what he tried to do was blocked.        No error is logged and the navigation operation is just silently blocked. </pre>
