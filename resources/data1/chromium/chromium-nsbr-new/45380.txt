<title>Issue 45380 -   chromium -    Google message said extensions sync but they don't. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Extensions don't sync. I got a message saying extensions could be synced   on the startup page with the 8 homepage examples (I have a big screen I   want more than 8 homepage preview links please)  2.Synced laptop to the same account but extensions are not synced...        I just want the extensions to be the same on each computer or have a button   or something that downloads all the synced extension names/programs. Please   email me if you fix it or give a short explanation of changes/fixes when   Google Chrome automatically updates itself.    Thanks.    Glen Charles Rowell  a4jp.com          <b>Please provide
