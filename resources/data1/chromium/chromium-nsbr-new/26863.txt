<title>Issue 26863 -   chromium -    Opening many tabs causes ChromeOS to reboot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.227.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30303">r30303</a>)  ChromeOS: 0.3.20.1    Although it is unlikely that a user will have this many tabs open  this  could be a stress test to see how ChromeOS handles a low memory condition.   Does it just keep allocating until the system crashes  or does it keep  track of how much memory is available and give a warning?        1. Open multiple Chrome windows.  2. In each window open many tabs.  3. Should have at least 100 tabs open in total  more if necessary.  4. F12 to expose window chooser UI.  5. F12 to activate the window again.  6. Repeat 4 &amp; 5 a few times until OS reboots.    What is the expected output?    Window should be reactivated.    What do you see instead?    ChromeOS reboots.   </pre>
