<title>Issue 38170 -   chromium -    Check for changes before invalidating in QuickDraw plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we don't know when QuickDraw plugins have drawn  so we just   assume the entire region needs to be invalidated every 50th of a second. We   should instead check for changes  and only invalidate when necessary.    I'm not sure how much this will help with the case of actually watching  say  a   QuickTime video though; it depends on how often QuickTime actually draws.    (We should also not send the 8 invalidates per second for offscreen plugins    but that's not going to make a difference in the case that matters.) </pre>
