<title>Issue 37055 -   chromium -    Bookmark Sync: OFFLINE_UNUSABLE when using authenticated proxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.249.89 (38071)  OS             : WinXP SP3      1. use an authenticated proxy for internet connection (no direct connection)  2. activate bookmark sync: enter username + password.  Bookmarks sync correctly.  3. close chrome  4. start chrome  5. type about:sync  --&gt; OFFLINE_UNUSABLE       Bookmarks correctly synchronized      Bookmarks are not cynchronized        MORE INFO:  ----------    I've monitored network activity using WireShark www.wireshark.org  When I run Chrome it try to connect clients4.google.com and clients2.google.com but connection failed because   proxy send a http 407. But Chrome does not ask me username/password and does not send them to proxy server. So the   conenction fails.       </pre>
