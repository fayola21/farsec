<title>Issue 40065 -   chromium -    Should be able to see the longer folder names in Tabbed in Bookmark manager.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: ToT.      Right now  there is no way  user can see the complete longer folder names   in tabbed bookmark manager  until and unless user tries to edit the name.    -Have a longer folder name in BMB or other bookmarks folder.  -Go to Bookmark manager.  -Try to see the complete longer folder name.    Possible Solutions:  1. We should either provide drag-able left pane in tabbed bookmark manager.  Or  2. We should provide full name bubble on mouse hover.   </pre>
