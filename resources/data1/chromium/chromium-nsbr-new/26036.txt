<title>Issue 26036 -   chromium -    Audio and video desync during OGV playback - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-">http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-</a>  videos/2009-10-27-open-internet/open-internet.ogv  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): MP4 plays fine (embedded and   not)  OGV doesn't play (I'm missing the appropriate Quicktime codec).  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Video/audio stays in sync when   playing back the OGV  though it took roughly an eternity to start up and   playback was jerky.  Reminds me of why I switched to Chrome...  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Don't know.      1.  Visit <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=1502">http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=1502</a> or go straight to   the video at <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-videos/2009-">http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-videos/2009-</a>  10-27-open-internet/open-internet.ogv  2.  Start playback.  3.  After about a minute  if becomes very apparent that the audio is out of   sync.      Video plays back and audio remains in sync.  Note that downloading the   video and watching it using VLC works as expected.  Also  there is no issue   with the MP4 version at <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-">http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/~blizzard/weblog-</a>  videos/2009-10-27-open-internet/open-internet.mp4      Video runs ahead of the audio.  The audio sounds fine  so I'm guessing the   video is not being played back at the correct framerate. </pre>
