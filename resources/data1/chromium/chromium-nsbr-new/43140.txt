<title>Issue 43140 -   chromium -    Search shortcuts with no text do not always work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Make a &quot;search engine&quot; shortcut  e.g. 'g' searches   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%s</a>. Have no %s attached. For   instance I may alias 'g' to simply <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> and expect it   to go to google's homepage.  2. This is the uncertain stage. If I have some popular website that   also begins with 'g' (let's pretend gmail)  then sometimes pressing   &lt;ctrl&gt;+l g &lt;enter&gt; takes me to google.com  sometimes to gmail.      I want it to always take me to the aliased thing  like in firefox.      Sometimes it takes me elsewhere.    <b>Please provide
