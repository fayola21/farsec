<title>Issue 33532 -   chromium -    pack chrome upgrade/install whacks wrong reg key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Vista64.  Before beginning  clear your registry of Chrome stuff.  E.g. after running   the Chrome uninstaller (if needed) delete these keys and their subkeys:  HKLMSoftwareWow6432NodeGoogleUpdateClients{8A69D345-...  HKLMSoftwareWow6432NodeGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-...  HKLMSoftwareGoogleUpdateClients{8A69D345-...  HKLMSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-...  HKCUSoftwareWow6432NodeGoogleUpdateClients{8A69D345-...  HKCUSoftwareWow6432NodeGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-...  HKCUSoftwareGoogleUpdateClients{8A69D345-...  HKCUSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-...    Now Install Google Chrome from pack (google.com/pack).  See v3.0.x installed.  See HKLM registry keys changed.  And that's fine.  In Chrome's About box  &quot;update is needed&quot;.  Click &quot;update&quot; and it gets   upgraded to 4.x.      When upgrading  the installer/upgraded appends &quot;-full&quot; to   HKCUSoftwareGoogleUpdateClientState{8A69D345-...ap.    The system-wide pack installer/upgrader should not touch HKCU  only   HKLM.    Note it's hard to try this now since pack has (as of last night) been   upgraded to Chrome4 so you can't install an older version of Chrome via   pack anymore.  Reproducing this bug will require help from the pack team   to get older &quot;packs&quot;. </pre>
