<title>Issue 37582 -   chromium -    Some synced bookmarks appear within Google Docs' &quot;All Items&quot; view because they have not been hidden. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 (Official Build 40685) dev      1. Bookmark a page using Google Chrome  2. Visit Google Docs.        See no bookmarks in the &quot;All Items&quot; view in Google Docs. Only see bookmarks   in Google Chrome folder and Bookmarks sub-folder within Google Docs.        Some synced bookmarks appear within Google Docs' &quot;All Items&quot; view because   they have not been hidden. It appears that under normal conditions  a new   bookmark is synced to Google Docs and is automatically hidden  so that it   can only be found within the Google Chrome folder and Bookmarks sub-folder   within Google Docs. In this particular scenario  however  the bookmarks   have not been hidden  so they appear in the All Items view. They can be   manually hidden  and all is well.    Here's the catch. I have this exact same version of Google Chrome   [5.0.342.2 (Official Build 40685)] at both home and at work. When I create   a new bookmark at HOME  it works perfectly. When I create a new bookmark at   WORK  the problem occurs. I have been trying to determine what is different   between my home and work configs (extensions  command-line switches    settings  etc...) and have been unable to find the culprit so far.    The one thing that might be different is the fact that we have a firewall   at our work. Perhaps the firewall is partially blocking the communication   needed to synchronize the bookmark fully? If so  perhaps this might have a   connection to <a title="bookmark sync cannot pass firewalls"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37290">Issue 37290</a> ?   </pre>
