<title>Issue 29539 -   chromium -    Theme loading bubble is slightly off-center - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was reported as a Chromium OS bug  but I see it under Metacity as well.    The &quot;Loading...&quot; bubble that appears when changing themes is positioned a   bit to the right of center.  I think that the problem is that the window is   getting positioned before its contents have been shown  so the size in its   requisition is bogus. </pre>
