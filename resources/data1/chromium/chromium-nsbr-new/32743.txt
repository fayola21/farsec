<title>Issue 32743 -   chromium -    Fix handling of mouse events outside plugins per Cocoa NPAPI spec clarifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There were some Cocoa NPAPI spec clarifications that haven't yet made it onto the wiki; currently   they are captured in this Mozilla bug:  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525078">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525078</a>    * NPCocoaEventMouseDown - Fired when a mouse button is pressed; this gives ownership of the   eventual mouse up event to the plug-in. On release  a NPCocoaEventMouseUp event is fired  even if   the mouse is released outside the plug-in area.    * NPCocoaEventMouseUp - Fired when a mouse button is released if the original button press   happened inside the plug-in area.    * NPCocoaEventMouseMoved - Fired when the mouse is moved unless a mouse button is pressed.   Not fired when the mouse is not over the plugin instance.    * NPCocoaEventMouseEntered - Fired when the mouse enters the plug-in area unless a mouse   button is pressed. If the button went down outside of the plugin but went up over the plugin no   mouse up event is sent to the plugin but it does receive a NPCocoaEventMouseEntered event.    * NPCocoaEventMouseExited - Fired when the mouse exits the plug-in area unless a mouse button   is pressed.    * NPCocoaEventMouseDragged - Fired when the mouse is moved with a mouse button pressed. This   will fire even if the mouse is moved outside of the plug-in area.    We need to audit these and make sure we do all of them correctly; we may get most/all for free from   WebKit  which according to the bug already does this. </pre>
