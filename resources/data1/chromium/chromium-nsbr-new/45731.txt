<title>Issue 45731 -   chromium -    Looping alert box locks out tab  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. create an onfocus event on a text field that pops up an alert box  2. click into the text field to cause an alert.   3. click OK to clear the alert. the onfocus triggers again causing an alert box loop.        with process isolation i had hoped to simply close the tab but it is locked.        have to terminate with an ugly force quit.  even though this is a JS programmer error on my part i   was simply using alert to debug onfocus but i think i should be able to close the tab easily   overriding the modality of the alert? or chrome should pick up the loop as it does on other   occasions and offer to suppress further alerts.      <b>Please provide
