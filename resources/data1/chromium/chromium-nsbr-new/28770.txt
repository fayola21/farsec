<title>Issue 28770 -   chromium -    Adobe Flash Player 10 crashes intermittently on sites previous Chrome versions were OK with - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I am not sure what perpetuates the problem. I happened today  but the   last time was a month or so prior.  2. I am not sure if it is this specific version of Chrome or the version of   Flash. Prior to the 4.0 Beta upgrade  this problem never existed. I am   inclined to think this is a Chrome issue  although I filled out a bug   report with Adobe.  3. See attached screenshot...there is not 'movie' that plays. It is not a   flash-based site. However  it may be the ads? Even those are noninvasive.   It happens so infrequently  but I was waiting for it to happen again so I   can file this with the screenshot.         Flash player crashes        As a result of the crash  the tab freezes  but causes the WHOLE BROWSING   sesssion to freeze too!    This means a ctrl+alt+delete closing of Chrome and all tabs.     <b>Please provide
