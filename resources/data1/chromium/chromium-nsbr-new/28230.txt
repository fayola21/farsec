<title>Issue 28230 -   chromium -    Cannot Alt+Tab to a window that's showing a JavaScript alert - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab.  2. Type 'javascript:alert('hello')' in address bar.  3. Without closing the alert box  switch to a different window.  4. Now  you cannot switch back to the window with alert box using Alt+Tab   key.  Only way to switch to that window is to use the mouse.      Alt+Tab should take me to a Chrome window without regard of whether an   alert box is showing or not.      Cannot switch to the window with an alert with Alt+Tab.    <b>Please provide
