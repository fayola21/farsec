<title>Issue 24095 -   chromium -    XKB redirection causes multiple key events - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.7 (Developer Build 28103)        Firefox 3.5: FAIL  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=500674">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=500674</a>      0. setxkbmap -print  # so the current configuration can later be restored    1. cd /path/to/xkb/configuration # likely /usr/share/X11/xkb  2. patch -p5 --backup &lt; us-redirect.2.diff  3. setxkbmap -layout us  4. start chromium  load a page with a text area  4.1 enter some text  move around with &quot;C-j&quot;-&gt;&quot;left&quot; and &quot;C-l&quot;-&gt;&quot;right&quot;  4.2 enter a j  k or l -&gt; char is insert  but some other actions occurs also    5. setxkbmap -layout &quot;the one from above&quot;        Pressing &lt;char&gt; when Control-&lt;char&gt; is redirected (using xkb) to some other  key should just insert &lt;char&gt; and not in addition call whatever function is  bound to Control-&lt;char&gt;.        Pressing &lt;char&gt; when Control-&lt;char&gt; is redirected inserts &lt;char&gt; but also  performs the function bound to Control-&lt;char&gt;.      In X11 using the X keyboard extension (xkb) it is possible to redirect one  key to another. For example I have redirected &quot;Control+j&quot; to &quot;left&quot;   &quot;Control+l&quot; to &quot;right&quot; and likewise other keys.    So when I press &quot;j&quot; while control is pressed this is supposed to redirect  to another key and release all modifier state before doing so. So all  applications should see/handle is the resulting &quot;left&quot; without a modifier  set. This works correctly in Chromium; when I press Control+j the cursor  moves left.    However if I press just &quot;j&quot; in a text area &quot;j&quot; is inserted but then  chrome://downloads/ is also opened (what C-j) is supposed to do. In the  address bar pressing &quot;j&quot; behaves as expected.    This is rather strange  while one might expect &quot;C-j&quot; not to correctly be  redirected to &quot;j&quot; one would not expect &quot;j&quot; to cause any problems. The only  other application (firefox - what bad luck) I could find that is not able  to handle redirected keys  only misbehaves in case of &quot;C-j&quot;-&gt;&quot;left&quot; not &quot;j&quot;.    Ps: Unless this is going to be fixed quickly  please tell me where the  bindings for C-j  C-l ... are made in the source  so that I can comment  them out as a workaround. Thx. </pre>
