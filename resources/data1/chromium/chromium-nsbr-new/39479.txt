<title>Issue 39479 -   chromium -    [Native translator] Request: Add UI (a Page menu option?) to show the translation bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chrome 4.1.249.1042  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://google.co.jp/">http://google.co.jp/</a>      1. Go to a page where the translation bar does not self-activate (like   <a href="http://google.co.jp/">http://google.co.jp/</a>)  2. or if you've disabled translation for a language  and you need to see   the translation bar again  3. Notice there are no menu items or other obvious ways to call up the   translation bar after it has closed      Some way of &quot;calling out&quot; the translation bar.      (No known workaround?) </pre>
