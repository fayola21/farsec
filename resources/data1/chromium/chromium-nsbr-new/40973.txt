<title>Issue 40973 -   chromium -    Search text available outside of Incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Splitting off the Mac version of <a title="Search text available outside of Incognito mode" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32021"> Issue 32021 </a>.  Things will be a little harder on the Mac because of   the find pasteboard      1. Open non incognito window  2. Open an incognito window  cmd + F  enter search text  close incognito   window  3. In non incognito window  cmd + F    What is the expected result?  Search field does no contain text of Incognito search text    What happens instead?  The search text I typed into the Incognito window is also in the non   Incognito window which means Private information was leaked out of   Incognito.   </pre>
