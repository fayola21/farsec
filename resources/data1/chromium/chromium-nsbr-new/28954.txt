<title>Issue 28954 -   chromium -    Very slow scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.starcraft2.com/faq.xml">http://www.starcraft2.com/faq.xml</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Great      1. Go to <a href="http://www.starcraft2.com/faq.xml">http://www.starcraft2.com/faq.xml</a>  2. Scroll using the trackpad.        Scrolling should happen with more than 0.5 fps.        Scrolling happens at around 0.5 fps.    This is on a 17'' MBP 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 duo  4 GB ram. Scrolling is   smooth in Safari.    My gut feeling says the flash plugin is to blame. </pre>
