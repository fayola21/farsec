<title>Issue 40930 -   chromium -    Nowhere to start dragging the page reference(?) since replacing the favicon by refresh button. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Try an older build with favicon left of the url.  2.Drag from the favicon  either on:  2a: the desktop (nautilus)  2b: the panel (gnome-panel)  2c: the bookmark bar.      Some Freedesktop drag and drop protocol allows the receiver (I think) to   treat the URL as it wants.   In this case:      if using nautilus  it will create a .desktop file linking to the URL.      if using gnome-panel  creates a launcher to the URL.      if dropping on the bookmarks bar  marks the page.      There is nowhere to start such a drag action anymore  except from an   already bookmarked page on the bookmarks bar. Since I used to drag pages to   the bookmarks bar  I can't easily drag references anymore!    <b>Please provide
