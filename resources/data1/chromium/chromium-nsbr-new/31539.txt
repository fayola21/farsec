<title>Issue 31539 -   chromium -    libflashplayer.so  64-bit  version 10.0.42.34 causes crashes on SOME (most) flash content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install libflashplayer.so version 10.0.42.34 (64-bit) into   /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ (and /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/ for opera)   and remove the npwrapper version for 32-bit emulation  if installed.  2. Verify that the plugin is active and the sole flashplayer plugin by   visiting &quot;about:plugins&quot; in Chrome and Firefox  and &quot;Tools--&gt;Advanced--  &gt;Plug-Ins&quot; in Opera.  3. Attempt to load  in Google Chrome     &quot;<a href="http://www.intellicast.com/Local/WxMap.aspx">http://www.intellicast.com/Local/WxMap.aspx</a>&quot; or several other sites with   embedded flash  like Google Maps Street View.      The page loads and the Flash content is displayed as normal.      I get the &quot;unhappy puzzle&quot; icon on the page accompanied by the message &quot;The   following plug-in   has crashed: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so&quot;.  Verification yields that the same actions in Firefox and Opera both produce   the expected results  but Chrome crashes.    <b>Please provide
