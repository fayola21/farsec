<title>Issue 28602 -   chromium -    Environment variables are no longer set for child processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The change in <a title="Worker processes can be left in a zombie state" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27935"> bug 27935 </a> causes environment variables to be lost before they are set for child   processes. I'm not sure if Linux used this  but on the Mac it means that our plugin interpose library   isn't loaded  which means lots of important plugin window handling code never runs.    This regresses a number of beta-blocker plugin bugs. I would strongly recommend this be   ReleaseBlock-Dev in addition to beta. </pre>
