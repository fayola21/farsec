<title>Issue 38856 -   chromium -    The 'extension has been disabled' infobar incorrectly shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load any unpacked extension  foo  2. Install any other extension  bar  normally  3. Disable the bar extension  4. Restart Chrome        Should see Chrome start without any infobars.    Instead  see the infobar &quot;Extension bar has been disabled because it requested more   permissions&quot;.    This is a regression since the addition of the 'remember unpacked extensions across restart'   feature. This only happens when an extension is loaded unpacked because in that case  we end   up running extension startup code after the browser window has been shown. Typically  we finish   extension statup before the first browser window. So even though we do send this notification    nobody receives it. </pre>
