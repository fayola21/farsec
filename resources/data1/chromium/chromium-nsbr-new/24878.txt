<title>Issue 24878 -   chromium -    Command-W beeps at me instead of closing my tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have some tabs  2. Want to have fewer tabs  3. Command-W      I expect a tab to close when I press command-W.  Instead  I get beeped at.    Sometimes  when I press command-T and then quickly press command-W   while the new tab is springing  I get beeped at.  If I open a whole bunch of   tabs and then hold down command-W  I'll get beeped at for sure.    This may be because of the gymnastics that we go through to switch   command-W between close-tab and close-window  but I see this when I   have a boatload of tabs open  so nothing should be changing the   command-W binding.    This may also be because of something new we're doing with offering   these commands to the renderer.    I don't think that this used to suck as badly as it does now  so maybe   there's something to the renderer theory.      Trunk <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29077">r29077</a> </pre>
