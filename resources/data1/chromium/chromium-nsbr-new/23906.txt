<title>Issue 23906 -   chromium -    DCHECKs in gaia_authenticator.cc(416) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I just opened up chromium and went to gmail  and got a dcheck in   gaia_authenticator.cc(416). Looks like it came out of a call to   GaiaAuthenticator::SetUsername  DCHECK_EQ(MessageLoop::current()    message_loop_); -- 00000000 vs CDCDCDCD.    Trying to reproduce and get a crash dump that I can upload. </pre>
