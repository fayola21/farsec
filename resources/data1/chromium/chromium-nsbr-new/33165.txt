<title>Issue 33165 -   chromium -    Check deps not functioning correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/545148">http://codereview.chromium.org/545148</a>  and its corresponding commit  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=36997">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=36997</a>    The try job went green but the commit triggered a check deps failure.  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20XP/builds/9866/steps/check%20deps/log">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20XP/builds/9866/steps/check%20deps/log</a>  s/stdio    ---    Using base directory: C:bslavechromium-rel-xpbuildsrc  Checking: C:bslavechromium-rel-xpbuildsrc  ERROR in C:/b/slave/chromium-rel-xp/build/srcbasethird_partysymbolizesymbolize.cc  Illegal include: &quot;glog/raw_logging.h&quot;      Because of no rule applying    ERROR in C:/b/slave/chromium-rel-xp/build/srcbasethird_partysymbolizesymbolize.h  Illegal include: &quot;glog/logging.h&quot;      Because of no rule applying      FAILED    ---    In fact  the check deps shouldn't have triggered on Windows at all since the code is not included on   Windows. It should have triggered on Linux  which it didn't on the try job. In any case  the failure   was real. </pre>
