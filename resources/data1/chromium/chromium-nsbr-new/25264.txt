<title>Issue 25264 -   chromium -    Mouse scrolling also passes thru to underlying window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): safari does not do it.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): firefox does not do it.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. open a finder window or other browser/app that has scrollbars and   enough content to scroll.  2. open chrome on top so the underlying app is only partly covered and   scrolling action in there would be visible  3. open a page in chrome that can be scrolled and move mouse into an   area in chrome which would be in the underlying window as well and scroll.  4. now move into chrome window area outside of the underlying window.      Chrome scrolls and underlying window stays put.      Chrome scrolls and underlying window scrolls as well. </pre>
