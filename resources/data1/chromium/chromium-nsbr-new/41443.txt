<title>Issue 41443 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar triggers on Ctrl+Shift+B  should instead trigger on Ctrl+B - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev    Since recently  the keyboard shortcut for bookmark bar triggering was switched from   Ctrl+Shift+B to Ctrl+B  per <a title="Change bookmarks bookmark and manager keyboard shortcuts" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40565"> Issue 40565 </a>.    The reasoning was &quot;Since this is a commonly-used keyboard shortcut in text areas&quot;.   But in fact  it seems to be no data supporting this claim; this shortcut has no   meaning in text areas.    For the bookmark bar triggering  which is operation that some users need to do   quite often  crude ctrl+shift+b shortcut is painful and uncommon.    For comparison  IE uses Ctrl+B for &quot;Organize favorites&quot;. </pre>
