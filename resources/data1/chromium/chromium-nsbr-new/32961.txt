Opens more blank tabs until tab-header-size is smaller than normal   (width equals half for better recognization)  3. Click mouse's mid-button on 3 tabs in the middle of tab-row to close   them. Do not move mouse to outsize of tab row  4. Tabs' width is maintained (this is what I expect)  5. Click a tab to move it to another place  6. Tabs' width is changed  even I do not move mouse to outsize of tab row  (this is what I do not expect)      Tab width is maintained until I release the mouse button or move mouse   outsize tab-bar.      Tab width is maintained. So I can arrange tabs easier.    <b>Please provide
