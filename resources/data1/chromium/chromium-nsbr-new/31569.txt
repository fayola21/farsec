<title>Issue 31569 -   chromium -    Cannot drag and drop text into the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.7 (Build 9J3050)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.288.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35427">r35427</a>  Release    QuickTime Player: 7.6.2    Flash Player: 10.0.22.87      1. Select text (a sentence) from a pdf or text file.  2. Drag it onto the omnibox of a NTP.    Result:  Chrome does not allow us to drag the text into the omnibox. But it does   show the &quot;+&quot; sign when the mouse hovers over the omnibox.    We should either allow the user to copy sentences to omnibox for search   or shouldn't show the &quot;+&quot; sign.   </pre>
