<title>Issue 28649 -   chromium -    need a way to clear blocked popup site list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's currently no way to do this from the UI.  For privacy reasons    would be nice if the user could delete this site list somehow.    Maybe we can somehow hook it to clearing all history (from the everything   time period)?    Alternately  it sounds like Firefox has a &quot;Site Preferences&quot; check box in   their Clear Recent History... dialog.  Maybe we should have something like   that as well (they split data out amount things related to time and not   related to time and put this in the not related to time bucket).    This would also be a good place to put things like the site zoom hosts that   pkasting is adding.   </pre>
