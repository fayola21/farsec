<title>Issue 23713 -   chromium -    Asynchronous destruction of plugin instance if it's the last one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This seems very wrong.    Because of how WebPluginDelegateStub deletes the WebPluginDelegate  if it's   inside a call this is done using a non-nestable task.  While this avoids   deleting objects in use  it means that when NPP_Destroy is called the   renderer side objects are gone.  If it's the last instance to that renderer    the pluginchannel itself is gone as well.  This means any scripting will   fail! </pre>
