<title>Issue 41620 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar disappears from open tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.379.0 (Developer Build 44646)  WebKit: 533.5  OS: Chrome  0.7.39.0 (continuous build 366fe8bb - Builder: 273)      1. Boot chromeos  log in.  2. New Tab page shows bookmarks bar  all others do not          I want ctrl-b to toggle the bookmarks bar like it used to. That's very  handy  and means I don't have to go poking buttons or pulldowns or opening  new tabs just to navigate to a new place.          No bookmarks bar. ctrl-b does nothing. no options to enable it.     </pre>
