<title>Issue 28107 -   chromium -    Mac: bad z-order (mismatched with focus) when used with Spaces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open two Chrom{e ium} browser windows  preferably in a single space   without other windows. Navigate to something different in one so you can   distinguish the two. It may (or may not) help to focus the omnibox.   Remember which one is focused and is on top.  2. Switch to another space that has an open application (Safari will do; the   particular application may matter). I always switch spaces using the   keyboard  but I don't know if that makes a difference. Click on that   application window.  3. Switch back to the space with your Chrom{e ium} windows.  4. Possibly repeat steps 2 and 3.      At step 3  one hopes that the window one had focused regains focus and is   on top. It always seems to regain focus (i.e.  key)  but sometimes it's not on   top. It occurs very often under certain circumstances  but sometimes not at   all  so it can be slightly painful to reproduce. It's had this issue for a while.    This is driving me nuts  since it leads me to close/open tabs in the wrong   window (e.g.  Cmd-W ... why didn't that do anything? ... try again ... and   again ... oops  see a background window disappear). </pre>
