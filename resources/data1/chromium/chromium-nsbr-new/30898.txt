<title>Issue 30898 -   chromium -    typing quickly into location/URL bar results in missing (possibly rewritten) letters - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. install chrome  POSSIBLY (may not be required) install Compiz  POSSIBLY   have a small history of 100-ish sites  2. type something very fast into URL bar      That the URL bar contains what you type. Like normal.      Random letters go missing. It might even be the case that the autosuggest   is overwriting things  e.g. typing:&quot;same..&quot; -&gt; &quot;sun..&quot;  but I have not been   able to reproduce that one. All I could reproduce was letters being omitted   due to some type of lag. The drop-down suggestion menu would periodically   flicker in and out as if it was being reset constantly as one typed.    <b>Please provide
