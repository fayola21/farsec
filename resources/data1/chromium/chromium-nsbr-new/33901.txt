<title>Issue 33901 -   chromium -    New tab page tiles zoom bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Official Build 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : new tab  lol :)  Other browsers tested: Chrome related only      1. Open new tab  2. Zoom page a few times  3. Try to zoom it to normal state        I've expected that page tiles (page previews) will go back to normal state   and will looks like in initial state when new tab is just opened.        Page tiles (page previews) sticks together or have a different sizes and   can be over each other  sometimes I can see a horizontal page scroll up to   2000 pixels maybe.    screenshot: <a href="http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/2589/chrome40bug.png">http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/2589/chrome40bug.png</a>  how to reproduce video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nv5XJf4wLk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nv5XJf4wLk</a>   </pre>
