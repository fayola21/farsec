<title>Issue 27399 -   chromium -    Update default extension icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Cole has provided us with a lovely new default extension icon which better   represents lack-of-icon-ness.    This is only meant to be used in the install (and uninstall) dialog  and in   the entries in the manage UI. It shouldn't be used for the header graphic on   the manage UI.   </pre>
