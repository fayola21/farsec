<title>Issue 42274 -   chromium -    Position caret not updated correctly when replaying audio clip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Tested on Vista x64 with Chrome 5.0.375.9)    Visit   <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull.og">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull.og</a>  g   play clip.    Now drag the position caret back to about 60% of the way through.  Hit   play.  The clip end plays  but the caret does not move.    If you then hit pause  then play  the caret jumps to the end.    (Side note: It would be nice if  after playing to completion  the seek   point jumped back to the clip start and the pause button reverted to a play   button.) </pre>
