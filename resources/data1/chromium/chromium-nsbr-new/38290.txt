<title>Issue 38290 -   chromium -    Annoying &quot;Back to Safety&quot; page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you go to website where the certificate doesn't match  you get a page that   looks something like this: <a href="https://adeelejaz.com/">https://adeelejaz.com/</a>    The problem is  it gives you this every single time which gets really   annoying if its a like cPanel  Plesk  or phpMyAdmin login.    Firefox has a really nice way of dealing with it where the user can mark it   as safe and everyone lives happily ever after. </pre>
