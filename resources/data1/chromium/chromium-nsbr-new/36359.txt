<title>Issue 36359 -   chromium -    Better management of Incognito downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Downloads in Incognito mode are shown in the download bar but not the downloads page..how about showing   them in both the downloads bar and page along with previous downloads (fron non-incognito) as to not   confuse people when they click &quot;Show all downloads...&quot; or go directly to the downloads page and see a   blank page or a page with previous downloads only  or when the downloads eventually pile up and you need   to access a download which you can not see on the downloads bar.    Solution: Remove them from the downloads page (only the incognito downloads) when they leave incognito   mode as is already done with the download bar. </pre>
