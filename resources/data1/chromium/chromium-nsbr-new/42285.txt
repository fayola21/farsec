<title>Issue 42285 -   chromium -    Buffered state wrong for video element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1059 (Official Build 44723)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?">http://www.youtube.com/watch?</a>  v=R74G9BqyLJo&amp;html5=True           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Go to any HTML5 video on YouTube you haven't seen before  2. Buffer shows full immediately when playback starts    If you probe this in Javascript  the video element always returns a full   buffer from videoElement_.buffered.end(0)    Even weirder  to me  is that if you look in the Resource view in Developer   tools  it always shows a 0ms load for the video regardless of whether you   have watched it before.    This makes implementing the player in HTML5 challenging  especially trying   to do advanced techniques with buffering (which we need). Safari handles   this correctly.    This happens in all versions of Chrome I have tested - Mac/Linux/Windows    both Chrome 4 and Chrome 5.   </pre>
