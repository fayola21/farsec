<title>Issue 43207 -   chromium -    Stop running ps for our own processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I added some logging to a Chrome build from the 375 branch at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46224">r46224</a> to help diagnose the   zombie problem. One of the things I��_��_��_m logging is the command line of each child process we   execute.    I was surprised to find that we periodically run ps  with command lines of this sort:    /bin/ps -o pid= ppid= ruid= uid= rss= vsz= comm= -p 88574 -p 88833 -p 88589 -p 88588 -  p 88587 -p 88586    Each of those pids are our own. Observe:    mark@rj bash$ ps -opid ppid comm | grep 88574 | cut -c 1-80  88574 55001 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome  88586 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch  88587 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch  88588 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch  88589 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch  88833 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch  89175 88574 /Users/mark/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.375.34/Google Ch    I thought (and Trung says he did too) that we were no longer supposed to be running ps for our   own processes  but the above makes it clear that we are. We should stop. What gives?    Note: I��_��_��_m not using the task manager or doing anything special  just surfing around to try to   collect some zombies. </pre>
