<title>Issue 23573 -   chromium -    Tooltips are treated as distinct windows for the purposes of Expos��_��_ ��_��_��_Show Desktop��_��_��_ (F11) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a tooltip.  For example  go to Gmail and hover over the ��_��_��_Inbox��_��_��_ link   near the top left.  2. Press F11 or do whatever you need to do to actuate Expos��_��_'s ��_��_��_Show   Desktop��_��_��_ feature.      Expect: not what happens  Observe: the tooltip is treated as a separate window.    It can look kind of weird especially when the tooltip window gets slurped   to a different edge of the screen  as is the case when the Inbox link is on   the left but you've got a narrower browser window towards the right of the   screen.      4.0.212.1    This is probably low-priority so I'm starting it out at Pri-3. </pre>
