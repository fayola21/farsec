<title>Issue 28912 -   chromium -    Uninitialized variable in WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::applyProperty()? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Valgrinding the nightly Chromium Windows build from  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/</a>  and visiting just one trivial web page  yielded  among others  the valgrind warning    Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)     at WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::checkForGenericFamilyChange  (cssstyleselector.cpp:5770)     by WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::updateFont (cssstyleselector.cpp:1665)     by WebCore::Node::styleForRenderer (node.cpp:1408)     by WebCore::Node::createRendererIfNeeded (node.cpp:1385)     by WebCore::Element::attach (element.cpp:735)     by WebCore::Element::recalcStyle (element.cpp:876)     by WebCore::Document::recalcStyle (document.cpp:1289)     by WebCore::Document::updateStyleSelector (document.cpp:2400)     by WebCore::CachedCSSStyleSheet::checkNotify (cachedcssstylesheet.cpp:115)     by WebCore::CachedCSSStyleSheet::data (cachedcssstylesheet.cpp:103)     by WebCore::Loader::Host::didFinishLoading (loader.cpp:367)     by WebCore::SubresourceLoader::didFinishLoading (subresourceloader.cpp:184)   Uninitialised value was created by a stack allocation     at WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::applyProperty (cssstyleselector.cpp:2926)    This and other errors related to uninitialised stack from applyProperty  were the bulk of the warnings.    I'm not so sure about those line numbers  but  CSSStyleSelector::applyProperty() is a monster long  function with a not-obviously-initialized local variable 'l'.  Could well be it's used without being initialized...    fwiw  the commands I used  after following the tips in  <a href="http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/valgrind/doc/win32.html">http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/valgrind/doc/win32.html</a>  were:    svn checkout <a href="http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</a> winezeug  cd winezeug  cat valgrind/valgrind-suppressions  testsuites/chromium/chromium-valgrind-suppressions &gt; ../supp.txt  cd ..  wget  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/chrome-win32.zip">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/chrome-win32.zip</a>  unzip chrome-win32.zip  wget  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/chrome-win32-syms.zip">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/33231/chrome-win32-syms.zip</a>  unzip chrome-win32-syms.zip  cd chrome-win32  mv ../chrome-win32-syms/chrome_dll.pdb chrome.pdb  /usr/local/valgrind-for-wine/bin/valgrind --trace-children=yes  --track-origins=yes  --workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes  --suppressions=../supp.txt --leak-check=full --show-possible=no  ~/wine-git/wine chrome --no-sandbox <a href="http://zilf.org">http://zilf.org</a> &gt; log.txt 2&gt;&amp;1    I then waited for zilf.org to show up  hit refresh a few times  and quit.     </pre>
