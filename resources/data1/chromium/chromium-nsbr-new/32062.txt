<title>Issue 32062 -   chromium -    Chrome ignores GTK configuration file for menu keybindings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I received this bug report from Ian Macdonald  who would like to be able to edit the GTK menu   keybindings. At first sight  this seems a reasonable request  as it appears to be a standard   GTK feature. But I don't know whether this would even be possible in our code  as keybindings   need to be managed for both the UI and for JavaScript. In any case  I figured I'd create a bug   so that we can track the request.    &gt; In the case of Linux Chrome  Google wouldn't even have needed to add  &gt; any clutter to the UI. Chrome is a GTK app and the standard mechanism  &gt; for configuring those is by adding keybindings to a text file in the  &gt; user's home directory.  &gt;   &gt; All Google needed to do was process that file  if it exists. In fact   &gt; Chrome does appear to read it  but it ignores the content.   </pre>
