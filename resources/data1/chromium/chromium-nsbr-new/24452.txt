<title>Issue 24452 -   chromium -    'Always on Visible Workspace' reverts after some time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.220.1 (Official Build 27713)  OS + version : Goobuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit  window manager : Metacity      1. Open chrome  2. Select 'Always on Visible Workspace' on the System Menu  3. ??? The trigger here is unknown but it seems to be related to being away from my computer for a while.  See   below for what I've tried to narrow it down.  4. Open system menu and see Always on Visible Workspace is no longer selected.      Always on Visible Workspace should stay selected as long as that Chrome window remains open.      Something is reverting the Always on Visible Workspace setting.    This has been happening to me for a while and unfortunately I haven't been able to nail down exactly when it   occurs.  I always seem to notice it after being away from the machine for a while.  Here are some experiments I did:  - Lock/Unlock the screen.  No Problem.  - Set screensaver to 1 min and monitor power to 2 min.  Wait for both to trigger.  Unlock.  No Problem.    So I still don't know what is causing it but I'm out of ideas on how to narrow it down so I thought I'll file a   bug.  If I find a more specific cause  I'll update this bug. </pre>
