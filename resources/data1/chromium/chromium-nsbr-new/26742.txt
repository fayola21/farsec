<title>Issue 26742 -   chromium -    [Mac] After closing last tab  new window will open with that same URL instead of NNTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0. Configure prefs to show new-tab page  and to reopen tabs on launch.  1. Make sure there is only one window with one tab open  on some URL   (say  www.google.com.)  2.Close Tab (Cmd-W)  3.New Window (Cmd-N)    Result: New window opens with the same URL as that last tab I closed   (www.google.com)  Expected: New window opens with new-tab page    The behavior when opening a new window is inconsistent depending on   context.   * If there are any other windows open  opening a new window shows the   new-tab page (or whatever else I've set for new tabs in prefs.)   * But if there were no windows open previously  the new window shows the   last previously-closed tab.    I suspect this is a Windows-ism  since IIRC that platform doesn't really have   a notion of an app that's running but has no windows open; so Chrome   might be treating this state the same way as if the app had quit  and thus   doing its &quot;restore after quit&quot; when the next window opens.    I think this is the wrong thing to do on Mac; especially since it could lead to   embarrassing situations. For instance  you open a new window to show   your boss your project  but what comes up in the window is the NSFW   webcomic you were looking at during lunch... </pre>
