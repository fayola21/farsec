From brian@chromium.org:  When users see a crash  we don't offer them much in the way of potential   solutions. While we can't give them specific helpful instructions  there are   some general things we can tell them. This article is a good start:   <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95669">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95669</a>    Add a &quot;Learn more&quot; link to the end of the text on the Aw Snap page linking to   the article above.    From beng@chromium.org:  Sounds good. Center link under existing paragraph.   </pre>
