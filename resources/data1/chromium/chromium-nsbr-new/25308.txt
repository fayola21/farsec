<title>Issue 25308 -   chromium -    Pinned tabs should throb if title of page changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If script changes the title of a pinned tab and the tab is not selected  we   should throb the tab so the user knows something is happening in the tab.   This is especially useful for chats in gmail.    I'm going to initially do this for linux  depending upon how well we like it   we'll then need to implement it on all platforms. </pre>
