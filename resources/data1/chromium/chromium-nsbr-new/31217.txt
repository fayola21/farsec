<title>Issue 31217 -   chromium -    Scramble extension doesn't work for non-English text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0��_��_��_  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a>      1. Go to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a>  2. Choose the &quot;Scramble by thakis@chromium.org&quot; extension.  3. Install the extension &amp; then try to use it on a page containing non-  English text.    The result:  Text scrambling won't take place.    Since the extension was most likely intended for English text only    perhaps we should add a disclaimer to its download page to make the users   aware of this. </pre>
