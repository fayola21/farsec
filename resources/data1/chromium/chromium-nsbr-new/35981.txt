<title>Issue 35981 -   chromium -    Crashed plug-in notification must be dismissed repeatedly (in every single tab the plug-in was used) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071) unknown  URLs (if applicable) : Any with Flash plug-in content      1. Go to web page with Flash (YouTube or Hulu videos work great)  2. Open new tab and go to web page with Flash in new tab  3. Repeat step 2 a few more times  4. Open Chrome's task manager  5. Kill Flash plugin  6. Dismiss yellow &quot;The following plug-in has crashed: Shockwave Flash&quot;   notification at top of web page  7. Switch to another tab that had Flash content in it and dismiss the   yellow notification there as well  8. Repeat step 7 a few more times      When I dismiss the yellow notification  it should dismiss it for all tabs    not just one.  An example of good behavior is that when I download files    they appear in a strip at the bottom of the web page.  If I close that   strip  it closes it for all tabs.      I have to dismiss the notification in each and every tab I was running the   plug-in that crashed in  which is repetitive and annoying. </pre>
