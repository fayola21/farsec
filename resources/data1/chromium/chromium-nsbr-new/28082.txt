<title>Issue 28082 -   chromium -    Drag and drop of file from Nautilus gets the wrong path - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Drag a file into imgur.com for upload  2. Click upload  3. Get an error about an invalid path    Browsing for the same file works.    From clicking around with files in multiple directories and the file picker   dialog  it seems maybe we're adding the files without a full path. </pre>
