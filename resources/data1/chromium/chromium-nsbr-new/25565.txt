<title>Issue 25565 -   chromium -    Official builders cannot run tests for two builds in parallel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The linux official and linux 64 official builds running at the same time   cause tests to fail:  - layout tests contend over the HTTP port  - page cyclers and ui tests contend over the Xvfb address.    Also  we can't rely on the perf numbers from the perf tests if they're   running in parallel.  Tony suggests adding a lock. </pre>
