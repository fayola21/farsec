<title>Issue 24800 -   chromium -    Open window with features shut off causes URL bar and bookmark bar to appear  bookmark bar to float in the center - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a page with a link containing a javascript window.open()   command  setting all features to 0 [ example: onclick=&quot;window.open(   'http://www.google.com' 'testWindow'    'status=0 toolbar=0 location=0 menubar=0' );&quot; ]  2. Click the link  3. A window will appear with a URL entry field and a bookmark bar. The   View menu will have a greyed out option for Always Show Bookmark Bar.   Resizing the window will cause the bookmark bar to float around the   window  aligning in the vertical center.      With all the features off  most web developers are assuming that they have   control of the entire contents of the window  so I'd expect nothing else in   that window. If a URL field and a bookmark bar is going to end up there    the vertical dimension should extend by the height of the two views  and   the bookmark bar should definitely not float around. :)      A window appears with a URL bar and a bookmark bar  and the bookmark   bar moves around with a resized window.    <b>Please provide
