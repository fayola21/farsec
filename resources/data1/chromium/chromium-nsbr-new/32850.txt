<title>Issue 32850 -   chromium -    add a flag to 'grit' to suppress warnings about fallback to English - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> grit has a flag to fall back to English ('fallback_to_english')  but it still   emits a warning about missing entries.     There are some strings (locale_settings) we don't add to per-locale xtb files   on purpose because we just want to use the same values as English Chrome.     These should not clutter up the build log and should be distinguished from   missing translations.     See <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/545132">http://codereview.chromium.org/545132</a> for examples.      </pre>
