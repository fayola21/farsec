<title>Issue 31524 -   chromium -    Refactor MemoryDetails to be able to do less to generate histograms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MemoryDetails is used in MetricsMemoryDetails/MetricsService (see   chrome/browser/metrics/metrics_service.cc) to collect information about   Chrome/Chromium processes. In doing so  it unnecessarily collects other   information (about other browsers).    Currently  on Mac  collecting information requires running 'ps'. As part of   work on <a title="The Task Manager is not implemented" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13156"> issue 13156 </a>  it will no longer be necessary to do so when collecting   information about the browser's own processes. To take advantage of this   requires some refactoring. </pre>
