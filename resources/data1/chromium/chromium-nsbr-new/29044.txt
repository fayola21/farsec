<title>Issue 29044 -   chromium -    Stable release source tarballs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When Chrome hits beta (or when it hits stable)  versioned source tarballs  will ensure that distributions have a predictable  stable target for  generating builds.     These versioned releases also provide a base for minor releases  such as  critical bug fixes or security patches. Major new features or API breaks  should not happen in minor releases.    These source tarballs should not contain prebuilt binaries  or at least  a  tarball should be generated that does not contain prebuilt binaries  and  should be clearly marked as &quot;source-only&quot;.    This is an issue for the distro metabug  28287. </pre>
