<title>Issue 31031 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame in IE full tab mode does not render pages if Ad block pro is installed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I only tested this with IE6 with AdBlock Pro installed.    Set OptinUrls to * and try to navigate to yahoo.com. Observe a blank  page. Same result with meebo.com  which actually sends in the X-UA compatible  header for Chrome.     </pre>
