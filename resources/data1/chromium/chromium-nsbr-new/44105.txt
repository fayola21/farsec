<title>Issue 44105 -   chromium -    CVC is shown in plain text in AutoFill options dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.404.0 (Developer Build 47168)    CVC in AutoFill should be removed or obfuscated.    Since the CVC must not be stored anywhere -even if it is encrypted-  (according to EMV  Visa and others)  I do not see any necessity storing it   in any browser at all. The point of the CVC is  that the card holder proves   he owns the credit card physically at time of the purchase. By storing the   CVC in the browser the purpose of the CVC will be completely nullified.      1. Open the &quot;Options&quot; dialog  2. Select the &quot;Personal Stuff&quot; tab  3. Click &quot;Change AutoFill settings&quot;  4. See the CVC in plain text      The CVC should not be stored not at all or should be obfuscated by   asterisks.      The CVC is shown in plain text. </pre>
