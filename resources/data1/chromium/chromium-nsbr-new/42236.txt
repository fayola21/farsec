<title>Issue 42236 -   chromium -    chrome_url_overrides is broken. No extension APIs are available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Load bookmark manager or an extension that overrides the NTP  for example:   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncdfeghkpohnalmpblddmnppfooljek">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncdfeghkpohnalmpblddmnppfooljek</a>  h?hl=en-US    What is the expected output?     Bookmark manager should work and the NTP override extension should work    What do you see instead?    The extension APIs are not available so neither work.    I don't know what caused this yet but I'm downloading nightlies to identify   where the breakage was introduced. </pre>
