<title>Issue 43514 -   chromium -    Please move bookmark &quot;Star&quot; icon from right to left of omnibox! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev  WebKit	533.8  V8	2.2.7  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/533.8 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.396.0 Safari/533.8    Just updated to the latest dev build  bookmark Star icon should be in the   left of omnibox  since there're already several extension icons in the right.   When in the left  it's simple and easy to find and use; but in the right  it's   confusing with other extension icons. So easily to click other icons when   you just wonna bookmark this page. So please restore it to the left side.    BTW  new theme looks pretty well. </pre>
