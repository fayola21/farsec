<title>Issue 26848 -   chromium -    Video tag should scale to match window size when in playback page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open a supported video element via omnibox  link  etc...    Shrink the window size down (or play a really large res video).    The video should scale appropriately (maintaining aspect ratio!) such that   the entire video + controls are always visible. </pre>
