<title>Issue 31351 -   chromium -    Chrome is no handling properly the Javascript &quot;Are you sure you want to leave the page&quot; type of alert used on meebo.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.meebo.com">http://www.meebo.com</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. Open a tab to meebo.com  2. Log in  3. Try to quit Chrome.  4. A JS popup appears. Click on Stay on the page    Chrome is now in a strange state:  If you try to quit Chrome  it's not working.  If you open a new tab and try to close the tab  Chrome is going to try to close the meebo tab instead (JS Pop-Up ...) If you click on &quot;Leave the page&quot;  Chrome   exits (no crash) instead of closing the current tab.    I'm not convinced if this issue is only on meebo.com.  It might be affecting all pages that uses this kind of Javascript &quot;Are you sure you want to leave the page&quot; type of alert.     </pre>
