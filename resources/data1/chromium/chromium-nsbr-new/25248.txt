<title>Issue 25248 -   chromium -    Scrolling using a mouse scroll wheel also scrolls the application behind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  OS version               :  10.6.1      1. Launch a web page in Chrome that requires you to scroll  2. Launch an application that also requires you to scroll such as Safari with another website that   requires you to scroll.  3. Click from Safari to Chrome and begin scrolling with your mouse scroll wheel in Chrome.   Notice that Safari scroll bar is effected and scrolls as well.        When I scroll using the mouse scroll wheel it shouldn't effect any other application other than   Chrome.        Using the mouse wheel to scroll makes the application behind Chrome scroll as well.    Other Browsers:    When scrolling in Safari  Firefox  Camino and Opera the other applications aren't effected.  This   seems to be a Chrome only issue. </pre>
