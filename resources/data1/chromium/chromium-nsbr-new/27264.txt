<title>Issue 27264 -   chromium -    Major regression: Gmail freezes completely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  OS + version : hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  window manager : Gnome  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com/a/google.com  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): works    From time to time (several times per day) the tab with Gmail completely   freezes  not responding to mouse  keyboard  scrolls or anything. Other tabs   work.    F5 in this tab reloads Gmail  but after reload Gmail stays non-responsible.    If I open a new window with Ctrl+N  and opening Gmail in it  new Gmail is   working perfectly. But after some time (minutes or hours) it also freezes.    It just appeared in the recent dev release. It seems to be limited to   Google Apps gmail  not personal gmail. </pre>
