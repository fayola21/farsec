<title>Issue 36853 -   chromium -    Crash when highlighting text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1          When browsing  I have a habit of repeatedly highlighting the text I'm   reading  which of course involves a lot of clicking. With the latest Dev   Channel update  after some time  this seems to cause Chrome to crash. This   has never happened before this latest release  and only happens when I am   highlighting text  however I haven't been able to reproduce it myself.   </pre>
