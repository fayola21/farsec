<title>Issue 35402 -   chromium -    Reload inspected page when Cmd+R is pressed inside devtools window  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When devtools is in the docked mode and the focus is inside devtools window   there is no easy way to reload inspected page without mouse. I may be a   good idea to reload inspected page when Cmd+R is pressed inside devtools   window. </pre>
