<title>Issue 32541 -   chromium -    chrome://downloads/ sometimes misinterprets downloads as extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is pretty strange ... not sure if anyone else is seeing this but I   thought I'd file it here for comments until I have some time to poke at it   a bit more.        1. Click on a pdf in chrome://downloads  2. Chromium misinterprets this as an extension for some reason and tries to   install it.  3. The install fails ('cos it's not actually an extension) with &quot;bad magic   number&quot; and then it DELETES the pdf file I downloaded. Not good.    This doesn't happen all the time ... sometimes I start chromium and it's   fine and it happily opens the (same) pdf file in evince ... other times it   shows the above behaviour.    The file deletion happens in chrome/browser/extensions/crx_installer.cc   btw. ... search for delete_source.    This is with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36945">r36945</a> but I did see it about a few weeks ago and I sort-of   forgot about it as I don't normally open stuff from downloads page. 32 bit     gcc 4.4  Release  no_strict_aliasing=0 (but I did patch lazy_instance  see   <a title="Hotmail Inbox (Spanish)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28479"> issue 28479 </a> but I doubt that matters given that it showed up earlier).    I'll try to narrow it down a bit more later eg. does buildbot binary do the   same thing  stick in some printfs etc. etc. </pre>
