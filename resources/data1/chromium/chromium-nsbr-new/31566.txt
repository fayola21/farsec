<title>Issue 31566 -   chromium -    Deleted/edited bookmark can be sync'd in wrong direction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome: 4.0.288.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35427">r35427</a>)  Browser 1: Windows XP  Browser 2: Linux Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)    Precondition:  -------------  1. Have 2 browsers set up with Bookmark Sync ON.    Note:  -----  You can force a sync by closing and reopening the browser.      --------------------------------------  1. Browser 1: bookmark page <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> on Bookmarks Bar.  2. Browser 2: force/wait for sync.  Google bookmark appears in browser 2.  3. Browser 1: delete Google bookmark.  4. Browser 2: force sync.       -- Google bookmark should disappear from browser 2  but does not.  5. Browser 1: force sync.       -- Google bookmark disappears from browser 1  but should not.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  Browser 2 should be the sync target.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  Browser 1 (the sync source) somehow becomes the sync target.  The same   effect may be seen with edited bookmarks.   </pre>
