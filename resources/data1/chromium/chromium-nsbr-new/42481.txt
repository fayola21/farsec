<title>Issue 42481 -   chromium -    Better error message when file: URLs blocked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      Download the attached file to the file system and open it there.      Either the word &quot;PASS&quot; or a helpful error message.      &quot;Error: NETWORK_ERR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101&quot;    Every browser in the world except Chrome allows file: URLs some limited XHR access; this is filed   as <a title="XMLHTTPRequests don't work from file: URLs to file: URLs." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586"> issue #37586 </a>  marked WontFix for security reasons.    Unfortunately  the error message doesn't say that the request was blocked for security reasons    but only that there was a network error.  This is very surprising behavior.    Instead  this error message should say something like: &quot;Blocked: request for local file. Use --  allow-file-access-from-files switch to override.&quot;  It might even link to a web page describing the   problem in more detail  and how to pass command-line switches to Google Chrome on OSX  etc. </pre>
