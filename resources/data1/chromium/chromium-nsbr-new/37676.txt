<title>Issue 37676 -   chromium -    It's possible to log in with the wrong account during a sync password renewal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Be syncing bookmarks.  2. Invalidate your gaia token. Possible ways to do this include configuring a   test server with a really fast expiration  and changing your password.  3. Do a commit so that the client gets the notification for token expiry.   Notice that Sync Error might NOT appear on the new tab page at this time.  4. Close the browser.  5. Open the browser  notice that the Sync Error box DOES appear now. Click it   to log in.  6. Notice that the username field is now EMPTY and allows you to enter any   username.  7. This will cause the sync DB not to be erased  and entries merged  which   causes serious problems. </pre>
