<title>Issue 32026 -   chromium -    &quot;Inactive Toast&quot; provides confusing crash notification and more - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install Chrome (and make it your default browser)  2. Don't use that machine for a month  3. Use the machine  and get the &quot;inactive toast&quot; offer to &quot;uninstall&quot; or to   &quot;try it&quot;.  Note this is an almost instance of Chrome running!  4.  Click on the link &quot;Why am I seeing this?&quot;  5. A second (real?) instance of Chrome will start  explaining why the offer   is made.  6. Click on the &quot;toast&quot; to &quot;try it&quot; (rather than &quot;uninstall&quot;).  7. The Toast turns into a &quot;real&quot; instance of Chrome  with a dialog telling   you that Chrome has crashed (not shutdown cleanly). :-).    What is the expected output?    IMO  when Chrome *is* the default browser  the &quot;Inactive Toast&quot; should NOT   appear.  Failure one of the users to use a particular computer should not   instigate the toast.      If it does appear  it should never instigate the conflicting use of the   default profile.  (I was assured by Carlos that this won't corrupt our   profile  but it is a scary side effect to worry about!).   </pre>
