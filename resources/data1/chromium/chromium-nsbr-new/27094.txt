<title>Issue 27094 -   chromium -    RTL page titles show up funny in tab strip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://www.hadess.net/2009/11/notice-anything.html">http://www.hadess.net/2009/11/notice-anything.html</a>    Tab strip: ellipsis is on the wrong side (?).  Should we propagate the page   directionality into the tab title?  This tab needs an LRM.    Content: title of page has boxes in it.  Font selection? </pre>
