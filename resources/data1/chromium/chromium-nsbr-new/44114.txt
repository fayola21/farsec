<title>Issue 44114 -   chromium -    Lock in address bar stays crossed out after visiting semi HTTPS page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.404.0 (Developer Build 47168)    The crossed out lock in the address bar which appears if a HTTPS website contains non-  HTTPS content does not disappear after browsing to another page within the same domain   which does not have non-HTTPS content since changing to another tab.      1. Browse to a HTTPS website; the lock symbol in the address bar is green.  2. Browse to a page at this website which contains non-HTTPS contents (e.g. an image   loaded via HTTP). The lock symbol turns grey and is crossed out with a red line.  3. Browse to a page which only contains HTTPS contents. The lock symbol still is grey and   is still crossed out.  4. Try reloading the page  reentering the URL manually nor leaving the page and returning   to it again  make the lock to turn green again.      The lock should turn green again if the web site does not contain any non-HTTPS content   anymore.      The lock stays gray and crossed-out.    The explained behavior only occurs in the same tab. It's possible to get two different   lock symbols for the same page in two different tabs. </pre>
