<title>Issue 44115 -   chromium -    New tab page's dropdown requires two clicks on &quot;Tips&quot; to close the dropdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev  Ubuntu Lucid Lynx      1. Open a new tab page  2. Click the dropdown arrow at the top right next to the Tip  3. Click &quot;Tips&quot;  or press down arrow then Enter to select Tips        Tips are unchecked and dropdown is closed        The dropdown remains open.  If you click again  the dropdown will close.    Separately  if you click away to close the dropdown and then click the   dropdown arrow again  Tips has in fact been unchecked.    Clicking Most Visited or Recently Closed (or using the arrow keys plus   Enter to select them) works as expected.  Also  it does not help to arrow   down past Tips  then back up  then press Enter; nor to mouse down to   Recently Closed  then mouse back up to Tips  and then click. </pre>
