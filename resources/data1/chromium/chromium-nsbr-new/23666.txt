<title>Issue 23666 -   chromium -    Download list can make ugly jumps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: '4.0.219.3 (Ontwikkelaarsbuild Ubuntu build 27326)'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : /  Other browsers tested: /      1.Download a file  2.Look at the download-page ( by entering 'chrome://downloads/' in the bar )          Good and good presented information about my downloads.            When downloading  let's say at 45 kb/s.  It does this with a 0.1 kb/s precision. When the information is refreshed it can jump between   say 45.5  45  45.9  44.7 or so. But the jumps between say 45 and 45.7 makes the string two   figures longer.     This jump easily makes the string long enough  to make a annoying jump. Sometimes resulting in   newlines that make the whole download-list jump up and down... with 4 downloads doing that   simultaneous  it's ugly and annoying. </pre>
