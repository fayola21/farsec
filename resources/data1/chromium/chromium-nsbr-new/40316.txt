<title>Issue 40316 -   chromium -    &quot;Task Manager&quot; in View/Developer menu has no default keyboard shortcut - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Task Manager&quot; in the View/Developer file menu has no default keyboard shortcut assigned to it in   Chrome Mac  but in Chrome Windows  it's assigned Shift+Esc.  The keyboard shortcut can be easily   added through System Preferences  but this is more about parity.    Chrome 5.0.342.7  OS X 10.6.3 </pre>
