<title>Issue 33016 -   chromium -    Copied image can't be pasted into Mail.app - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you copy an image from a web page and try to paste it into Mail.app  it   comes out as a broken-image icon instead. But oddly  you can paste into   other apps.    Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 dev  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): didn't try      1. Go to <a href="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</a> (or any web page with images on it)  2. Right-click on Google logo image  choose &quot;Copy Image&quot;  3. Launch Mail.app  4. Open a new compose window (Cmd-N)  5. Click in the message body area  6. Paste      Image appears in the compose window      Small &quot;image not found&quot; icon (blue box with &quot;?&quot; in it) appears.    However  if you launch TextEdit and paste  the image appears. Or if you   launch Preview and choose &quot;New Image&quot; (Cmd-N).    I suspect the problem is with the HTML on the pasteboard  which Mail will   read but the other two apps won't. </pre>
