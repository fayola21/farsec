<title>Issue 29049 -   chromium -    Don't include third_party header files by local reference in source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium should never include files by local reference  specifically for  third_party bits that may be provided by the system.     Example:    [BAD]    #include &quot;third_party/foo/bar/baz.h&quot;    [GOOD]    #include &lt;bar/baz.h&gt;    (and use proper -I options to point to top level system includedir as relevant) </pre>
