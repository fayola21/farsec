<title>Issue 30652 -   chromium -    Painful flicker while scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse to: <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com/46-businesses-with-hilariously-bad-names/">http://www.businesspundit.com/46-businesses-with-hilariously-bad-names/</a>  2. Scroll the page (keyboard or scroll bar)          Notice the strong flicker while scrolling. The images disappear and return back with a long enough delay to notice. Certainly not a good experience.        4.0.268.0 stable    Safari does just fine. </pre>
