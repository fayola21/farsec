<title>Issue 36292 -   chromium -    Add a way for users to toggle whether an extension runs in incognito windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This probably requires an additional option in the chrome:extensions page. To   start  I'm going to add an &quot;Enable in Incognito&quot; toggle next to the Disable   and Uninstall toggles we have now.    UI input needed to come up with a good place for this to live. </pre>
