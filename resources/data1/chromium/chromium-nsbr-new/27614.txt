<title>Issue 27614 -   chromium -    New Chrome window intermittently doesn't obtain focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start a new instance of Chrome from start menu/quick launch bar  2. Start a second new instance of Chrome in the same way  3. Notice flashing cursor in omnibar of new window; attempt to type URL  4. Typing is ineffective; notice that neither Chrome window has OS focus    I can 100% reproduce this behaviour by opening two new instances of Chrome   in succession from my quick launch bar. The first will  most often  open   with focus. The second will invariably open without focus. (Focus does not   remain with the first instance either - no application has focus).    This ONLY occurs with Chrome. I can open as many instances of Firefox as I   like  and the most recently-opened one will always obtain focus. Same with   PuTTY  Notepad etc.    Although the steps I describe can reproduce the problem reliably  this is   not the only sequence of events which triggers it. Even creating a new   window in Chrome with ctrl-n will intermittently open without focus.    This is under Vista 64-bit.                <b>Please provide
