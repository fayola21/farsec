<title>Issue 33616 -   chromium -    Orkut not opening - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to www.orkut.com  2. Enter your username and password  3. Click sign in       You should be logged in your account       I get a weird page containing some kind of text and it keeps loading until   the the browser crashes. It crashes the whole browser including all the   other open tabs. The only workaround that I found is pausing the process   and replacing the long text after orkut.com/blah.. blah.. blah.. with   orkut.com/Main#Home and I have to do it every time I go to that site (which   is like 15 times a day).   The same thing happens with www.yahoo.com but out of every 5 times    atleast one time the browser gets is right.     <b>Please provide
