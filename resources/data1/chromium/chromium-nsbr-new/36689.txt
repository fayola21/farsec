<title>Issue 36689 -   chromium -    Developer request: Make API types have constructors which are visible from the global namespace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For instance  BookmarkTreeNode could be defined on   chrome.bookmarks.types.BookmarkTreeNode.    Developers could then add custom functions to the constructor which aids   their particular use case.    This is a common pattern in Javascript and would be nice to support.
