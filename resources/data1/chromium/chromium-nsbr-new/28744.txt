<title>Issue 28744 -   chromium -    Use SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're going to switch to SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows  so that we can use new SSL/TLS features on older versions  of Windows.  An example of an SSL/TLS feature that we  want is the TLS server name indication (SNI) extension.    During the transition period  Chromium will have a dual SSL  stack -- both the Schannel-based SSLClientSocketWin and  SSLClientSocketNSS will be present.  We may also continue  to use Windows CryptoAPI for certificate verification and  certificate chain viewing.    There are some open issues on how NSPR and NSS should be  built for use by Chromium on Windows.  NSPR and NSS are  DLLs and linked with the DLL version of Visual C++ C  run time.  Chromium is one big DLL (chrome.dll) and linked  with the static library version of Visual C++ C runtime. </pre>
