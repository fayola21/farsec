<title>Issue 38200 -   chromium -    Visual issues with cookie dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - enable to be prompted on every cookie in cookie settings  - go to cnn.com    here are a few visual issues:  - modal dialog with no icon identifying application. This violates the HIG.  - radio buttons for &quot;enable&quot; state wraps and looks like ass even on the shortest website urls. Radio   buttons should be written to not wrap.  - ui doesn't match any other yes/no/remember on the OS (which uses a checkbox  not radio   buttons).     </pre>
