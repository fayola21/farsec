<title>Issue 33255 -   chromium -    Automate the sample landing page generation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per today's discussion  we would like to automate the sample landing page   generation  so that when a new sample is added to svn  relevant information   will be extracted and to be listed on the sample page. Then apply some AJAX   code to allow developers to search for samples based on keyword  this is   easier for developers to browse through compared to svn repository.   </pre>
