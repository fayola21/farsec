<title>Issue 23593 -   chromium -    browser action button disappears when loading a new extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had the print button browser action loaded via --load-extension.  I then   manually loaded mappy from chrome://extensions.  When I did that  the print   browser action button disappeared (although the space for the button   remained). </pre>
