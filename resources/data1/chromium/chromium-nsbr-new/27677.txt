<title>Issue 27677 -   chromium -    browser_tests can't be run in a discoverable way - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you run the browser_tests project  you'll get the error:    [1113/145559:ERROR:in_proc_test_runner.cc(135)] No dynamic library name   specified. You must specif one with the --lib=&lt;lib_name&gt; option.    It turns out the way to figure out how to actually run the browser tests is to   look at the stdio of the buildbot and see that it does:      browser_tests.exe --lib=browser_tests    You should not have to specify &quot;browser_tests&quot; when running the &quot;browser_tests&quot;   project! This bug just made me waste a whole bunch of time since I thought my   build was messed up and did a rebuild.    We can not expect people to run the tests or fix them unless its reasonable to   figure out how to run the tests. </pre>
