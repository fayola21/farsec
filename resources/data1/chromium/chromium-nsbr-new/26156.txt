<title>Issue 26156 -   chromium -    Detect when switching networks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The network module needs some mechanism to be notified when &quot;the network changes&quot;. For   example  when you:      - switch wireless networks    - join VPN    - lose/regain connectivity    - change default network interface    This feature is needed  so chrome can respond by flushing various caches / reconfigure network   dependencies  etc...    This is a tracking meta-bug  to list the bugs that are blocked on the feature.    Examples of things that need to be done on network change:      - flush host cache    - close idle sockets    - re-run automatic proxy configuration </pre>
