<title>Issue 42000 -   chromium -    Cmd-` doesn't work when Flash is active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 (Official Build 44625) dev  Other browsers tested: Safari  Firefox         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: FAIL      1. Open e.g. YouTube video. Click anywhere on it to make sure that Flash is active.  2. Open a new window (Cmd-N)  3. Click Cmd-` (switch between windows) several times.        Cmd-` should work even when Flash is active. Otherwise you have to click outside the Flash to   be able to switch windows with keyboard.        As soon as Flash gets active Cmd-` no longer works. </pre>
