<title>Issue 33031 -   chromium -    Implement form label scraping in webkit/glue/dom_operations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some forms are labeled using the HTML Label element (see <a title="Copy WebInputElement::label() into FormData once support for label() has been added to WebKit" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33030"> bug 33030 </a>)  while   most forms use tables to format the labels and form control elements.  We   need to scrape through the DOM to extract labels from the form for AutoFill. </pre>
