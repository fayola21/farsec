<title>Issue 31990 -   chromium -    Selecting any JPG with HTML file selector causes crash on Linux 64-bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Nightly 64-bit build 4.0.296.0 (35933)  OS + version : Gentoo Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE      1. Open any HTML page which allows you to upload a file.  2. Browse harddrive to any JPG file  3. Selecting the JPG causes Chromium to instantly crash      An preview of image on right hand side like it does with GIF &amp; PNG files        Segfault    Unfortunately I can't seem to use strace with chromium as the entire  (graphical) system locks up before chromium even gets loaded. The only way  I can start it is to kill strace first. `ldd` doesn't show any missing  libraries either.    Anyone have any ideas what is (or could be) causing this?   </pre>
