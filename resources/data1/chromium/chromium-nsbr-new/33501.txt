<title>Issue 33501 -   chromium -    Browser crashes during file upload if fewer bytes than the claimed file size can be read - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Upload a file without read permissions (any file with fewer readable bytes than its initial file size   will work as well  for example one with a bad block in the middle or one truncated while the upload   is in progress)      The browser doesn't crash or hang      The browser  if built with DCHECK enabled  crashes with a DCHECK(result &gt;= 0) error in net::TCPClientSocketLibevent::Write called by net::HttpStreamParser::DoSendBody. In a release build    the uploading thread hangs. </pre>
