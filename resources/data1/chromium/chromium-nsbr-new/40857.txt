<title>Issue 40857 -   chromium -    No translate infobar shown when triggering translation from context menu for some sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Visit <a href="http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm">http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm</a>  2. No translate infobar is shown  3. Right click and select &quot;Translate to English&quot;    Expected:  An infobar is shown mentinoning translation occured.    Actual:  Some text in the page is translated but no infobar is shown.    Note:  The link above points to a page for which we don't know the language of. So  when we force translation  we return to the browser that the page has been  translated from 'und' to 'en'.  The translate infobar does not understand 'und' and asserts.  The back-end should ask the translate element what the page language is in  that case and somehow default to something if it does not find it.     </pre>
