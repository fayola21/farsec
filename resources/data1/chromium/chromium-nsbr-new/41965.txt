<title>Issue 41965 -   chromium -    Hard-coded timeout value in chrome/test/test_launcher/out_of_proc_test_runner.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As I can see  there's a hard-coded kTestTimeoutMs constant that determines  the time to live of an executed subprocess. Such a trick makes it  impossible to run the tests if the execution is slowed down (e.g.  unoptimized binaries  gprof  Valgrind etc.)    As many tests that run real Chromium rely on this code  I suggest to  replace the timeout value either by a command-line flag or an env var  if  possible. </pre>
