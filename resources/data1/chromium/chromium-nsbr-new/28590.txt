<title>Issue 28590 -   chromium -    split locale_settings.grd into platform specific files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mark  TVL and I discussed a while back splitting the locale_settings.grd   into 1 + n   platform files.  locale_settings.grd would include settings that are common   across   platforms  and locale_settings_foo.grd would include platform specific   values (e.g.    font faces).  This would avoid having hard to read xtb or grd files with   lots of &lt;if&gt;   blocks.  I'll look into doing this after we push the linux/mac betas (to   make cherry-  picking patches easier until then). </pre>
