<title>Issue 43477 -   chromium -    Clicking on a form-auto suggestion should select it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 6.0.398.0 (Developer Build 46578)  OS: XP    I've been observing this since yesterday. Open crbug.com entry form or any   other bug for some time (may be until screensaver triggers). After that    click on any text fields (Status  Owner  CC) or labels and try to select   any suggestion from the list.    Issue:  The suggestion is not selected on clicking on it.
