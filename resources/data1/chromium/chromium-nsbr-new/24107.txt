<title>Issue 24107 -   chromium -    Directory listings should allow sorting columns - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice if the directory listing you get when navigating to a file:   URL for a directory allowed you to sory by the various attributes by clocking   on the columns.    The sorting behavior used to be in the FileEnumerator in base. I'm currently   in the process of moving it to net/base/directory_lister. If this bug is   fixed  that sorting should be removed and all the sorting done in JS. This   will also allow the directory listings to come in incrementally (since we   sort  we have to wait for all the entries before sending any).    <a title="Minor typing inconsistency in Hungarian setup" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=459"> Issue 459 </a> might be relevant if we're doing a JS sorting implementation. </pre>
