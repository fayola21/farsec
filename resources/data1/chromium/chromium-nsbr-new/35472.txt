<title>Issue 35472 -   chromium -    Autofill hiccup when typing previously mis-spelled term - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Attempt type a term in form field (e.g. chromium issue search) that you   have previously been used but mis-spelled.            When different letter is typed in word the autofill list below field should   disappear and typed letter should be input into field.        The different letter needs to be typed twice before it is registered.  For   example  I accidentally searched for &quot;desktop notfications&quot; (missing first   &quot;i&quot;).  If I try to search for with the proper spelling I have to type the first &quot;i&quot;   twice for it to register when typing &quot;desktop notifications&quot;.      <b>Please provide
