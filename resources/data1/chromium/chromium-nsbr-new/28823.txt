<title>Issue 28823 -   chromium -    Google for VIPs (Visually Impaired Persons) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi guys I'm blind (I use the computer with the aid of special talking   software) I find google chrome great apart from a couple of things which I   can't find answers to.  My email is bob.stoker@sky.com could you tell me if there is anyway to   change the start/home page on google - I want google to start with my   email (sky.com) sign in page.  I have clicked yes to `Save Password` but it only saved it for about 3   days now I have to type it in each time I access my email is there a way   to rectify this?  Google chrome works well with the screenreader I am using but I have heard   that it makes a stuttering noise when used with another screenreader.  Any help I can give re suitability for VIPs (Visually Impaired Persons)   Please just give me a shout.  Bob   </pre>
