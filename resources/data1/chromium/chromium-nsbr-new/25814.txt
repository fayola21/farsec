<title>Issue 25814 -   chromium -    Rendering problems (maybe with antialising) in Chrome Linux 4.0.223 (regression) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open  for example  Google calendar.      NOTE: this is NOT the overlapping event bug that was fixed in 4.0.223.  2. Have some events showing      Calendar entries are rendered with the right antialiasing.      Something with the rendering is off -- it may be the antialising  but the   event text looks bad.    This also happens in at least a couple of other cases that can't be shared   via screenshot unless this bug is marked private. I can see it happening on   other coworkers' computers too.    <b>Please provide
