<title>Issue 35900 -   chromium -    [Extensions] Clicking on &quot;Manage extensions&quot; context menu item opens a new extensions management page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have some browser action extensions installed  2. Access extensions management page  3. Right click on browser action button and then click on &quot;Manage extensions&quot;      Since the extensions management page has already been opened  the clicking  on &quot;Manage extensions&quot; should just give focus to the existing page  but now  a new extensions management page is opened.    This issue happens in beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069)   but it doesn't happen on latest trunk.   </pre>
