<title>Issue 40270 -   chromium -    SVG &lt;use&gt; tag not applying inner CSS styles correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.368.0 (Developer Build 43430) Ubuntu      Firefox 3.x: OK       Opera 10: FAIL    (What steps will reproduce the problem?)        Write a CSS stylesheet for &quot;myclassname:hover&quot;      Add a &lt;rect &quot;myrect&quot; class &quot;myclassname&quot; ... /&gt; in the &lt;defs&gt; section      Insert this using &lt;use xmlns:href=&quot;#myrect&quot; ... /&gt;    (What is the expected result?)  On mouse over  the :hover class should be applied (at least I think it should)    (What happens instead?)  The :hover is never applied.    (Please provide any additional information below.)    in SVG markup  when a &lt;use&gt; element references a &lt;path class=&quot;myclass&quot;&gt; or similar element the base   &quot;path.myclass&quot; style is applied to the path  but on mouseover the &quot;path.myclass:hover&quot; style is not.    This behaviour is also exhibited in Opera 10 but not in Firefox 3.6  which displays the :hover   correctly.    I haven't been able to find a relevant section in the SVG 1.1 specification  but that behaviour doesn't   sound right to me; it's inconsistent with the description given of the 'use' statement.    Could someone with more knowledge of SVG tell me if this is correct behaviour?  I have attached an offending svg for testing. </pre>
