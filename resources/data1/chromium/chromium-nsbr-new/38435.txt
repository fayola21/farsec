<title>Issue 38435 -   chromium -    Browser window moves offscreen (disappears)  when switching desktops using TwinView - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : noticed on 4.0  still extists in 5.0.307.11      Reproducing:  I'm using the following setup: debian linux  fvwm2 window manager (no  desktop manager in use)  NVidia twinview setup. Resolution on screen 1 is  1600x1200 pixel  resolution on screen 2 is 1024x768. I have 4 desktops set  up in a 2x2 area.    I'm accustomed to change screens with the alt + direction buttons. But when  I do this with google-chrome focused  then the browser window moves offscreen.    This bug does not happen if I either:   - turn off twinview   - focus on other window than google-chrome  while pressing alt+direction   - use any other method to change the active desktop (for example: using  the desktop selector application)    I've attached a screenshot of the application selector  that displays the  window coordinates also. In the highlight you'll see that the coordinates  of google chrome are way to the bottom (y: 7232 pixel)        Browser should stay where I've put it :)       </pre>
