<title>Issue 43219 -   chromium -    Password not remembered when login form uses XHR or equivalent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome's password autofill code only recognizes logins that are made through a normal form   submit. If the site uses an onSubmit handler to abort the normal submit (by returning false) and   handles the login itself using an XHR or something equivalent  Chrome won't think there was a login   and won't offer to save the password.    Hulu.com is a major site that's known to do this (at this writing.)    This is a spin-off of <a title="Password saving on sites with different onsubmit handlers doesn't work" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28910"> issue 28910 </a>. </pre>
