<title>Issue 45145 -   chromium -    Update from 5.0.375.55 beta to 5.0.375.55 stable didn��_��_��_t smell like an update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If 5.0.375.55 beta was updated to 5.0.375.55 stable in the background  the About window didn��_��_��_t   realize anything changed  because the version numbers are the same. The About window might   want to look at the KSChannel key too. The only problem this caused is that the About window   didn��_��_��_t show the restart sheet. </pre>
