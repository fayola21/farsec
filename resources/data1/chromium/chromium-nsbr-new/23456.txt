<title>Issue 23456 -   chromium -    Chromium latest build 15-20% slower than Firefox nightly/Webkit nightly on content aware image resizing canvas demo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (27622)    <a href="http://labs.pimsworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/demo-content-aware-image-resizing-2/">http://labs.pimsworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/demo-content-aware-image-resizing-2/</a>  Other browsers tested: Firefox Minefield 3.7a 20090930  Webkit nightly <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=48794">r48794</a>      1. Click on Full image (to slow it down)   2. Switch to Energy Image (someone expressed concern it was due to a slower  CSS resize)  3. Hit Go    All times below were from taking the best of several runs in each browser.    Some times on my machine:  Nasa/Full Image/Continuous Update/Energy image  Firefox: 7.665  Webkit: 8.020  Chromium: 9.011    Crowd/Full Image/Continuous Update/Energy image  Firefox: 10.928  Webkit: 10.667  Chromium: 12.161    The surprising thing to me is how much slower Chromium is than Webkit.  The  only difference is V8 right?    Now  under a virtual machine  things were a bit more ambiguous.  On the Crowd image Chromium actually gained on Firefox.  Nasa/Full Image/Continuous Update/Energy image  Firefox: 9.335  Webkit: 7.023  Chromium: 10.740    Crowd/Full Image/Continuous Update/Energy image  Firefox: 13.702  Webkit: 9.248  Chromium: 12.757       </pre>
