<title>Issue 43227 -   chromium -    Dropping or Pasting Bookmark into Empty Folder Leaves &quot;(empty)&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Copy or drag a bookmark onto a folder which has no bookmarks and is showing &quot;(empty)&quot;.  2. Before pasting or dropping  wait until the contents of the empty folder is shown  thus revealing   the &quot;(empty)&quot;.  3. Paste or complete the drop.    What is the expected output?  - The folder presentation should only show the newly pasted/dropped bookmark.    What do you see instead?  - The folder presents both the newly pasted/dropped bookmark and the old &quot;(empty)&quot; placeholder. </pre>
