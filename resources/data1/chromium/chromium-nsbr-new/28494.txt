<title>Issue 28494 -   chromium -    Status bubble scurry flashes in wrong position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) go to  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-</a>  Malloc.html#Hooks-for-Malloc  2) scroll to bottom of page  3) move mouse bellow bottom link  4) move mouse up to link    I get a flash of the status bubble (since I moused over a link) followed by   it immediately hiding (since my mouse is in the bubble region).  I guess we   need to pass in the mouse coords the first time we show it as well? </pre>
