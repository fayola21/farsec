<title>Issue 33877 -   chromium -    Add ability to restrict history searches to matches in title/URL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.276.0 (Developer Build 35044)    The History search function currently includes all pages whose text matches   the query in the results. Sometimes  this is unhelpful and causes   unwanted/irrelevant hits. It would be nice if there was some way to exclude   full-page-text matches and only include URL and/or title matches. </pre>
