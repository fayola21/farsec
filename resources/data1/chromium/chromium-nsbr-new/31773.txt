<title>Issue 31773 -   chromium -    Developer tools style toggle is not reversible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555) unstable  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.288.1 Safari/532.8    Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Create and load simple test page like the one attached.  2. Go into &quot;inspect element&quot; on the image.  3. Click the checkbox next to &quot;float:left&quot; twice (to turn it off and back   on).      The page looks just like it did initially.      The page is laid-out differently.    Attached find screenshots of the process and a simple test file.    Note: I'm not sure which layout is more correct  but I don't think they   both can be. </pre>
