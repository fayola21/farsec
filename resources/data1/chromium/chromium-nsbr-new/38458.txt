<title>Issue 38458 -   chromium -    Switch Popup Blocker from &quot;load but hide&quot; to &quot;don't load&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our current popup blocker loads popups but hides them.  This causes   problems for webpages that try to detect blocked popups by seeing if   window.open() returned NULL.  As a result  pages don't tell Chrome users   that they have a blocked popup  leading to users wondering why their button   clicks aren't working.    This also leads to <a title="Don't play plugin instances inside suppressed popups?"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3477">issue 3477</a>.    If we change to match other browsers  these concerns go away.    From Darin: &quot;To implement this properly  I think we can just piggy back on   the ViewHostMsg_CreateWindow IPC  which is already synchronous.  We would   just need to move the popup blocking policy to the IO thread of the   browser.&quot;    Note  however  that our current popup UI shows users the title and favicon   of popups  which cannot be obtained if we never load the popups in the   first place.  We may want to either reconsider the popup blocked bubble UI    or try to go ahead and partially-load a popup in the background  long   enough to get a title and favicon  and then discard it  even as we return   NULL to the caller.  Dunno how feasible this is. </pre>
