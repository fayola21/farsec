<title>Issue 36536 -   chromium -    Keyboard shortcuts donot work after playing video in Fullscreen mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.335.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=39561">r39561</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.42      1. Open a video in Youtube.com.  2. View the video fullscreen mode.  3. Come back to the normal mode.  4. Hit cmd+shift+F.    Expected:  The window should go to fullscreen mode.    Actual:  Nothing happens.    Note:  1. This is not the case in Safari.  2. Most of the keyboard shortcuts like cmd+O  cmd+R  cmd+Y do not work  after we get back from fullscreen mode. But shortcuts like cmd+T  cmd+W   cmd+N work.  3. Chrome on Linux does not respond to any keyboard shortcuts (Plugin eats  them all).  4. We already have a <a title="Some Keyboard Shortcuts (Cmd-L) don't work when a plugin eats them"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25756">bug 25756</a> for the plugin eating the shortcuts  but in  that its mentioned that cmd+T  cmd+N also don't work  but here it does.   </pre>
