<title>Issue 32120 -   chromium -    Tabs on Mac should elide with ellipses instead of fading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open many tabs on the Mac version of Chrome.  2. Note that instead of eliding with ...  tab titles fade away anemically.  3. $%#^@!    This bothered me greatly when I started using the Mac version (I thought it   was a bug)  and I thought I would give it a while to grow on me.  After several   months  it hasn't -- it still seems weird and wrong; just this morning  I was   sure I had discovered a strange display bug  but on closer examination  it was   just a half-faded &quot;C&quot;.    What do you think  users of Chrome?   </pre>
