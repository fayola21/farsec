<title>Issue 45842 -   chromium -    Wrench menu renders incorrectly in Windows 7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	6.0.422.0 (Official Build 48573) dev      1. Open Chrome 6.0.422.0 dev on Windows 7 64-bit with Aero enabled.  2. Click the wrench menu.      The menu appears normal and is skinned properly.      The menu is rendered as if Aero isn't turned on and looks out of place.   Confirmed by looking at the page menu which rendereds properly.   </pre>
