<title>Issue 25335 -   chromium -    refactor: Move DnsMaster to the IO thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now DnsMaster can run from either the UI thread  or the IO thread.  It uses locks to synchronize access to shared data.    When I changed HostResolver to being a shared non-threadsafe object  I made some ugly changes   to DnsMaster so that it funnels all of its requests to HostResolver through the IO thread.    The next logical step is to simply move the whole thing (DnsMaster) onto the IO thread.  This would simplify the design  and allow me to defer creation of HostResolver to the IO thread as   part of ChromeURLRequestContext. </pre>
