<title>Issue 32165 -   chromium -    Spinner wastes CPU resources  is not green and need to be replaced. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load a moderately complex page (e.g. www.slashdot.org  www.nytimes.com    etc.) or restore a complex session (e.g. <a title="Restoring 600 tabs at once can make browser completely nonfunctional"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32061">Issue #32061</a>).   2. The tab shows a &quot;spinner&quot; icon which remains for a few seconds   (depending on the complexity of the page) to 15-20 minutes (in the case of   exceedingly complex session restores if they max out the CPU and/or   network).  3. This wastes CPU time  forces the browser to consume more energy than is   required and makes the browser slower than may be necessary (and may even   prevent the browser from working at all).      The page loading process should be as fast  efficient (green) and   informative as possible.      It is only a 2-state source of information (unloaded vs. loaded) and the   animation/spinning of the icon requires CPU resources that can otherwise be   used to accelerate page loading and makes the browser less green.      <b>Please provide
