<title>Issue 28647 -   chromium -    Stop using Sqlite for Safe Browsing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing the bug to track this issue.    A few folks have discussed not using Sqlite for Safe Browsing  now that the   current implementation doesn't use database features like indexing.  We use the   database basically only for storage.  For the ~4.5MB of actual data  the SB2   histograms show an order of magnitude more bytes read and written.  So switching   to a flat file sounds like it could reduce the disk access by a lot and make   Chrome hog the disk less. </pre>
