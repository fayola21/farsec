<title>Issue 39898 -   chromium -    Detect bad winsock LSPs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some winsock LSPs are broken and/or malicious.  Developers sometimes spend   non-trivial time trying to find the source of a problem only to conclude   that the network APIs are not behaving according to spec because of an LSP.    We should record a hash of installed LSPs and include it in the minidump in   order to more easily spot an issue caused by a broken LSP.    Furthermore  it would be nice if Chrome had a black list of known bad LSPs   and informed the end user when they are using a bad LSP. </pre>
