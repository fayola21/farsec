Use Quick/ChangJie (_��_��___��_/��___��_��_) Input Method.  2. Type at least 2 Chinese Words quickly.      Can type Chinese Words that I want.      The second Chinese word cannot be typed correctly.    Watch the video which I attach.  In the video  I want to type _��_��__��_��_��_��__.  However  the second word &quot;_��_��_&quot; cannot display.  I sure that I have typed &quot;_��_��_&quot; correctly.  That must is Chrome's problem. </pre>
