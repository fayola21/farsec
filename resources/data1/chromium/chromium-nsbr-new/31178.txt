<title>Issue 31178 -   chromium -    &quot;Delete cookies&quot; also deletes extension localStorage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.277.0 (35054)    Deleting cookies (by way of Clear Browsing Data) also seems to erase   extensions' localStorages. It's not apparent from the dialog box that it's going   to do this  and so it annoys users. Perhaps there could be a separate option   for deleting extension settings? </pre>
