<title>Issue 33073 -   chromium -    Linux Chrome gets in an unresizable state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Start linux chrome.    Accidentally hit the options-v keystroke combination - this seems to make   Google Chrome as wide as the screen.    Try moving the Chrome window so you can resize it smaller again - see that   Google Chrome thinks it's now maximized - it fills the entire screen and   has the un-maximize button in the upper right corner.    There doesn't seem to be any way to unmaximize the window now - the window   is maximized and so can't be resized  but clicking the unmaximize button in   the upper right corner doesn't do anything.    The only thing I found I could do is to enable the &quot;use system title bar   and borders&quot; option and resize the screen using the system controls. </pre>
