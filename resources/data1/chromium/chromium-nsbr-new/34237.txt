<title>Issue 34237 -   chromium -    Chrome saving data may expose credit card details and other sensitive information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a code-level bug  or something &quot;hard&quot; to discover  but it is a   serious and really dangerous bug. Anyone who used (or even watched me using   my computer) may &quot;accidently&quot; see my credit card details and &quot;accidently&quot;   use it if they want. Things could be worse if someone had written a data   &quot;analysing&quot; Chrome extension  and secretly collect credit card details   through it!    As you can see in my attachment &quot;bounty.jpg&quot;  my credit card is yours now.  (It does save VISA security code  too)    My suggestion is to write some code to primitively prevent the browser   saving any credit card details. For instance  not saving any 12-digit   numbers which looks like credit card number; scan the tag before the input   box  discard the saving data if there is any trace of &quot;credit card&quot; (and   the translation of &quot;credit card&quot; in other 170 languages)  etc.    I hope this is helpful.    (By the way  my spelling of &quot;accidently&quot; is correct  but Chrome/Google   Desktop say it is wrong  and sadly they provide no suggestion.)    Aaron  polymorpher.darkiron@gmail.com   </pre>
