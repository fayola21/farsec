Note that despite the similar stack near NPP_Destroy    this isn't the same as <a title="Flash 10.0 crash under NPP_Destroy @+0x0016b063" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35862"> bug 35862 </a>  especially given the very different   distribution of URLs.    Currently the #11 Mac Gecko Flash crash  so it should be upstreamed. </pre>
