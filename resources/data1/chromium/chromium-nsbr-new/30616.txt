<title>Issue 30616 -   chromium -    Unexpected error in DoesTableExist() when called from DirectoryBackingStore::InitializeTables() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This previously caused a crash as there was a CHECK() assuming that the   SELECT count(*) could not fail.  This is possibly caused by SQLITE_BUSY or   SQLITE_CORRUPT error occurring  or PrepareQuery() failing.    See report link: http://go/crash/reportdetail?reportid=eb4ffd2d2bbf05bb </pre>
