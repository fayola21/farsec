<title>Issue 43218 -   chromium -    A HostPortPair is not enough to determine the scheme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some servers can serve both http and https over the same host port pair.    gutschke:8888 is an example.  Currently  our client socket pools assume   that  for a given host port pair  the sockets will all be TCPClientSockets   (for http) or all be SSLClientSockets (for https).  This means that when we   reuse a socket  we can get the wrong socket type now  which leads to crashes   / other bad behavior. </pre>
