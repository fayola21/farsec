<title>Issue 25802 -   chromium -    Extension updates hosted on Google Sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    I uploaded the XML and CRX files to Google Sites. Both are then accessible   via a direct URL  but the update does not work. I suspect the problem is   either that Google Sites 302 redirects to an URL at a different domain   (googlegroups.com) or that the new URL is incredibly long (373 characters)   and contains authkey and other variables.    How can I debug this?  </pre>
