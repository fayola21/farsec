<title>Issue 32556 -   chromium -    Extension page action installation pop-up should be optional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 dev (Windows XP)    In Windows  when an extension with a page action is installed  a help pop-up   automatically shows up next to the page action icon  explaining that the user   can click the page action icon to do stuff. (Note: this doesn't happen on   Linux.)    However  some extensions use an OPTIONAL page action icon and make it hidden   by default (by calling chrome.pageAction.hide() immediately). For such   extensions  showing the help pop-up is just confusing  because immediately   after it's dismissed  the page action icon disappears.    Note: this can also happen if the page action is enabled by default but hide-  able in options  if the user disables the icon and then uninstalls/reinstalls   the extension.    The help bubble should be eliminated  made optional  or should only trigger   the first time an extension is ever installed. </pre>
