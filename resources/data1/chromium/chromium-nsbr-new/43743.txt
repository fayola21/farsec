<title>Issue 43743 -   chromium -    createTab shouldn't require tabs permission - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Request for a new API method: chrome.extensions.createTab(url)    It would be incredibly useful to have the ability to create tabs without   needing permission to access the chrome.tabs.* API  which throws up an   unnecessarily scary dialogue warning if you're only intending to use the   create() method.    Previous discussions have suggested using window.open() but the behaviour   of this is not flawless  and in   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31607">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31607</a> there was the   suggestion of chrome.extensions.createTab(url) as an alternative. I know   there are a number of developers who are facing negative user comments over   their permissions warnings when only needing the existing create() method    and so this new alternative would be greatly appreciated as soon as   possible! </pre>
