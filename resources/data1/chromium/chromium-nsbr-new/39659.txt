<title>Issue 39659 -   chromium -    English web page with a lot of non-English names in Latin is detected as a non-English and translation infobar pops up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Official Build 42199)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm">http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Visit a site such as <a href="http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm">http://www.saanconf.org/alumni.htm</a> that is in   English  but populated primarily by non-English names.    2. Note that a translation bar appears        For no translation bar to appear.      A translation bar appears asking if the site should be translated from   Malay to English. This is wrong on two levels:    1) The names are South Asian (Indian  Pakistani  Bangladeshi  etc)  not   Southeast Asian (Malaysian etc.)    2) Aside from the names themselves  the page is completely in English  and   so should not have a translation bar displayed.   </pre>
