<title>Issue 31884 -   chromium -    Slow start of gmail standard view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.294.0 (Developer Build 35869)    For some days now (hard to say how long exactly  less than a week I think)    GMail is not loaded correctly after starting the browser.      1. log in to gmail   2. pin the gmail tab  3. the chrome to open the tabs that were last open  4. restart chrome    Before  GMail laoded correctly. Now  I only see the loading bar and after   about a minute:    ---  Loading xyz@gmail.com��_��__  This is taking longer than usual. Try reloading the page.    If that doesn't work  you can:  Disable Labs and try again.  If you're on a slow connection  try basic HTML view.  For more troubleshooting tips  visit the help center.  ---    If I press the reload link  GMail starts up correctly.    I have disabled all extensions  no difference.    I have also tried GMail basic  which works just fine (but I don't really   want to use that :)    I have found similar issues:  19177 - different because GMail works just fine for me once started  28010 - different because I don't use chat at all (login disabled) </pre>
