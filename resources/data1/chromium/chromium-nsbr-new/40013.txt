<title>Issue 40013 -   chromium -    WebWorker crashes on startup [or never starts up] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load the attached file db.html.        I see a worker-crashed infobar.  I'd expect an exception to be thrown   inside the worker instead  and reported in the textarea  since openDatabase   doesn't exist in worker context yet.    I realize that this is a huge  clunky test case.  I'll try to narrow it   down to a smaller one  but I wanted to get this logged quickly.    I've only run this in Vista64 so far  with a debug build of the latest code   as of yesterday afternoon.  This repros both via file:// and http:// URLs. </pre>
