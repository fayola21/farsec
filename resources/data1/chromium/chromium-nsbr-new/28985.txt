<title>Issue 28985 -   chromium -    Flash-based magazine (zmags.com) doesn't load properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12 (Official Build 32876)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/0305a228">http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/0305a228</a>  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Not tested  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested      1. Navigate to <a href="http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/0305a228">http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/0305a228</a>  2. Try zooming by clicking on one of the pages.  3. Try skipping to page 5-6 (or even further).    I'm using Shockwave Flash version 10.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32">r32</a> (as shown on about:plugins).   Safari 4 using the same plugin version works fine.      The page should load without errors and it should be possible to zoom in   on the page and navigate to the middle of the magazine without   encountering pages that do not load.      The page shows a Flash renderer load error which fades away after a few   seconds. Attempts at zooming are ignored and only the first two folds have   contents. The rest of the magazine pages aren't loaded properly. </pre>
