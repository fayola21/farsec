<title>Issue 24380 -   chromium -    Refactor most visited backend - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The most visited pages as done today gets its data from 4 different data   sources.    1. It queries the entire history to get N most visited pages  2. It gets the blacklisted pages from the prefs  3. It gets the pinned pages from the prefs  4. The pre populated pages are hard coded in the code (<a title="Make pre populated thumbnails localized"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17630">issue 17630</a>)    It would be good if we could provide one unified data source for this. Both   for performance reasons as well as to ensure that both the NTP and the   Windows 7 jump list would show the same set of pages.     </pre>
