<title>Issue 38841 -   chromium -    Chrome does not detect DNS forward changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Do a DNS forward for a domain  e.g.  foo.com -&gt; foobar.com  2. Load foo.com in Chrome - will correctly show foobar.com  3. Change DNS forward as foo.com -&gt; fubar.com and load foo.com in Chrome      Should now load fubar.com  since that's the new destination.      Chrome will continue to load the old foobar.com. This is after the cache has had a plenty of time to expire (e.g.  I continue to experience this after 2   weeks). Running ipconfig /flushdns does not help  and Ctrl+F5 doesn't help either.    Both FF and IE correctly load the new fubar.com.    <b>Please provide
