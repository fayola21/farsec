<title>Issue 42413 -   chromium -    Implement centrally-managed preferences on Linux  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once the preference abstraction is complete  we should implement the   underlying Linux behavior for centrally-managed preferences.    Per our conversations  this should probably start as two flat (JSON?) files   in /etc.  One file is only administrator-managed and parallels &quot;group policy   settings&quot;  whereas the other is user-managed and parallels &quot;group policy   preferences&quot;.    Eventually  we can also build in the support for other configuration tools    but that can be tracked separately.   </pre>
