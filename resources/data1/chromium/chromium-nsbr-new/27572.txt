<title>Issue 27572 -   chromium -    Extension manifest file: permissions URLs should not accept port - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The manifest file of an extension should not allow having port number in the   permissions URL. (ex: <a href="http://www.google.com:9191">http://www.google.com:9191</a>).  That messes up the permission and it makes impossible to access that URL from   the extension.   </pre>
