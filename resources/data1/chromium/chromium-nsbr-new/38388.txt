<title>Issue 38388 -   chromium -    Indicator for &quot;never remember&quot; password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the only way to know that you opted to never remember your  password for a site and change your selection is by visiting Wrench &gt;  Options &gt; Personal Stuff &gt; Show saved passwords &gt; Exceptions.    It would be great to surface this choice and control to users in the  context of the page.  The trick is doing it without being annoying.  Some  ideas:    1. an icon in the field  that when clicked allows the user to change their  selection  3. a link hover style status message at the bottom of the page  combined  with a right-click context menu  2. a page action in the URL bar (not very discoverable)   </pre>
