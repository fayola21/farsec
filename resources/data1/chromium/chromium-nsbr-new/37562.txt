<title>Issue 37562 -   chromium -    When selecting a fallback font for a complex script  the presence of OT layout tables has to be taken into account - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install a Tibetan font  jomolhari available at  <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/jomolhari">http://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/jomolhari</a> . On Ubuntu/Debian  'sudo  apt-get install ttf-dzongkha' will do it)    2. Go to <a href="http://yarlungraging.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html">http://yarlungraging.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html</a>    (alternatively  Try the same page in Firefox 3 or copy'n'paste a snippet to  geditor and compare the results.)    What's expected: Tibetan characters are 'shaped'.      Actual: Nominal glyphs are rendered 'serially'.     jomolhari has the opentype layout tables (gsub gpos) for 'tibt' (Tibetan  script) and harfbuzz seems to support Tibetan (at least harfbuzz-tibetan.c  is in our copy of harfbuzz and is built).      </pre>
