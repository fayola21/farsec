<title>Issue 40312 -   chromium -    History Hack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history-hack.html">http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history-hack.html</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1.visit Web sites will change the way that links are displayed        &quot;I discovered this around a year ago... Instead of fishing  I called it   history &quot;fisting&quot;  because you can force-feed someone a huge list of links   and see what sticks  then pull it out. This can all be done surreptitiously   and report back to the server. Using XMLHttpRequest  you can send megabytes   of links (mod_gzip is your friend) over time while someone browses a   page... or if they just leave the page open.    I'm sure it was discovered before me too. [Update: the above paper makes   that clear...] The easy way to fix it is for a browser to not change the   vlink on any OFF-site links... that way an attacker can only find out which   links on the current site you've seen  which they know anyway (from reading   their own web logs).&quot;    <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history-hack.html">http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history-hack.html</a>         </pre>
