Go the URL above.  2. Click in the blue area.  3. A black circle appears - but not under the cursor.        A black circle appears underneath the cursor.        The circle appears offset to the top. I've create a simple as possible  example for your to examine.    It appears as if getScreenCTM is not setting up the correct matrix.    Firefox's matrix is:  a = 1.366  b = 0  c = 0  d = 1.366  e = 0  f = 244    Chrome's matrix:  a = 1.356  b = 0  c = 0  d = 1.356  e = 0  f = 491.7999    notice how f is different. </pre>
