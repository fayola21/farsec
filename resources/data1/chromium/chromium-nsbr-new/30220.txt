<title>Issue 30220 -   chromium -    Gmail messages not loading: XHR not sent on click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium 4.0.270.0 (34432)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox">https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox</a>  Other browsers tested:        Google Chrome 4.0.249.30 : OK        Safari 4: OK  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Log in to Gmail.  2. Click the first message to open it.      After step 1  inbox should be visible. After step 2  message should be   loaded in less than half a second (over high-speed connection).      After step 1  inbox visible as expected. After step 2  loading takes precisely   30 seconds  then the desired email conversation is displayed  but an error   box comes up saying:    Some Gmail features have failed to load due to an Internet connectivity   problem. If this problem persists  try reloading the page  using the older   version  or using basic HTML mode. Learn More.    After pressing OK  interface works as expected. Looking at Developer   Tools  no XHR is sent until *after* the 30 seconds have passed. Note that   this issue does not occur in Google Chrome 4.0.249.30; an XHR is sent   immediately when the message entry is clicked. Is this a V8 regression?    Tested with all extensions disabled. No proxy being used. No log messages   printed to console. </pre>
