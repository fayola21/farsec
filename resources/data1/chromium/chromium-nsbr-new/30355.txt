<title>Issue 30355 -   chromium -    XMLHttpRequests at times bypass the host network stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Copying contents from a user post.  Hi     While testing our web application with CF we had some strange problems  with CF getting access denied errors for some ajax requests some of  the time. It seemed like some of the ajax requests made from within a  CF rendered page were not sharing the IE's authenticated session  cookie.    I tried reproducing the problem with a simple test application  and I  think the problem has to do with making ajax requests to relative  URL's starting with &quot;../&quot;. For instance if page at &quot;/application/  index.html&quot; makes an ajax request to &quot;rest/resource&quot;  the IE cookies  and session are shared  but if the page is located at &quot;/application/  pages/index.html&quot; and request is made to &quot;../rest/resource&quot;  the ajax  request doesn't containt the IE cookies (and the UA is that of Chrome   not IE+CF).    The test application is available at    http://83.169.19.87/chromeframe/    1) login with test/test  2) click link &quot;AJAX-request test page&quot; (/chromeframe/pages/other.jsp)  3) the headers of the request to this page are first written to the  top of the page  4) once the page is loaded  it makes an ajax request to ../ajax/  ajaxResponse.jsp   * ajaxResponse.jsp takes the headers out of the ajax request and  wraps them into a json object and returns it   * the code on other.jsp then dumps the ajax response to the bottom of  the page    With FF 3.5.5  Chrome 3.0.195.33 and IE 7 (without CF) the headers on  the top of the page are same as the ones inside the json object dumped  to the bottom (except for the x-requested-with  accept headers). With  IE 7 + CF the ajax request is returned the contents of the login page  instead  which is dumped where the json contents should go. The login  page displays the headers as well  and now both the session id and the  UA are different from the ones sent in the previous request.    Is this a known issue/feature?
