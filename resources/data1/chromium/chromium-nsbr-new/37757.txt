<title>Issue 37757 -   chromium -    new Date().getDate() won't update when system date is changed to a previous day. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Output current day.  2. Change system date to a previous date.  3. Refresh page.      The new Date().getDate() value should update during changes on system date   on browser refresh.      new Date().getDate() only updates when you do positive changes to system   date  i.e. changing date to tomorrow's date. When negative changes to the   system date is made  the function will output the day of the last/greatest   date before the change  i.e. changing the date from march 3 to march 2 will   output 2. Its value only updates correctly upon re-opening script  i.e.   closing webpage and opening it again.    <b>Please provide
