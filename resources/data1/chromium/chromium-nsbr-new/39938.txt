<title>Issue 39938 -   chromium -    Options and Chrome alert windows get huge crazy sizes after visiting bank website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. logging in the www.bancomercantil.com website  2. clicking on the ENTRAR button (the one by the right side with the yellow   arrow next to it)        Options window and Chrome alert window sizes should not change. They should   always be at the original regular size.      Options window and Chrome alert windows fill up the screen  the same way   the website fills the screen after clicking ENTRAR. The OK and CANCEL   buttons remain hidden under the Start menu bar  so I must resize the window   by double clicking on the status bar in order to be able to see OK and   CANCEL. However it does not get to original window size when I do that.    <b>Please provide
