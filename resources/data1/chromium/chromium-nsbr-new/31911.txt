<title>Issue 31911 -   chromium -    SyncerCommands need to make separate passes over data items for each model thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Because we need to process items pertaining to a certain data type only from   the Chrome thread that the native model lives on  and we have a   heterogeneous (w.r.t data type) Directory  we need to make multiple passes   over sets of SyncEntities  one for each &quot;model safe thread&quot;  and take care to   only process items belonging to a type that lives on the current thread.    This &quot;filtering&quot; needs to be instrumented to several loops in SyncerCommands   (such as ApplyUpdates  BuildAndProcessConflictSets  .. possibly any command   that uses a WriteTransaction). </pre>
