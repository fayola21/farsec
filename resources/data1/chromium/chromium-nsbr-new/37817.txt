<title>Issue 37817 -   chromium -    Autofill profile dialog should scroll as I tab between fields to make them visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the AutoFill profiles dialog box. Add a few new addresses. Once it   starts to scroll  fill out one field and press Tab to move to the next field.   Notice eventually focus moves off the bottom of the visible area of the   scrollview.    Two things:  - when you add a new address I think the view should scroll such that the   entire &quot;add&quot; form is visible  - if for some reason this is not possible  or the user then scrolls the   dialog manually back up  pressing &quot;tab&quot; should always ensure the focused   field is scrolled into view. </pre>
