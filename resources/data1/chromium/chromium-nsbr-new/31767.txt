<title>Issue 31767 -   chromium -    Add tests for NPN_ConvertPoint and NPN_PopUpContextMenu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since we don't have the necessary test infrastructure on the Mac yet (<a title="Implement UI automation on Mac" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26102"> bug 26102 </a>)  NPN_ConvertPoint   and NPN_PopupContextMenu will be landing without tests. As soon as we have the UI automation    I'll be following up with tests for them. </pre>
