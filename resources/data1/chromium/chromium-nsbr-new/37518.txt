<title>Issue 37518 -   chromium -    Limited number of WebWorkers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)            Firefox 3.x: OK              I should be able to create and run as many web workers as I want.        On a freshly started Chrome  I can create 16 web workers that work as they  should. The 17th never replies.    Try opening the attached html file. Every click on the Work! button creates  a web worker. The web worker simply posts back the event.data. Note that  every time it logs &quot;Running X&quot;  the web worker will respond and we log  &quot;Finished X&quot;. But only 16 times. Then the new web workers don't seem to run  any more (or at least  they don't post anything back).    Looking in Process Explorer  I can see that every new worker spawns a new  process  but only up to 16.    I try to terminate the workers with both close() inside the worker and  worker.terminate() from the main thread. Neither changes the behaviour. </pre>
