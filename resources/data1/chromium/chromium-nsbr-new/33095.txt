<title>Issue 33095 -   chromium -    Any HTTPS site gets the &quot;unable to check whether server's certificate was revoked&quot; error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Move the Windows time one month ahead (if we're in Jan  move 30 days   ahead into Feb).  2. Open any HTTPS website.  3. For instance  try Facebook.com.  4. Moreover  try logging into  Chrome's synchronization login dialog   (Google account's login page).        1. No HTTPS certificate error should appear  2. Facebook should login  3. Chrome's synchronization login should work.      1. Red-line appears across HTTPS icon  and an error notification bar pops   out saying &quot;Unable to check whether server's certificate was revoked.&quot;  2. As for Facebook  once I hit the login button with correct   username/password  the site opens a new login page and gives a nonsensical   error saying &quot;you must login to this page.&quot;  3. As for Chrome's synchronization login page  given the correct username   and password  it gives an error: cannot communicate with server!      <b>Please provide
