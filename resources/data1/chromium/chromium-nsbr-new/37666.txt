<title>Issue 37666 -   chromium -    Support bitmap-only fonts in renderers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We support fonts that are scalable but contain bitmaps for some font sizes    but we don't support fonts that are bitmap-only.  This in particular   includes &quot;old-style&quot; X fonts.    I believe this is due to the code that chooses which font to use being far   away from the code that determines which size of the previously-chosen font   to use.    agl understands this better than me and maybe can write a more intelligent   description  but I thought I'd write this bug so we can dup other bugs   against it. </pre>
