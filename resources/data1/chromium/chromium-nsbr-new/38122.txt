<title>Issue 38122 -   chromium -    feature request: tools menu entry &quot;close tab&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 (Official Build 39572) beta    Other browsers (IE  Firefox) have a &quot;close window&quot; or &quot;close tab&quot; option on   their file menu.  This is accessible via 'Alt-f c'.    Chromium now supports Alt-f to pull up the tools menu  it would be great if   it could provide a close window / close tab option with key binding 'c' on   that menu.    this would make migration easier for people who use other browsers.  (I've   got &quot;alt-f c&quot; burned into my brain  and the other close-tab key bindings are   much harder for me to hit... this is the only reason why I don't use   Chrome/chromium at this time.  Really.) </pre>
