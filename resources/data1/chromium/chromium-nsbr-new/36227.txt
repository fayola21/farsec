<title>Issue 36227 -   chromium -    Almost entire tab bar becomes white when using the address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.330.0 (Developer Build 39184) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Chrome 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta       Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Type any string into the address bar.  2. Press enter to go to the website or perform a search.      The tab bar shows no changes  other than normal tab title changes.      The entire bar glitches out and becomes solid white  except for the active   tab. This seems to happen only during resolving of hostnames  as the glitch   lasts noticeably longer when visiting a website on the internet as opposed   to  say  the about: URLs or localhost. As soon as the host is resolved and   the website begins loading  the tab bar returns to normal.   </pre>
