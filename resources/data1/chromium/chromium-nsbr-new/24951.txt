<title>Issue 24951 -   chromium -    scroll wheel leakage to occluded windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5    OS version               : OSX 10.5.8             1. Open a window in chrome  visiting a page that has room to scroll  2. Make sure that there is another window underneath it which also has   room to scroll (this can be another Chrome window or a window of another   application)  3. Move the pointer to the Chrome window  to an area at which the   rectangles of the two windows mentioned above intersect.  4. Use an external mouse scroll wheel (mine is a dell wired mouse) to scroll   the Chrome window. Do it fast and enthusiastically  not click by click. It   might have to do with moving the mouse a bit too  so if you're too careful   this won't reproduce.        The Chrome window  since it's on top  scrolls.        The Chrome window scrolls but also the occluded window scrolls.   </pre>
