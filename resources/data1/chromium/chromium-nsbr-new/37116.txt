<title>Issue 37116 -   chromium -    Trying to close a pinned tab causes it to blank out and not close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Only Chrome      1. Right click on a tab and click &quot;Pin tab&quot;.  2. Try to close the tab by either middle clicking it or right clicking on   it and clicking &quot;Close tab&quot;.      Not sure  depends on how you look at it. A pinned tab should not be   closeable  I believe that is the point of pinning it in the first place.   So  the &quot;Close tab&quot; context item should be blanked out and disabled  and   middle click should do nothing  so the tab could be truly pinned. This is   how Opera 10.5 behaves. Or  if the purpose of pinning a tab in Chrome is   simply to make it smaller  then the tab should close normally.      The user is switched to the next tab  and the pinned tab blanks out. Once   you switch to the &quot;closed&quot; pinned tab  it will reload the page it was on   prior to blanking out. Then the tab behaves normally as if you never closed   it. Basically  trying to close a pinned tab causes a tab switch and a   refresh of the pinned tab. </pre>
