<title>Issue 27666 -   chromium -    Size buildbot chart does not match binary size of installed code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release/sizes/report.html">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/linux-release/sizes/report.html</a>  says we're around 44mb     but ls -l /opt/google/chrome/chrome  says we're around 40mb.    Which is correct?  Are we doing extra stripping when we release?   </pre>
