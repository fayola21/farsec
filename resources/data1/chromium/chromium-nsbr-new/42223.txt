<title>Issue 42223 -   chromium -    Same script listed multiple times in scripts panel - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Refiling <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37365">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37365</a> as a Chromium bug as requested.    I hit this all the time trying to debug http://test-  results.appspot.com/dashboards/flakiness_dashboard.html. Don't know how to give reproducible   steps. Also  often when I see this  some of the duplicates are empty (as in  I selected them from the   Scripts dropdown and the script content area is empty).    By the way  why don't we leave these in bugs.webkit.org since the code changes will most likely be   upstream? Seems like leaving the bugs upstream but changing the subject to start with [Chromium]   is better.   </pre>
