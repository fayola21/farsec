<title>Issue 42536 -   chromium -    Display an info-bar when chrome was updated asking the user to restart the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run chrome.  2. Upgrade to latest version.        I'd like to see some information that tells me that i'm not running the   latest version installed on the system.    This would also be useful for chrome-os       </pre>
