<title>Issue 23523 -   chromium -    Insanely high CPU consumption by Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Open about 10 tabs including two tabs of gmail (corporate and external   account)  calendar  reader  docs  and other random tabs  2. very quickly the CPU consumption grows insane and the browser becomes   not responsive. I also get the dialog &quot;do you want to stop the plugin quite   often&quot;. [my plugins are Gears 0.5.32.0  flash and Google talk]. I have to   play cat and mouse with busy tabs and close them from time to time to free   some CPU. I am considering to move back to FF.     Screenshot of CPU graph attached.                <b>Please provide
