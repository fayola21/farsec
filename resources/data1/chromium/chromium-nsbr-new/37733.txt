<title>Issue 37733 -   chromium -    (Design issue) &quot;Plugin has crashed...&quot; top-bar is present on every tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 (Official Build 40461) dev      1. Open a couple dozen tabs with flash content  2. Kill flash    This results in 20 tabs or more  each with an annoying &quot;Flash has crashed...&quot; top-bar yellow   dialogue. Purely an annoyance  not a bug per se.    A couple of notes:   * More often than not  flash is just in ads. The user doesn't really care if an &quot;ad has   crashed&quot;   * More relevant content (other plugins...) is usually larger  the user can quickly identify   what is wrong with the current sad-plugin-icon image.    Proposed fixes:   * Only show the yellow bar on the current tab. Possible issue: Something crashes when the user   changes tabs/the user doesn't pay attention to it  comes back much later and wonders &quot;What the   hell is that?&quot;   * Show it on every tab until the info bar is closed  at which point it should be closed on   every tab.   * Same as above  but only show it when the user accesses a tab with flash content.   * Keep it as it is (there may well be a perfectly good reason why it is as it is now)   * Remove the yellow bar entirely (see below)      It feels a bit redundant to issue warnings in multiple locations for a plugin crash. Perhaps   there could be a note accompanying the plugin crashed image  or just a message log in   about:plugins  and get rid of the yellow bar altogether. Thoughts? </pre>
