<title>Issue 43237 -   chromium -    SPDY NetLog integration - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should add a section to track SPDY streams and SPDY control frames in   chrome://net2.    We should also fix TODOs like (spdy_session.cc):      // TODO(mbelshe): can we figure out how to use a NetLog here?      stream = new SpdyStream(this  stream_id  true  BoundNetLog());   </pre>
