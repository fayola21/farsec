<title>Issue 25374 -   chromium -    Re-enable -fstack-protector-all (debug) and -Wl -pie (all) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29591">r29591</a>  I added -fstack-protector-all to debug builds.  It caused debug-  mode layout test failures (<a title="LayoutTest failures since r29591" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25372"> bug 25372 </a>).  In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29601">r29601</a>  I backed it out.    In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29592">r29592</a>  I added -Wl -pie to all builds to make executables load at random   addresses.  It caused Valgrind failures.  Apparently  Valgrind doesn't   understand slide.  In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29602">r29602</a>  I backed it out.    It would be good if we could get both of these features reenabled. </pre>
