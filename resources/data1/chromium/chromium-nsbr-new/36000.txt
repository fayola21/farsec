<title>Issue 36000 -   chromium -    Zoom functionality is disabled in IE8 on the Google Calendar page when Chrome Frame is enabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 5.0.317.0          1. Enable Chrome Frame in IE8  2. Go to Google Calendar in IE8  3. Go to View &gt; Zoom    What do you expect to happen? The Zoom menu should include a list of   options to zoom in/out  choose a preset zoom level  or set a custom zoom   level. Also  the current zoom level should be displayed on the status bar   in the lower right  where the zoom menu should also be accessible.    What do you see instead? The Zoom menu within the View menu is completely   empty  and the zoom level does not appear on the status bar (nor is the   zoom menu accessible from the status bar). The only way to change the zoom   on the Google Calendar page is to use CTRL+ and CTRL- -- all other zoom   functionality disappears.    If I disable Chrome Frame and restart IE  the problem goes away. So far  I   only notice this problem on the Google Calendar page (not on the Gmail   page or any other websites).     </pre>
