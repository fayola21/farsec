<title>Issue 45504 -   chromium -    compile chromium win from linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be awesome if we could compile chromium win using mingw on linux.  This would have the   following benefits:    - use of distcc &amp; ccache  - better dependency checking than visual studio    This wouldn't be for a shipping binary  this would just be for helping save developer build time.  It   has the following disadvantages:    - another gyp target to support  - VS debugger wouldn't work  but web search suggests that gdb may work   </pre>
