<title>Issue 33344 -   chromium -    WorkerHttpAuth and SharedWorkerHttpAuth tests failing  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For some reason  no http auth dialog is appearing on the build bots when this   test is run (we are timing out while waiting for it to appear).    This works fine on the try bots  so it seems that the code itself is fine - I'm   disabling these tests on windows pending further investigation. </pre>
