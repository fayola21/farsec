<title>Issue 43671 -   chromium -    syncapi should enforce a maximum size on EntitySpecifics - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Non-ASCII character display garble text in saved autofill data after browser relaunch" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38364"> Bug 38364 </a> corrupted many dev channel user's autofill stores with very long   (many megabyte) entries.  Some of these entries were so huge as to be   uncommittable.    We should cap the size of individual EntitySpecifics at the syncapi layer as   a defense mechanism against such bugs with current and future datatypes.    Clients of the syncapi will have to handle failure on Set*Specifics   operations.    Additionally  we should cap the entire size of a ClientToServerMessage so   that the client doesn't send oversized messages to the server that have no   chance of succeeding. </pre>
