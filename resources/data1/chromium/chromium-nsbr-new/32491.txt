<title>Issue 32491 -   chromium -    Cannot open local files with spaces in filename - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	4.0.249.64 (Developer Build 35722)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.19  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.64 Safari/532.5  ----------------------    Chromium cannot open local files with spaces in their filename.  This happens on Linux with Gnome.      1. Save the current page for example  2. Open it with Chromium  3. See a gazillion 404 tabs being opened      Chromium should open the file    I tried the following *without* success:  * to run chromium from the console and quote the filename  * to escape spaces with   * to change %U to %F in the chromium.desktop file    The only way it worked was by replacing spaces with %20 from the command   line  but this is very inconvenient. </pre>
