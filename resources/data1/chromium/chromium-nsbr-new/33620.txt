<title>Issue 33620 -   chromium -    webgl: slow shaders on shadertoy can make whole machine very janky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/shadertoy/">http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/shadertoy/</a>    select one of the following shaders: (in order of severity)  - 3D / Lunaquatic  - 3D / Slisesix  - 3D / Valleyball  - 3D / Quaternion  - 3D / Road to Ribbon  - 3D / Disco    Although the CPU isn't particularly busy when these run (only one core is   pegged)  the whole machine becomes unresponsive.  Typing in any process   becomes extremely slow and janky.  All of these shaders report running at   less than 20fps for me.  The worse is running at 3fps. (maybe the slow   performance is a separate bug)    For the other shaders that run above 30fps  the machine seems to run as if   nothing bad is happening.   </pre>
