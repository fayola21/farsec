<title>Issue 24567 -   chromium -    missing feature - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi Developers!  It's not a bug. Just a missing feature. I used to use Firefox. When you  type some expression to the adress bar it takes you to the &quot;I'm felling  lucky&quot; page of google. I'm really missing it. Change the search  preferencies! The world would be perfect again.    Peace!    k </pre>
