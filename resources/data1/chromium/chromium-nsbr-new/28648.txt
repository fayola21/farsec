<title>Issue 28648 -   chromium -    Create Master Password for Saved Passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I personally do not feel safe allowing anyone access to my computer to just   click maybe three buttons and see all of my passwords; from a security   standpoint  this is A HUGE defect.  What is the use of having passwords if   they can all be seen so easily.    So I propose creating a master password to be able to view all of the saved   passwords  for increased security. </pre>
