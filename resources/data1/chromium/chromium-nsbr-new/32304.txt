<title>Issue 32304 -   chromium -    Xmodmap'd keys on linux apply modded state incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. setup an xmodmap file to map keys to something special  i.e.   (This setup is probably rare  but other users might have problems with  extended latin keys such as umlauts).  keycode 66 = Mode_switch  keysym i = i I Up  keysym j = j J Left   keysym k = k K Down   keysym l = l L Right   2. run said map: &quot;xmodmap .Xmodmap&quot;  3. Try to enter the text &quot;ijkl&quot; in a chrome text box      &quot;ijkl&quot; should be entered      The keys navigate the text box instead (as they should only when I hold my  mod key  which happens to be capslock).     </pre>
