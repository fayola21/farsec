<title>Issue 37745 -   chromium -    Mac: new tab button runs into incognito badge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   - create an incognito window  then lots of tabs    This one may be my fault  and I have a fix. (The old code which cut down the size of the tab strip on   the right is a bit suboptimal  since this results in a weird cut-off effect when dragging tabs towards   the right and since we should let tabs temporarily go over the badge.) </pre>
