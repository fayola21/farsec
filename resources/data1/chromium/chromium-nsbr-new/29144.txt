<title>Issue 29144 -   chromium -    Large stroke widths in SVG rendered incorrectly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      Open the attached SVG  which uses a large coordinate system.      Appears the same as FF.      Strokes are too thin.    This is a regression between 4.0.249.11 and 4.0.249.21. Tested on Linux   only  but my guess is it is a Skia issue. </pre>
