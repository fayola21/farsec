<title>Issue 27496 -   chromium -    Add an indicator for which search engine is used to search through the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0 (Ubuntu build 31665)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A           Safari 4: it has search engine bar with icon indicator OK    Firefox 3.x: it has search engine bar with icon indicator OK           IE 7: it has search engine bar with icon indicator OK           IE 8: it has search engine bar with icon indicator OK          Opera: it has search engine bar with icon indicator OK        there isn't any indicator/icon telling you which search engine you are using in that   moment  and chromium doesn't have a spearated search engine bar.          get a separated search bar  or a way to easily determine which search engine is set   in that moment.        As we can state all browsers (opera  IE  Firefox  Safari) have a separated search   engine bar  with a small icon indicating the search eengine that you use in that   moment. Chromium has the search enginge bar mixed with URL bar and no icon appears.  We should wonder why  and why chromium doesn't have one.  It's really usefull for users to NOT have such bar  or it is just something to say   &quot;we think different&quot; from others?  I have some doubt  and to be honest I found useful the search bar from the other   browsers.    I know it's possible to change the search engine in chromium by right-clicking on   the bar  but in my opinion this is not the best. Most of the times I prefear typing   the complete url of the search engine  because after I can forget to reverse the   previous search engine.......... and next time I don't know which search engine has   been set.     </pre>
