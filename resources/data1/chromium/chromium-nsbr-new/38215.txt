<title>Issue 38215 -   chromium -    Add Alpha  Beta and Stable versions to Extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be very useful for Extension Developers if we had the ability to   publish alpha  beta and stable versions of our extensions. This way extension   users could subscribe to a certain version and developers could deploy code   to a smaller subset of their users enabling us to get earlier feedback and   fix bugs. </pre>
