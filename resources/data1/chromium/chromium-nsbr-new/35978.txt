<title>Issue 35978 -   chromium -    onDrop does not fire and -webkit-user-drop has no effect - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 - 5.0.328.0           Safari 4: OK  WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=54757">r54757</a>: OK (Safari)    See the attached page for a testcase.  To reproduce: load page  then try to  drag a word onto the target.    Expected result: An alert that says &quot;drop&quot; should appear.  Also  the cursor  should show that dropping is permitted.    What happens: onDrop does not fire the event.  The cursor shows that  dropping is not allowed.    All other events (ondragstart  ondrag  ondragend; ondragenter  ondragover   ondragleave) successfully fire  except for ondrop.   </pre>
