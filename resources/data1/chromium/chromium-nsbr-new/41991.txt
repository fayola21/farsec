<title>Issue 41991 -   chromium -    Multi View - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium could support Konqueror's functions  &quot;Window &gt; Split View Left/Right&quot;  which splits window into two views which can   be independent or linked with &quot;View &gt; Link View&quot;.   If views are linked   one view can be locked with &quot;View &gt; Lock To Current   Location&quot;. If link is clicked in locked view  page is loaded in other view.  Other functions could be supported:  Open Link in New View - window is splitted  page is loaded in new view  Open Link in Other View - page is loaded in inactive view         </pre>
