<title>Issue 26255 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar doesn't draw correctly in the Ratchet and Clank theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1) Apply the Ratchet and Clank theme.  2) Always Show Bookmark Bar  3) Notice that there is several pixels at the bottom of the bookmark bar   that are white.  4) Hit Ctrl+F.  5) Notice that the find bar doesn't have a themed background.    Conjecture: We do not appear to be repeating the background image   vertically. </pre>
