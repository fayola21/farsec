<title>Issue 31275 -   chromium -    Display Gears-based databases in Developer Tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://devtools/devtools.html  Other browsers tested: None    The Developer Tools (Web Inspector) should be extended to support the   viewing (and possibly editing) of Google Gears local databases under the   Storage tab  as well as HTML5 Storage databases.    The Google Gears databases can be accessed in a similar way to HTML5   databases and are accessible via JavaScript from the Developer Tools   window. As such  it should be possible but I have yet to look deeply at the   Developer Tools code and only had a quick crash course in   <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html">http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html</a> .    Having this allows user's to easily view / debug applications that still   use Gears database API  such as GMail Offline. </pre>
