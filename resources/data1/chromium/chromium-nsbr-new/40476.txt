<title>Issue 40476 -   chromium -    pinned tab navigation is unpredictable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> if you type an address into the url for a pinned tab and press enter  it   opens it as a new tab. However  if you press a bookmark button on a pinned   tab  it navigates in the pinned tab. I don't know if this is intentional but   it confused me when I accidentally navigated away from mail and couldn't get   back by typing &quot;m/&quot;. </pre>
