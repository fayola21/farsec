<title>Issue 38405 -   chromium -    Mac: Not possible to set cookie expiration in cookie prompt dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to Preferences -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Content Settings  choose &quot;ask me when a site tries   to set data&quot;  2. Go to a site that tries to set a cookie with an expiration (i.e. not a session cookie).  3. in the modal prompt  toggle the disclosure triangle.    What is the expected output?     There should be a popup menu allowing the user to change the expiration on a cookie to the   end of the session if it set that way already.    What do you see instead?    The expiration is static text. </pre>
