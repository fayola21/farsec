<title>Issue 37253 -   chromium -    Mac: Flash input broken/offset when page is zoomed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a split from <a title="Windowless plugin (e.g.  some Flash) mouse input broken/offset when page is zoomed"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9996">Issue 9996</a>    Under Mac  the issue is reproducible using Chrome but not using Safari so   the fix might be different than the one needed for Windows (where both   Safari &amp; Chrome are affected)    Steps:  1. Go to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/freakedfrequency">http://www.myspace.com/freakedfrequency</a> or any myspace page with   an embedded music player)  2. Zoom page to more than 100%  3. Try clicking on the player controls or hover the mouse over songs    Issue:  If zoom != 100% neither the buttons nor the song highlight work. It appears    as if the player is picking up offset input.  </pre>
