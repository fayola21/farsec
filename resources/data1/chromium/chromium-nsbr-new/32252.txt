<title>Issue 32252 -   chromium -    changes Chrome's own window state and moves other (unrelated!) windows to another screen when search-in-page fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. visit any webpage  2. presss Control+F  3. enter a random string that is not present on that page      the Chrome window should not change its state and other windows (completely   unrelated to chrome) should not be touched (should not change their state   nor move to other screens).      Chrome window disapears  some other windows reshuffle along z-axis (appear   and disapear)  then chrome comes on top and maximizes to fullscreen (like   hitting F11 and it shows the baloon about F11  except that I did not do use   F11).  This bling-bling happens quickly  but if I type quickly this reshufling   continues for longer period and I loose control over entire desktop for   that time  windows change their positions and the layout of windows is   messed up.    Please provide
