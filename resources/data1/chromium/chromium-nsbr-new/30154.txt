<title>Issue 30154 -   chromium -    What's -[AutocompleteTextEditField textView:doCommandBySelector:]? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Errors in the 10.6 SDK build:    .../chrome/browser/cocoa/autocomplete_text_field.mm: In function 'BOOL  -[AutocompleteTextField  textView:doCommandBySelector:](AutocompleteTextField*  objc_selector*   NSTextView*  objc_selector*)':  .../chrome/browser/cocoa/autocomplete_text_field.mm:212: warning:  'StyledTextField' may not respond to '-textView:doCommandBySelector:'    -textView:doCommandBySelector: is an NSTextViewDelegate method  but  AutocompleteTextField is an NSTextView subclass.  Is it also supposed to be  its own delegate?  I don't see any mention of delegates in  autocomplete_text_field.mm or styled_text_field.mm (which defines its  immediate superclass).    Scott  what's intended here? </pre>
