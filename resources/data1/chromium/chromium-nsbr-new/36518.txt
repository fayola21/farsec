As expected.    Not tested.      1. Create a GWT ListBox with no items and only a default message. Add a   Window.alert(..) for a ClickHandler attached to the ListBox.  2. Click on it on Chrome/Mac  3. Nothing happens. Click Event is dropped.        Expect a Window to pop up.        Nothing.     --    This is specific to Chrome on MAc. FF  Safari  Chrome/Linux do not drop the   click event.    Note. If the ListBox contains &gt;=1 items in addition to default message  the   Change event works. However  click does not.   </pre>
