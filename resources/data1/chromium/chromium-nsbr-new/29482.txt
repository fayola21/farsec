Run Chrome in Windows.    2. Browse enough to populate thumbnails in the new tab page.  3. Note the speed at which the new tab page loads when one is opened   (feels instantaneous).  4. Repeat above steps on Mac version of Chrome using same computer...      Expect new tab page to load very quickly.      New tab page has noticeable lag time in rendering itself  feels slow and   disjointed. </pre>
