<title>Issue 24206 -   chromium -    Page sometimes produces an extra newline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ( Migrated from http://buganizer/issue?id=1126050 ).    pamg on April 14 2008 11:48  (New)  Summary     Page sometimes produces an extra newline  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; WebKit  Reporter     pamg  CC     chrome-bugs  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Hotlist     chrome-layout-test-bugs  Cr__Rel_1.0  Cr__Untriaged  Notes  LayoutTestshttptestsnavigationchanging-frame-hierarchy-in-onload.html    On KJS  this nearly always fails.  On V8  it's been passing about 1/3 of  the time. When it fails  it's because of a single extra blank line at the  end of the test results.  It's not at all clear why that happens.    It's not very important by itself  but it indicates some non-determinism  (flakiness) somewhere else in the app.  mal on April 17 2008 15:53  (New)  Hotlist     chrome-layout-test-bugs  Cr__Rel_1.0  eseidel on May 01 2008 14:02  (New)  Hotlist     chrome-layout-test-bugs  Cr__Rel_Future  Notes  This test has been deferred.
