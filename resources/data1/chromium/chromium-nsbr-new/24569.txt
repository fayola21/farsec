<title>Issue 24569 -   chromium -    chromeframe user agent confuses browser detection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Web sites that use a simple regex for &quot;chrome&quot; to detect the Chrome   browser will confuse IE for Chrome when Chrome Frame is installed. If they   the web site thinks it's talking to Chrome instead of IE  it may attempt   to let the user install Chrome themes and extensions  record incorrect   analytics data  block the user if Chrome isn't supported  and so on.    I'm not sure how often this happens in the wild although it happened to me   once while working on a Chrome extension.    There are workarounds for the web site but I could see it causing   unexpected behavior since there's a lot of browser sniffing code that's   not aware of Chrome Frame yet. It might make sense to use a string that   doesn't have Chrome such as &quot;cfplugin&quot; &quot;cframe&quot; &quot;chromiumframe&quot; etc. to   make it harder to mistake a Chrome-Frame-enabled IE for Chrome.   </pre>
