<title>Issue 30970 -   chromium -    Display different error message when internet connection is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   (Filing a feature request on behalf of mack@google.com)    Currently  when a given webpage is not reachable  the following error   message is displayed:    This webpage is not available.  The webpage at <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a> might be temporarily down or it may have   moved permanently to a new web address.      The same error message is displayed if (A) the example.com server is   actually down  or (B) the user's network connection is down (e.g.  wi-fi is   disabled or not connected).      Feature request: Chrome should be able to detect when the user's network   connection is not enabled at all (or maybe just do a ping to google.com to   see if it's reachable?)  and in that case  display a different error   message. E.g.  &quot;please check your Internet connection and try again&quot;.   (instead of implying that the remote server is down)    FWIW  Firefox displays a different error message when the user's network   connection is disabled (something about being in &quot;offline mode&quot;). </pre>
