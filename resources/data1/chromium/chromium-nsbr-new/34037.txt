<title>Issue 34037 -   chromium -    Always on top bug. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi   I found a bug. I always use the &quot;auto-hide taskbar&quot; option  but when I use   google chrome  google chrome often gets on top. Over the taskbar  so that I   can't reach the taskbar. I first have to minimize the window  before I can   use the taskbar. I.E. when using Windows Live Messenger  the taskbar pops up   when I receive a message. The taskbar pops up behind the google chrome   window  so that I can't see the taskbar popping up. I'm not sure whether this   is a security bug  but I still wanted to remind you to it.    Yours     Jorinde Mallinckrodt </pre>
