<title>Issue 24377 -   chromium -    themes leave junk in user preferences JSON file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My Preferences file is 100k.  Most of it are themes that I installed while   trying out different themes.  I bet a 100k Preferences file causes my   startup to be slower.    It would be nice if we could remove entries for themes that we're no longer   using.  I realize it's a bit tricky because you can undo a theme install    but I think that's the only other way to go back.    One idea is to write a JSON file into each theme directory and only keep the   current theme's data in the Preferences file. </pre>
