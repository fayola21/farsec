<title>Issue 34738 -   chromium -    [usaa.com] password and pin fields are saved as a single saved password (entering each overwrites it) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Login to USAA account (requires name and password)    - this loads the &quot;account listings&quot; page  2. Click on a checking or savings account (requires PIN)    - this loads a &quot;enter your PIN&quot; page  3. Allow browser to save passwords        The password and PIN should be saved separately (they are entered on   separate pages).     In IE8  the PIN field doesn't get saved (although it might be user error   that I accidentally told it not to).    In Firefox 3.5.7  both the password and pin are saved fine and if I log out   and repeat the steps  the password is filled in the password field fine and   the pin is filled in the pin field fine.            The browser doesn't seem to understand these are 2 separate fields (perhaps   because they're both type=password?).  After letting the browser save the   initial password  it's filled in for the PIN field on the later page.  When   then correcting and typing in the correct PIN (which has a different number   of characters in my case  so it's easy to tell which is getting filled in)    then after logging out and logging back in  the PIN value is what's pre-  populated in the password field.    <b>Please provide
