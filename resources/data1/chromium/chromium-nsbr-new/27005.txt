<title>Issue 27005 -   chromium -    Session restore kills my newly created tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. With the Session Restore Infobar visible press Ctrl+T  2. Type in an address and press enter  3. Go back to the New Tab page and press Restore    It would be nice if Session Restore would not kill the navigation I have in   progress in my new tab as it restores  but unfortunately -- it did.   </pre>
