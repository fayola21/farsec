<title>Issue 36587 -   chromium -    Incognito download appearance for items in Incognito downloads page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Even though we can now show downloads performed in the incognito window in   the downloads tab of the incognito window  we should color them differently   so it's clear they'll disappear when the incognito session is ended:    From Brian:    &quot;We should show a &quot;special UI&quot; (shaded background in the same color as the   incog window tint and maybe some explanatory text) on any items that will be   deleted after incognito ends. &quot;     </pre>
