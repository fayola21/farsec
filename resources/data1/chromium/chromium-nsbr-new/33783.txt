<title>Issue 33783 -   chromium -    Unusable scrollbar for extension icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I've install Lastpass extension and I've found that there is a   adjustable thing like '||' at the top right beside address bar.  2. After I adjust it to the smallest  I can't scroll down for my Lastpass   extension.  3. I've test it with other extension and none of it show up which means   that the scroll thingy is not functioning.      It should scroll down and show the extension that I've hidden up.      Nothing happen when I click the scroll down button. It's not doing   anything.    <b>Please provide
