<title>Issue 45308 -   chromium -    Improvements of TAB searching (automatic detection  shortcut) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now when i enter some hostname followed by TAB like youtube.com[TAB]   i can search that webpage using it's own search engine...    there are few things that can be improved about this...    1.) right now search is allowed on some whitelisted pages probably known   from google's index. but every page can contain some metatags specifiing   it's search API (URL). Why we are not getting this on fly for pages that we   have visited in the past? eg. google can't index webpages on my LAN (at   least i hope so) and there are several pages that are not indexed. i think   this should be done by browser itself - not by google.    maybe there can also be some interface for inspecting (and editing) such   database in each browser.      2.) add some shortcut to do such TAB search on current website.  CTRL+L = select whole adress bar  CTRL+G = delete adress bar and prepend it with &quot;?&quot;    there should be hotkey for something like  &quot;delete everything from adressbar but protocol and hostname and open custom   search (means press TAB)&quot;    TAB search is not working if URL in adressbar contains some path  in such   case TAB just makes me jump to another input on the page... </pre>
