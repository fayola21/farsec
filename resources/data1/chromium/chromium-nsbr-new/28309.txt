<title>Issue 28309 -   chromium -    &quot;Import Bookmarks and Settings&quot; needs &quot;��_��__&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per Apple HIG  menu items that open dialog need a trailing &quot;��_��__&quot; (that's opt-;    not three dots btw). &quot;Import Bookmarks and Settings&quot; (in the Chrome menu)   doesn't have that.    Given the &quot;What is there should be polished&quot; mantra  I think this should be   m4 (if string freeze allows it). </pre>
