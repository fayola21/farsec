<title>Issue 33006 -   chromium -    Add basic file operations for the download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I want to move the downloaded file to another folder  I have to click the   triangle and choose &quot;Show in folder&quot;  and then cut the file. When there are   lots of downloaded files in the folder  the operation is somewhat time   consuming.    Could you please add some basic file operations like copy  cut  or delete in   the popup menu of triangles in download bar? </pre>
