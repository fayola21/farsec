<title>Issue 39821 -   chromium -    [Native Translate] Contradictory items are selected simultaneously in the Options menu on the Translation Info Bar. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The report below is copied and pasted from windows bug  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39174">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39174</a>.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.359.0 (Official Build 42151) dev        1. launch Chrome with English UI  2. go to non-english wib site (ex: <a href="http://yahoo.co.jp">http://yahoo.co.jp</a>)  3. click Options from the Translator info bar   4. check the &quot;Always translate X to Y&quot;  and &quot;Never translate X&quot;      What is the expected result?  They shouldn't be selected simultaneously.    What happens instead?  &quot;Always translate X to Y&quot;  and &quot;Never translate X&quot; can be checked at the   same time.  Since they are opposite meaning  users might get confused.    Roma and Brian say to disable the contradictory options.    </pre>
