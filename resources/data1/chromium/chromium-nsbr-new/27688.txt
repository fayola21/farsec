<title>Issue 27688 -   chromium -    Extensions might need an increased WebDatabase quota - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As discussed in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/bdeff2aa3a2f1867">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/bdeff2aa3a2f1867</a> extensions should have unlimited quota for   LocalStorage + DB.    Also  when users uninstall extensions we should probably see if they want to remove the storage space used.  It might also be good to have a way for a user to   see how much space extensions are using (around where we show how much memory they're using). </pre>
