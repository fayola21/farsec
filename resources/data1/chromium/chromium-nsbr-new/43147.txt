<title>Issue 43147 -   chromium -    IMP: Need to enable clipboard inside extensions by using javascriptcanaccessclipboard property - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I recently fixed a webkit bug <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27751">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27751</a>  which disabled use of clipboard for web pages. however  it also disabled  clipboard inside extensions which i think we dont want (adam can confirm  that as well from a security perspective). I temporarily disabled the  unittest till we fix it.   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1925001/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/1925001/show</a>    Can you help me out here since we might need to fix this urgently to  prevent extension breakage for dev channel and i am not familiar with  extensions code.   </pre>
