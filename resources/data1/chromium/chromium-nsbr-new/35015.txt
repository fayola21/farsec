<title>Issue 35015 -   chromium -    Word wrapping incorrect when using quotes after question mark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have some elements in my HTML that contain quotations that end with   question marks  i.e.:          &lt;blockquote&gt;          &amp;ldquo;Is &amp;lsquo;hiding&amp;rsquo; the real prices a sign of trust and           partnership?&amp;rdquo;        &lt;/blockquote&gt;    In Chrome  the quote character after the question mark is wrapping to the   next line.  This happens for &quot;  &amp;rdquo;  and even '.  The other browsers do   the right thing and keep the question mark and quote fixed to the last word   of the sentence.  I experienced this with blockquotes  but I verified the   same thing happens for paragraphs.    Chrome Version: 4.0.249.78      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK   </pre>
