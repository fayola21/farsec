<title>Issue 27909 -   chromium -    ScopedRunnableMethodFactory running tasks after RevokeAll() is called - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebPluginImpl has a ScopedRunnableMethodFactory&lt;WebPluginImpl&gt; method_factory_;  In a debugger I can see:    WebPluginImpl::updateGeometry() is called which does:    MessageLoop::current()-&gt;PostDelayedTask(        FROM_HERE  method_factory_.NewRunnableMethod(            &amp;WebPluginImpl::OnDownloadPluginSrcUrl)  0);    then WebPluginImpl::TearDownPluginInstance() is called which does:    method_factory_.RevokeAll();    then the task runs and WebPluginImpl::OnDownloadPluginSrcUrl() is called.  Unsurprisingly   WebPluginImpl::OnDownloadPluginSrcUrl() derefs pointers off the 'this' object that are no longer there.    RevokeAll() should prevent the callback from running at all. </pre>
