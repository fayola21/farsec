<title>Issue 45446 -   chromium -    Last closed tab will reopen on next start with &quot;reopen tabs&quot; option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enable the browser option &quot;Reopen last tabs on startup&quot; (or what it's   called in en)  2. Close all tabs but one if you have open two or more  3. Now remember the last tab  4. Close the last tab. The browser closes altogether now.  5. Open Chrome by its shortcut with no specific URL to load.      As I explicitly closed the only tab last time  I'd expect it to be closed   and gone  so Chrome would now start up with an empty &quot;new tab&quot; page.      Instead  the tab that I have just closed reopens.    <b>Please provide
