<title>Issue 32248 -   chromium -    DevTools: setting breakpoints in and stepping through the code that has no function calls does not work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to <a href="http://repenaxa.com/editor/editor.html">http://repenaxa.com/editor/editor.html</a>  2. Set breakpoint in JavaScriptTokenizer.js:97 first line of the nextToken   method  3. Try changing editor text so that nextToken is called    Expected: breakpoint triggers  stepping covers all the steps.  Actual: breakpoint is not being hit. You actually need to move it to the first   function call &quot;if (this.getCondition()&quot; so that it triggers. Once it has triggered    try stepping over statements. You will find that you never stop at line that has   &quot;continue&quot;  &quot;while&quot; and &quot;switch&quot;. </pre>
