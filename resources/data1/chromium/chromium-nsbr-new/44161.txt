<title>Issue 44161 -   chromium -    hiding http:// in omnibox makes it harder to switch to https:// (or ftp://) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev    Firefox 3.x: ok      1. I like the hiding of http:// protocol but   2. sometimes I need to switch from http: to https:  3. it is a little annoying to have to type &quot;http:// rather than just   insert an 's'.      How about showing the &quot;http:// protocol prefix if one puts the omnibox   cursor at the beginning of an URL?      Need insert: h t t p s : / / to switch to secure https.   </pre>
