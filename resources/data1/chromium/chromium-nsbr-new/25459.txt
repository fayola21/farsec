<title>Issue 25459 -   chromium -    extension popup sometimes flickers black while resizing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Create a popup that resizes itself dynamically.  Use -webkit-transition to   animate the size change.  Sometimes  you'll see some black flickering within   the popup while it resizes.  This looks like the ExtensionView drawing as   solid black.  I haven't looked into why this happens. </pre>
