<title>Issue 44490 -   chromium -    Investigate: ShouldTryNextAddress() in the windows/posix TCPClientSocket implementations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like the ShouldTryNextAddress() implementaiton for posix (possibly windows) is   incomplete. Certain errors are happening to users  which cause it to not fallback and try the next   address in the list (because it maps to uknown error).    This is just a theory right now (blocked on 44488 to confirm the data).    Go a report from forum of a user that would fail to load 'www.python.com'. It would error with -  104 ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED after a couple of seconds.    Looking through the log  I can see that they had IPv6 host resolving enabled  and   www.python.com resolved to two addresses -- the first one IPV6  the second one IPv4.    What I presume is happening  is we try to connect to the first one (the IPv6 address). This fails   with some unknown OS error after a couple seconds. However instead of falling back and trying   the next address (the IPv4 one)  we give up and fail  because the error did not map to something   that ShouldTryNextAddress() recognizes. </pre>
