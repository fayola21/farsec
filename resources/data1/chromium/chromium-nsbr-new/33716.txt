<title>Issue 33716 -   chromium -    Auto Apdates and Download Master - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello! I have noticed some the unpleasant moments in a browser.  In the first  it concerns autoupdatings. In later Beta versions pressing the   autoupdating button  the browser wrote that at present this latest version   though at that point in time there were already new assemblages Beta of   versions.  In the second  There is a bug with integration Download Master. Sometimes at   pressing of the reference for file loading  it is started Download Master and   swings a file  but the browser hangs and does not answer actions. It was   necessary in the Dispatcher of problems some times urgently it is closed that   at browser start all windows would disappear.   </pre>
