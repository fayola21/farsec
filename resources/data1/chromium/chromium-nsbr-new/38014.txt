<title>Issue 38014 -   chromium -    Investigate 65% (86% in release) chrome.dll size increase over public lifetime - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-</a>  release/sizes/report.html?  history=41000&amp;header=chrome.dll&amp;graph=chrome.dll&amp;rev=-1   from <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1434">r1434</a> (which   was the trunk on Aug 28  2008  just before our public beta) until now  the   size of chrome.dll has grown from 13 548 032 bytes to 22 350 336 bytes  a   65% size increase.    Now  obviously as we implement more functionality  the number is going to   grow.  But this amount of increase seems surprising and excessive  unless   I'm missing something obvious -- the size of strings for all the additional   translations can't possibly be megabytes (can it?).  I wonder if bits of   ICU we don't really need have snuck back in  or there is other low-hanging   fruit.  After we spent so long before release trimming the binary size  for   both download speed and startup perf  it would be a shame for us to not   keep it as low as possible.    I'm not sure who is qualified to investigate this. </pre>
