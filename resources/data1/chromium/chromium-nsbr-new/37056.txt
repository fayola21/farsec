<title>Issue 37056 -   chromium -    Bookmark sync does't work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 dev          Chrome won't sync bookmarks between two computer with chrome (both Dev   versions). Won't syn by itself  won't sync when asked to (stop sync  then   start sync). Obviously can't log in sync - the log in window shows   &quot;configuring&quot; for a long time  but to no effect.    So basicly it wont sync.   </pre>
