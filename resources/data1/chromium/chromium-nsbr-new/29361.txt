<title>Issue 29361 -   chromium -    Mac: dragging bookmark folder buttons off the bookmark bar should do something sensible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> third_party/mozilla/include/NSPasteboard+Utils.h claims to support putting   multiple URLs on the drag pasteboard  but I don't know what it really does (or   whether anything supports whatever it does). In any case  there'd still be the   question of what to do about subfolders....    We should probably do something sensible  rather than nothing. </pre>
