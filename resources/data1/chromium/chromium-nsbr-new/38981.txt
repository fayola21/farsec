<title>Issue 38981 -   chromium -    [CF] Switching tabs while Find-in-page is active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Frame 5.0.359.0 (Official Build 42151)  Host browser: IE7  OS: Windows Vista    Precondition:  -------------  Have 2 tabs open.  At least one should be rendered by ChromeFrame.      --------------------------------------  1. Have tab A open to a page rendered by ChromeFrame.   2. Ctrl+F to bring up Find box.  3. Enter search string  hit Find Next button.  4. Switch to tab B.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  Probably  the Find box should close and the Find state of the active tab   should be restored.  In Chrome  each tab has its own Find state  which is   restored when you switch to that tab.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  The Find box stays open  still set to 'find' on tab A (which is now not the   active tab).    Also  the scroll position can be forgotten upon switching back to tab A.     </pre>
