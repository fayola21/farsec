<title>Issue 27636 -   chromium -    SharedWorker constructors can incorrectly generate URL_MISMATCH exceptions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've never seen this locally (despite many hundreds of attempts at reproducing   it)  but the trybots occasionally get a sporadic URL_MISMATCH exception   under the following conditions:    1) Page under a domain creates a named shared worker.  2) Switch to another page under that domain  3) That page creates a named shared worker with a different URL.    In reality  nobody would write code like this  because step 3 would fail if the   user had the page from step 1 open in another tab. But it trips up the unit   tests.   </pre>
