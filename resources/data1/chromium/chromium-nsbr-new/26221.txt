<title>Issue 26221 -   chromium -    Menu incorrectly displayed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.parkstreet.org/">http://www.parkstreet.org/</a>             IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      I'm not sure if this is a javascript coding error or an error in Chrome.    (At least IE does something to it that makes it functional  I don't have   Firefox on this computer).  The menu portion of the website does not   display properly in Chrome.  Instead of having a drop down menu  it is   listed all on top without links.  The debugger gives an error of &quot;Uncaught   TypeError: Cannot set property 'bw'/js/menucode/browser_ns.js:1 of   undefined&quot;.  I don't know js well enough to piece it together  but is there   something that was mis-coded but somehow IE figures out how to put it   together?  Or is it a function they ran in js that doesn't work in chrome? </pre>
