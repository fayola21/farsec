<title>Issue 26777 -   chromium -    sporadic syslog process using 100% cpu while using chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.236.0 (31045)  URLs (if applicable) : any  OS version               : 10.5.8      1. Open chrome with a couple web pages  2. wait and watch cpu usage  3. look for cpu hog in machine's process table      chrome will not fork/exec syslog process and/or it will not use 100% cpu      cpu goes to 100% from syslog process    I can get this bug under replacing syslog with a symlink to /usr/bin/true.    I'm curious if it's related to <a title="NOTIMPLEMENTED output shows up in non-debug builds"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11966">issue 11966</a> </pre>
