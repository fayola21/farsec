<title>Issue 25689 -   chromium -    Crash regression in r29897 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like my plugin canvas change introduced a regression.    It's possible these allocations were always failing and the old code just   tolerated it (since it wasn't using the PlatformCanvas). On the other hand    the exact line seems to indicate that we're using &gt;1.5GB of memory. If this   is true  there is likely a leak related to the bitmap management. </pre>
