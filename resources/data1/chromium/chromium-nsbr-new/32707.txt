<title>Issue 32707 -   chromium -    Can't close facebook tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.64 (Official Build 35722) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://facebook.com">http://facebook.com</a>    I am having a problem with Facebook. Used to have them in the early days of   3.0 beta (or dev  can't remember)  and after the latest update it seems   like it's back.    Sometimes the Facebook tab freezes for a while  as if loading (displays   only a blank page). If the tab freezes  it also freezes all other open   Facebook tabs  while the other site tabs (Slashdot  for example) continue   to work normally.  After a minute or two it unfreezes  facebook  works normally  but I can no   longer close the tab. Clicking X  ctrl + w  nothing.   I have to hunt it down in Task Manager and kill it that way.    Tried detaching the tab to it's own window  and I couldn't even close that   window.    Can't provide the steps to reproduce since it seems random  it's not that   often (maybe the JS on facebook.com is causing problems)  just wanted to   inform you.   </pre>
