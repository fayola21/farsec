<title>Issue 29785 -   chromium -    http://evisaforms.state.gov claims that Chrome does not meet their minimum requirement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://evisaforms.state.gov">http://evisaforms.state.gov</a>  2. A pop-up window shows up    The pop-up has the following (paraphrase):    1. Your browser does not appear to meet the minimum required version  2. You do not appear to have the minimum required version of Adobe Acrobat installed.     This happened with Mac Chrome. With Safari 4.x on Mac OS X  I only got the first of two above.     I haven't yet finished filling out the form  but I guess it just works fine with both Chrome and   Safari.     I suspect that the web site just checks for IE and Netscape/Mozilla.    </pre>
