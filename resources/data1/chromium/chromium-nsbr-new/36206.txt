<title>Issue 36206 -   chromium -    Minimal history leak from Incognito mode when using zoom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Official Build 38810) dev      1. Open Incognito mode with Ctrl+Shift+N  2. Visit a website of your choice  3. Set a bigger zoom (Ctrl++)  4. Close Incognito mode and visit that website again in a normal window      The zoom level should only be remembered between non-Incognito windows.      The zoom level set in a Incognito window is remembered in a non-Incognito window    causing a history leak.    Not a very problem  but if you want to know if somebody visited a website  you can   do it if the user used the zoom  even s/he was using Incognito mode. </pre>
