<title>Issue 34177 -   chromium -    Exception editor dialog should support multiple types - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It might be nice to make the exception editor dialog support editing multiple   items at a time. For example  if you want to change the action for 20 items    it would be convenient to select them all  click edit  change type  click ok.   Right now it only supports editing a single type. </pre>
