<title>Issue 39743 -   chromium -    'gclient sync' to lkgr right after 'svn' failure skips the module for which 'svn update' failed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0. .gclient has 'safe_sync_url' set to lkgr    1. run 'gclient sync'  2. 'svn update' fails to add a directory because there's an unversion   directory of the same name (e.g. third_party/adobe)  3. run 'gclient sync' again       The module for which 'svn update' failed is skipped. In this case  'the   main module' (src/*) is skipped leaving a lot of files outdated.     This happened because the root of the module in question was updated to the   lkgr while subtrees (that come after the failure point) were not.       'gclient sync --force' solved the problem (or manually running 'svn update   -rXXX') solved the problem.     Perhaps  it's not practical to check all the subtrees' revision to decide   whether or not to skip a module. Instead  emitting a message that alert   users to run 'gclient sync --force' or 'svn update -rXXX' may be   sufficient.    </pre>
