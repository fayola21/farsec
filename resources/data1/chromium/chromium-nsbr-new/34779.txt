<title>Issue 34779 -   chromium -    Boomark Manager: &quot;Bookmark bar&quot;  &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; can be Drag/Dropped (also creates duplicates) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.307.5 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37950">r37950</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42        1. Open Bookmark Manager  2. Drag Drop Bookmark bar and Other Bookmarks folders to other folders    Actual: All the Bookmarks in the Bookmark bar or Other Bookmarks gets copied to the dropped location.Now   we see two sets of bookmarks in both the location.    Expected: Initially &quot;Bookmark bar&quot;  &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; cannot be drag dropped ( Windows behavior). If the   above is expected in Mac  Drag drop should always move  but cannot duplicate.       </pre>
