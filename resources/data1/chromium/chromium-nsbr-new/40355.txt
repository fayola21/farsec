<title>Issue 40355 -   chromium -    web page crashes chrome tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.356.2 (Official Build   42060) dev  OS + version: linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: kde    <a href="http://www.infrastructurist.com">http://www.infrastructurist.com</a>    This site crashes the current chrome tab repeatedly for me.  Click on any of   the article headlines and a crash.  It seems I can paste in a url in a fresh   tab and get them to load  but if I try to follow a link to them  I get a   crash. </pre>
