<title>Issue 26646 -   chromium -    Bookmark search text rendering on top of search results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version info is at the bottom.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to open the Bookmark Manager. Ensure the search field   at the top right is empty (No search query)  2) In the left pane  select &quot;Search&quot;.  3) In the right pane  it should be empty with the exception of a status   text that says: &quot;Enter a query in the text field above to search your   bookmarks.&quot;.  4) In the search field in the top-right  type &quot;test&quot;.  5) Leave the bookmark manager open and go back to Chrome's main window. Add   a new bookmark anywhere with &quot;test&quot; in the name.  6) Look back at the bookmark manager. Notice that the new bookmark shows up   in the search results  however that status text mentioned in Step #3 is   still rendering over it.    Expected results:  The status text should disappear automatically when search results are   updated dynamically as new bookmarks are added.
