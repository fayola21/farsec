<title>Issue 41273 -   chromium -    Implement app process model isolation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Modify renderer isolation to take into account the extents declared in web app manifests.    For a first pass  I think it should work like this:    * Chrome-started navigation (omnibox  bookmark  etc): switch processes  * Normal hyperlink navigation: switch processes  * window.open(): switch processes (breaking script connections if necessary)  * redirect: no switch  * subframe: no switch </pre>
