<title>Issue 33169 -   chromium -    Hebrew diacritic marks not rendered correctly on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.hadess.net/2009/11/notice-anything.html">http://www.hadess.net/2009/11/notice-anything.html</a> in   Chrome/Linux    Notice the following issues:  * &quot;emty box&quot; displayed after &quot;_��_&quot; in page heading (I'm guess that the letter _��_ and   the diacritic mark after it need to be coalesced in some way and aren't).  * Diacritic marks aren't aligned correctly under letters - for example the   vertical 2 dots (shva - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shva">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shva</a>) under the letter _��_   should be centered. </pre>
