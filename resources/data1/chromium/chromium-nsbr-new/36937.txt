<title>Issue 36937 -   chromium -    Add function to call native web page translation in Chrome Extensions API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add function should be added to call the native web page translation in the   Chrome Extensions API. Since the native translation feature however doesn't   currently display a button or provide a way to manually initiate a   translation  adding this function would allow existing/new extensions to   provide a way to manually initiate translation of a web page by adding a   button which calls the api function.     </pre>
