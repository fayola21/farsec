<title>Issue 31355 -   chromium -    Silverlight showcase content vanishes on first load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think I've seen this happen on other loads too  but the only reliable steps I've been able to pin   down are:  1. Quit Chromium  2. Launch Chromium  3. Go directly to <a href="http://silverlight.net/showcase/">http://silverlight.net/showcase/</a>    The plugin starts to draw  then just goes white. On a reload  I get the showcase (although it doesn't   seem to ever get past &quot;Loading Silverlight Applications&quot;. </pre>
