<title>Issue 36023 -   chromium -    Crashes on reliability bot due to image decoder crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have lots of crashes in the reliability bot as of yet  which should block the next dev   build.    Last known good:  39173 http://chromebot/buildsummary?id=buildbot_39173_ext  Started crashing:  39179 http://chromebot/buildsummary?id=buildbot_39179_ext    Changes between these two build include innocent looking changes plus a WebKit roll (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=39175">r39175</a>)   to WebKit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=54839">revision 54839</a>.     That WebKit revision includes code cleanup in ImageDecoders  which started crashing a layout   test.  <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54823">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/54823</a>    It is therefore the prime suspect at this point. </pre>
