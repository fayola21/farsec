<title>Issue 32292 -   chromium -    PyAuto: Separate out UITestSuite and UITest interfaces derived by PyAuto - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Refer <a title="PyAuto: Implement python interface to Automation Proxy/Provider" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32283"> issue 32283 </a> for the original PyAuto description.    PyAuto derives features from UITestSuite (src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test_suite.h) and UITest (src/chrome/test/ui/ui_test.h). They should line up more one to one with the   TestSuite and TestCase classes in Python. Right now they're all mixed into one class PyUITestSuite. This is a tracking bug to separate them out.    It's necessary to separate because of some initialization restrictions placed by chromium. </pre>
