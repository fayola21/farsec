<title>Issue 23401 -   chromium -    Investigate when to flush memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Add MemoryPurger" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23400"> Issue 23400 </a> covers building a hook that can dump as much memory as possible   on sleep.    After we build this  it might make sense to call it  or some subset of it  if   the system is idle for long enough  or perhaps just if Chrome is idle long   enough.  For example  if the user hasn't touched the system for 20 minutes    or Chrome has been minimized for 20 minutes  or something like that  maybe we   should flush all of this  or at least flush the background renderers. </pre>
