<title>Issue 35001 -   chromium -    Remember zoom ratio on a per-hostname basis is a problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In tab 1 open <a href="http://www.domain/file1">http://www.domain/file1</a>  2. Increase the zoom (say Ctrl-+ three times)  3. In tab 2 open <a href="http://www.domain/file2">http://www.domain/file2</a>  4. Zoom level is same as for 'file1' and is too much  so reset the zoom of   this resource (Ctrl-0)  5. Go back to tab 1 and its zoom level has also been reset... but I need it   to be zoomed (and zooming it causes tab 2 to zoom also)        Zooming should occur on a per-resource basis  not a per-domain basis.  I am   a teacher and need to zoom things so that they show on the projector screen   at appropriate sizes.  But other content from the same domain needs to be   shown at regular sizes.        Explained above.    Behavior I would prefer to see instead:    I would prefer that zooming occurs at the tab level.  E.g. zoom the content   in a tab and after that all content (regardless of the domain) gets   rendered at that zoom level in that tab.    OR    Zooming occurs on the resource level.    OR    I understand why people would prefer domain-based zooming.  Let the user   choose domains that are excluded from this behavior and engage a resource-  based zoom setting.  (Firefox has the behavior I need - tab-level zoom -   and will be forced to use the FF browser instead).    <b>Please provide
