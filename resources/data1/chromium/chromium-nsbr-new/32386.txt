<title>Issue 32386 -   chromium -    Change MSN -&gt; Bing for Germany country code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Similar to <a title="Live Search search provider needs to be changed to Bing (US only)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13065"> bug 13065 </a>.  It seems like the Bing brand has replaced MSN in   Germany.    1. Open Options in a 'German' installation of Chrome  2. Try to set default search provider to Bing    What is the expected result?  Option for &quot;Bing&quot; instead of &quot;MSN&quot;    What happens instead?  There's only an option for MSN    Setting it to MSN will work  because it redirects to Bing; however    the real name is Bing now  so it needs to be fixed. </pre>
