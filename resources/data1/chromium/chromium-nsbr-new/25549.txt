<title>Issue 25549 -   chromium -    Add 'search' collator tables to ICU  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="layout test failure fast/text/international/japanese-kana-letters.html" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25401"> bug 25401 </a>  I added the invuca table to ICU to make the layout test added   in webkit revision ( <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49899/">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49899/</a> ) pass.     The webkit patch is not quite right because it breaks find-in-page for many   languages (e.g. Swedish  Finnish  etc) while fixing it for Japanese.     The right fix requires one of the following two:    1. Build a custom collator at run-time in Webkit to meet Japanese (as well   as Korean) users' expectation about find-in-page. To do that  we have  to add rule strings for all the collators we care about in addition to the   invuca table.       It'll increase our download size (perhaps by hundreds of kBs). Besides    it can be potentially memory-consuming (it's per renderer process)    2. Add search collators to our copy of ICU data file while adding them to   the ICU trunk. We can also talk to Apple about doing the same  but it may   take quite a while and it may not be ported to Mac OS 10.4.      In webkit  try to open a search collator. If it's present  we're all set.   If not  do #1 above.      If we do #2  Chrome wouldn't suffer from the issues arising from doing #1.      </pre>
