<title>Issue 41956 -   chromium -    Scrolling stops when mouse moves over Flash object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://reader.google.com/">http://reader.google.com/</a>  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Open a page that has a flash object say  half way down  2. Put the mouse cursor in line with that flash object  3. Use the mouse wheel to scroll down       Scrolling continues past the flash object as it does not have focus      Scrolling continues until the flash object and then stops. I assume that flash takes focus   immediately upon mouse over.    Particularly annoying when you're using google reader to scroll through a lot of new items.    </pre>
