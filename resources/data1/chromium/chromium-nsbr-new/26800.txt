<title>Issue 26800 -   chromium -    alert() popups should have a checkbox to prevent further dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/undeadpopup.html">http://www.crystalorb.net/mikem/crbug/undeadpopup.html</a> and click in the top textbox.    This should popup a series of javascript alerts.  On windows and linux  every alert after the first   includes a checkbox to &quot;Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs.&quot;  We should have this on   Mac as well. </pre>
