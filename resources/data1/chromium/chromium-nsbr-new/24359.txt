<title>Issue 24359 -   chromium -    Crash when killing chromium-browser process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  4.0.222.1~svn20091007r28248-0ubuntu1~ucd1~hardy  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10 beta 1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome 2.28.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): n/a        Unfortunately I cannot reproduce it. I opened some tabs in Chromium (some   links from update-manager to Launchpad site). I tried to close one of   Chromium tab using mouse middle button. I wasn't able to close it. The tab   was released from main window instead. I wasn't able to get it back. The   tab was moving when I moved mouse cursor. I killed chromium-browser process   and then chromium-browser crashed:    apport (pid 15152) Thu Oct  8 22:52:22 2009: called for pid 5955  signal 6  apport (pid 15152) Thu Oct  8 22:52:22 2009: executable: /usr/lib/chromium-  browser/chromium-browser (command line &quot;/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-  browser&quot;)  apport (pid 15152) Thu Oct  8 22:52:30 2009: wrote report   /var/crash/_usr_lib_chromium-browser_chromium-browser.1000.crash    See also attached crash report </pre>
