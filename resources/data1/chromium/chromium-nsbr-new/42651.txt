<title>Issue 42651 -   chromium -    Page rendering issues in 249.1064 and on Trunk. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 249.1064  OS:Windows    I'm referring two different issues here. If required  will file   individually.    Issue1:  Navigate to   <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/27/news/economy/fiscal_commission_first_meetin">http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/27/news/economy/fiscal_commission_first_meetin</a>  g/index.htm    Notice how throbber and Go/stop button and cursor spins how ugly until page   is rendered completely - to understand what is happening here  scroll the   page to bottom of the page - This reproduces on Trunk also and Safari too.      <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue2 </a>:  When I navigate to a webpage (for eg: cnn.com) and open any links from   there  the page rendering does not start immediately may be for 30 sec    some time even 1 min also  and all sudden all the pages rendered suddenly.   This repros on Trunk also for me.     </pre>
