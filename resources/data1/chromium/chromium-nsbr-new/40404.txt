<title>Issue 40404 -   chromium -    Session restore restores last tab  even though it has been closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> With Session Restore turned on  close all the tabs in your browser one by one   (until the browser closes because you closed the last tab).    Now  go to Start  Run and type in a web address (and press Enter).    You'll notice that not one but two tabs are opened  one for the address you   typed in and another for the last tab closed in the previous session. This   shouldn't happen  unless my last session ended with me closing the browser   (as opposed to the tab).    This used to work right but has recently broke. We should add a test to make   sure this doesn't regress again. :) </pre>
