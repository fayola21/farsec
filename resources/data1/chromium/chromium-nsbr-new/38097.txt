<title>Issue 38097 -   chromium -    Control-shift-up/down unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3 dev  URLs (if applicable) : any URL when typing text into a box    As far as I know  every other browser when you are in a textbox (such as this   one  composing emails  etc.) when you press control  shift  and an up/down   arrow key  it will select the paragraph you are in.  However  in Chrome  when   you press ctrl-shift-up  nothing happens.  I believe it used to work  but it   has been too long since I remember it and I never got a chance to fill out a   formal &quot;bug report&quot;.  This function is handy and mimics the behavior that   occurs in IE and Firefox.  I do not know if this is related to <a title="Keypress event should fire for Ctrl+key combinations on Windows"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13891">issue 13891</a>. </pre>
