<title>Issue 42061 -   chromium -    Auto clear cookies on redirect loop? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After some cookies expire  I get crazy redirect loops. the known fix for this   is to clear cookies.    If we encounter a redirect loop  can we just auto clear the cookies for the   domain (or at the very least prompt the user do so)? </pre>
