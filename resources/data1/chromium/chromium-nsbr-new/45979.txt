<title>Issue 45979 -   chromium -    IMG tags with AVI files not handled correctly on linux? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [This is with 6.0.422.0 on Ubuntu 10.04  with all codecs installed.]      1.

Expect to see movie of car parking  with 'play' button and progress bar   and in fact one sees this with Firefox on Linux.  But in Chrome  the movie doesn't play  there's just a blank window.    On Windows  Chrome launches an external movie player  which is better than   nothing.     </pre>
