<title>Issue 27111 -   chromium -    deny prefetches at site owners' option: use.txt and page markup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> HTML 5 supports prefetching as a time-saver for website visitors. However   it adds unwanted traffic to some sites  so site owners should be able to  deny prefetching. I proposed methods. Before HTML5's specification editor  adds the methods to HTML5  they want to know that a UA will support them   with either an experimental UA or a commitment to do so in the future.    Various burdens on sites are described in the W3C thread  especially at  &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7918#c3">http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7918#c3</a>&gt;  in some depth.  Also  both sides of the debate are indirectly touched on in  &lt;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13505&amp;can=1&amp;q=prefetch&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13505&amp;can=1&amp;q=prefetch&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS</a>&gt;  (wants page prefetches) and  &lt;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3041&amp;can=1&amp;q=prefetch&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3041&amp;can=1&amp;q=prefetch&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS</a>&gt;  (problem with DNS prefetches)  both as accessed 11-08-09. While I can't use  Chrome (I run modern Linux and old Win)  I gather you don't offer page  prefetch denial. This proposal is for future Chrome versions.    While most site owners are happy to help visitors get content faster and in  most sites predictions about what a visitor probably wants to see next will  be correct often enough  in some websites the predictions will often be  wrong  especially where pages are dynamic  and prefetching will add costly  traffic that will not benefit the visitor. In some cases  visitors will  experience slower downloads specifically due to prefetching.    To solve that for site owners who object  I proposed two solutions  and I'd  like to ask that Chrome support them.    1. For site-wide blocking of prefetching  the site owner would add a file  named use.txt  modeled on robots.txt. The use.txt file would be at the root  level and would include one line:    prefetch no    By having a separate file  use.txt could eventually be expanded to support  other commands  which may be specified in HTML and other specifications  coordinated with HTML  not the case with robots.txt.    Chrome's role would be  before prefetching anything at a site  to check for  use.txt and the command. If they're present  Chrome would prefetch nothing.  If the command or the file is absent  Chrome would prefetch as much as is  appropriate.    2. For page-specific blocking of prefetching  a link element would include  rel=&quot;noprefetch&quot; or rev=&quot;noprefetch&quot;. The rel value would mean not to  prefetch the indicated URL while the rev value would mean not to prefetch  the current page bearing the element.    For more specific blocking of prefetching  an a or area element would  include rel=&quot;noprefetch&quot;. The rel value would mean not to prefetch the  indicated URL while the corresponding rev value would be meaningless.    Chrome would check the page which or from which it is planning to prefetch  for a link  a  or area tag with this value and  if found  accordingly  decline to prefetch.    For all methods:    No bar to prefetching would work across multiple sites. If example.com  tries to bar prefetching from example.org  that bar would be ignored. Any  bar to prefetching from example.org is to be determined by example.org's  owner  not someone else. That's partly to prevent slowing down competitive  websites. If Chrome sees such a cross-site bar in place  Chrome would  ignore it.    If Chrome has cause to prefetch two or more items for sequential exposure  to the user  if any item in the set is denied for prefetching  no  subsequent items are to be prefetched. Once a prefetch-denied item is  fetched  subsequent items may then be prefetched  if Chrome wishes.    If Chrome allows its users to turn prefetching off  that's a separate  matter. If the site allows prefetching but the user has configured Chrome  to prevent it  Chrome would not prefetch. And if the user permits  prefetching but the site doesn't  Chrome wouldn't prefetch.    Chrome can implement this before HTML5 does or before any website does  without interfering with any use of Chrome.    If Google/Chrome sees the value of doing this  that'll add ground for  inclusion in the HTML5 spec.    Thank you.    --   Nick </pre>
