<title>Issue 37780 -   chromium -    x86-64 Linux build should use x86-32 NaCl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the x86-64 build of Chromium builds the x86-64 version of NaCl.    It should also have the option of using the x86-32 version of NaCl  and this   should probably be the default  because it is better tested and the x86-64   version is not yet complete.    This means sel_ldr (NaCl's loader process) would need to be built as a   separate executable.
