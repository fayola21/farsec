<title>Issue 44205 -   chromium -    Need more bits (64-bit Mac): don��_��_��_t declare host_arch or target_arch in GYP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For the 64-bit Mac GYP/Xcode build  architecture selection is handled at a  different layer than on other platforms. The target architecture is chosen  in Xcode via build settings. There can be no knowledge of architecture at  GYP .xcodeproj generation time.    As a precursor to a full proper 64-bit build  host_arch and target_arch in  GYP need to be changed. Currently on the Mac  they��_��_��_re set to ��_��_��_ia32��_��_��_. This  should change to ��_��_��_mac��_��_��_ as a pseudo-architecture  and an indication that  something special is going on.    Some .gyp files will need to be adjusted to recognize the new host_arch. In  most cases  these adjustments will temporarily cause ��_��_��_mac��_��_��_ to be  interpreted identically to ��_��_��_ia32��_��_��_ until these components are made able to  build properly on the Mac in 64-bit mode.    One .gyp file that needs such an adjustment is v8.gyp  which lives outside  of the main Chromium repository. v8.gyp will actually be made Mac 64-bit  aware in <a title="GYP/Xcode/Chromium build support for x86_64 v8"  href="/p/v8/issues/detail?id=706">bug v8:706</a>. This bug depends on that one. </pre>
