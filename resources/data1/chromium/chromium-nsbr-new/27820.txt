<title>Issue 27820 -   chromium -    Chrome never gets focus back after Flash Debug Player spawns error dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0 (Official Build 31763)    <a href="http://cdn.eyewonder.com/100125/adWdrDemos/54343555/54343555_2508228_81559_Demo.html">http://cdn.eyewonder.com/100125/adWdrDemos/54343555/54343555_2508228_81559_Demo.html</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Install the flash debug player:  <a href="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_plugin_debug.dmg">http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_plugin_debug.dmg</a>  . This player spawns error dialogs on errors as opposed to gracefully  ignoring them like the regular flash player.   2. Visit a url with a swf that has some actionscript that invokes an error   like the one above so the debugging error dialog is spawned.      Click continue or dismiss all  focus returns to the browser and you can  carry on using the browser.        When the error happens  focus transfers to the error dialog  then you click  &quot;continue&quot; or &quot;dismiss all&quot; focus does *not* browser ui and click on a tab  or page will not let the browser regain focus.  This makes it impossible to  use the browser after the error dialog is dismissed.  In the attached  screenshots  you can see the browser and tab are still in blurred color and  clicking on the page doesn't return focus.  You can only remedy this by  force quitting chrome.       </pre>
