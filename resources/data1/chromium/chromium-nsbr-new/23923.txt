<title>Issue 23923 -   chromium -    Create central CrosLibrary class - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to refactor the Chrome OS network/power code into a central CrosLibrary class that   handles all the interaction with the Cros shared library API. Each status area UI will just observe this   singleton class for changes to the UI so they all act in lock step. </pre>
