<title>Issue 25323 -   chromium -    Detect Bookmarks Extensions API events from sync code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> An extension that generates changes to bookmarks (maybe because the extension   is to sync bookmarks) could potentially cause a feedback cycle with the   built-in browser sync feature.    To detect (and maybe combat) this feedback cycle  the browser sync code   should keep some kind of counter of changes that originate from the   extensions API.  On a commit  the client should communicate the number of   extensions API events that have occurred since the last successful commit. </pre>
