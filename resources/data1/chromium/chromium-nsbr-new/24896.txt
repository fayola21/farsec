<title>Issue 24896 -   chromium -    Background download coninues after cancel in save dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.25      1. Turn on setting &quot;Ask where to save each file before downloading&quot;  2. Click on any download link in browser  3. File save dialog appears and the data starts being downloaded in the   background  4. Press &quot;Cancel&quot; button in that dialog      The background download should be aborted immediately.      The file is still being downloaded to nowhere in the background. It stops   only when the Chrome is closed.    Network indicator demonstrates network activity  and my internet provider   logs show that the whole file size was downloaded from that resource. </pre>
