<title>Issue 25232 -   chromium -    Autocomplete window does not move with window scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a long page with an input box (like crbug.com)  2. Enter some text in the box to trigger the autocomplete feature to suggest   some text  3. Scroll the page with the scroll wheel      The entire page should scroll  including the text suggestions or the   suggestions should disappear.  Instead  the autocomplete text &quot;detaches&quot;   from the input box and stays in the same absolute position on the screen.     </pre>
