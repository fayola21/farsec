<title>Issue 26649 -   chromium -    Unable to view the first added entry on clicking &quot;+&quot; twice on startup open pages list  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.229.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30554">r30554</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Launch chrome   Open Preferences -&gt; Basics  2. Under On startup --&gt; Open the following pages  3. Have few sites added to the list  4. Click &quot;+&quot; twice     Actual: Thick Field focus overlaps the first added entry  hence URL entry is not readable.  ( Screen shot attached for reference )  Note: Click &quot;+&quot; one more time.. Entry looses the focus and everything shows fine.    What is the expected output?   URL should be readable for any kind of focus on the entry.    Cant compare with other platforms  Since &quot;Add..&quot; maintains separate dialog. </pre>
