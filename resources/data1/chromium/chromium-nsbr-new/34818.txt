<title>Issue 34818 -   chromium -    RenderViewHostDelegate::View::HandleMouseLeave does not work on linux/gtk. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> RenderViewHostDelegate::View::HandleMouseLeav gets never invoked on linux  even when a mouse pointer moves out from renderer's view.    This is because in WebInputEventFactory::mouseEvent   (WebKit/chromium/src/gtk/WebInputEventFactory.cpp)  it says:    ------------------      switch (event-&gt;type) {      case GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY:      case GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY:          // Note that if we sent MouseEnter or MouseLeave to WebKit  it          // wouldn't work - they don't result in the proper JavaScript   events.          // MouseMove does the right thing.          result.type = WebInputEvent::MouseMove;          break;  ------------------    which is causing a problem in the following code  in RenderViewHost::ForwardMouseEvent (render_view_host.cc).    -----------------          case WebInputEvent::MouseLeave:          view-&gt;HandleMouseLeave();    ------------------    Evan  do you have any suggestion how to get this working?  I just want to use this callback to implement hover animation in   notification panel for ChromeOS. </pre>
