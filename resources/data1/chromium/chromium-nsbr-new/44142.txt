<title>Issue 44142 -   chromium -    Video player should support linking to times within video - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm watching a long video. I want to link to a specific point within the   video  just like youtube. We should support copying a link to a specific   point within the video by right clicking on the trackbar when the video is   paused or something like that...    e.g. if a video <a href="http://www.foo.com/bar.ogg">http://www.foo.com/bar.ogg</a> is embedded in a web page  I start   playing... then pause it at t=5m34s  then when I right click on the track bar   there's a &quot;Copy video URL at 5:34&quot; option as well as the regular &quot;Copy video   URL&quot; option. This copies the URL <a href="http://www.foo.com/bar.ogg?t=5m34s">http://www.foo.com/bar.ogg?t=5m34s</a> or some   such to the clipboard which we can then parse and skip ahead when the video   is loaded in the fullscreen player.    What do you think Andrew? </pre>
