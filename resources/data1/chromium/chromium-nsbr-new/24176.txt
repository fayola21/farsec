<title>Issue 24176 -   chromium -    extension user scripts no longer load consistently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install my Mouse Gestures extension from   <a href="http://www.zeniko.ch/chrome/mousegestures.crx">http://www.zeniko.ch/chrome/mousegestures.crx</a>  2. Visit e.g. <a href="http://www.derbund.ch/">http://www.derbund.ch/</a>  3. Try to drag&amp;drop a link from that page into the content area (should   open the link in a background tab) or right-click and move the mouse down   and then right (should close the tab).      Sometimes the extension starts working again after reloading the page  but   most often there are pages where it always works (e.g.   <a href="http://www.google.ch/">http://www.google.ch/</a> ) and on some pages it never does (such as this very   Google code page).    Please provide
