<title>Issue 38178 -   chromium -    Chromium shows passwords in clear text via autofill that were previously entered hidden - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.351.0 (41249) Ubuntu      <a href="http://tools.sunriseroad.net/jeremy/tests/clear-text-passwords">http://tools.sunriseroad.net/jeremy/tests/clear-text-passwords</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Log in to a web page that uses an &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;   /&gt; in its web form.  2. Have Chromium save the web page.  3. Now visit a page that uses an &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; /&gt; and   trigger the auto-suggest box (i.e. click in the box twice).        I would have expected Chromium to recognise that at the time I entered the   passwords  they were masked by type=&quot;password&quot;  and so not shown them in   clear text afterwards.        Instead  all your remembered passwords will be displayed in clear text in a   drop-down box for all your shoulder-surfers to see.    In case the above link gets cut off  this is a test case that reproduces   the bug for me:    <a href="http://tools.sunriseroad.net/jeremy/tests/clear-text-passwords">http://tools.sunriseroad.net/jeremy/tests/clear-text-passwords</a> </pre>
