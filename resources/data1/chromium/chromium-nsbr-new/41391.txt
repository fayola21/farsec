<title>Issue 41391 -   chromium -    Omnibox does not paint correctly when the chrome window is maximized. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See screenshot    Started happening with 5.0.375.3 dev    Happens only in maximized mode    Happens only when chrome has a theme. (But happens no matter which theme I   pick)    It does not seem to happen to all the windows.    Tested on Vista 64.      I believe these repo steps should replicate the problem  - update to latest dev channel  - Set chrome to have no theme  - restart chrome  - set a theme  - maximize chrome  - The main chrome window should now have a broken omnibox.   </pre>
