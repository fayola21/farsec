<title>Issue 40718 -   chromium -    Popup blocking when leaving a page uses next page's content settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit popuptest.com.  Click &quot;multi popup test #1&quot;.  Now manually navigate to   chrome://extensions/.  Be surprised when two popups open.    The page tries to open two popups when exiting  and all chrome:// URLs are   whitelisted to allow all content  so I think this means we're using the wrong   settings to check what to do? </pre>
