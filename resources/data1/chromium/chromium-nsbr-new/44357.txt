<title>Issue 44357 -   chromium -    window.showModalDialog and popup blocking - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta (Mac)         Safari 4: OK       Firefox 3.x: OK       IE 7: OK       IE 8: OK       Chrome Windows: FAIL      window.showModalDialog call when popup blocking on      It should either return immediately (popup blocked) or create a popup.      The tab freezes. I suspect Chrome is waiting for the response (modality) but can't because there   never will be a response (the popup was blocked).  Interestingly I don't get anything telling me the tab has crashed either.   </pre>
