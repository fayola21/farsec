<title>Issue 25441 -   chromium -    memory-model=low should respect virtual desktop switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27    Currently  memory-model=low leads to freeing up memory only for those Chrome   windows which are minimized.    However  there are virtual desktop managers (like VirtuaWin 4.0.1) that   don't minimize windows when switching from one virtual desktop to another.    Chrome should also free up memory when a window remains in switched-from   virtual desktop and becomes hidden (and in most cases  is not expected to be   used for a long time). </pre>
