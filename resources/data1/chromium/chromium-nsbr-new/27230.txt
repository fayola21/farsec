<title>Issue 27230 -   chromium -    Javascript running in one tab effects info bar on active tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testing-119.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.241.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31417">r31417</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32.18      1. Add the attached  test.html script as home page.  2. Open two tabs.  3. In tab one click on the home button   when the script is running.  4. Open tab two  apply any theme  and check for the info bar  be in tab   two.  5. After tab one closes  apply any other theme in tab two and check for   info bar.    What is the expected output?  Javascript in tab one should not effect the info bar in tab two.     What do you see instead?  Once the attached javascript runs in another tab  it closes the info bar in   active tab  and info bar does appear after that. </pre>
