<title>Issue 29393 -   chromium -    Implement history.pushState()/replaceState() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Support for History.push/replaceState() was added to WebKit in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=51644">r51644</a>  but not implemented in   Chromium.    I've implemented the V8 bindings  but the core History APIs (BackForwardListChromium.cpp) are   just stubbed out for now.    this is also tracked upstream at <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32148">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32148</a> </pre>
