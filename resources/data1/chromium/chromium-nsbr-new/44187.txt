<title>Issue 44187 -   chromium -    Google Chrome usage with handyCafe firewall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     I want to report a bug about Google Chrome usage with handyCafe firewall at   Turkish internet cafes.    There is an incompatibility between Google Chrome and handyCafe Firewall.   They say that when HandyCafe firewall is on  Google Chrome users receive   the following error message as they try to open a page.    Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): Unknown error.    It's believe that Chrome makes the initial connection but HandyCafe   interrupts and directs the connection to 127.0.0.1. In other words  it   behaves as a proxy.    Since this problem affects 8 thousand internet cafes and prevent more than   1 million people from using Google Chrome in Turkey  it is an important   problem.    Could you please help us on solving this problem?    Many thanks    Renin </pre>
