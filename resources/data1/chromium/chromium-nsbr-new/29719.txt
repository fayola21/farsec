<title>Issue 29719 -   chromium -    Extensions need source-based trust verification mechanism - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The extensions website needs to be able to display the source for   extensions before they are downloaded  and needs to allow users to vote on   whether an extension is trustworthy or not  stating specific security   concerns if they are not happy with the source.  This process needs to be   able to be replicated every time an update is pushed for the extension  and   a trust history needs to be shown both for the application author  the   applications they write  and for those submitting security audit   evaluations. </pre>
