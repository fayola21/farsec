<title>Issue 34875 -   chromium -    MiddleCtrl clicking a link in a popup gives focus to the main window where the new tab was created - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Middle+Click and Ctrl+Click are supposed to open links in a new tab in the   background but when used in a popup they give the focus to the main window.    &quot;edge&quot; cases: 1. main window is minimized and therefore maximized too. 2.   there is no main window so a new window is opened on front.    seems to me this is undesirable (the main window should not steal the focus   from the popup  at least on the normal case where the window is already   opened)    other browsers:  Opera: tab opened in the background in the main window (the desired   behavior IMO). note: in Opera there are no edge cases because the popup   isn't independent to the window.  Firefox  Safari: opened a new tab in the popup window  IE: no such thing as tabs when in a popup window  a new window is always   created.    Only Chrome and IE don't allow background tabs to be opened from popups. </pre>
