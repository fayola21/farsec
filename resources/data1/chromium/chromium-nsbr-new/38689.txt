<title>Issue 38689 -   chromium -    Web page display in tab seems to be frozen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't have any good STR for this  but it has happened twice to me today on mac 5.0.356.0.    Basically a web page will display (I've seen this on gmail.com and addons.mozilla.org today) but is   completely unresponsive to keyboard or mouse input.  I am able to refresh the page  but the tab   remains unresponsive.  The tab does not seem completely dead  however -- looking at the stats in   the task manager  I can see cpu and network activity for the tab's process.    Anyone have suggestions on how I can debug this problem?   </pre>
