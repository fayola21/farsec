<title>Issue 38932 -   chromium -    Remove wmode hack from Flash when Core Animation is available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Even after we enable Core Animation negotiation for Mac plugins  Flash won't use it because of our   wmode hack (which we use to prevent them from using QuickDraw as an accelerated drawing mode   when CA isn't available).    I have code ready to go for this  we just need to make sure there aren't any serious regressions   before we do. </pre>
