<title>Issue 24630 -   chromium -    about:net-internals keeps around recent incognito requests information - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The recent requests section of &quot;about:net-internals&quot; shows requests made in incognito mode. This   is probably fine  however after all the incognito windows have been closed they shouldn't continue   to be shown. </pre>
