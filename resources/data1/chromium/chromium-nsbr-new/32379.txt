<title>Issue 32379 -   chromium -    Can't focus &quot;Log In&quot; nor &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons in the basic authentication dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) dev  - Windows specific. Does not reproduce on Linux Chrome.      1. Visit e.g. <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/internal">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/internal</a>  2. Press TAB key twice on the basic auth dialog.    What is the expected output?    The &quot;Log In&quot; button is focused.    What do you see instead?    Current focus goes outside of the authentication dialog (i.e.  an item on a current web   page is focused. It's weird.)       </pre>
