<title>Issue 38229 -   chromium -    Support Xt-based plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install a plugin that expects Xt (e.g. Acrobat Reader)  2. See that Chrome does nothing useful with it    It's unfortunately kind of complicated: we have to simulate that we're an Xt app  which is   a super obsolete API.  Emulating this is made even more complicated by Chrome's   multiprocess model.  The way existing browsers do it involves gtk2xtbin which actually   involves a 25ms polling timer.    It appears mozplugger is one workaround for this -- it does the Xt emulation and exposes   an gtk/xembed interface to us. </pre>
