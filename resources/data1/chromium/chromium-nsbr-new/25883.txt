<title>Issue 25883 -   chromium -    Quicktime crashing under NPAPI::PluginStream::TryWriteToPlugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may end up being a dup  since we have known issues with QuickTime  but  filing as a placeholder for crash reports. Stacks look like:    0x046731c0 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x0001a1c0] 	  0x04678b8c 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x0001fb8c] 	  0x04675ffd 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x0001cffd] 	  0x04676536 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x0001d536] 	  0x046778f2 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x0001e8f2] 	  0x04679940 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x00020940] 	  0x04669ec7 	[QuickTime Plugin 	+ 0x00010ec7] 	  0x012302a8 	[Google Chrome Framework 	- plugin_stream.cc:186]   NPAPI::PluginStream::TryWriteToPlugin(char const*  int  int)  0x012303bc 	[Google Chrome Framework 	- plugin_stream.cc:133]   NPAPI::PluginStream::WriteToPlugin(char const*  int  int)  0x012306c0 	[Google Chrome Framework 	- plugin_stream.cc:99]   NPAPI::PluginStream::Write(char const*  int  int)  0x01231450 	[Google Chrome Framework 	- plugin_stream_url.cc:70]   NPAPI::PluginStreamUrl::DidReceiveData(char const*  int  int)   ...    Random sampling of crash reports shows the url as somewhere on Facebook in  the vast majority of cases  but that may just be linking to videos.      Note for anyone triaging: This should *not* be dup'd to 17043; this is all  QuickTime on the Mac  which isn't what that bug is about. </pre>
