<title>Issue 29329 -   chromium -    call V8::IdleNotification in extension processes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like V8::IdleNotification isn't being called in extension processes.    It depends on the browser telling it that the tab's been hidden  which will   never happen to an extension.  This could have the effect of causing   extension memory to hit a high water mark and not shrink.   </pre>
