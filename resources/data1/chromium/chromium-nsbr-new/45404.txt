<title>Issue 45404 -   chromium -    adsense flash ads do not display on chrome in image search results (i.e. when page in a frame) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;5.0.375.55    Other browsers tested: yes        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK      when a webpage contains adsense ads that are flash animations  the ads do   not display when the webpage in in a frame.    in particular this happens when the webpage is displayed as a google image   search result.    i never noticed this issue before chrome 5.0    if i select &quot;open frame in new tab&quot;  then the flash displays properly in   the new tab.  but flash ads never display in the image search results   bottom frame.    i assume that this affects all flash animations  not just adsense ads.    and i suppose that this happens when a page is displayed in any frame  not   the the google image search results. </pre>
