<title>Issue 41496 -   chromium -    Bookmark sync brings back previously deleted bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.378.0 (44489)      1. Delete a bookmark  2. Get on a different machine  wait for it to sync  3. Notice that your deleted bookmark is back      Bookmark is deleted forever and doesn't come back on sync.      Bookmark comes back.    Is this happening because bookmarks are stored in Google Docs? It looks   like if I delete the bookmark there  it'll be gone forever. I shouldn't   have to go into Google Docs to permanently delete a bookmark  though. </pre>
