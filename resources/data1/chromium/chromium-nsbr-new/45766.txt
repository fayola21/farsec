<title>Issue 45766 -   chromium -    ExtensionUITest needs to be ported to non-Windows platforms - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The entirety of ExtensionUITest is ifdef'd out for non-Windows platforms (and the file isn't even   being built at the moment  but I'm about to fix that).    The most obvious portability problem is that SetUp for the test class includes:        mock_-&gt;host_window_style_ &amp;= ~WS_VISIBLE;    We need a platform-neutral way of doing whatever is necessary here. There's also a comment about   needing &quot;external tab stuff&quot; ported; I'm not sure what specifically was missing  so I'm not sure if that   still applies. </pre>
