<title>Issue 44296 -   chromium -    Can't scroll when over flash objects - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47052) dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.haaretz.co.il/">http://www.haaretz.co.il/</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK (Safari 4)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested  but linux dev channel NOT OK either.      1. Visit the site above.  2. Wait a few seconds for the frontpage add to go away and the main page to finish loading  3. Scroll through the page with scrollbutton or (on mac) two-finger drag        Scroll all the way down.        Scroll stops when the pointer goes over a flash element.    Extra note: this does not happen (say) on youtube.com. </pre>
