<title>Issue 26527 -   chromium -    Make seccomp and setuid sandboxes run together - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;it would be great if we could run both the seccomp sandbox and   the suid sandbox  if both of them are available. I think  this mostly just   works  except for the seccomp sandbox temporarily needed access to some   files in /proc. But we could pass in those file handles.&quot; </pre>
