<title>Issue 41488 -   chromium -    about:memory should (have an option to) auto-refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev  URLs (if applicable) : about:memory    about:memory doesn't autorefresh if a tab is closed. This also prevents   &quot;live diagnostics&quot; - leaving the tab open in another window and running   memory tests on a page. Something like gnome-system-monitor's resource tab   could be interesting to have (maybe in a separate page  as about:memory is   likely to be pulled in memory-critical conditions).     </pre>
