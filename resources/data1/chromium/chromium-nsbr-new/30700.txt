<title>Issue 30700 -   chromium -    Get npapi_test_plugin tests working on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the npapi_test_plugin tests aren't being run on Linux. See   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/503029">http://codereview.chromium.org/503029</a> and <a title="Port remaining npapi_test_plugin tests"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30488">bug 30488</a> for the corresponding Mac work.    (I originally tried doing Linux as well in <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/503029">http://codereview.chromium.org/503029</a> as well  but ran   into test failures I didn't have time to debug and abandoned it for that CL.) </pre>
