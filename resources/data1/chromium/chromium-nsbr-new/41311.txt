<title>Issue 41311 -   chromium -    Automatic side-by-side docked windows scrolling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a feature request.    When two windows are 'docked' side-by-side  the user should have the option   (the UI could use perhaps a little lock icon below the vertical scrollbar or   similar to toggle this behaviour on/off) to enable a mode where scrolling in   the active window scrolls also in the other docked window visible. </pre>
