<title>Issue 32837 -   chromium -    text + icon notifications need to limit the width of the icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if you pass a very wide but not very tall icon to   createNotification()  the icon is not scaled or clipped horizontally  so it   overlaps with the text area.    Ideally we do some kind of snifty aspect-ratio-correct scaling in both   directions to make it fit  but failing that  we should just truncate the   width so it doesn't overlap the text area. </pre>
