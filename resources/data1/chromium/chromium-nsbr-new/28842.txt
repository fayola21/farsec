<title>Issue 28842 -   chromium -    Mac: should be able to drag bookmarks (from bookmark bar  possibly from folders) as URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (onto desktop  etc.).    Safari doesn't do this  but its behaviour is a bit weird (dragging a bookmark off the bar in Safari and dropping causes it to be deleted). Camino and   Firefox do allow this. Another question is what the right behaviour when a folder is dragged.    Here's what was said in a CL (see below) review:    [Nico said:]    1.) Why is it correct to do &quot;moves&quot; for bookmarks? The bug that's mentioned as  BUG= doesn't really say that we want this. Safari doesn't do this (if you drag a  bookmark from Safari's bookmark bar to the desktop  it just disappears from  Safari's bookmark bar  which is even worse  but it kind of makes it clear that  you just can hit undo in Safari to undo this. Where would our undo go? Chrome?  Finder?    To sum up: I'd like to have a bug where stuff like this is discussed :-)    [I said:]    Well  it actually does &quot;copies&quot;  unless you're moving things on the bookmark  bar  so it's non-destructive  thus not requiring undo. This seems right if we  believe that the dragging of bookmarks should be &quot;real&quot; drag-and-drop.    AFAICT  Safari's dragging of bookmarks isn't really drag-and-drop (since you can  *only* drag them around on Safari's bookmark bar  or drop it into thin air).    (Entertaining Safari bug: try dragging a bookmark bar item from one window's  bookmark bar onto another window's.)    &gt; To sum up: I'd like to have a bug where stuff like this is discussed :-)    Right. I have a comment on the listed bug saying exactly that. ;-)    [Nico replied:]    Ah  ok then.    &gt; Right. I have a comment on the listed bug saying exactly that. ;-)    As a first step  maybe file one for this CL and just copy a paraphrased version  of the above paragraph.    [But I'm too lazy to paraphrase. Hence the cutting-and-pasting.]    See also <a title="Non-rectangular view (Cole prototype) for bookmark bar menus" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17608"> issue 17608 </a>  where all similar issues have been somehow lumped.
