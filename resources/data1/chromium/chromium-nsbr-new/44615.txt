<title>Issue 44615 -   chromium -    AutoFill when visiting a form presents additional suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Scenario: Visiting a form presents possible AutoFill completions  1.  Given I have enabled AutoFill in Chrome  2.    And I am visiting a web page with a fillable form  3.  When I click in a form field that is fillable  4.  Then I should be presented with a drop down showing me choices (according to new mocks).    Expected:    Clicking shows a drop down showing choices (according to mocks) in the following order:      AutoFill suggestions first (if any)      AutoComplete suggestions first (if any)      A separator and an &quot;AutoFill Options...&quot; menu item last (if there are any AutoFill suggestions   present)    Actual:    Clicking shows list of AutoFill suggestions  no AutoComplete suggestions  no separator or   &quot;AutoFill Options...&quot; menu.    Currently AutoComplete suggestions will appear if user types  but do not appear in drop down   menu.   </pre>
