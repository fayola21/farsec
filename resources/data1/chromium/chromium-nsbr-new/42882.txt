<title>Issue 42882 -   chromium -    ~200KB regression in xp release dual core moz total_byte_b and total_byte_r - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ~200KB regression has appeared in XP release dual core's moz page cycler   total_byte_* results.  See:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-</a>  core/moz/report.html?history=50&amp;rev=45476&amp;graph=total_byte_r    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-</a>  core/moz/report.html?history=50&amp;rev=45476&amp;graph=total_byte_b    The increases occurs at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45424">r45424</a> from Jochen.  Jochen  is this increase in   total bytes sent/received between browser and renderer expected?  I assume   so  but in case not  can we work out a fix to restore our previous usage?    Expectations should be updated to green up the page cycler in the meantime. </pre>
