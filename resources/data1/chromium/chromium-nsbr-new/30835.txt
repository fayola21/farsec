<title>Issue 30835 -   chromium -    --app windows should show a divider line below the window title line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35012">r35012</a>      1. Run  xcodebuild/Debug/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium  --  app=<a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>        Since the appmode window has no toolbar  it should have a divider line   below the window title. Compare TextEdit. The easiest way is probably to   make appmode windows not textured.    (This is probably not true for the web inspector window  where the title   gradient should be so that it blends nicely with the gradient in the html   toolbar. Right now  the colors there are off.)   </pre>
