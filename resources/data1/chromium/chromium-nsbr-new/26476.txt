<title>Issue 26476 -   chromium -    Dead tabs after startup with a lot of tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a bunch of tabs  maybe across multiple windows  2. Some tabs don't render. These things DO NOT help:     refresh button     shift refresh button     F5     Shift F5     Click in the URL  hit return     Click in the URL  change it  hit return     Change to a completely different URL  3. The tab goes busy  like it's downloading  4. View page source shows the source.  5. Inspect element works.  6. Everything works  except something between render and display.  7. Which tab(s) don't render is random.  8. This time  I had 6 tabs fail to render on 1 of 5 windows  111 tabs   total.    Quick work-around (close and re-open the tab):   Control-W  Control-Shift-T      All tabs should render on startup        Some tabs don't display and never will  Very repeatable.    <b>Please provide
