<title>Issue 44579 -   chromium -    Audio element volume setting working improperly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47018)   dev          Firefox 3.x: OK    Reproduce Step (In Javascript)  1. Create a new audio object by:  &gt;  var x = new Audio(&quot;http://xxx/a.ogg&quot;);  2. Set it's volume to 0.05  &gt;  x.volume = 0.05;  3. call load() function  &gt;  x.load();  4. play it  &gt;  x.play();  you will be noticed the volume is 1.0 instead of 0.05  5. set the volume again:  &gt;  x.volume=0.05;  &gt;  x.play();  the volume is still 1.0  6. set to a different volume:  &gt;  x.volume=0.06;  &gt;  x.play();  the volume is correct now.          The setting volume should be applied to the audio object.        audio always played with volume 1.0 after load() is invoked.         </pre>
