<title>Issue 37247 -   chromium -     Win7: Window management controls should be RTLized  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: ToT(<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40415">r40415</a>)  OS:Win7 only.    -Launch Google Chrome for any RTL UI.    Issue: As shown in the screenshot  windows management controls shows up on  Top-right side of the window instead of Top-left of the window.    One more issue:  As a result of this  Incognito logo lays on top of 'X' button of the window  management controls. So this issue goes away  if the original issue is fixed. </pre>
