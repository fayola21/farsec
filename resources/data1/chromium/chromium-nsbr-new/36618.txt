<title>Issue 36618 -   chromium -    Switching checkout URL for gclient should not delete checkout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Switching checkout URLs in gclient should not delete the entire working   copy  even if it is &quot;safe&quot; to do so.    STR:  1. Follow Chromium &quot;get the code&quot; instructions  using 'gclient config   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src'">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src'</a> to point to ToT  2. Call 'gclient sync' to get the code  3. Follow Chromium &quot;get the code for a specific release&quot; instructions    using 'gclient config <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/releases/5.0.330.0'">http://src.chromium.org/svn/releases/5.0.330.0'</a> to   point to a particular release  4. Call 'gclient sync' to get the code    Actual result:  gclient deletes the entire previous working copy  because for some reason   the repo UUIDs don't match. User spends an extra couple of hours checking   out source code again.    Expected result:  I expected the repositories to match and the files to only be updated based   on the DEPS file in the new location. Barring that  it would have been nice   to have a warning/confirmation before it blew away my src directory. Or   perhaps rename the checkout directory instead of removing it  so I could   recover more gracefully.    See gclient_scm.py near line 715. </pre>
