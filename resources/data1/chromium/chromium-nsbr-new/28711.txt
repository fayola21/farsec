<title>Issue 28711 -   chromium -    Omnibar treated all input as search queries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Seattle admin ran into this problem - all of the entries she typed into   the omnibar were treated as search queries.    So  if she typed &quot;guts&quot;  she got a google search for guts. If she typed   &quot;go/purchasing&quot;  she got a google search for &quot;go/purchasing&quot;.    When she typed &quot;guts&quot; in the omnibar  chrome would display a gold bar   prompt asking her if she wanted to visit &quot;http://guts/ What was weird was   that even after clicking on that gold bar  the next time she typed &quot;guts&quot; it   still performed the google search (as if it didn't learn that &quot;guts&quot; was a URL    not a search query).    Restarting chrome made this go away - tragically i don't have any more   debugging information than this  and we can't reproduce it  but I wanted to   log it regardless in case other folks ran into it.   </pre>
