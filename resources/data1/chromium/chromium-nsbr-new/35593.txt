<title>Issue 35593 -   chromium -    Fix BrowserActionsContainerTest.TestVisibility - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've checked in some browser test for the browser actions container. One of   those tests (TestVisibility) relies on the overflow menu which isn't   supported yet on TOOLKIT_VIEWS for Linux.    We need to reenable the test once the overflow menu is implemented. </pre>
