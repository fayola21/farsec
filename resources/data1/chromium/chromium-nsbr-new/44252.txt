<title>Issue 44252 -   chromium -    Chrome ignores cookie delete at end of session option when selecting allow and remember selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. set content to ask me when a site tries to set data  2. go to website.  when prompted change cookie to &quot;delete when I close   browser&quot; and click remember for all cookies then allow  3.close browser and reopen  4.go back to website. close browser and re open      The cookies will be deleted and any new cookies will be &quot;deleted at end of   session&quot;      The original cookie was deleted correctly.  but the cookies you got when   returning to the site do not reflect the &quot;delete at end of session&quot;   selection you made when you originally allowed it.  all subsequent cookies   end on like 2012 2014 2022 etc.. even though you specified to remember in   the future to allow but &quot;delete at end of session&quot;.  One would normally   expect given the wording that all future cookies will follow that rule.    but it is not so.  I have tried this on dozens of sites.    <b>Please provide
