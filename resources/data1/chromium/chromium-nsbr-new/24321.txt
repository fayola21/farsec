<title>Issue 24321 -   chromium -    NTP: theme corner can cover objects within page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Offizieller Build 27713)    At certain window sizes  the theme corner prevents you from clicking the   &quot;Start Now&quot; link for starting bookmarks synchronization and/or a &quot;more   information&quot; link from the main tip line. The corner should be big enough a   target  even if it goes behind these. </pre>
