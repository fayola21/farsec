<title>Issue 33334 -   chromium -    get live_sync_tests running on continuous build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was always important  but in light of a recent server-side integration   bug that could have been detected by these tests I believe this is critical.    The tests *were* previously running as part of the official cycle  but I   don't see them there now.    issue 23478  for example  was a bug with the script that ran them.    Laforge  what's the deal here again?  Was it just that they were too   flaky/noisy?  (Brian is working on these tests  but I can't assign to him as   he is not a project owner  you can assign back to me after to track)   </pre>
