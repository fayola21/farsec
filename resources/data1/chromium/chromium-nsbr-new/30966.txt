<title>Issue 30966 -   chromium -    Leading zero in update check number causes error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create extension with a manifest with a leading zero. e.g. 1.01  2. Try to install the extension. Occurs on current chrome beta (4.0.249.43)   and dev (4.0.266.0).        Version should be interpreted as 1.1.  Instead this error is given:   &quot;Required value 'version' is missing or invalid. It must be between 1-4   dot-separated integers.&quot;    This extension currently (as of 12-21) exhibits this behavior:    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cdgkpekhhlaghemfhimcoflhkdhmkhj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cdgkpekhhlaghemfhimcoflhkdhmkhj</a>  j   </pre>
