<title>Issue 30590 -   chromium -    Dutch: title of dialog shows 'Map' and description shows 'Directory'. Both mean 'folder'  but you should use 'map' as the title also calls it 'map' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Dutch (nl)      4.0.226.0      Vista SP2 (Dutch)      extensions-page --&gt; click the first button (to load an unpacked extension)   --&gt; notice the title of the dialog shows 'Map selecteren' ('select folder')   but the dialog description shows 'selecteer de directory van de extensie'   ('select the folder of the extension').  Both 'map' as 'directory' mean folder  but in this case 'map' would be   better for two reasons:  -the title bar already shows this  -the word 'map' is more commonly known by 'non-computer-experts' than the   word 'directory'.      done </pre>
