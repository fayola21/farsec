<title>Issue 33609 -   chromium -    views::Combobox for Chrome OS does not work as intended - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     Create a combobox like this:    combobox_ = new views::Combobox(&amp;combobox_model_);    combobox_-&gt;SetSelectedItem(3);  // select 4th item in the model.    What is the expected output?    The 4th item is shown.    What do you see instead?    - 1st item is shown.  - The ItemChanged() call back function is unexpectedly called  with weird   parameters (prev_index==3 and new_index==0).       </pre>
