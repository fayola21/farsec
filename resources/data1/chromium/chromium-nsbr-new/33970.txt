<title>Issue 33970 -   chromium -    Sometimes save as window stays backward the main window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When I will download a file  Chrome show me &quot;Save as&quot; window. That's OK.  2. But... If I didn't see and continue with navigation  this window stays   down  behind the main window.  3. In this case I'm unable to click on any links of the page that I was in    unless I see the &quot;Save as&quot; window and click on it.        &quot;Save&quot; window should blink or disable (with colors) the main window  so   users will see it.        &quot;Save&quot; window sometimes stays behind the main Window  only with a button on   taskbar.    <b>Please provide
