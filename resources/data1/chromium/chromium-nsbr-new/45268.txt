<title>Issue 45268 -   chromium -    Moving window or tab playing Flash content in multi-monitor set up results in white screen  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Be on a multi-monitor set up. Open up a Chrome window on the laptop and a Chrome window   on the TV/monitor.  2. Go to a site with Flash  say a game for example like:   <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/gluefo3.html">http://www.addictinggames.com/gluefo3.html</a>  3. Drag this window/tab from laptop window to attached external LCD monitor or TV display.  4. Window goes white  sound will remain.  5. Drag back to original browser window -- still white.  6. Open a new tab  and select it  then return to tab with Flash content in it -- it will be back.        Should be able to move Flash windows or tabs from one source to another without a problem.        Screen is white. Need to open another tab to change focus of browser window before switching   back to original tab to view the Flash content. This is more of a problem with Flash playing in a   window like MLB.tv where you can't open another tab or change 'focus'.      <b>Please provide
