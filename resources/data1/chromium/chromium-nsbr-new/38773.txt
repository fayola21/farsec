<title>Issue 38773 -   chromium -    Closing a tab will take down the whole browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev  OS version               : 10.6.2    Every now and again  when I open a tab  paste in a URL and hit return. The loading indicator (gray   one) just keeps spinning for eternity  and not because the website doesn't exist but the tab became   unresponsive in a weird way.     Closing this specific tab will take down the whole browser in one click.    I can't seem to replicate the problem on-demand  but it is there - happened to me twice after the   latest dev update. </pre>
