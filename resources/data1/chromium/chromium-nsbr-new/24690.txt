<title>Issue 24690 -   chromium -    All incognito windows share the same cookie jar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [not exactly a security bug  more a potential privacy issue which could be   improved on].    Currently  Chrome creates a fresh  empty cookie jar when &quot;New Incognito   Window&quot; is invoked.  This cookie jar will be shared among all incognito   windows and tabs  and will only be destroyed when the last incognito   window/tab is closed.    If found this behavior to be surprising; I would have expected to get a   fresh  separate cookie jar everytime I invoke &quot;New Incognito WIndow&quot;.  In   particular  if I were to forget an incognito window (e.g.  minimized or on a   different desktop)  the incognito &quot;session&quot; would survive much longer than   I'd expect.    At the same time  common usage scenarios within incognito windows   require that some &quot;related&quot; tabs/windows share the same cookie jar; e.g.   webapps may expect that a popup window they open has the same cookies   as the parent window.    Strawman proposal:   - every time the user selects &quot;New Incognito Window&quot;  a new window is   opened and attached to a fresh  empty cookie jar.   - when a new tab or popup is opened from within an incognito window  it   inherits the parent window's cookie jar   - one cannot drag a tab from an incognito window associated with one   cookie jar onto a window associated with a separate jar (just as today  one   can't drag tabs between incognito and regular windows).  One can drag a   tab between incognito windows associated with the same cookie jar.    - possibly  this could be made more apparent by giving incognito windows   a separate border color/stripes/checks/plaids for each cookie jar (i.e.    incognito windows of the same color share one cookie jar).    I suspect though that the coloring won't be necessary; this is the behavior   that users might intuitively expect (at least I did).   </pre>
