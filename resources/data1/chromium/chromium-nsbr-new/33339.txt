<title>Issue 33339 -   chromium -    TCP receive (and send) buffer size are set too late - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TCPClientSocketLibevent::SetReceiveBufferSize is called after the socket has   already connected.    The receive buffer size should be called after socket() and before connect()   so the window scaling option can be correctly set during the TCP handshake.   Currently it is only done after connect() has completed (see   FlipSession::OnTcpConnect for an example).    I've only validated this on Linux and will update the bug after making sure   this is the case on Windows and OSX as well. </pre>
