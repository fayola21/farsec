<title>Issue 31946 -   chromium -    Reload local PAC script when it's modified - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: FAIL (but you can force it reloading the script by presing   'Reload' button)           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: N/A      1. Configure Chrome so that it reads proxy settings from a local PAC file   (e.g. 'file:///c:/proxy.pac').  2. Modify the PAC script file and save.  3. Open any website and check 'chrome://net-internals/proxyservice.config'.      Chrome should detect the script changes (maybe by checking file size    modified date  ...) and reload it.      It doesn't detect the changes  and therefore it doesn't reload the script. </pre>
