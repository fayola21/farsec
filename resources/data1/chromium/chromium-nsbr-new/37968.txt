<title>Issue 37968 -   chromium -    QuickTime playback degraded: choppy with severe visual artifacts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/CrossFit_HelenDemo.mov">http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/CrossFit_HelenDemo.mov</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8 (also reproduces in Snow Leopard)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): smooth playback  no artifacts  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): smooth playback  no artifacts  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: smooth playback  no artifacts      1. Open the URL <a href="http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/CrossFit_HelenDemo.mov">http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/CrossFit_HelenDemo.mov</a>      Smooth playback  no artifacts      Choppy playback  severe visual artifacts    This is a regression.  While playback used to be a little choppy  the choppiness has gotten worse   and severe visual artifacts have started to appear.    I tracked this down through the builds on build.chromium.org to this day:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/2009-12-11/34421/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/2009-12-11/34421/</a>    It corresponds to a bug fix that made the controls on the video visible. </pre>
