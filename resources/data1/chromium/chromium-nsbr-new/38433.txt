<title>Issue 38433 -   chromium -    cursor not placed at end of last line when clicking at bottom of textarea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I click in the empty space at the bottom of a textarea  the text cursor   should move to the end of the last line of content.  This is the behavior   exhibited by Firefox (and most applications in general).    However  Chromium is instead putting the cursor at the position of the last   line directly above the mouse cursor.  To clarify  I am attaching images   illustrating the correct behavior and the current behavior.  Note that as an   artifact of the screenshot process  the mouse pointer looks like an arrow   instead of a vertical bar  but the pointer in the image is at the location   of clicking. </pre>
