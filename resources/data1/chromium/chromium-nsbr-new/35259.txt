<title>Issue 35259 -   chromium -    Support for setting breakpoints in packed (and possibly obfuscated) JavaScript code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> JS code is often packed and obfuscated. That makes it virtually impossible   to debug in an orderly manner - let alone set a breakpoint.    To allow for the latter  we should pretty-print packed code in the UI   (i.e.  when the whole file is in one line).     Then we could have an internal mapping between the displayed line numbers   in the UI and the original character ranges  so that breakpoints set in the   UI translate nicely into breakpoints in the packed (and possibly obfuscated   code).         26912 </pre>
