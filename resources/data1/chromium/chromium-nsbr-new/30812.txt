<title>Issue 30812 -   chromium -    Need a better 'no update is available' warning message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This just cost us a couple of man hours...    There is something weird going on with the update process. I updated my   extension from 1.0 to 1.1 and for a while the server only responded with the   'no update' xml (took me a while to track that down).    When we parse this  we spit out:      Error parsing update manifest:    Invalid codebase url    After trying various things and trying to debug it and trying to troubleshoot   with Carl why the server was not providing updates  he pointed out that the   existence of codebase_url might be what we use as a signal to see if we   should update or not.    If this is not the case  then we have a bug.  If this is the case  then we should change the output message to state that   this means there is no update available.   </pre>
