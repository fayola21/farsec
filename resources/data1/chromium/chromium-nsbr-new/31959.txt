<title>Issue 31959 -   chromium -    Don't get &quot;type to search&quot; in omnibox until you start typing something - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open a new tab    expected:  - opens to NTP  omibox has no url  but has &quot;type to search&quot; at far right    actual:  - omnibox is totally empty until i hit a key  then the &quot;type to search&quot; appears.    Seems strange that it tells me that I can type to search only after I've started   typing. Why not before I start typing?    Is this a regression? </pre>
