<title>Issue 44350 -   chromium -    Mac DevTools toolbar can't be dragged to move the window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x: OK      1. Open DevTools  2. Click and drag on an empty spot on the main toolbar (ie between the last button and the   search element box)        The window should move (as if the user was dragging on the titlebar). This would be consistent   with Safari's web inspector and with OS X interfaces in general.          Nothing.      <a title="In docked mode on Mac  when clicking &amp; dragging mouse on tabs headers pane  cursor takes the 'drag' form"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32053">Issue 32053</a> seems to be the complement to this issue for when DevTools is in docked mode.   <a title="Mac Devtools should have a gradient" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30830"> Issue 30830 </a> points towards a common source for the two. </pre>
