<title>Issue 45586 -   chromium -    We need to delay load opengl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We load opengl32.dll and glu32.dll every time we start browser process. The   reason is that we statically import opengl to chrome.dll because webkit   depends on it. We should change it to delay load to improve start up   performance. </pre>
