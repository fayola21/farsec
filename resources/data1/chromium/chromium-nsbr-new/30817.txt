<title>Issue 30817 -   chromium -    Chromium OS ARM FFmpeg build issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Someone on chromium-dev reported an issue building libffmpegsumo:   CXX(target)  out/Release/obj.target/ffmpegsumo_nolink/third_party/ffmpeg/dummy_nolink.o   LINK(target) out/Release/ffmpegsumo_nolink  out/Release/lib.target/third_party/ffmpeg/libffmpegsumo.so: undefined  reference to `ff_dsputil_init_neon'      It looks like the FFmpeg ARM config files for ChromiumOS defines HAVE_NEON  yet ffmpeg.gyp doesn't include the neon files for ChromiumOS.    In fact.. is there any reason why the ARM config files for Chromium and  ChromiumOS should be different? </pre>
