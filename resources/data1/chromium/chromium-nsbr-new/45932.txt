<title>Issue 45932 -   chromium -    Support modifier clicks on translation toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a sister bug to <a title="Modifier clicks on Back/Forward entries should open page in a new tab"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10878">Issue 10878</a> (Back/Forward menus) and <a title="MIDDLE-clicking 'Search Google for [selected text]' should open in background"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20952">Issue 20952</a>   (page context menus). The translation toolbar which appears when using   Chrome's in-built translation has a button on it  &quot;Show original&quot; which   should support modifier clicks  so that you can go back to the original in a   new tab. Also  when the bar autodetects and offers you a language  middle-  clicking the translate button should open that one in a new tab (although I   haven't seen that for a while  so perhaps autodetection has been removed). </pre>
