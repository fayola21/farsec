<title>Issue 33708 -   chromium -    Message on Chrome when opening a page and internet is not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: &lt;from cf:about:version&gt;          1. your internet it is not working or it is turned off.  2. You open a web page        I expect that Chrome could tell me why is not workin. It could detect if it   is a problem of the webpage or instead of the internet conexion        Chrome tell you that the web page maybe has changed the url or something   like that  but no reference that could be another problem like that just   your wifi is off!   </pre>
