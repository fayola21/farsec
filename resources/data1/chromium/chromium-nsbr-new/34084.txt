<title>Issue 34084 -   chromium -    Recreate the console view on appengine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In an effort to remove the load on the buildbot status page  we will be   sending all the status to app engine  and the users will be consuming those   instead of connecting directly to the buildbot.    this bug is about re-creating the console view on app engine using the data   that was pushed. </pre>
