<title>Issue 44909 -   chromium -    BXWA - &quot;FastBid&quot; - Compatability Issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I use BXWA on a regular basis  and Google Chrome does not work for viewing   plans on this site  as of now they say only Internet Explorer and Mozilla are   supported... is this something you are working on to fix  and make Google   Chrome compatible? I really enjoy Google Chrome  but don't intent to use it   if this isn't going to be fixed  because then I would have to continue to use separate browsers depending on what i'm doing online.    Thanks.  Josh   </pre>
