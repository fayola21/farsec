<title>Issue 36446 -   chromium -    Previously used client cert should be default choice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you select a client cert to use at a particular site  Chrome should   remember that choice and make that cert the default choice next time you   visit that site.    (Not sure if the other platforms do this already  but the code I just checked in   for Mac doesn't.) </pre>
