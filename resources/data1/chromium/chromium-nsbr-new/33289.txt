<title>Issue 33289 -   chromium -    Youtube videos are invisible in Chrome/Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.302.3 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36935">r36935</a>) beta candidate  OS: Linux Ubuntu 9.04  OS: Linux openSUSE 11.1        1. Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a>  2. Click on one of the Most Popular videos.  Chrome navigates to the page   that has that video.    What is the expected output?     Video should be visible.    What do you see instead?    Video is invisible  but you tell that it is playing because you can hear   the sound.  If you scroll or resize the browser window  the video then   becomes visible.    Other sites with flash don't seem to have this problem.    [KEYWORDS youtube flash swf]     </pre>
