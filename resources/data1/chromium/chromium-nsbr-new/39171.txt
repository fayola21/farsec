<title>Issue 39171 -   chromium -    geolocation: defer sending location via network location provider - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The google network location service should not be used with location specific   payload (e.g. mac addresses or cell ID) until the user has clicked Allow on the   geolocation prompt.  (An artifact of the webkit geolocation implementation is it will start location   updates even before the first permission request agreement)   </pre>
