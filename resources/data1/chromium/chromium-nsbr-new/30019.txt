<title>Issue 30019 -   chromium -    PageAction popups don't seem to work on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Using Chrome 4.0 Beta on Linux  install an extension that uses page   actions and popups.     For example:   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfj</a>  d  2. Click on the Page Action.     For example: Go to a page with a feed (nytimes  for example) and click   on the RSS icon.    Note that nothing happens. This is because a popup is supposed to appear    but it doesn't.    Rafael  I assigned it to you since we were going to look at it on your   machine in a minute. If you need to take   this off your plate  feel free to unassign.    I suspect this is a regression  so I added the label.   </pre>
