<title>Issue 29872 -   chromium -    file:// links do not open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: '4.0.249.30'&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : file:///any/file/in/your/local/machine           Safari 4: NO IDEA    Firefox 3.x: FAIL (even on 3.6beta4. See   <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122022">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122022</a>)           IE 7: NO IDEA           IE 8: NO IDEA    ---- What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Have a web page with an href to some local file via the file URL. E.g.:   &lt;a href=&quot;file:///home/xyz&quot;&gt;file:///home/xyz&lt;/a&gt;  2. Then  the link even though visible like a link  it does not open it.  3. Further  I can't even copy the link address with the right click.    ---- What is the expected result?  It should open the file URL link. As you would know  the file URL link is   perfectly valid when given in the address bar.    ---- What happens instead?  Nothing happens.   </pre>
