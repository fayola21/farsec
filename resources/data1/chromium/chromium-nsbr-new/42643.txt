<title>Issue 42643 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Infobars don't disappear on navigate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium @<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45707">r45707</a>    Do a search that pops up the &quot;Did you mean infobar&quot;.  With the infobar open  focus the omnibox   and do another search for that same term.  See that now you have two open infobars.  Repeat as   desired.    The first infobar should be disappearing once you do another search. </pre>
