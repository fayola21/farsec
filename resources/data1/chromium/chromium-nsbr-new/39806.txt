<title>Issue 39806 -   chromium -    geolocation: feature to be controlled by switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The javascript API is already controlled by the --enable-geolocation switch.  Need to ensure that all other entry points are guarded by this switch.    Specifically  the &quot;Location&quot; tab in the content settings dialog on each of the   three platforms needs to check this switch. </pre>
