<title>Issue 30005 -   chromium -    Excel calculations prevent new tabs from loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Launch Excel. I have Excel 2007 for PC. Force Excel to run a calculation   that takes a few minutes to run. For example  apply a formula (sumif or   vlookup) on a 200k-row spreadsheet  comparing it to a 10k-row spreadsheet.   The actual calculation you do doesn't matter  but Excel needs to think   about it for a few minutes.  2. While the calculation is running  open a new tab in Chrome and try to go   somewhere. For example  gmail.com. You can open a new tab and type in a   URL  you can open a new tab and click on a bookmark  or you could do &quot;open   in a new tab&quot; from an existing tab. As long as it's a new tab  and you   expect to go to a destination  it reproduces.        The new tab should open  and the destination URL should be loaded.          The new tab stays blank until Excel finishes the calculation  and then it   loads.      <b>Please provide
