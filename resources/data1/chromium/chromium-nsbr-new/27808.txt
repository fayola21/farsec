<title>Issue 27808 -   chromium -    Segmentation Fault with builds ~ &gt;=32003 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &gt;=32003  OS + version : Gentoo 10.0  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32bit  window manager : Metacity    When launching newer builds of chromium from Gentoo I receive a   segmentation fault error with no other output. Attached is gdb log with   backtracke for build 32051.    Seems like a threading issue...    Please note that I'm not sure in which build the problem started but I'm   currently running build 31382 successful  while 32003 doesn't work. I   tested until build 32051 which should be today's work.    If you need further details or tests feel free to ask me.     </pre>
