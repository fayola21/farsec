<title>Issue 31514 -   chromium -    resuming a download which was paused for many hours alters bandwidth calculation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. find a big file on a remote and fast server that supports resuming (a   big ISO for instance)  begin download for a couple of seconds then PAUSE it   for a least 1 or 2 hours.  2. Resume it  3. go to the &quot;downloads&quot; tab (CTRL+J) : although windows &quot;network monitor&quot;   reports a reasonable bandwidth (ADSL 8Mbps for me)  Chrome displays a   ridiculous rate (10~20 kBps instead of hundreds of kBps)      the actual download speed (approx 800kBps).      approx. 20kBps...  the bandwidth seems to be calculated according to the BEGINNING of the   download  regardless of the big &quot;pause&quot;. It should use the time when I   resumed it.      <b>Please provide
