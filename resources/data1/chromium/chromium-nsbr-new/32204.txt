<title>Issue 32204 -   chromium -    Revert the &quot;no_strict_aliasing=1&quot; patch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36151">r36151</a> I made -fno-strict-aliasing the default after a long discussion on   chromium-dev    Before this can be reverted  the following things should ideally happen   IMHO:    1. existing aliasing issues should be resolved properly in the code eg.   28749 et. al.    2. test/build infrastructure should exist to run all existing tests using    gcc 4.4 compiled binaries. This would ensure that regressions as a result of   aliasing errors are caught in the build/test environment rather than in the   field. </pre>
