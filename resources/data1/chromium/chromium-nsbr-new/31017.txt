<title>Issue 31017 -   chromium -    Yojimbo bookmarklets fail in Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK      1. Open the attached file in Chrome   2. Drag &quot;Bookmark In Yojimbo&quot; to the bookmarks bar  3. Navigate to <a href="http://www.apple.com">http://www.apple.com</a>  4. Click on created bookmarklet        Bookmark is created in Yojimbo        Bookmarklet fails because Chrome changes the URL the bookmark creates before passing it to   Yojimbo.    This is the URL which is created:    	x-yojimbo://CreateItem?  kind=Bookmark&amp;name=Apple&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2F  	  Since this is not a URL scheme Chrome knows (or can know) anything about  it should not modify   the URL and had it off as is.    Instead  it changes it to     	x-yojimbo://createitem/?  kind=Bookmark&amp;name=Apple&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2F  	  which fails in Yojimbo. (The first portion of the URL's case is changed  and an extra / is added.) </pre>
