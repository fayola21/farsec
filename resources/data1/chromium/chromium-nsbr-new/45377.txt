<title>Issue 45377 -   chromium -    Strange memory behavior on META REFRESH  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)  URLs (if applicable) : Not applicable           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: Not tested           IE 8: OK          Opera: OK    I have a very specific scenario.  I have one script taking screenshots of my webcam every second and   uploading the image to a webserver (~30-50KB).    And in my webserver  there is a page with this source:  &lt;HTML&gt;  &lt;HEAD&gt;    &lt;TITLE&gt;Camera&lt;/TITLE&gt;    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=Pragma CONTENT=no-cache&gt;    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT=3&gt;  &lt;/HEAD&gt;  &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=black TEXT=white&gt;    &lt;p align=center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;snapshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/BODY&gt;  &lt;/HTML&gt;    As one can see  this is a page that refresh its content every 3 seconds   without cache. In other words  it is a kind of live video straming webpage.    The problem is that when I open this page on Chrome  the memory usage for   the tab keeps growing and don't stop until I close it.    If I keep the tab openned for one hour  for example  my computer freezes   because of the high memory usage.    Other browsers does not present the same behavior.      My guess is that Chrome is keeping old images in memory for some reason. </pre>
