<title>Issue 26165 -   chromium -    Need to put together a manual test plan for extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test team has graciously offered to help us manually test the extension   system. We should put together a list of ~10 extensions that can be installed   and visually inspected that will represent a good smoke test that the system   is working. </pre>
