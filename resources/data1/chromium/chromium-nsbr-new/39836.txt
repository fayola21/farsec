<title>Issue 39836 -   chromium -    Not prompted for basic auth - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Try to log in to a allnet 2297 webcam        you should get prompted for basic auth. instead you get to see a 401 page.   The culprit is the webcam  which sends a malformed challange:    name=&quot;value    however  all other browsers silently ignore this and present a basic auth   dialog anyway.       </pre>
