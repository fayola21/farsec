<title>Issue 24734 -   chromium -    Crash on quit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start up Chrome Mac (r 28825 ) with just a themed empty window with a single bookmark in   the bookmark bar.  2. Quit      No crash    Instead I'm getting a crash because the view is attempting to determine whether or not it is   opaque  and it's controller (that it references) is already gone.    Note that I appear to be the only one seeing it  but it definitely is a bug. This was with a clean   build at the top of tree.     </pre>
