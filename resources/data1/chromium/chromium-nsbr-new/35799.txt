<title>Issue 35799 -   chromium -    History: back button navigating to incorrect (sometimes blank) page when clicked twice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071) - i'm using PL version if it  changes anything  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/pl/tips.html">http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/pl/tips.html</a>  <a href="http://www.skyscanner.pl/lotniska/bcn/barcelona-lotnisko.html">http://www.skyscanner.pl/lotniska/bcn/barcelona-lotnisko.html</a>         Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: -    repro:  1. clear cache  2. navigate to the test url (the first  google one)  3. switch to the second tab on the page (#green)  4. click the link 'for companies (?)' [PL: dla organizacji]  5. once page has loaded click the browser's back button twice - note: this  has to be done quite fast    EXPECTED:  the browser should either stay on the previous page (tips) or go back to  the start page    RESULT:  chrome fails to display the page with tips most of the time - a blank page  is shown instead  with the correct title  - it's possible that if you try navigating further back the start page  appears but with gmail icon in the tab    I've checked also for the second test link (skyscanner) by navigating to  the url given above  clicking on the link 'google maps' in the page  content  then clicking a random link in the right hand side panel.  Afterwards when double clicking back button the correct page appeared  but  with an incorrect title ('new tab'). When trying to navigate forward once  nothing happened.    It looks that Chrome might have a problem maintaining history when the  users are too fast when clicking. </pre>
