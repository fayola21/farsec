<title>Issue 46298 -   chromium -    bidi mirroring characters are not correctly mirrored during inputting in textfield and omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> while *inputing*  CRichEditCtrl does not mirror unicode bidi mirroring characters correctly.    Using parenthesis as example  following are how they should be displayed:  a. In RTL directionality  unless surrounded by LTR characters on both sides  U+0028 is displayed as &quot;)&quot;. U+0029 is displayed as &quot;(&quot;.  b. In LTR directionality  unless surrounded by RTL characters on both sides  U+0028 is displayed as &quot;(&quot;. U+0029 is displayed as &quot;)&quot;.    Although the parenthesis are not mirrored while inputting  it is mirrored correctly if rendering the whole text  for example using SetWindowText().          1. In English Chrome  press ctrl+F to open find-in-page  2. change IME to Hebrew  type in Hebrew character  for example 'A'.  3. change IME to English  type in &quot;(&quot; -- U+0028   4. change IME to Hebrew  type in Hebrew character  for example 'B'.  5. the display of the above is &quot;A(B&quot;  which is not correct according to the above rule.  6. now  change focus to anther tab  and focus back to this tab    7. the string is displayed as &quot;B)A&quot; (which is correct) in find-in-page box.      Or you can try the following:  1. In English Chrome  press ctrl+F to open find-in-page  2. type in English letter 'a'.  3. change IME to Hebrew  type in &quot;)&quot;  whose generated codepoint is U+0028   4. the display of the above is &quot;a)&quot;  which is not correct according to the above rule.  5. now  change focus to anther tab  and focus back to this tab    6. the string is displayed as &quot;a(&quot; (which is correct) in find-in-page box.          See above.        Above steps shows the bidi mirroring character is not correctly mirrored in LTR context. They are not correctly mirrored in RTL context either. Since currently our textfield and omnibox are actually in LTR direction  there is no way to test it out without changing the code and rebuild. </pre>
