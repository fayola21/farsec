<title>Issue 42309 -   chromium -    [RU] Too long translation of &quot;View full history&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Russian      5.0.385.0 (tree rev. 45309)      Windows 7 x64      The New Tab page:    At the bottom  in the &quot;Recently closed&quot; section  there is the &quot;View full   history&quot; link which is translated into Russian as &quot;_��_��_��___��_��_____��_���_��_��_��� __��_��_��__   _�ܕ�_��_��___��_��__��_&quot;. The translation is longer than the original  and it gets trimmed   to &quot;_��_��_��___��_��_____��_���_��_��_��� __��_��_...&quot; (similar to &quot;View f...&quot;) which is more than awkward.    I believe the horizontal space dedicated to the item should be considerably   increased  since I have seen translations into other languages  that are   even longer than the Russian one.       </pre>
