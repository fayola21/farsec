<title>Issue 30523 -   chromium -    ModelAssociator::LoadAssociations does not validate or rectify positions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am seeing a case during startup where ModelAssociator::LoadAssociations   succeeds  and yet shortly thereafter  we get an assertion failure here    processing a favicon load:    [14575:14575:1821188345162:FATAL:chrome/browser/sync/glue/change_processor.c  c(202)] Check failed: node-&gt;GetParent()-&gt;IndexOfChild(node) ==   CalculateBookmarkModelInsertionIndex(node-&gt;GetParent()  &amp;sync_node) (3 vs.   5)    This means that we're operating with bad associations: the client view and   the sync view have diverged.  I imagine that changes arrived from the server   -- and were applied -- before LoadAssociations ran.  If the changes   consisted only of moves within a folder  then LoadAssociations seems like it   would not detect the divergence; it does not validate the positions. </pre>
