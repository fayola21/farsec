<title>Issue 31905 -   chromium -    Reopened tabs with &quot;about:&quot; URLs do not display properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have more than one tab open.  2. Navigate a tab to any of the &quot;about:&quot; URLs.  3. Close that tab.  4. Right-click on the tabstrip and select &quot;Reopen Closed Tab&quot;      The tab should reopen and display the content of the &quot;about:&quot; page it was   on  instead a blank page is shown (but the &quot;about:&quot; URL correctly appears   in the omnibox).    Right-clicking the blank page shows a context menu with only a separator   and a disabled &quot;Inspect Element&quot; item.    If it was a window that was closed and then reopened using &quot;Reopen Closed   Tab&quot; then the same problem is still observed.    I observed this problem on Ubuntu 9.10 </pre>
