Create a bookmark and drag it under the Bookmark bar chevron.  2. Delete this bookmark.    Expected:  Bookmark bar should redraw/rebuild with the item gone.    Actual:  The bookmark is deleted (if you check in Bookmark Manager) but the item is still visible on the   bar  the bar doesn't redraw for.    Same issue with cutting a bookmark under the chevron.    You can see the changes happening immediately in the Bookmark Manager but not on the bar.   </pre>
