<title>Issue 29208 -   chromium -    TabRestoreUITest tests often hang the Mac valgrind bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're getting pretty frequent hangs on the Mac valgrind bots under the TabRestoreUITest tests. I'm   not sure if we just need a longer timeout  or something more serious is wrong  but I noticed there   are bugs mentioning them being flaky in general which may be related. </pre>
