<title>Issue 37442 -   chromium -    Improve scrolling performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> sbyer says that when you scroll:    a) We blit twice per screen update  b) We don't scroll but redraw everything    (a) is way more expensive and probably not too hard to fix. (b) is known (necessary when the find   bar is open) and maybe not too expensive  but we might want to look into scrolling anyways if the   find bar is closed.    We should look into this. </pre>
