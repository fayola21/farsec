<title>Issue 40724 -   chromium -    XMPP notifications are sometimes not sent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When testing on my desktop  I launch two browsers side by side on different   profiles to test sync.  Every now and again  one of the two browsers fails   to send notifications -- about:sync on that browser says &quot;Notifications   Enabled: false&quot;.  Output logs indicate that the XMPP connection is   successful  but I also see these lines:    [25531:25719:798273180705:INFO:chrome/browser/sync/engine/syncapi.cc(1828)]   Sending XMPP notification...  [25531:25719:798273180723:INFO:chrome/browser/sync/engine/syncapi.cc(1834)]   Could not send XMPP notification    Attached is the full output log -- unfortunately this is a mix of both   browsers' stdout :(   </pre>
