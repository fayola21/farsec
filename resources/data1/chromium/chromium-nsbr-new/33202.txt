<title>Issue 33202 -   chromium -    Google Chrome won't install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt; Chrome Beta    Other browsers tested: n/a      1.See explanation below          Can��_��_��_t install chrome  Few months ago  I installed ��_��_��_Advance System Care��_��_��_ on my new computer  I  didn��_��_��_t realize that with this installation it will also install Google  Chrome (it was too late). In my old computer I had Google Chrome Beta  so I  was expecting to install this version in my new computer as well. I tried  to download the Beta version but I got an error message ��_��_��_Google Chrome is  already installed and available to all users of this computer. If you want  to install Google Chrome at the level user  you must first uninstall the  system level version installed by an administrator��_��_��_  I am not a computer savvy  so I uninstalled Google Chrome from the control  panel. After this  I proceeded to download and install the Google Chrome  Beta Version. I got the same error message. I just thought by uninstalling  ��_��_��_Advance System Care��_��_��_ it will uninstall the regular Chrome Version (since  it came with it). I uninstalled ��_��_��_Advance System Care��_��_��_ and again tried to  install the Beta Version.  I got the same error. I checked the ��_��_��_Programs  and Features��_��_��_ in the Control Panel  there was not Google Chrome installed.  I tried several times with the same results. I gave up.  Weeks later a  re-installed ��_��_��_Advance System Care��_��_��_ and made sure not to installed Chrome.   Few days later I realized I had installed ��_��_��_View on Chrome��_��_��_ Firefox add-on.  I click on it and Chrome browser opened. I was surprise since I thought I  didn��_��_��_t have Chrome installed. I checked Control Panel but I did not see  Chrome installed.  I searched for Chrome in my computer and I found the  folder in the Program Files (x86).I deleted it.  Now every time I click on  the ��_��_��_View on Chrome��_��_��_ I get this message: ��_��_��_Google Chrome could not be run as  ��_��_��_C:Program File (x86)GoogleChromeApplication chrome.exe��_��_��_.   I can��_��_��_t install either version of Google Chrome.  I used Firefox and chrome  most of the time but for now I have to use Firefox and IE while this is  fixed (Hopefully). As a mention before  I am not a computer savvy  if this  is not fixed I have to say good bye Google Chrome :( for good and use IE  instead. Urghhh!     </pre>
