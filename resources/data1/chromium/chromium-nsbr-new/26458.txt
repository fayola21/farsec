<title>Issue 26458 -   chromium -    Menu item capitalization consistency in Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have some nitpicks regarding menu item labeling in Windows. Currently    menu items only have the first letter capitalized. I can't think of any   other programs that use this convention. In most Windows apps  each word   tends to be capitalized.    Examples:  &quot;New incognito window&quot; vs. &quot;New Incognito Window&quot;  &quot;Bookmark manager&quot; vs. &quot;Bookmark Manager&quot;    The same is also applicable to the Win 7 jumplist:  &quot;Recently closed&quot; vs. &quot;Recently Closed&quot;    One final thing: I think &quot;Most visited&quot; on the jumplist should be renamed   to &quot;Frequent&quot;. They're basically synonymous  but &quot;Frequent&quot; seems to be the   convention thus far. </pre>
