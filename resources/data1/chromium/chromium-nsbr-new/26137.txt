<title>Issue 26137 -   chromium -    CRASH Infobar close button versus JavaScript close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make the attached test.html your home page.  2. Provoke a crash.  3. Restart Chrome.  4. w/in 5 seconds  make the window key  and press and hold the infobar close button.  5. Release after window closes.        Crashes the browser.    Let me know if I can provoke an info bar more easily.  You can make a crash by browsing to   test.html  and click-dragging the link and holding it over the content until it crashes.   </pre>
