<title>Issue 26702 -   chromium -    Keystone user/system ticket collision - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When running as a non-root user  indicating a user ticket  the update   installation script should check to see if a matching system ticket is also   present.  If it is  it should remove the existing user ticket and exit early.  The   system ticket will &quot;own&quot; the product and should be responsible for updating   it. </pre>
