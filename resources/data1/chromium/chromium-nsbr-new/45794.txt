<title>Issue 45794 -   chromium -    Object.create doesn't work as on other OS'es - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.55 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -  psn_0_106522    <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/index.html">http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/index.html</a>    Doesn't work in latest Chrome beta build on Ubuntu Linux  either.  Works in latest Chrome beta build on Windows.  Works in Firefox and Safari on both OSX and Windows.    It appears Object.create(o) throws an exception when o is a function on OSX and Linux  but not   on Windows. Doug Crockford's original JS implementation does not throw an exception either (in   any OS). It's only the native code version in Chrome that does. </pre>
