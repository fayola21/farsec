Load a webpage with an interactive flash application  2. Give the flash app focus  3. Try to use cmd-`  cmd-l  cmd-m  -t  -w  etc.      Chrome should have switched windows  changed focus to location bar    minimized the window  opened a new tab  closed the window  etc.      Chrome has not switched windows  changed focus to location bar    minimized the window  opened a new tab  closed the window  etc. It's as   though the command key modifier is eaten - some apps with text input   windows will show the key (`  l  m  t  w  etc.) as though command were not   pressed.   </pre>
