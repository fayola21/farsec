<title>Issue 42177 -   chromium -    [Native Translator] Translate info bar UI isn't ideal (at least not for me!) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.3 (Official Build 44229) dev    The current bar looks like this:    [icon] This page is in [Arabic]. Would you like to translate it? [Yes]   [Nope] ....... [options v]    I feel this could be made a bit better. A few comments:    1) The options menu is waaaaay to the right. It's easy to miss if you have   a wide screen because the eye doesn't travel there naturally.    2) The options menu doesn't have many things in it anyway.    I suspect the reason some people complained when the bar was launched is   that it's easy to not notice how to disable language pair translations.    How about this alternative layout?    [icon] This page is in [Arabic]. [Translate v] [Don't translate v] [Learn   more]    Clicking translate would offer a &quot;translate just this page&quot;  &quot;translate   everything on this site&quot;  &quot;always translate this language&quot;.    Clicking don't translate would offer &quot;don't translate this page&quot;  &quot;never   offer to translate this language&quot;  &quot;never offer to translate this site&quot;.    It would have the following advantages:    * Most users probably want to pick &quot;always translate this site&quot; or &quot;always   translate this language&quot;. But the UI only makes &quot;translate this page once&quot;   convenient or easy.    * It ensures users discover the per-language/per-site options.    * It removes the casual-sounding &quot;nope&quot; which may annoy users who can't   figure out the ui and get frustrated as a result.    It would have the following disadvantage    * Doing a single page  one time translation takes an extra click.     </pre>
