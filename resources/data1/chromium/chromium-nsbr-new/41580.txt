<title>Issue 41580 -   chromium -    update IME state if WebKit can't handle the composition event - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes a composition event will be ignored by WebKit (e.g.  the textarea is disabled or the DOM   is mutated before WebKit gets the event).  In these cases  we send a IME_CANCEL_COMPOSITION  message back to the browser process so it can notify the IME that the composition event failed.    We currently ignore this message  but perhaps there's an IME that needs to update its state based on   this message. </pre>
