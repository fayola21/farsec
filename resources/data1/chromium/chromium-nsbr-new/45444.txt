<title>Issue 45444 -   chromium -    Select previously used bookmark when I click &quot;Other bookmarks&quot;. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feedback from the user below:    --    I have a list of bookmarks that I iterate over regularly. Each time I select 'Other bookmarks'  first   item is selected / highlighted. So when iterating over the bookmarks  I need to scroll it again and   again. Please preserve current selection and navigate to it when I click 'Other bookmarks' </pre>
