<title>Issue 37133 -   chromium -    Adding Chrome update available notification? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am not sure whether we need to do something here.    If side by side channel is later used for daily update  we may want to show a   notification like info bar to the user if an update is available. That way   the user can restart the browser to use the new version. </pre>
