<title>Issue 42719 -   chromium -    Insanely high memory usage on Mibbit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 (Official Build 45554) dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.mibbit.com/chat">http://www.mibbit.com/chat</a>  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Log into Mibbit (web-based IRC chat) as normal  2. Use the service as normal for at least 15 minutes  3. Wonder why everything is slow and no-one has said anything for a while  4. Discover the insanely high memory usage and panic    What is the expected result?    Memory usage normally hovers around the 12k - 20k mark. Service is as   responsive as any other website.    What happens instead?    Memory usage eventually rises to the 300k mark at which point the website   stops receiving or displaying data to the user. If left open long enough    entire system becomes sluggish.   </pre>
