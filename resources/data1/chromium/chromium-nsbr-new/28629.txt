<title>Issue 28629 -   chromium -    We need a way to reliably tell gtk widget state on x11 to make tests more reliable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have a few tests that are flaky because gtk's state is not always in sync  with the program  due to the asynchronous nature of x11 (and possibly gtk).  We need some way at least to keep the state in sync with the code to make   tests more reliable. </pre>
