<title>Issue 43978 -   chromium -    Text Input Readonly property - autocompletion list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>                   1. Simple input with a type 'text'. With readonly attribute set to   'readonly'.  2. Fill the chrome's native autocomplete list of this element with some   values (inserted not directly cause readonly  by JS)  3. Double-click on field. And select the value from a native autocomplete   list.      Readonly text inputs mustn't shows up autocompletion lists and mustn't   insert any values from it in a field.      The value from a list was inserted in an input text.    Thanks for attention       </pre>
