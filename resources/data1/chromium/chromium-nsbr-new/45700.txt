<title>Issue 45700 -   chromium -    Content window used by the GPU process doesn't resize properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  when the GPU process creates a GL context tied to a window   (currently used for pepper3D plugins and the layer compositor)  we first   create a child window and create the GL context using the DC of that child   window.  This is done to get around a bug with wgl that prevents GL windows   from resizing past their original size (See:   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44518">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44518</a>)    The child window needs to be resized every time its parent changes size.   The resizing currently happens in NativeViewGLContext::SwapBuffers which   means that any drawing up until that call is lost. Rendering an additional   frame and calling SwapBuffers is required to get the correct results.    The proper place to resize the child window is at the time its parent is   resized so that the GL backbuffer size is updated before any drawing   happens. </pre>
