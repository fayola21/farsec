<title>Issue 32532 -   chromium -    Custom keyboard shortcuts that invoke bookmarks open a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works correctly  bookmark is applied to current   tab    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not applicable  custom shortcut functionality is mac-  specific      1. Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts   2. Add a keyboard shortcut with the title of one of the bookmarks from your bookmarks   menu (either chrome-specific shortcut or for all applications)  such as Google Maps  3. Go back to Chrome  and invoke the bookmark using the new keyboard shortcut.      Bookmark should load in current tab  as would happen if the bookmark had been invoked   via the menu with the mouse.      New tab is opened and bookmark loaded in that new tab.  Current unchanged tab retains   focus.    This is mainly a problem if what you want to invoke via the shortcut is a bookmarklet   (e.g. the Read Later bookmarklet from Instapaper.com or the Readability bookmarklet   from <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/</a>) which need to act on the page you   are currently viewing. </pre>
