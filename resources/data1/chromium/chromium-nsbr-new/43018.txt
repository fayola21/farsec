<title>Issue 43018 -   chromium -    install detection busted when BHO is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 5.0.375.15      1. Go to Tools -&gt; Manage Add Ons  2. Disable GCF's BHO  3. Restart IE  4. Go to a page that prompts IE users via CFInstall  e.g.   <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org">http://alex.dojotoolkit.org</a>        A prompt should be displayed asking users to install GCF. This doesn't   happen because the ActiveX control can still be constructed which the   install detection routine takes as &quot;this system has GCF already  no need to   prompt&quot;.    A method should be added to the ActiveX control to query for BHO   enabled/disabled state and CFInstall made savvy about it.        No prompt. </pre>
