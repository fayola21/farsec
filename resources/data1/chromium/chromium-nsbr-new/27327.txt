<title>Issue 27327 -   chromium -    NNTP auto closes while reopening a 'Recently closed window' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.241.0 (Official Build 31417) and ToT.    -Have NNTP opened.  -Ctrl+n to create a new window and navigate to any webpage and close the  window.  -Click on the link in 'Recently closed' section of NNTP to reopen the  closed window      Expected:  The window should be reopened and should have the NNTP opened (Step1)    Result:  The window is reopened but NNTP closes.    Not sure  if we changed here by design?? If so it does not look good for  me. I don't see any reason to close a NNTP for reopening a closed window.   </pre>
