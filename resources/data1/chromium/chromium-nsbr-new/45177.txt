<title>Issue 45177 -   chromium -    [Accessibility] &quot;Invalid entry&quot; is read along with the text/label for graphics/links/buttons. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: dev channel build (latest)    1. Turn on JAWS.  2. Load Chrome  3. Navigate through the page using the tab key.  4. Pay attention to what is being read.    What is the expected output?   The appropriate label for the link/button/form field should be read.   Example  for the search button  &quot;Search button&quot; should be read.    What do you see instead?  The right information is read however  it is followed by &quot;invalid entry&quot;.      Used JAWS 11.0.1430  Behavior is consistent when using NVDA. However  when using Window-Eyes   7.2  &quot;hyperlink&quot; is read for every link instead. </pre>
