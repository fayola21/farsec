<title>Issue 34117 -   chromium -    sync notification issues with connection dropouts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've seen cases where notifications stop working after a connection interrupt   even though &quot;notifications enabled&quot; is true.    I still need to investigate what exactly causes this  but I'm filing this now so I   don't forget about it. </pre>
