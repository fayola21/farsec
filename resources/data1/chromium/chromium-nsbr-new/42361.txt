<title>Issue 42361 -   chromium -    Add new net error code ERR_MISSING_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> wtc raised a good issue in the code review of <a title="Need better user error messages for client SSL errors" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36480"> issue 36480 </a> -- a suggestion on changing our network   error codes around a bit to improve the quality of user error messages:  ________________________________  We may also set the ERR_BAD_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT error  when we send no certificate.    Whether we report ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR or  ERR_BAD_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT in that case depends on the  server's action.    Some servers respond with an SSL handshake_failure alert  when we send no certificate.  That alert is mapped to  ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR.    Other servers respond with an SSL bad_certificate alert   which is mapped to ERR_BAD_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT.    Ideally  we should add a new error code  ERR_MISSING_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT  and do context-sensitive  error code mapping of handshake_failure and bad_certificate.  ________________________________    Filing this in a new issue so I can close the original one. </pre>
