<title>Issue 41612 -   chromium -    Mousing over omnibox shows ibeam cursor between page actions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per shess:    If you move gradually from left to right over the page-action icons  the cursor  flips from arrow to i-beam and back.  I suspect that what we really should have  long-term is that the i-beam only happens in a specific area  and add some slop  around page-actions so that clicking between them either selects one of the  page-actions  or does nothing.  Clicking between and hitting the text editor  seems unright. </pre>
