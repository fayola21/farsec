<title>Issue 46205 -   chromium -    Typing in text fields produces no text  but invokes Chrome browser hotkeys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.70  URLs (if applicable) : googleDocs (spreadsheet)  blogger  seems like it happens &quot;randomly&quot;  OS version               : 10.6.3            1. go to a webpage which requires lots of text input (like a form  or even googleDocs)  2. start typing  3. at a &quot;random&quot; time during text input  keys pressed will invoke Chrome hotkey commands with their command description showing on the bottom-left of screen.    Aside: this may be related  but I cannot get the actual hotkey of Shift-Apple-J (Downloads) to work.  It does a page-down instead.        Expected to be able to keep typing without interruption.        Hotkeys get invoked.  Getting back to a text input state is almost impossible.  Either must close Chrome or do some jedi-stuff to get text back.  I don't remember how I got text back.    Thank-you! </pre>
