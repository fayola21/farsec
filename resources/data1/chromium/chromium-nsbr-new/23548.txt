<title>Issue 23548 -   chromium -    &quot;Show in folder&quot; should be &quot;Show in Finder&quot; on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open download item context menu        The menu item should read &quot;Show in Finder&quot; as in other OS X apps.        It says &quot;Show in folder&quot; as on windows/linux.    Cole  do you concur?    (And since this requires a strings change  this is slightly urgent) </pre>
