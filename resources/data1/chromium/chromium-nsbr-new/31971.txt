<title>Issue 31971 -   chromium -    r35181 broke window handling under Linux GTK+ version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Window manager tested with: XFCE's WM  Linux version: gHardy    Steps to reproduce:  1) Build gtk+ version of chrome for linux.  2) Start chrome.  3) Open a second window.  4) Note that both windows have the same titlebar color. (They shouldn't).    5) Revert 35181 and build gtk+ version.  6) Start chrome and open a second window.  6) Note that the new chrome window has the focused titlebar color while the   other one has the background color.    I haven't straight out reverted this since the commit message seems to   indicate that the patch fixes a race condition. Not sure what the correct   action is. </pre>
