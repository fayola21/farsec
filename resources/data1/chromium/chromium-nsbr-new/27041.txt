<title>Issue 27041 -   chromium -    Type to search in the Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I never realized the message &quot;Type to search&quot; in the omnibox  after over one year of using Google   Chrome  until today. I think if it was centered (and then disappeared when the omnibox had focus or   you started to type in it...or something) or some other way in which you see the message to remind you   that you can search from the omnibox would help people to see it and use the feature..because I never   really used it until today..although I knew it was there..I was just accustom to going to google.com   to search for something first. </pre>
