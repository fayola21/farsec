<title>Issue 42786 -   chromium -    Copy Image no longer works - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.342.9 beta  Is this the most recent version: I think this is the latest stable version  OS + version: Suse 10.3  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit  Window manager: Compiz    Behavior in Linux Firefox: unknown  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): unknown  Behavior in PREVIOUS VERSION of Chrome (3.???): works      1. Have The GIMP image editor open.  2. Right-click on an image and select &quot;Copy Image&quot;  3. Paste it into The GIMP.      Image is pasted in.      Clipboard (or whatever the Linux equivalent is) has not changed (I think).   Whatever was in the clipboard before the failed &quot;Copy Image&quot; is pasted in.    Workaround: Drag-and-drop the image from the web browser window into The   GIMP window. </pre>
