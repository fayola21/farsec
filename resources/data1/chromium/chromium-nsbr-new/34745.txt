<title>Issue 34745 -   chromium -    Security bug found in 4.0.249.78 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello guys  I recently found a security bug in the last revision: Google  Chrome 4.0.249.78 ( Windows )    This issue affects the history in the browser.    Drag and drop the txt file into the Chrome Browser... then copy all the A's  and paste it like 4 or 5 times in the address bar ... wait a few minutes  and your chrome will crash.    And if you dont delete your &quot;History&quot; when you write AAAA... in your  address bar .. the autocompletion will crash the browser..    Attached files:   User data: with the history already loaded for a easy and more practicall  review  Crash dump: for your knowledge    Thanks a lot and I want my $$$ reward!!!    <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/encouraging-more-chromium-security.html">http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/encouraging-more-chromium-security.html</a>    Greetings!
