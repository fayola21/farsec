<title>Issue 39176 -   chromium -    ReportCrash using 170%  CPU Util on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chrome on my macbook (built from top-of-tree)  with --  internal_nacl --no-sandbox --internal-pepper --enable-gpu-plugin  2. Load Native Client pepper_plugin.html or anything else that uses the GPU   process  3. after it fails  kill the tab etc.      I expect things to die cleanly and for Chrome to clean-up after itself.  Instead I see a &quot;ReportCrash&quot; process burning 170% CPU. I believe the GPU   process crashes  and NaCl modules are hung too.    The GPU and NaCl issues are not a ReportCrash problem  but the fact that   any scenario can cause this kind of misbehavior for ReportCrash is a   problem. After several minutes it's still at 122% CPU.       </pre>
