<title>Issue 33633 -   chromium -    Update from 4.0.303 to 5.0.307 severely distorted theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had the &quot;Good Smile Company&quot;   (<a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_at_goodsmileco.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_at_goodsmileco.html</a>)   theme installed  and was on 4.0.303. I got updated to 5.0.307 and when I re-  started the browser  my theme was totally distorted. Looks like color   inversion  plus some other strange effects (lost the background image).   Screenshot attached. On vista 64 if it matters.    P.s. this is yet another example of why it would be nice to have a &quot;you've   been updated&quot; notification -- cause we do break stuff  and it'd be nice to at   least know it was update related. </pre>
