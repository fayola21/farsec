<title>Issue 26879 -   chromium -    Inspect Element links do not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 3.0.195.27      Open a website that has CSS background images  such as:  background: url(<a href="http://example.com/images/logo.gif);">http://example.com/images/logo.gif);</a>    Right click on the element in the browser window and select &quot;Inspect   Element&quot;    In the inspection window  the URL for the image will show as a link (blue   and underlined) and also contain link related menus on right click.    Right click on it and select &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; &quot;Open link in new   window&quot;  etc.      &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; should open a new tab with the URL of the image.      Nothing happens. </pre>
