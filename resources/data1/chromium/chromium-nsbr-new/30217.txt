<title>Issue 30217 -   chromium -    Pulling a tab off onto the desktop switches spaces (possibly to the space I opened chrome in) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open chrome.  2. Open a window in a different space  3. pull off a tab to the desktop      The tab pulls off and becomes an independent window in that space      I am taken to a different space  possibly the space where I first opened   chrome (I can't test it without closing this bug!)      Please provide
