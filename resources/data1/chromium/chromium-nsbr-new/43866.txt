<title>Issue 43866 -   chromium -    chrome on ubuntu EEE netbook not redirecting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. fire up chrome  2. notice it isn't redirecting to a captured portal page  3. panic and curse at the gods    Hello friendly group.     We recently installed chrome on an Eee PC netbook running 10.04 ubuntu.  When we attempt to connect to the internet using chrome  we aren't  redirected to our schools portal page (aruba wireless).     The sad  sad  sad thing is when we firefox  we ARE properly redirected to  the aruba portal page  where we can login and read XKCD all day long.    Any idea why chrome isn't redirecting to our login portal  but firefox is?     We poked around /var/logs to look for error / warnings / grues and found  nothing.     Appreciate any of that &quot;collective wisdom&quot; everyone talks about.    Warmly  and thanks in advance      Bill                 <b>Please provide
