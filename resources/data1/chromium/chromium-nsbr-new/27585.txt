<title>Issue 27585 -   chromium -    Esc does not correctly dismiss http auth dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to http://www/~thakis/cgi-bin/test.html (internal only  sorry)  2. Hit esc        First auth sheet should be dismissed  second should appear  broken image   should appear -- just as if &quot;cancel&quot; had been pressed.        Both auth dialogs just disappear. Probably missing some handler on &quot;window   dismissed&quot; that calls CancelAuth(). </pre>
