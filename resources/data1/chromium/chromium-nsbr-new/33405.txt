<title>Issue 33405 -   chromium -    [CF - IE Menu] &quot;Shortcut to desktop&quot; menu doesn't work for pages rendered by Chrome Frame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Go to a page rendered by Chrome Frame  2. Click &quot;File&quot; -&gt; &quot;Send&quot; -&gt; &quot;Shortcut to Desktop&quot;        Ideally this should create a shortcut to desktop  but currently nothing  happens. This happens on all versions of CF.       </pre>
