<title>Issue 31858 -   chromium -    Carbon plugin null events should have actual mouse location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we send the last mouse point within the plugin with null events  rather than the actual   mouse location; both Safari and Firefox do the latter.    Before we can fix this we need to fix <a title="Send window geometry to plugin via IPC" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31543"> bug 31543 </a>  however  or we'll get hover effects in totally the   wrong place between the window moving and the mouse re-entering the plugin (since that's the   only time we currently update the plugin's dummy window location). </pre>
