<title>Issue 30289 -   chromium -    about:plugins should report path to files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Linux 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : about:plugins  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Visit about:plugins     [in my case  whilst trying to resolve flash plugin issues which may be due   to two different versions of flash plugins in three separate files being   found]      That plugins should contain sufficient path information to determine which   file is being used.       Only the filename of the plugin (e.g. libflashplayer.so) is given.    [in my case  there are three separate files with this filename.]     </pre>
