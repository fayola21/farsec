<title>Issue 35091 -   chromium -    Application shortcuts run extensions without UI capabilities providing a confusing experience at best - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev    If you create an application shortcut  and use that shortcut your  extensions still run in the application shortcut window  but there's no UI  capabilities to do anything with extensions  enable  disable  etc.      For LastPass this is a a security issue: we indicate your logged in state  via the UI button  and if you close your main chrome window without closing  your application shortcut window it's not clear to users that they may  still be logged in. </pre>
