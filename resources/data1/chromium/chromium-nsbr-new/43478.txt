<title>Issue 43478 -   chromium -    Hard crash in gHardy (when detaching a tab out) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. It may not be reproducible though cause I tried again and it didn't   happen. So basically what I did was to create a presently doc  edited a   slide and then I was trying to detect the tab out to its own window and it   crashed the whole application.             It shouldn't crash. Or maybe crash the detected window but not the main   window          The whole application got killed.      <b>Please provide
