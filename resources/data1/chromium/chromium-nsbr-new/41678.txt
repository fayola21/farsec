<title>Issue 41678 -   chromium -    javascript console should give more verbose error messages like Firefox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.11 beta         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. trigger any sort of javascript error      The error is given with contextual information  e.g. If it's a syntax   error  where the error probably was.  What line the error occurred on.  Clicking should take you to the error (or preferably just print the   offending line of code + lines of code around it) and underline the   relevant bits (e.g. where a missing parenthesis was expected)      Very vague error messages with no contextual information:  e.g. &quot;Unexpected ___&quot;    If this functionality *does* exist in Chromium  it really should be the   default behavior. </pre>
