<title>Issue 25084 -   chromium -    Expose/Spaces animations choppy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)    OS version               : 10.5.8 (9L31a)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK        1. Launch Chrome with at least one window  2. Activate expose or spaces  3. Note delay on finalizing chrome windows      Expose and Spaces complete quickly      There is a noticeable delay just before the final redraw when any Chrome   windows are involved.    For example  using the All Windows Expose mode  when a window is   selected and everything expands to normal size  just before the end - at   95% or so of full size - the animation pauses for moment before finalizing.    With Spaces  switching into or out of a screen with Chrome windows has a   small delay just before the move is finished. </pre>
