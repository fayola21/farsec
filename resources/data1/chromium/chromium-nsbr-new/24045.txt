<title>Issue 24045 -   chromium -    make build rebuilds unnecessarily - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If it try to build the same target twice  everything builds again.    When I rollback gyp to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=676">r676</a>  I don't get this problem.  I think <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=677">r677</a> &quot;make   fixes: Force link commands to be run by removing default &quot;order only&quot;  and   fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH.&quot;    This bug should probably be have filed in the gyp code project. </pre>
