<title>Issue 33102 -   chromium -    Noticeable jank pulling down Bookmarks menu  with large numbers of bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In fixing <a title="[Mac] Changes to multiple bookmarks lock up UI thread for seconds" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30600"> bug 30600 </a> I've removed the delay when updating any bookmark   (noticeable if you have lots of bookmarks  and awful if many of them are   being updated at once). Instead  that delay now occurs once  when pulling   down the Bookmarks menu the first time after launch or the first time after a   bookmark has been changed.    This isn't a big problem (it's about 0.2 sec on my Mac Pro with ~2 000   bookmarks) but it's detectable jank. Someone with ridiculous amounts of   bookmarks might find it objectionably long. So I'm filing this bug to note the   remaining issue. </pre>
