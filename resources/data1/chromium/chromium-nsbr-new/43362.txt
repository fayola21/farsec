<title>Issue 43362 -   chromium -    Omnibox changes the auto-completed url after the first auto-completion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.29    QuickTime Player: 7.6.6    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2    After seeing Mark P's machine  we noticed that     When typing first 2-3 chars in the omnibox  Chrome does url auto-complete and then   immediately omnibox url gets changed to other best suggestion. (Without changing the chars   entered by user)    I think to repro this problem we need a large history with set of qualified/unqualified urls.  ie www.google.com  www/~abcd/...    We will try to repro this problem and will update the bug with steps.   </pre>
