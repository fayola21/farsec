Open Chromium for Mac  2. Go to Google Docs  3. Create New -&gt; Documents  4. Press Shift+Cmd+F      Chromium should go fullscreen (No menu bar  tab bar  bookmarks bar  etc)      The document inside Chromium gets &quot;Fullscreen&quot; or what Google call it   &quot;Hide Controls&quot;    I guess the webpage catches the keyboard event and we'll need to change   it to another fullscreen combination on Mac or change Google Docs'   (Unlikely) </pre>
