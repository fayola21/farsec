<title>Issue 31437 -   chromium -    NiceToHave: chrome extensions api tabs children - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't see a &quot;feature template&quot;  so  sorry in advance for the extra trouble.    It would be great to have a function in the API to retrieve children tabs. Tabs created   by others tabs.     I implemented something similar in the &quot;tab plus&quot; extension to manage tabs   internally. But  it is far from perfect.    Thanks </pre>
