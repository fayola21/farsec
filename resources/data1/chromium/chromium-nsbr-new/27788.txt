<title>Issue 27788 -   chromium -    Consider adding Silverlight to the whitelist for beta - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since Silverlight now works  we should consider adding it to the whitelist for   beta. We should watch the issue tracker and the crash server for a little while   after the next dev channel before deciding  but filing now so we don't forget   to make a conscious choice about it. </pre>
