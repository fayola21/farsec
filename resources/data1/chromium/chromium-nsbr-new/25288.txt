<title>Issue 25288 -   chromium -    Mouseover / Mouse input to flash window does not work as expected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Chromium 4.0.223.5 (29495)  Flash 10.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32">r32</a>  URL: <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/DesktopTD15k.swf">http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/DesktopTD15k.swf</a>  OS version: 10.5.8  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: working as intended      1. Wait for Ads to finish.  2. Click on 'English'  then click on 'Easy'. You may need to click many  times for something to happen. This is a bug in chrome.    3. Press '1'. Details for a pellet tower now appear on the right hand side.  (Thank you  Amanda!). Press '1' to deselect again.    4. Try to use mouse to click on pellet tower. Most of the time  the details  will appear shortly and disappear again. This is a bug in chrome.    5. Place the mouse on the middle of the field. Use the keys '1' - '3' to  cycle through units. Move the mouse on the field. Placeholder and range  indicator should move with the mouse. They do not. (Compare to firefox or  safari  or windows chrome  to see expected behaviour).    Thank you for your consideration! </pre>
