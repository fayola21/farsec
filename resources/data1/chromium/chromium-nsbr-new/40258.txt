<title>Issue 40258 -   chromium -    New omnibox behavior (&quot;search within cnn.com&quot;) confusing  flimsy and buggy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Type &quot;cnn.com&quot; in the omnibox (and you have been to cnn.com before  so   the omnibox will autocomplete quickly)  2. After typing 'c' and 'n'  the omnibox completes to &quot;cnn.com&quot; and   replaces right away what you type by a &quot;Search cnn.com&quot; special feature. )I   didn't press TAB.)  3. If you try to erase any of the letters of the completed URL &quot;cnn.com&quot;    the omnibox hides the &quot;Search cnn.com&quot;  showing &quot;cnn.com&quot; again. After   erasing the 'm' and the 'o'  the &quot;Search cnn.com&quot; comes back  and you're   back to point 2. It becomes impossible to erase &quot;cnn.com&quot; with backspace    you're in a loop  the only escape is to close the tab.        - Probably the &quot;Search cnn.com&quot; special feature should be in the dropdown   of the omnibox (or only activated by TAB)  not replace the being typed URL.   Rationale: if I simply want to go the cnn.com homepage  I can't. The   &quot;Search cnn.com&quot; will not send me to the homepage if I simply type &quot;Enter&quot;.   This is a regression. It is also damn confusing with the omnibox hiding   what you're typing all the time (as opposed to showing an evolving list of   choices  below  in the dropdown as it used to do  which is fine).    - If I also have crbug.com in my browsing history  if I type 'c' in the   omnibox  and wait around 200ms before typing 'n'  then the box &quot;Search   crbug.com&quot; appears and anything I type after that will go in the that   search box  and I have no way of typing cnn.com (and cannot remove that   search box because of points 2. and 3.). This is a regression.      <b>Please provide
