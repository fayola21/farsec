<title>Issue 44786 -   chromium -    [Feature Request] Make Chrome the *best* browser for web development - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  6.0.401.1 dev         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: Better  with Firebug           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL    Chrome should be the best browser for web development.  Some of the features required to achieve this would be:  * CSS Auto-completion (hell  even IE Developer Toolbar supports this)  * Ability to SAVE css changes to your local CSS file(s) (this would be a HUGE feature for developers)  * Better &quot;Edit As HTML&quot; functionality (colorized  with standardized formatting -- or better yet  edit in configurable external   editor)    To be fair  Chrome already has some superior performance analysis tools than any other browser. It should be the case   that HTML/CSS development tools are superior as well. </pre>
