Right click on the counter on the right side of the screen  2. Choose 'inspect'  3. Try to open any of the div's 'minutes'  'days'  'seconds' or 'hours'  4. You fail to open it because it changes every second      I don't really know  but at least be able to view it. Maybe something like   'freeze': the page doesn't update anymore.      It closes continuously </pre>
