<title>Issue 28935 -   chromium -    drover eats hyphens - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I was using drover to merge <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33241">r33241</a> to the 249 branch  and when it brought   up the editor  I found that it had eaten all of the hyphens from the original   change description.  I had to put them back in manually.    drover should not eat hyphens. </pre>
