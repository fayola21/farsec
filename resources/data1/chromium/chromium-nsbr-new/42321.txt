<title>Issue 42321 -   chromium -    In &quot;Confirm Navigation&quot; dialog  hitting escape should have the same effect as clicking &quot;Stay on this Page&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mouse-avoidant users like to use keyboard shortcuts wherever possible. In Mac OS X  the escape   key typically maps to the Cancel button in dialogs. Because the &quot;Confirm Navigation&quot; dialog's   &quot;Stay on this Page&quot; button has the same effect as Cancel  users (like myself) expect the escape   key to have the effect of pressing that button.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Go to gmail.com  2. Enable keyboard shortcuts  3. From inside a message  hit 'y' to archive  4. Quickly! hit cmd-W to close the tab  5. Get a &quot;Confirm Navigation&quot; dialog. (If you didn't get one  repeat steps 1-4 more quickly.)  6. Hit escape.    Expected result: The dialog box goes away  without effect  as if you had hit &quot;Stay on this Page&quot;    Observed result: Nothing. And I have to go use the mouse to make the dialog go away without   losing the pending server request. </pre>
