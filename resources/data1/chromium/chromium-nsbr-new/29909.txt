<title>Issue 29909 -   chromium -    parent id &amp; position should be optional in the sync protocol - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the sync protocol  a client should be able to omit the parent id and/or   position in parent values.  When this happens  the server should try to   preserve the original location as much as possible.  For newly created   items  the server should create them in some default location  and this   behavior should be documented in sync.proto.    The rationale for this is that a non-chrome sync client might not enforce a   hierarchy or position on its bookmarks  and wish to access them as an   unordered  flat collection.  Android bookmarks work this way: search is the   primary interface  and bookmarks are presented in relevance-order  rather   than in a fixed positional hiearchy.    Additionally  in Chrome  non-bookmark objects might not be positional    and so we might not want to have the sync client to bother maintaining a   position for these items (though we probably will not do away with parent   IDs  it's possible that we'd have folders whose contents were not ordered).    Making the sync.proto fields optional provides the flexibility to do this.    The work is probably mostly on the server-side  but we might start by   defining the behavior in sync.proto. </pre>
