<title>Issue 30670 -   chromium -    Cannot input any characters after typing CTRL+H on IME - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (This issue is originally reported to the U2U forum of Google Japanese IME   &lt;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/ime/thread?tid=4753c2f759b88e98&amp;hl=ja">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/ime/thread?tid=4753c2f759b88e98&amp;hl=ja</a>&gt;  but this issue is moved to our   buganizer because it happens also with other IMEs.)      1. Launch Chrome;  2. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/;">http://www.google.com/;</a>  3. Set the input focus to its search box;  4. Change the input method to Chinese ITABC (or Japanese Kotoeri);  5. Type an 'A' key;  6. Type Control+H keys  and;  7. Type any keys.    What is the expected output?  We can see typed characters in the search box.    What do you see instead?  Nothing happens.      To check this issue with our continuous builds  this issue doesn't happen on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26664">r26664</a> (*1) but happens on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26799">r26799</a> (*2). I   suspect this is a regression caused by <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=26694">r26694</a>.
