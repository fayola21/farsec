<title>Issue 36275 -   chromium -    create whitelist of &quot;privileged&quot; extension ids which can inject content scripts into all pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We would like to use extensions to develop some features that add general   functionality to all pages  including chrome:// pages  etc.  These extensions   would be bundled with the browser  so the issues of API compatibility and   security shouldn't be an issue.  To support this use case  one possibility is   to bake in a white list of trusted extension ids which would get these   enhanced privileges.   </pre>
