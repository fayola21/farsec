Put the cursor in the end of the last line (the left most part of the the bottom line).  3. Press the Up arrow key - cursor will move one line upwards.  4. Press the Up arrow key again - cursor will move to the beginning of the current line instead of moving one line upwards.  5. Any additional Up arrow key press will have no effect.
