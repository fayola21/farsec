<title>Issue 24004 -   chromium -    Need to handle chrome back/forward context menu options on the CF side - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Current if the user selects Back on the CF context menu when there is no   back entry in the travel log  Chrome crashes (same thing for Forward). These   events should be handled by Chrome Frame and shouldn't trigger a crash.  --  We should also handle history.back/forward </pre>
