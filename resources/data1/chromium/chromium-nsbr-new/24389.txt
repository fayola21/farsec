<title>Issue 24389 -   chromium -    Need a way to track pending timers through the inspector - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's much too hard to debug the common error of leaking timers  especially   setInterval() timers  in Chromium right now.  As a developer I want to be   able to click a button in the inspector and have it list out every pending   timer along with:    - whether it's a setTimeout or a setInterval  - the delay time specified and the clamped value  - how many times it has fired so far (for setIntervals)  - a timestamp and the JS stacktrace when it was set  - what code will be executed when it fires (either the specified string or   the contents of the specified function)    This would make debugging a few recent problems in google properties about   10 000 000x easier. </pre>
