<title>Issue 35948 -   chromium -    White space in tab bar instead of tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): Chromium 4.0.249.78   (Developer Build 36714)  Is this the most recent version: no  OS + version: Arch Linux  kernel version 2.6.32 (using KMS + X.org Intel   driver 2.10.0)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: TWM (yes  that archaic one)            Bug is very random  I only got this once.  1. When opening a new tab (IIRC via middle-clicking)  the tab bar wasn't   drawn  instead a huge white gap appeared. (It could also have appeared   after moving the window a little  I am not sure  sorry.)  2. Moving over the places where the tabs should be  they appeared one by   one. In the attached screenshot there are still two tabs undrawn  but none   of them initially appeared.      The tabs should have been drawn instantly.    I installed one extension: Delicious Tools.  I was using system title bar and borders. </pre>
