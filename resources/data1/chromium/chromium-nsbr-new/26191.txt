<title>Issue 26191 -   chromium -    Line count in downloads tab can oscillate distractingly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a minor annoyance. I doubt it's Linux-specific but I haven't been   able to test on other platforms.    Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29916)  OS + version : Arch Linux (package is aur/google-chrome-dev 4.0.223.11-1)  CPU architecture x86_64  window manager : metacity      1. Start a large-ish download and open chrome://downloads/  2. Resize the window horizontally so the file name plus status line (e.g.    303.5 kB/s - 1529.7 kB of 58.6 MB  3 mins left) is almost exactly as wide   as the window  3. Watch as download speed &amp; ETA oscillate      A steady display appears  with the numbers changing as the download   progresses.      A rapidly shifting display appears: the status line is alternately on the   same line as the file name or wrapped to a new one  depending on the width   in the current font of the digits in the status line.  If the file name's width is &quot;just right&quot;  this behavior can be triggered   without step 2.    It would probably be better if any necessary line-wrap would &quot;stick&quot; until   the window is resized. </pre>
