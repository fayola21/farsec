<title>Issue 39518 -   chromium -    Don't allow pages to request extension resources unless the extension has access to that page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Web sites can detect extensions by attempting to load resources (like   manifest.json) and detecting whether they load or not.    This works because we specifically allow web pages to load extensions   resources so that content scripts can rely on images from their package.    However  as more and more extensions don't contain content scripts  we're   needlessly disclosing data to websites.    We should prevent web sties from loading extension resources unless the   extension has opted into interacting with the web site. </pre>
