<title>Issue 35889 -   chromium -    Cookie Warning Dialog Not Resizing Properly When &quot;Show/Hide Details&quot; Is Clicked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL that supplies cookies not already on the   &quot;allow&quot; list.  Other browsers tested: N/A; Chrome-specific.      1. Visit a website that attempts to place cookies (ex. pandora.com)  2. Click the show/hide details toggle button.  3. Dialog resizes  making it unusable. Since the focus carat is set to the   button (although it is no longer visible)  hitting spacebar will resize the   window back to a useable form.      The window would resize  hiding the extra details  but leaving the vital   &quot;Allow&quot; and &quot;Deny&quot; buttons as well as the radio buttons visible.      The dialog becomes very small  and essentially useless since it hides all   pertinent information. </pre>
