<title>Issue 34582 -   chromium -    Bookmarks Bar at New Tab page doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.317.0 (38075) Ubuntu      Temporary Bookmarks Bar that appears at New Tab page  while the actual Bar  is not in 'always show' mode  doesn't accept clicks anymore. Bookmarks on  this bar are also not being highlighted when you point them with the mouse  cursor. A short desktop video record is attached. The problem has started  since yesterday I've updated with the version prior to the above specified.  I don't think it's something related with appearance-themes of the browser  as it remains when you change them  </pre>
