<title>Issue 35045 -   chromium -    NaCl: Redesign memory protection abstraction - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current abstraction (mprotect/mmap) is a thin layer over Linux  and   doesn't fit the Windows model well. Our needs are the same on both systems    though  and it seems like we should be able to design an abstraction that   fits both platforms. </pre>
