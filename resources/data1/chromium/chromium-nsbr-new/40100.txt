Please help.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 unknown (38071)          Firefox 3.x: OK             I'm facing these problems using Google Chrome browse..  1. Mostly any big page is not loaded in the browser.        &gt; For example  if I go for orkut or facebook or aol or sometimes   yahoo too  not loaded. It shows some text in half page  and keeps loading    but nothings happens then. If I press refresh button  again some different   text is shown to me.     If I load same page in Firefox  it is loaded at   first try only.    2. I'm facing with privacy matter.        &gt; If I've visited some private sites  its cache is stored in the main   page of the browser  with thumbnails.        &gt; I also can't store thumbnail of the site I want  it is   automatically stored.        &gt; I also wish for password protection to use the Google Chrome   installed at my pc.    -------------------&gt;        Still  I've a great experience using this browser.
