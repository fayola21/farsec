<title>Issue 24842 -   chromium -    We shouldn't be using NSBundle when we're not sure of thread safety - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> NSBundle isn't really thread-safe.    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/</a>  Multithreading/ThreadSafetySummary/ThreadSafetySummary.html    We use it in maybe-unsafe ways in base/base_paths and   chrome/common/chrome_paths_mac.  And maybe other spots.  If we can't be   sure what thread these will be called on  we shouldn't be using NSBundle. </pre>
