<title>Issue 42828 -   chromium -    Minor debugging could be enabled by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I notice that some bugs that people and I report are closed because we do   not have the time nor desire to learn how to install and use a heavyweight   debugging tool. I mean absolutely no offense  but one cannot expect all   users to have the technical knowhow *and* motivation to provide extremely   technical debug information for the bugs they find  because of Chromium's   choice of language.    Please consider if it would be possible to enable some sort of lightweight   debugging by default  which could provide enough info for a bug report.    I'm not sure how exactly one could achieve the type of reflection in C. But   perhaps an invisible in-memory trace (suitably optimized) and a &quot;dump debug   info now&quot; command could vaguely replicate some functionality.    Or if performance is a concern  at least enable debugging as simply as   enabling Page&gt;Developer&gt;EnableDebugging option that lasts until right after   the browser next opens or possibly reboots the browser (or opens a new   window) with debugging enabled. And having the log automatically inserted a   bug report at the exact url of   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a> . </pre>
