<title>Issue 34333 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't reduce the Tabs Sizes when it is running in a 42 inch Screen and DPI set as 150% - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Google Chrome  2. Add Tabs (by clicking on Plus icon)  3. After 5 Tabs opened (that is the maximum limits to fit into the 42 inche   screen)  Chrome keep adding more Tabs with same size pass the monitor   screen limits.       Is expected that the opened Tabs reduce theirs sizes  like it is when   Chrome run in a normal monitor screen (not 42 inche with DPI set as 150%)    to fit all opened Tabs into the monitor screen limits.      Is not possible access the lastest opend Tabs.    <b>Please provide
