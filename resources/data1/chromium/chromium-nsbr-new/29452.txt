<title>Issue 29452 -   chromium -    Feature request: Popup bubble size should be user adjustable (with no max size) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.22 (Official Build 33427)                    1. Create an extension with a popup containing content wider than 800px   (the current max)  2. Use the extension.        The popup will resize to arbitrary sizes (with no max size).      The popup contents can't fit  so scroll bars are added.    Aaron Boodman asked me to report this feature request.   </pre>
