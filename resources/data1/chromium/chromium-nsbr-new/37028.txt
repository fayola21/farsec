<title>Issue 37028 -   chromium -    Attach sRGB to untagged images instead of monitor profile (wide gamut monitor problems with Mac OSX) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Connect a mac to a wide gamut monitor such as the Dell 2408 WFP (also  known as AdobeRGB monitors).  2. Visit the gballard.net page using Chrome and mouse over the image on  top  notice the colors change.  3. Visit the gballard.net page using Firefox 3.5 with color management  enabled.  See the colors DO NOT change.  4. Check that IE8 on Windows 7  colors do not change.  5. Visit any site such as www.ebay.com on the mac hooked to a wide gamut  monitor that has untagged images (ebay logo is untagged).  See the red &quot;e&quot;  is over saturated.  Compare it to the color red in Firefox.  Firefox is  closer to the correct color.  Compare the result of Chrome on Windows to  Chrome on Mac (with the wide gamut monitor).  Chrome on Windows looks  correct.  Chrome on Mac doesn't.    The root cause of this problem  as explained by the gballard.net page is this:    When Chrome on Mac OSX encounters an untagged image  it assigns the monitor  profile to it.  While this works for normal monitors which are close to the  sRGB color profile  it is broken with wide gamut monitors.  Due to the  color space problems  all colors (particularly reds) are oversaturated on  the Mac version of Chrome.    The problem with this is since 99% of the images on the internet are  untagged  Chrome is useless when used on the Mac platform with a wide gamut  monitor.  The colors are not just accurate  but they hurt your eyes.    Firefox 3.x handles this accurately.  It applies sRGB color profile to  untagged images  which is the correct intent.  Right now Chrome on mac  assumes that all monitors are sRGB monitors and this assumption fails for  wide gamut monitors (monitors that are closer to aRGB color space).    Please fix this.                     </pre>    </td>  </tr>          <tr class="cursor_off">  <td class="vt issuecomment">        <span class="author">Comment <a name="c1"  href="#c1">1</a>  by  <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/u/anand.sankaran/">anand.sankaran</a></span>   <span class="date" title="Sun Feb 28 12:16:51 2010">Feb 28  2010</span>   <pre> Sorry  forgot to add the other 3 questions:    - What is the expected result?    In the gballard test at <a href="http://www.gballard.net/photoshop/srgb_wide_gamut.html">http://www.gballard.net/photoshop/srgb_wide_gamut.html</a>  the  colors should NOT change when you mouse over.    - What happens instead?    The colors shift on wide gamut monitor when used with Mac OSX.  This is wrong.    - Please provide
