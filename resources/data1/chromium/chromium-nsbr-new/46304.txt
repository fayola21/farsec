<title>Issue 46304 -   chromium -    window.open fails with second parameter if access key used - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;            Firefox 3.x: OK             IE 8: OK        1. Have a form with a button that has an access key and a JavaScript click handler.  2. The handler does window.open('http://www.google.com');  3. Click the button; result as expected.  4. Press the access key combination followed by Enter; result as expected.  (As a separate issue  I would much rather the Enter was not needed; it isn't in Firefox).  5. Change the handler code to window.open('http://www.google.com' 'windowName');  6. Click the button; result as expected.  7. Press the access key combination followed by Enter; the button gets the focus but nothing else happens. No errors are reported. And in this state  clicking the button no longer works either.      What is the expected result? New tab opens for www.google.com      What happens instead? See above. </pre>
