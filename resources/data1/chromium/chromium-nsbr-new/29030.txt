<title>Issue 29030 -   chromium -    Tabs turn into illegible narrow stubs when there are many tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you open a large number of tabs in Chrome Mac  the tabs have no minimum width  and   therefore continue to shrink even beyond the point of the labels and (x) close buttons   disappearing.    Chrome Version : 4.0.249.12  OS version : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): minimum width for tabs before spilling over into right-  side menu  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): minimum width for tabs before spilling over into right-side   menu      1. Keep opening tabs until you can no longer see the (x) close buttons or tab labels  2. The tabs are effectively useless at this point.      Tabs shrink down to a minimum width  after which point they spill over into a menu on the right   side of the tab bar. They can shift left and right as Firefox does  or something equivalent.      Tabs keep shrinking in width no matter what. </pre>
