<title>Issue 46070 -   chromium -    Chrome waits for a long time before starting to download pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I can only repdouce this on my machine at work. I cant reproduce it on any other computers... The only thing i do  is that i open webpages.  We are using a PAC proxy script.      The page should start downloading at once.      Chrome waits for 10-30 seconds without doing anything  and they  suddenly the page loads. This does only happen on the first page on a domain after opening a tab. So if i have loaded the front page and clicks on a link  it opens like normal. If i close the tab  it is slow again the next time.  Could it be a dns problem?    <b>Please provide
