<title>Issue 46253 -   chromium -    Changing proxy during download loses the file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)  OS: Windows 7 x64      1. Start some big download  2. After some part of the file has been downloaded change the proxy settings (I closed a tool called Fiddler which sets itself up as a WinINET proxy)      Continued download - or at least paused so that it can be started later.      Download was canceled without any indication that there was a problem. The file appears on the disk but was incomplete. </pre>
