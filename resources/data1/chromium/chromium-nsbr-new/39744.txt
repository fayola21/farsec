<title>Issue 39744 -   chromium -    CHROMIUM_BUILD env variable should be used in locales.gyp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> $(CHROMIUM_BUILD) is used in the .rc filename in src/chrome/app/localeslocales.gyp  This means that CHROMIUM_BUILD must STILL be set to 'google_chrome' to get a valid build official   build. This is NOT the intended behavior. This should be set by the 'branding' gyp variable.     </pre>
