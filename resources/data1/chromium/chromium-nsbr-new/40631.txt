<title>Issue 40631 -   chromium -    Download counter runs wild when disk is full - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download a file to big to fit on the disk (maybe just the default   ~/Downloads/ folder  that's what I'm using).  2.

Download counter running wild  with no clue to the real reason being a disk   without free space.    <b>Please provide
