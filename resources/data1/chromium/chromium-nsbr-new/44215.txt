<title>Issue 44215 -   chromium -    Need more bits (64-bit Mac) in skia - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a couple of things needed here.    1. skia/src/third_party/skia/src/ports/SkFontHost_mac.cpp (upstream) uses ATSUI. Most of ATSUI is   deprecated in the 64-bit environment. I��_��_��_m not yet sure how best to handle this.    2. skia/ext/skia_utils_mac.h makes NSSize equivalent to struct _NSSize  but this is only correct for   the 32-bit environment. In the 64-bit environment  NSSize is equivalent to CGSize. Work is   underway at <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/2134003">http://codereview.chromium.org/2134003</a>. </pre>
