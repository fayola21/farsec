<title>Issue 25322 -   chromium -    &quot;Copy Image&quot; to clipboard on Mac should pipe original CGImage over IPC - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the &quot;Copy Image&quot; feature  on the Mac  converts the CGImage to an  SkBitmap and hauls raw bits over IPC. This loses the colorspace  leading to  a loss of fidelity. The original image should be marshaled over IPC as best  as possible to keep quality up. </pre>
