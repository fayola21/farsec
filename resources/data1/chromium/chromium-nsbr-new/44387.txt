<title>Issue 44387 -   chromium -    Expose OGG timestamp to javascript (for video/slide sync) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's only possible to get relative playtime with html5 in javascript. I  want absolute timestamp that's embeded in OGG.    Here's the deal:  I stream conferences using Ogg Theora+Vorbis using Icecast2. I have built a  site that shows the video and then automatically shows the slides (as PNG  files) as well. I use orbited (COMET) to have the server PUSH my ��_��_next�_  presses on my keyboard.    The problem is that icecast does heavy buffering  and also the client  so  that while I switch the slides  the browser will go from slide 3 to 4 WAY  too early (from 10 second to 1 minute).    If I could get the timestamp OR time-since-started-sending/recording from  the ogg file in javascript  I'd be able to sync everything.    There are multiple way to sync this  may even an stream with the slide-data  INSIDE the ogg file  however  AFAIK there's also no way of getting out such  arbitrary streams.        I also filed a bug at Mozilla;  &lt;<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566375">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566375</a>&gt; </pre>
