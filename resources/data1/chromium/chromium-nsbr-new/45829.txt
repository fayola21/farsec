<title>Issue 45829 -   chromium -    Inputs problem when &quot;visibility: hidden&quot; is set for BR tag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0  URLs (if applicable) : -         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Strange summary  don't you think? :-) But it's really mysterious issue.    1. Create simple HTML-page with this simple code:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  	&lt;style&gt;  		br	{visibility: hidden}  	&lt;/style&gt;  	&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    As you can see  there's nothing except one text input and style property   for BR tag. How are they connected? You'll see. :-)    2. Now open this page in any version of Chrome. As I know  this issue   exists since version 3 or maybe even 2 and till the latest v6.0 build).    3. Place cursor into our input and write something.    4. Now delete the written text (no matter how - with &quot;backspace&quot;  &quot;delete&quot;   keyboard keys or with mouse context menu commands).        Nothing special - empty input with blinking cursor in it so I could write   again.        When input becomes empty  the cursor in it disappears and input becomes   unfocused (though it has yellow highlighting like it's focused). Seems like   the whole page takes focus  because if you press Backspace in this   condition  you'll go back in page history. You can't write anything in the   input until you focus on some other element (for example  on the page   itself) and then focus on the input again. It you write anything in it and   then empty it again  the issue will repeat.    If you remove the BR tag property &quot;visibility: hidden&quot; from the style   section  input will work like it should. Don't understand how these two   things linked but they are.    The issue appears on Windows XP  Vista and 7 (x86/x64).    Thanks and good luck! </pre>
