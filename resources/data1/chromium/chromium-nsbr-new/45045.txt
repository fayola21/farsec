<title>Issue 45045 -   chromium -    Tab widths resize after closing tab in position 2 before user moves mouse away from tabstrip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Open new Chrome browser  2. Open enough new tabs so that Chrome starts shrinking the width of all tabs to fit in   the window  3. Navigate away from the &quot;New Tab&quot; page on the tab in position 2 - go to   <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>  4. Click on the close button on the tab in position 2 and do not move your mouse pointer        The width of the tabs following the closed tab should remain the same and they should   all slide over to the left. The close button of the next tab should appear under the   user's mouse pointer.        The width of all of the tabs get resized to be equal. This behavior should only occur   after the mouse pointer is moved away from the tab-strip. </pre>
