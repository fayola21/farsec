<title>Issue 46311 -   chromium -    Add a multi dll developer build for Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  chromium is built as chrome.exe and chrome.dll on Windows. Other major components are built as static library. Splitting the major components into DLLs should speed up the link time.    The goal is to split major components into DLLs on Windows so developers could enable a flag to build this way.   </pre>
