<title>Issue 25833 -   chromium -    doc for pageAction onClicked event handlers doesn't match reality - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The doc at:    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/pageAction.html">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/pageAction.html</a>    makes it look like the pageAction onClicked handers get called with a tab object. In reality  they   get called with (pageactionid  details) where pageactionid is a string  and details is an object   with &quot;button&quot;  &quot;tabId&quot;  and &quot;tabUrl&quot; properties.     I think we changed the doc (and extension_api.json) to reflect how we *want* the API to work  but   not the actual implementation.   </pre>
