<title>Issue 45938 -   chromium -    abc.go.com says flash not installed when it is. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium	5.0.375.55 (Developer Build 0)  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.55 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium  URLs (if applicable) : a test would be <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/happy-town">http://abc.go.com/shows/happy-town</a>             Safari 4: no test    Firefox 3.x: ok           IE 7: no test           IE 8: no test    The site says I don't have flash installed. This is not true  flash works   just fine other sites such a youtube and comedy central. Up 'till like a   week (Maybe 2? I was able to watch the final episode of lost a few days   after it aired on their site) ago their site worked. I can say that   chromium has been upgraded since. </pre>
