<title>Issue 41755 -   chromium -    Show keyboard shortcuts in devtools button tooltips - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045 (42898)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    Not a bug  an enhancement request: Show the keyboard shortcuts for the   DevTools buttons in their tooltips.    For instance  the tooltip for the step over button currently reads &quot;Step   over next function call.&quot; On my system (Windows XP)  that would read &quot;Step   over next function call [F10]&quot; (there's no need for the period at the end   of the tooltip  and it looks odd). (On other platforms the keystroke shown   in the square brackets would be different.)    The shortcuts are described here:  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools/google-chrome-developer-tools-tutorial">http://www.chromium.org/devtools/google-chrome-developer-tools-tutorial</a> </pre>
