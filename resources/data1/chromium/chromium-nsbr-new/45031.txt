<title>Issue 45031 -   chromium -    OnUnload dialog tests are disabled on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following UI tests are disabled on the Mac:    BrowserCloseBeforeUnloadOK    BrowserCloseBeforeUnloadCancel    BrowserCloseWithInnerFocusedFrame  Because we need to implement ClickModalDialogButton so the modal dialog that comes up doesn't   wedge the test forever. </pre>
