<title>Issue 30936 -   chromium -    Display LoadLog on error page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the network request fails  all we display is the error failed page with a   details section that shows the net:: error code.    Now that we have a LoadLog which logs the actions we did  we should just   output the LoadLog on that page too to help with diagnostic. </pre>
