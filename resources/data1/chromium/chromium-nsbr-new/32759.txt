<title>Issue 32759 -   chromium -    Sort out the language code returned by CLD - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  LanguageCode (in third_party/cld/bar/..../languages/languages.h)   returns the following:    Trad. Chinese : zh-TW  Simp. Chinese: zh  Hebrew:  iw  Norwegian: no    'iw' is especially problematic because it's an obsolete code for Hebrew.   This is public-facing and we have to use the standard code ('he').     Although less critical than 'he vs iw'  perhaps  it's better to return   'zh_Hans' and 'zh_Hant' for trad/simplified Chinese.       Code-wise  it's simple to fix  but we need some coordination with Google   services like translation. Apparently  it doesn't understand 'he' (oops!!)       </pre>
