<title>Issue 34762 -   chromium -    Forecastfox causes segmentation fault on 5.0.318.0 (Developer Build 38172) Ubuntu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.318.0 (Developer Build 38172) Ubuntu    Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: ubuntu default  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): don't have access to  it  but a user reported a similar problem.          Install Forecastfox from the extension gallery:  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ihffmkcfkejomlfnilnmkokcpgclhfeg">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ihffmkcfkejomlfnilnmkokcpgclhfeg</a>        Chrome immediately segmentation faults.      I tried to get a backtrace  but my desktop doesn't respond to the keyboard  or mouse after I reproduce the segmentation fault with GDB attached. The  only way to make it responsive is to switch to a shell and kill the gdb and  chromium-browser processes. Any tips? I've attached what it recorded up  until where I had to kill gdb.   </pre>
