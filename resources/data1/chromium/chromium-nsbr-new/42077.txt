<title>Issue 42077 -   chromium -    Chrome discards clipboard at exit (== data loss) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i unfortunately do not have the exact Chrome version: i'm using the latest  available (as of 3 days ago) for Ubuntu.    Steps to reproduce:    a) Visit any web site.    b) Copy the URL from the entry bar.    c) Close chrome.    d) Try to paste the URL somewhere.    e) Write a haiku: The clipboard empty / data is forever lost / can no  longer paste.    The clipboard is empty. The URL is lost. i believe this also happens with   e.g. textarea text but i am not on a machine where i have rights to install  Chrome  so i cannot confirm that at the moment.     </pre>
