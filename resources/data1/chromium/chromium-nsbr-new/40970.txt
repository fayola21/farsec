<title>Issue 40970 -   chromium -    Resizing windows slows down tab switches - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 5.0.371.0 dev and ToT    Open a Chrome window with two tabs.  I think any two tabs will do  I used the NTP in both.    1) Switch back and forth between the two tabs.  Get a sense for how long it takes.    2) Use the resize widget to resize the window a lot.  Hold down the left mouse button and resize the   window however you want for 10 seconds.  Then let go of the mouse.  Now try to switch tabs.    For me  switching after a long resize is noticeably slower.  I can consistently get a beachball. </pre>
