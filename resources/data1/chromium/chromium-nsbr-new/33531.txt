<title>Issue 33531 -   chromium -    SPDY: Server push should allow fully qualified URLs or paths for X-Associated-Content and X-Subresources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Server push currently specifies paths rather than fully qualified URLs for   X-Associated-Content (and possibly X-Subresources  I haven't checked).    X-Subresources can definitely come from different domains than the server -   it's just a hint and the client fetches.    X-Associated-Content should use a fully qualified URL as it's possible that   multiple domains can share the same SPDY connection (FlipSession). The   server push content should be at the same domain as the related page which   is pushing the content down. It should be secure to be a sub-page as well   (i.e. a main page www.foo.com can push down images.www.foo.com but not   images.foo.com) </pre>
