<title>Issue 25158 -   chromium -    &quot;Recently closed&quot; and bookmark bar bubble on ntp have different colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29288">r29288</a>   10.5.8      1. Open NTP while bookmark bar is not in &quot;always show bookmark bar&quot; mode        Color of bookmark bar bubble and &quot;recently closed&quot; bubble should have the same color  given how   similar they look.          Bookmark bubble is grey (and it probably has to be  'cause that's how it looks when it's always   visible)  &quot;recently closed&quot; is blue. </pre>
