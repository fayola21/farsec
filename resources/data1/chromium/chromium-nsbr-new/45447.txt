<title>Issue 45447 -   chromium -    &quot;Reopen closed tabs&quot; no longer works properly after closing multiple tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a bunch of tabs in a Chrome window  2. Right click on a tab and click either &quot;close other tabs&quot; or &quot;close tabs   to the right&quot;.  3. Right click on the title bar and click &quot;reopen closed tab&quot;      First  the menu option in this case used to be (and should be) &quot;reopen   closed tabs&quot; (note &quot;tabs&quot; is plural).  Second  when clicking this option only one of the last closed tabs is   restored  instead of all of the tabs that were closed with the action in   step 2. It is quite annoying when accidentally closing multiple tabs to   have to manually restore one at a time - ESPECIALLY when this used to work   properly in earlier versions.    Thanks          <b>Please provide
