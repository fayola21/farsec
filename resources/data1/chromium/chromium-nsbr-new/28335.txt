<title>Issue 28335 -   chromium -    Allow extensions to edit the context menu for their Browser Action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a context menu when you right click on <a title="Proposal for Implementation of Browser Actions" href="/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">BrowserActions</a>.  In it   we could put things like &quot;hide button&quot;  &quot;uninstall extension&quot;  &quot;inspect   element&quot;  etc.    As proposed for toolstrips in <a title="Create a context menu for toolstrips" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22382"> Issue 22382 </a>  developers of extensions should   have enough control where they can add tiered context menu items  set/show   hot-keys (hot-keys meaning both combination keys like Ctrl+L and   accessibility letters)  and set limited styles (strong  emphasize  etc).    Example context menu is attached.  (Ignore the toolstrip and just image it's for a BrowserAction) </pre>
