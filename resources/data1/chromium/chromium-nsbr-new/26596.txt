<title>Issue 26596 -   chromium -    TreeNodeModel icons are wrong for closed folders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In views using TreeNodeModel  the folder icon is incorrect for folders that   have been opened and then closed. In the current behaviour (look at bookmarks   manager as an example)  if you double click bookmarks bar to open it  double   click it again to close it  the icon stays as the &quot;open folder&quot;. In other   native windows tree controls (e.g. look in visual studio)  double clicking to   close the folder  even if the folder remains selected  results in the folder   icon changing back to the closed folder.  </pre>
