<title>Issue 41287 -   chromium -    Turning on Autofill gets you throttled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get a Chrome instance that has been used for a while  i.e. thousands of autofill entries. (Not sure   how to check this)  2. Turn on syncing for autofill.  3. Go to about:sync.        You should not be throttled  i.e. it shouldn't get stuck in 'Syncing'. </pre>
