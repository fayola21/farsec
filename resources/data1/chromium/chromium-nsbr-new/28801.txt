<title>Issue 28801 -   chromium -    OK button on last sync setup wizard dialog doesn't have the input focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start chrome.  2. Click &quot;Tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;Synchronize my bookmarks...&quot;.  3. Enter email/password and press the &quot;Sign In&quot; button.  4. The 'Success!' wizard screen should show up.    What is the expected output?    The 'OK' button on the &quot;Success!&quot; dialog should have the input focus so   that the dialog can be dismissed by pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard.    What do you see instead?    'OK' button does not have the input focus.     </pre>
