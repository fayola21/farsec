<title>Issue 28980 -   chromium -    Status bubble text has no subpixel antialiasing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12      1. Hover over a link  2. Look at status bubble        The text in the bubble should have subpixel antialiasing.        It only has normal gray-level antialiasing.    I think that's because the bubble is sometimes transparent  and cocoa   doesn't render text with subpixel aa on semitransparent windows. </pre>
