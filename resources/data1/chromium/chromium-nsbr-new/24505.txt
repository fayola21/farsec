<title>Issue 24505 -   chromium -    flakiness_report.py should recognize FLAKY_ test prefix - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In flakiness_report.py (or possibly reportlib.py) we should delete the FLAKY_   prefix from the test name. Otherwise the scripts may see two variants of the   test name (with and without FLAKY_ prefix) which makes the later analysis   inaccurate.    Nicolas  could you take a look? I can prepare a patch if needed  just don't   have the files currently (you can send them to me and I'll give you a patch). </pre>
