<title>Issue 33229 -   chromium -    Page load time statistics should separate out back vs reload vs navigation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Histograms of page load metrics need to separate out reloads etc. from actual   navigations.     As it currently stands  delaying the network *might* cause the user to press   cancel  discarding a long delay  and instead getting a short-delay for a   reload of the prior page.  This tends to reduce the average for the current   metrics when we delay the user!?!?    If we separate out these different cases  then we should see smoother   histograms  and more clear benefits in any A/B tests that are justifiable   improvements to the PLT. </pre>
