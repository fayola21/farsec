<title>Issue 28207 -   chromium -    Replace filter factories with passing in constructed filters to the pipeline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The whole filter factory concept has caused more pain than it's worth.    Let's face it  building a gstreamer/directshow replacement is completely   out of scope.    Instead of filter factories with private constructors  we should be able to   do the following:   - Public constructors.. heck you can even pass parameters in directly!   - Call said constructors to create an *uninitialized* filter   - Create a vector of filters   - Pass vector into pipeline   - Pipeline will figure out the proper initialization order    This might also expand nicely to being handle different pipeline   configurations i.e.  transcoding pipeline  encoding pipeline  who knows!!! </pre>
