<title>Issue 27489 -   chromium -    Do we need a &quot;Use omnibox to search!!!!11!!cos(0)&quot; bubble on first run? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Windows and Linux both show an info bubble pointing at the omnibox that   says &quot;You can use this to search&quot; or similar on first run.    I couldn't find an bug for this on OS X (neither open nor closed). Do we want   to do this?    If so  this is the bug for that. </pre>
