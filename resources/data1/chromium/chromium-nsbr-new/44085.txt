<title>Issue 44085 -   chromium -    Https change button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> this is just a issue that has no urgency. But it would be nice a button to   change the protocol from http to https since https was removed from the   url.  I think an extension would also do it.    ChromeFrame version: &lt;from gcf:about:version&gt;  any version      -      1. open any page      a button to click and change from http to https      nothing   </pre>
