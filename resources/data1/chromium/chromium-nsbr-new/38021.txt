<title>Issue 38021 -   chromium -    [Wishlist] Native support for shared/download files from trackers (torrents) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome doesn't support downloading files from trackers  thousands and   millions of peoples shared/download torrent files. Browsers like Opera and   Wyzo  supports torrents  but not Chrome.    The solution is use a client like uTorrent or Transmission in   Windows/Mac/Linux  but... the biggest problem is Chrome OS. For that...   Chrome browser should have native support for shared/download files on   torrents (trackers).    The principal target: Provide a easy way to get files from trackers on   Chrome OS. </pre>
