<title>Issue 45832 -   chromium -    Chrome update tries to run even when disallowed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)  WebKit	533.4  V8	2.1.10.13  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.55 Safari/533.4  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome -  psn_0_167977          1. Install Chrome on an admin account  2. Create a new user account  3. Turn on Parental Controls  4. Disable access to all applications (in my case  excepting DVD player and Safari) for the new   account  5. Log in to the new account  6. After a while  the Chrome updater will try to run  but will be blocked by the OS. An alert will   appear asking if the user wishes to override this. This alert interrupts DVD playback  or appears   in the middle of the screen  right on top of the disney website.        The updater programme would not run.        My daughter cries.   </pre>
