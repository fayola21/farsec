<title>Issue 42567 -   chromium -    [appcache] When appcache is blocked it shows cookie blocked message in block notification bubble - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set &quot;Cookie&quot; -&gt; &quot;Ask me when a site tried to set data&quot;  2. Access <a href="http://static.webvm.net/appcache-test/simple.html">http://static.webvm.net/appcache-test/simple.html</a>  3. On the pop-up prompt  check &quot;Ask me every time&quot; and click &quot;Block&quot; button  4. Click on the blocked notification icon to see the bubble      In the bubble  it says something like &quot;This page was prevented from setting  cookies&quot;  this is confusing  actually cookie is not prevented to be set  it  is appcache which is prevented to be set.       </pre>
