<title>Issue 35232 -   chromium -    'Open Link in New Tab' Creates Multiple Tabs  Opens Link In Current Tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev    OS version               : 10.5        Difficult to reproduce consistently on any given page link combination  but   happens with reasonable frequency on sfappeal.com and sfgate.com   (among many others).    1. Open sfappeal.com.  2. Cmd-click on one of the stories  hit 'Open Link in New Tab'.        One new tab is created in the background; current tab is unaffected.        Sometimes  multiple new tabs are created  loading the link.  Sometimes    the link is loaded in the current tab.  Sometimes  both.    I realize that this description may not be helpful --- I'm happy to pop by   someone's office and demo. </pre>
