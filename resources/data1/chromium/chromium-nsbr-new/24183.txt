<title>Issue 24183 -   chromium -    Take advantage of user-configurable buffer allocators for FFmpeg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We can override AVCodecContext's get_buffer/free_buffer function pointers to   provide our own allocators.    By controlling the allocation process  we can most likely eliminate an   allocate+copy+free from AVFrame -&gt; VideoFrame when handing off a video frame   from the video decoder to the video renderer.    Before tackling this I would really like to have benchmarking tests in place   to measure any performance gains.    This feature might be necessary to run on lower specced machines. </pre>
