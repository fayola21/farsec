<title>Issue 42370 -   chromium -    Intermittent 'illegal access' executing pages with multiple dojo DateTextBox elements - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  Ubuntu Karmic (9.10)        Chrome 5.0.342.7 beta  Linux: FAIL    Chrome: 4.1.249.1025  WinXP: FAIL    Firefox 3.5  3.6: OK      1. Bring up the attached repro.html in Chrome.  2. Bring up Chrome Developer Tools - Click Script tab  Click 'Pause on All   Exceptions'  3. Refresh the page repeatedly. (Anecdotally  a hard-refresh may make it   easier to repro).      The two unstyled inputs become dojo-decorated DateTextBoxes (and become   styled).      If 'Pause on all exceptions' is not checked  an 'illegal access' message is   shown in the javascript console  and the DateTextBox elements fail to load   completely (unstyled inputs are visible). If 'Pause on all exceptions' is   checked  execution appears to stop on line 189 of strings.js      Additional info:    This bug originated  as a dojo bug   (<a href="http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/10811">http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/10811</a>)  and my repro case is based off   of one of theirs (minus all the localization changes  which didn't fix the   issue for me anyway).     The chrome-js-callstack.png shows the callstack that is shown for me when   execution stops. Notice that the 'c' value (which seems to be the 'end'   parameter to the substring function) is larger than the length of the   string (which may or may not be related  but it seemed kind of suspicious).      </pre>
