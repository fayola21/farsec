<title>Issue 26081 -   chromium -    Extensions disabling themselves when a update requires new privileges.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11          1. Download a extension  2. Wait till it's updated to a new version that requires new permissions  3. Watch it disable itself.      If a updated extension suddenly requires new privileges in order to run    ask the user if they want to update in the first place instead of doing it   silently.     Blindly enabling something in this case could be a security threat and the   method of updating leaves you with a disabled extension that would   otherwise work correctly.      The extension is disabled out right unless you want to enable it blindly. </pre>
