<title>Issue 35830 -   chromium -    MSDN pages getting stuck - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.307.7 (Official Build   38400) beta  Is this the most recent version: Most probably  yes.  OS + version: Ubuntu 8.04.3  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Compiz  URLs (if relevant): <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/*">http://msdn.microsoft.com/*</a>    <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/*">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/*</a>  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Not checked.  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Seems to work  but   didn't test extensively.      1. Open MSDN (msdn.microsoft.com)  2. Search for various things  open a few tabs with articles from MSDN.      MSDN works smoothly.      After opening a few tabs and performing a few searches  MSDN grinds to   halt. The status bar says that it's either waiting form MSDN  or waiting   for cache. If you just copy and paste URL to a Chrome window that runs in a   under a different Chrome profile  it works like a charm. </pre>
