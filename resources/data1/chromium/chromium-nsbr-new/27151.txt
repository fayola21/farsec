<title>Issue 27151 -   chromium -    On the new tab page --&gt; the options --&gt; bookmark sync can be turned off  but to reactivate it you'll have to refresh the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://newtab/  Other browsers tested: n/a      1. Go to the new tab page  2. Click the arrow to show the new-tab-page-options  3. Click bookmark sync to turn it off (if it currently is on)  4. Click bookmark sync to turn it on again  5. Notice that it (the text about bookmark synchronization) doesn't get   back automatically      Just like the other 3 options: to have effect immediately      You'll have to refresh the page to see the result    (Maybe useful: I do not use bookmark synchronization  it is turned off for   me) </pre>
