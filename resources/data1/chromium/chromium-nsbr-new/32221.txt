<title>Issue 32221 -   chromium -    Prevent valgrind layout bots from turning red without actual memory errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Valgrind bots go red when layout tests fail (timeout or result mismatch)  even without actual memory errors (the primary purpose of running valgrind  bots).     Tests that time out might have to be marked as such with a new 'VALGRIND'  label in the expectation list.     Tests that fail with a mismatch are likely to be due to a race (<a title="Some layout tests fail with text mismatch only on valgrind bots"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32219">bug 32219</a>)  and have to be fixed eventually.     In the meantime  it's a good idea to turn valgrind bots red ONLY when  there's a memory error.       </pre>
