<title>Issue 43422 -   chromium -    PAC Proxy file causes crash on startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Chrome Version:  5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) beta  URLs (if applicable): N/A  OS version: 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): PASS  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): PASS  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: PASS    (This was originally filed #37584  reposting here.)        1. Use PAC file gc_test_FAIL.pac (attached) as PAC proxy autoconfig file for any network connection   under OS X.  2. Launch Chrome.  3. Crashes hard upon network access attempt (no local crash file generated). Usually 3-7 seconds.    This problem occurred on an internal  corporate proxy. The file is massively long; it's a big company. I   cannot attach the proxy file in question as it contains too much sensitive information.     I instead went through and looked at the javascript syntax to find errors  and finding none via jslint    looked at the conditional statements within the file.    There are at least three conditional regex match statements conjoined with OR (&quot;||&quot;) within the   original file with over 1000 statements. Thought this might be the issue  and in creating a general   test case  that does seem to be the cause. In the examples provided  I've shown that adding one   additional OR clause causes the crash (at the bottom  labeled &quot;breaking the camel's back&quot; :)    While I wish the PAC was written better  the fact is I can't change it--nor is it happening anywhere   else.    I've attached two PAC files  one that is OK and one that causes the crash. Check comments at bottom   of both. Apple dump also attached (no chrome info is produced).      Browser does not crash on a network request.      Browser crashes immediately.       </pre>
