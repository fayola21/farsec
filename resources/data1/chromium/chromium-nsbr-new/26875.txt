<title>Issue 26875 -   chromium -    Remove ignoreKeyEvents_ from RWHVMac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> James points out that it's not necessary:    &gt; the |ignoreKeyEvents_| is actually useless. Because when redispatching the   event  ChromeEventProcessingWindow's sendEvent method won't forward the   event at all.    That sounds right  but I'd prefer to wait with removal until things have settled   down a bit (and possibly until we have some tests for the keyboard stuff) </pre>
