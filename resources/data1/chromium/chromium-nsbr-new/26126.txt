<title>Issue 26126 -   chromium -    Change the default location of content script injection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we always inject content scripts in DOMContentLoaded. This affects   page load time and many content scripts do not really need to be run so   early.    We should add a new location like &quot;IDLE&quot; that injects as soon as layout is   idle for 10-20ms. </pre>
