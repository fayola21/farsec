Ctrl+a and Ctrl+c to copy all text there  3. Compose a new mail in Gmail. make sure you are using the rich text   editor there (which is default probably) which should be set to left   alignment by default.  4. Ctrl+v the text copied from the Google docs document  5. Ctrl+a to copy all text you just pasted.  6. Ctrl + RightShift to RTL the text you selected.    Aw Snap! 100% reproducible    you will need to have some BiDi language installed in your system in order   to have Ctrl+RightShift working  i used Gmail with English UI  with &quot;Right-to-left editing support on  &quot; in the Gmail settings page.    please ignore the text you pasted if you can understand it  i am pretty   sure it is a hoax  i was just about to mail it to a hoax investigation site   :) </pre>
