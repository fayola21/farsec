<title>Issue 38825 -   chromium -    New tabs appear on left in tab strip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Linux trunk)    I'm assuming this isn't an incorrect locale setting on my part; when I   print base::i18n::IsRTL()  I get false.  However my tab strip is being   ordered right-to-left.    I actually like this and consider it a feature  as most meaningful content   is on the left side of the browser  so I also want the newest tab to appear   there as well.    I am filing this bug because I can't find any bugs or docs on this latest   change  or in the case that I've just set something incorrectly in my   environment (I haven't changed any settings that I know of) I'd like to   know. </pre>
