<title>Issue 44180 -   chromium -    View source seems to not show the actual code behind the viewed page  but rather makes another request to the server... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Version: 5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 1.0-3.6: OK           IE 5-8: OK      1. You need a page with a form that submits to itself  i.e. action being   the same page as the form.  2. Say upon processing of data after the submit  you have a success or fail   printed  3. Now right click on the page and hit &quot;view source&quot;        Source code of the current page        Chrome will display the code for the form; it seems to make another request   to the server to get the page code...?    very crude code to demonstrate the issue:    &lt;?php  if(!empty($_POST['test']))  {      echo &quot;Where did the code go?&quot;;  }  else  {      echo &quot;&lt;form action='test.php' method='post'&gt;            &lt;input type='text' length='5' name='test'&gt;            &lt;input type='submit' name='go' value='go'&gt;            &lt;/form&gt;&quot;;  }    3 screen shots demonstrate what happens   </pre>
