<title>Issue 33040 -   chromium -    HTML5 video does not recover after network interruptions  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start watching a video on say vimeo.com in HTML5  2. Disconnect your network connection  3. Wait until video halts  4. Reconnect the network      That  eventually  the video player will continue playing the video.     My 2c: the netflix player's robustness is pretty good during network   interruptions  and I esp. like how it goes out of its way to keep track of   where you left on in the video. That would be a great feature to have on   any site. Though I don't like how they switch to their red netflix logo   screen when there is something wrong  I find that rather jarring.      The video never resumes playing when the network is restored. You have to   refresh the web page and lose you place in the video.    <b>Please provide
