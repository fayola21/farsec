<title>Issue 26537 -   chromium -    should be able to uninstall bogus / corrupt extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the manifest of an extension gets messed up  it will still be &quot;installed&quot;    but it won't show up on chrome://extensions  so you can't uninstall it.  This   can also happen if we break compatibility with the manifest format  where an   extension was installed and working fine  but then a chrome update comes   along a decides that this manifest is no longer valid.  In theory this   shouldn't happen much  but it leaves users in a mysterious state with no   error messages and no easy way to fix it.   </pre>
