<title>Issue 24849 -   chromium -    Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows Can break Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  In the Adobe Acrobat CERT <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/259425">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/259425</a>      is a note to tinker with DEP.  Setting it to &quot;Always On&quot;      apparently causes problems for chromium.  2.  As administrator bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn  3.  reboot and test       Expected no change in chrome.     Since there are four states for nx [Optin |OptOut | AlwaysOn |AlwaysOff]   it would be nice if Chromium was happy in all and could warn if it was    impacted.        chrome silently fails to open bookmarks and links.    <b>Please provide
