<title>Issue 41815 -   chromium -    modal dialogs hidden when an info bubble appears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome 5.0.375.9 (Official Build 44625) dev Ubuntu 8.04 64 bit      1. Go to Wrench &gt; Options &gt; Under the hood &gt; Content Settings  2. Go to images tab  3. Select radio button - Do not show any images  4. Click on Exceptions   5. Let the Exceptions dialog be open and navigate to any webpage say   google.com (make sure google.com is not in exceptions list)  6. Click on broken image in far right corner of omnibox  7. Click on Manage image blocking  8. Click on Exceptions    What is the expected output?   Exceptions dialog should be seen    What do you see instead?  Clicking on Exceptions does nothing. On closing the browser and restarting   again  then only you see the dialog again.    You can see exceptions dialog in any other tab say for cookies  javascript    etc    In windows - Exceptions dialog never vanishes at first place. On clicking   Manage image exceptions  Exceptions dialog is already open.        </pre>
