<title>Issue 46214 -   chromium -    Chrome fails to notice updates to reslov.conf for an inordinate amount of time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   Chrome fails to notice updates to reslov.conf for an inordinate amount of time.  When I change networks on my laptop  Chrome often lags for a long time after networking (including name resolution) works.  It seems to be DNS in particular.  Is Chrome attempting to do something &quot;smart&quot; with DNS?  Can it just use gethostbyname() like everything else?  I find it's current behavior broken.      Immediate reaction to a change in resolv.conf.          <b>Please provide
