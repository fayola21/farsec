<title>Issue 33167 -   chromium -    &quot;Google Chrome Helper&quot; Processes Don't Quit with Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.6.2    I noticed that my computer was acting sluggish so I pulled up the activity   monitor.  There were two processes called &quot;Google Chrome Helper&quot; that were   each using up about 95% CPU.    I quit Google Chrome but the processes didn't quit and continued to eat CPU.    See attached screenshot of Activity Monitor where &quot;Google Chrome Helper&quot;   processes are still running but Chrome is not.    I'm not sure how to reproduce this bug but will update if it happens again. </pre>
