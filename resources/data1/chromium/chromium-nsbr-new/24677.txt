<title>Issue 24677 -   chromium -    Cleanup needed in browser_theme_provider.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Two problems I noticed during my cleanup pass:    * Use of file-static objects of class type.  This is forbidden by the C++   style guide.  These need to be simple data types or else Singletons or   similar.    * |themeable_images| is a map from ID to bool  but it's not really used: it's   initialized to &quot;all true&quot; and the only other use is to check whether it has   any members.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a lookup of the members of   this somewhere when deciding what to theme  or maybe it can just die. </pre>
