<title>Issue 44799 -   chromium -    entire browser hangs while extension icon spins / animates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38      1. install an extension that uses a spinning icon to get user's attention:   lastpass  Google Voice (by Google) - Version: 2.2.1.3  2. get the extension to spin its icon: GV spins when you receive a new   SMS/message. Lastpass spins when prompting to save/replace a site  3. Try to scroll any page (won't work). Try switching to another tab and   you'll get a fubared page. It's most noticeable with a lot of open tabs &amp;   while loading pages.      icon animations work at a normal speed and don't slow the browser down at all.      The CPU gets maxed out. All windows will be unresponsive until the icon   finishes its animation (about fifteen seconds)  which is much slower than   normal (about two seconds). Icon animations take priority over the rest of the   browser's functionality.    ubuntu 10.04  intel c2d  screenshot shows CPU graph in top left (chrome is using 100% of one core) and   the yellow lastpass icon while turning. </pre>
