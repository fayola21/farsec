<title>Issue 36914 -   chromium -    improvement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello. I've been using your browser  and I am very pleased. But I think it   would be better if you made some changes here   <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95451">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95451</a>. When I open   a new tab  I see the labels. And it would be better if I could fully control   them. I would like to put on labels  any links  and then fix them. This is   done in the browser &quot;Opera&quot;. There is a possibility to change the quantity of   labels on the page shortcuts. This is very convenient  and I hope you   implement it. Thank you for your attention  I hope I have helped you. </pre>
