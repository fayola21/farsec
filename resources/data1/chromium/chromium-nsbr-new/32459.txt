<title>Issue 32459 -   chromium -    .rmvb -&gt; .rmvb.ram - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.64 (35722) beta            Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1. Download files on .rmvb extension          To have a .rmvb file      We have a .ram file    Exemple:    Download name11.rmvb  It's saved as name11.rmvb.ram    So we have to rename all the files...    This isn't something that makes me feel angry enough to leave Chrome (yes    it is my mains  and only  browser)  but it bothers me.    Thank you. </pre>
