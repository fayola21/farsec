Go to any Flash video page (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?">http://www.youtube.com/watch?</a>  v=WPVNvJoljD0&amp;feature=featured)  2. Click the &quot;full screen&quot; button in the Flash video player.        The browser and menu bar automatically disappears and the Flash player   takes over the whole screen.        The browser window stays in the foreground while the Flash player is   playing in the background.  You are required to click into the background   to get true full screen mode.  Even after this is done  the top menu bar still   shows at the top of the screen (see screenshot). </pre>
