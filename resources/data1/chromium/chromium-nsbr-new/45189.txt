<title>Issue 45189 -   chromium -    the html input type=file control cannot accept document packages or other bundles on Mac os x - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Many mac os x applications deliver their documents as document packages. These are special   folders that appear on the user as simple files.   The chrome browser cannot see such special folders as files and this is causing confussion to   users that don't know that these are actually folders.  There should be a way to upload such files by zipping them.
