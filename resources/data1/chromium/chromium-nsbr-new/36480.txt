<title>Issue 36480 -   chromium -    Need better user error messages for client SSL errors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an error occurs with an SSL client certificate  the error messages   shown to the user are uninformative. They all read      This webpage is not available.      The webpage at .... might be temporarily down      or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.    Even if you click on &quot;More information&quot; you just get:      Error 117 (net::ERR_BAD_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT):       Unknown error.    We need real error messages for situations like  * The site requires a client cert but the user doesn't have one  * The user chose a client cert that the site doesn't trust  * The user's client cert has problems (expired  damaged  etc.) </pre>
