<title>Issue 43216 -   chromium -    searching between tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1064 (Official Build 45376)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: Firefox        Firefox 3.x: OK          1. use CTRL-F to search the page for 'abc'  2. go to the next tab  3. hit F3 to find the next result (sometimes it looks for abc again and   sometimes it does not)      Be nice if the search was persistent across tabs.  Also  the first time you   press escape it should clear the field and pressing escape with an empty   search box should close it.      It does not search again.   </pre>
