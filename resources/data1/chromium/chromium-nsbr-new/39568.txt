<title>Issue 39568 -   chromium -    Minimizing the browser can cause Gmail chat moles to disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Minimizing the browser can cause Gmail chat moles to disappear    Observed on windows  while running Gmail in an application window.  My guess is that minimizing   the window is somehow causing the tab contents to be resized to 0x0.  Gmail has a &quot;feature&quot; where   it discards chat moles as the window size is made smaller  so we are probably tripping over that. </pre>
