<title>Issue 39857 -   chromium -    Flash video full screen for two monitors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897) dev  Windows 7 32-bit    1. Open a flash video on a two-monitor setup.  2. Enlarge the video to full screen.  3. Click anywhere on the other monitor (the one that does not have the   flash video)  4. The flash video will exit full screen mode and return to its original   size.    The expected result is that the video remains in full screen while i work   on the other monitor.    I previously used a hack for the flash plugin to fix this  but now that it   is integrated into Chrome I am filing this as a bug that hopefully Chrome   can fix. (I do have the internal flash player enabled) </pre>
