<title>Issue 38450 -   chromium -    Omnibox autocomplete behavior for Korean is less than optimal  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="IMEs do not work well in the omnibox due to a race condition" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19421"> bug 19421 </a> comment #9  Peter wrote the following:    .... I will note that on Windows  we   disable inline autocompletion when an IME composition is in progress.  See   AutocompleteEditViewWin::UpdatePopup() and comment in   AutocompleteEditViewWin::OnInlineAutocompleteTextMaybeChanged().    Because of that  hardly any suggestion is made for Google search when I   type Korean in the omnibox.     AutocompleteEditViewWin::UpdatePopup() has the following:    model_-&gt;StartAutocomplete((sel.cpMax &lt; GetTextLength()) || ime_composing);    In the past  what I described in <a title="Hangul syllable in the middle of composition is not used in omnibox match"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27547">bug 27547</a> happened. With this being   disabled  it's not the case any more.     We might try enabling this only for Korean IME (which is different from   Japanese/Chinese IMEs in most cases in that it doesn't involve candidate   look-up as long as Hnagul input is concerned).      </pre>
