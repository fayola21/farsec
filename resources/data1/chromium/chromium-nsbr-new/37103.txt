<title>Issue 37103 -   chromium -    OS X: How do i open an external link from Quicksilver  or any other external link  as the the FIRST and ONLY tab? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm using Google Chrome latest Dev Build (5.0.335.0 dev) with Mac OS X 10.6.2  Every time i launch a link from QS (or anything else) Chrome opens a new tab _and_ another tab   with my link.  Any tips for opening only one tab (with the link i've launched) as Firefox and Safari does?    Thanks to all. </pre>
