<title>Issue 44203 -   chromium -    Omnibox popup not showing up &quot;sometimes&quot; with automation on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are adding hooks for fetching info from the omnibox  for automation. The methods added set   text in the omnibox and fetch matches. This works fine on win and mac  but on linux this results in   the omnibox popup not showing about once in 500 times.    The methods in question are:  AutomationProvider::GetOmniboxInfo()  AutomationProvider::SetOmniboxText()  in chrome/browser/automation/automation_provider.cc    To close this bug  the following test should pass on linux.    $ python chrome/test/functional/omnibox.py --repeat=500 </pre>
