<title>Issue 44028 -   chromium -    &quot;Autofill profiles&quot; dialog should automatically scroll down / up as you tab through fields - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chromium and go to options -&gt; personal stuff -&gt; change autofill  settings  2. Click &quot;Add an address&quot; (a vertical scroll bar appears  with some of the  fields hidden from view)  3. Start typing text in the fields one by one  and tabbing to the next field    What is the expected output?   When you tab to a field that's not in view  the dialog should automatically  scroll so that the field that you are currently in becomes visible.    What do you see instead?  When you tab to a field that's not in view  the dialog does not scroll  and  you need to manually scroll down the window to see the field.       </pre>
