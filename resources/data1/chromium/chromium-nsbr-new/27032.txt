<title>Issue 27032 -   chromium -    When using Chrome the &quot;back&quot; previous screen does not work when searching emails within GMail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: Not Tested           IE 8: OK      1. Login to Gmail  then search within Gmail.  2. Next try to return &quot;back&quot; to search screen by clicking &quot;back&quot;.  3. You aren't taken anywhere  to get back to search result listings you   must re-click the Search Mail function again.    Just curious why this seems to occur only in Chrome as opposed to other   browsers? If this is deliberate it will take some getting used to.     </pre>
