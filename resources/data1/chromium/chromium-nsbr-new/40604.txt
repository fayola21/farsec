Play with chrome to get any info bar  ( Example: Get the &quot;Theme&quot; undo info bar after install.  or &quot; Do you want Google Chrome to save your password?&quot; infobar when signed in to   any account or &quot;Restore&quot; info bar after crash )  2. Resize(shorten)  the window vertically    Actual: The Text on Infobar gets truncated.  ( Screen shots attached )    Expected: Text should be elided or faded.   Should get added with (...) beside the text when window gets shrinked. ( This is working as expected on beta ( 342.9 ) )   </pre>
