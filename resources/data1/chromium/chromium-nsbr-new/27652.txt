<title>Issue 27652 -   chromium -    Weird tab dragging between monitors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Create a browser window on a secondary monitor that is taller than the   primary monitor (see attached image dragsetup.jpeg)  2. Create a new tab and drag it to the main monitor.      Expected: tab drags to destination monitor without astonishing the user.    Actual: during drag  components of the window get out of sync (see   attached image indrag.jpeg).  On drop  the tab appears in a browser   window without any tabs in the tabstring (see attached image   postdrag.jpeg)       </pre>
