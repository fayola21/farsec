<title>Issue 38671 -   chromium -    Chrome does not detect virtual desktop switch (on Windows) correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a regression  but a fairly longstanding one (several months).    I use a program called &quot;Vista/XP Virtual Desktops&quot; to provide virtual   desktops on my Vista x64 box.  (This isn't a Microsoft powertoy but it's   similar to that).    If Chrome is a focused window on one desktop and I switch to another    Chrome doesn't realize it's lost focus.  This manifests in two ways:  1) If focus was in the omnibox  then I can type keys and get a floating   omnibox dropdown to appear on my new desktop.  2) If there was a status bubble  it sticks around on the new desktop.    Forever.  To remove it  you not only need to go back to the Chrome window   on the other desktop  but do things like opening or closing tabs -- even   rolling over different links doesn't make it go away.    Seems like we're probably just not reacting correctly to some Windows   message. </pre>
