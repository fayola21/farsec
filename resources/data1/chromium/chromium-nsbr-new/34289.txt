<title>Issue 34289 -   chromium -    Upload hook asks for username/password  but prompts aren't printed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had trouble this morning with &quot;git cl upload&quot; appearing to hang.  It   appears than a hook was prompting for my username and then password  but   stdout was getting eaten by another process.  Here's a stack trace after   hitting Ctrl-C:    -------    Traceback (most recent call last):    File &quot;/usr/local/google/home/derat/chrome/src/.git/hooks/pre-cl-upload&quot;    line 40  in &lt;module&gt;      exec git_cl_hooks.RunHooks(hook_name=program_name    upstream_branch=sys.argv[1])  Traceback (most recent call last):    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git_cl_hooks.py&quot;  line 58  in RunHooks      options = ChangeOptions(commit=commit  upstream_branch=upstream_branch)    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git-cl-repo/git-cl&quot;  line 923  in   &lt;module&gt;      sys.exit(main(sys.argv))    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git_cl_hooks.py&quot;  line 46  in   __init__      description = gcl.GetIssueDescription(int(issue))    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git-cl-repo/git-cl&quot;  line 917  in   main      return func(argv[2:])    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/gcl.py&quot;  line 574  in   GetIssueDescription      return SendToRietveld(&quot;/%d/description&quot; % issue)    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git-cl-repo/git-cl&quot;  line 565  in   CmdUpload      RunHook(PREUPLOAD_HOOK  upstream_branch=base_branch  error_ok=False)    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/gcl.py&quot;  line 564  in SendToRietveld      return rpc_server.Send(request_path  payload  content_type  timeout)    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git-cl-repo/git-cl&quot;  line 515  in   RunHook      output = RunCommand([hook  upstream_branch]  error_ok).strip()    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/upload.py&quot;  line 361  in Send      self._Authenticate()    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/git-cl-repo/git-cl&quot;  line 40  in   RunCommand      output = proc.communicate()[0]    File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/subprocess.py&quot;  line 662  in communicate      stdout = self._fo_read_no_intr(self.stdout)    File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/subprocess.py&quot;  line 1019  in _fo_read_no_intr      return obj.read()  KeyboardInterrupt    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/upload.py&quot;  line 399  in   _Authenticate      super(HttpRpcServer  self)._Authenticate()    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/upload.py&quot;  line 305  in   _Authenticate      credentials = self.auth_function()    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/gcl.py&quot;  line 556  in   GetUserCredentials      email = upload.GetEmail(&quot;Email (login for uploading to %s)&quot; % server)    File &quot;/home/derat/local/depot_tools/upload.py&quot;  line 108  in GetEmail      email = raw_input(prompt + &quot;: &quot;).strip()  KeyboardInterrupt    ----------    When I blindly typed my username and password  it worked. </pre>
