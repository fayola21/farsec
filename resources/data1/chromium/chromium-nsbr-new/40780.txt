<title>Issue 40780 -   chromium -    Inaccessibility of context menu to flash/swf content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> OS: Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit   Build: Chrome   Version: all builds so far from either channel       Right-clicking on flash content can't bring up context menu in some* cases.     That's what would happen when browser load Adobe Flash Player 10.0    however  if the plugin is Adobe Flash Player 10.1 (system-wide/newly built-  in)  then things will get interesting:    Page freeze as well as that which belongs to the same process  a window to   let you kill pages or wait pops up after a while  the rest of pages keep   alive until cursor hovers over any flash content. Thereafter any new pages   that comes with flash can't be loaded any more. The awkward situation   remains even the browser is run afresh after all browser windows had been   closed  because in system background there is already a browser process of   the flash plugin hanging  thus only restart/logout/ending the process can   make it revert to normal.    In Firefox  none of the problems above exists.    *If a flash displays any visual element that makes cursor type changed when   cursor hovering over it  right-clicking on this flash would bring up   context menu as expected with no problems  no matter which version of Flash   Player is in used. Just try out the two flashes on   <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>      The bug exists for a long time indeed  but I was not sure whether it is   from Google or from Adobe  however  I needn't hesitate to find somewhere to   report it any more  since the browser has been integrated with the plugin    fantastic! </pre>
