<title>Issue 35431 -   chromium -    Using Web Inspector on an element in a page where JS is blocked crashes the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Turn on JavaScript blocking (Options-&gt;page 3-&gt;Content Settings-&gt;JavaScript-  &gt;toggle radio button).  Go to any external page (e.g. google.com).  Right-  click inspect some element.    The renderer crashes.  It looks like the issue is in   DebuggerAgentImpl::createUtilityContext()  where we ask for   V8Proxy::context(frame) -- this triggers an ASSERT() in V8.    For --disable-javascript  we just disabled the Web Inspector too.  But for   our new content settings  we've been trying to make &quot;internal&quot; parts of   Chrome  e.g. Chrome UI pages and extensions  continue to work even with JS   disabled elsewhere.    One part of this is that we whitelist script on URLs with certain schemes    e.g. chrome:// and chrome-internal://.  If there is a set of URLs connected   to the Dev Tools I need to add to the whitelist  that's feasible.    Otherwise  perhaps the problem is somewhat like one Matt fixed for   extensions at <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/595001">http://codereview.chromium.org/595001</a> ? </pre>
