<title>Issue 24267 -   chromium -    colors not right for images used outside of webview - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. load <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">http://caminobrowser.org/</a> in safari  2. load <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">http://caminobrowser.org/</a> in chrome/chroimium  3. compare the site icons        Safari has the colors right  odds are it is because we're expecting the skia   rendered image to get corrected when drawn by the webview.  For all image   uses outside of the webview  wrong things happen.  We might need to correct   in all places we convert to an NSImage (bookmarks  downloads  even the   aboutbox pulls it's big image from resource and hence via skia) </pre>
