The error in Chrome  is that you can write email from my web mail   when I give <a href="http://correo.orange.es">http://correo.orange.es</a> writing makes me an &quot;Error your   browser  or your rendering engine are not compatible with this website   (attached screen image)  So I hope you fix this error (uploaded  command copy the source code of the  page to fix this error in this webs   <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?yezmtwni1ai">http://www.mediafire.com/?yezmtwni1ai</a>      <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?mka1tkyzui0">http://www.mediafire.com/?mka1tkyzui0</a>  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?4xonjht3ytt">http://www.mediafire.com/?4xonjht3ytt</a>  )    because the send button  and all appear on the website of my mail do not   work and I wish I could still use my mail  and I would like to continue   will using Webkit browsers as Google Chrome  because they are better.  Therefore the error is I can not send email because the function of the   send button does not work  or any button and the page does not load   properly  as they are not loaded correctly will not let me choose the   correct letter for my email.  I hope to settle it.  Faithfully  Ruben   </pre>
