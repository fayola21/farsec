<title>Issue 27611 -   chromium -    Ability to change 'the maximize state on new window' behaviour - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Maximize browser window  2. Press Ctrl+N      Window will be opened with the same maximized state  like on other   browsers. I suggest you to add special paremeter in options to change that   because evidently you like actual behaviour pretty much. But no everyone   does.      New window loose maximized state   </pre>
