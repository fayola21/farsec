<title>Issue 29871 -   chromium -    Chrome font rendering seems fuzzy compared to Firefox (on Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  OS + version : Fedora 12  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Metacity  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming</a>  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Clear font rendering.        1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming</a> in both Chrome and Firefox.  2. Compare text.  3. Notice font differences.    The font rendering in Chrome seems fuzzy and doesn't seem to use the same  font rendering as all my other apps  including Firefox. You can see the  difference in the attached zoomed-in screenshot (Firefox top  Chrome  bottom). Notice the 'l' in &quot;linux&quot; is 1 pixel wide with Firefox  but 3  pixels wide with Chrome.    This makes Firefox's fonts more crisp and clear  while Chrome's are fuzzy.  What's strange is that Chrome's chrome (tab titles  menus  preference  dialog  etc.) uses the non-fuzzy rendering like all my other apps  but the  web page renderer seems to use something different. I've also attached a  non-zoomed-in version to compare.    As a side note  I have the freetype-freeworld package installed from  <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/">http://rpmfusion.org/</a> with the difference being: &quot;This version is compiled  with the patented bytecode interpreter and subpixel rendering enabled. It  transparently overrides the system library using ld.so.conf.d.&quot;    Please let me know if I can provide any other information. </pre>
