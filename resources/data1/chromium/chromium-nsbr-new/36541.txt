<title>Issue 36541 -   chromium -    Gyp: --generator-output has no effect without &quot;--depth=.&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To reproduce:    $ mkdir builddir  $ ./build/gyp_chromium --generator-output=builddir -f make    Expected: makefiles written to builddir.    Actual: makefiles are written to the current dir (the source tree).    I only get the expected result if I add the argument &quot;--depth=.&quot;      This seems to be because in gyp/generator/make.py we have:    makefile_path = os.path.join(options.depth  makefile_name)  ...      makefile_path = os.path.join(options.generator_output  makefile_path)    Without &quot;--depth=.&quot;  options.depth is an absolute path  so makefile_path is   absolute too  and hence options.generator_output gets ignored.    Background:  I'm trying to do non-srcdir builds (similar to what autoconf   supports) so that I can have builds with different options coexisting.   </pre>
