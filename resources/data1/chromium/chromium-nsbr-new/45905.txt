<title>Issue 45905 -   chromium -    Multiple-restarts required to initiate new version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When downloading an update  Chrome prompts you to close all tabs and   then restart the browser. When I open the browser again  the new version is   not recognized  and it takes multiple times (around 10) for the browser to   recognize the new version.
