<title>Issue 30162 -   chromium -    circular dependencies in webkit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : svn34196  OS + version : Fedora 10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): i386    While compiling with library=shared_library  all libraries generate  but  when the chromium binary is supposed to be built  unresolved symbols are  exposed for libwtf.so  specifically:    /mnt/chromium/rpmbuild/BUILD/chromium-20091209svn34196/src/sconsbuild/Release/lib/libwtf.so:  undefined reference to  `WTF::ChromiumThreading::scheduleDispatchFunctionsOnMainThread()'  /mnt/chromium/rpmbuild/BUILD/chromium-20091209svn34196/src/sconsbuild/Release/lib/libwtf.so:  undefined reference to `WTF::ChromiumThreading::initializeMainThread()'    Those functions look like they live in libwebkit.a  but adding this line  into the wtf 'dependencies' doesn't work (gyp complains about an  unresolvable loop):    '../../WebKit/chromium/WebKit.gyp:webkit'     Sure enough  webkit depends on webcore  which deps on webcore_bindings   which deps on wtf. I'm not sure how to resolve this  perhaps move the code  (src/third_party/WebKit/WebKit/chromium/src/ChromiumThreading.cpp) wholly  into wtf? I don't think anything besides wtf depends on it. </pre>
