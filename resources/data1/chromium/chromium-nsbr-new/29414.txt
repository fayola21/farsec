I don't like drawing over the thumb  as no one else does  that. (We're drawing the yellow ones today under the thumb.)    Sure. Indent 3-4px from the sides  and draw under the scroll thumb. 75%  sounds good to try  but I'd like to see if there is a way to make it look  nicer.    Let's see how this goes. </pre>
