<title>Issue 40322 -   chromium -    Typing into omnibox might choose first suggestion without user selecting it on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.0 (Official Build 43169) dev    OS version               : 10.6.3            Hit cmd+t and start typing quickly  Once in a while Chrome will pick the first suggested completion after the first letter has been   typed  Completion is copied to the omnibox without user actually using it and cursor moved after it.    e.g:  I try to go to exchange.foo.com and engadget.com is the first suggestion for 'e'.  I type cmd+t exchange only to notice that the omnibox says 'engadget.com/xchange'  This doesn't happen every time but it appears to correlate with new tab page loading longer for   some reason.     </pre>
