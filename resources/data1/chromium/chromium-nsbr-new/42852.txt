<title>Issue 42852 -   chromium -    Chrome loses cursor position when continuing selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8      There are multiple ways to see this. Here's one:  1. Enter multiple lines of text  2. Highlight some text by clicking and dragging the mouse.  3. Use Shift+Arrow to shorten the selection      The cursor should start where I mouse-up'ed  and the selection should continue from there.       Instead  Chrome seems to select the cursor position so the shift+arrow makes the selection   bigger. Safari also has this problem. Firefox does not.      Other ways to see similar problems:    Hold shift  and click the mouse several times inside your text. The selection should remain pinned   at the first non-shift click  with other shift+clicks simply setting the other end. Instead  which   end of the selection moves is hard to predict. Safari also has this problem. Firefox does not.    Hold shift and use arrow keys to select something. Then hold shift and hit Ctrl+left/right to select   to the beginning or end of the line. Again Chrome makes the selection as large as possible rather   than anchoring one end at the place I started selecting. Neither Safari nor Firefox have this   problem.    Hold shift to select some text changing both the line and column. Then release shift and hit an   arrow key. The resulting cursor position is often surprising. Safari has this problem in a similar   way to Chrome. Firefox does it less often  but I can still provoke weird cursor positions.      This seems related to <a title="end key doesn't work correctly when selecting text in multi-line text boxes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31046"> issue 31046 </a> and <a title="Shift+mouse does not work right when selecting text inside an editable area"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10841">issue 10841</a>  but those weren't mac bugs. </pre>
