<title>Issue 27303 -   chromium -    Proxy PAC hostname resolution fails  causes proxy configuration to fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm a googler and can provide more detail if contacted directly. I've briefly   spoken with Avi about this bug.    Chrome Version       : Chrome v4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : (urls on the Google production network)  OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Work OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested      1. Configure Mac OS system preferences with a Proxy Pac file   (http://wpad/wpad.dat  2. Switch between different wireless networks  3. All URLs behind the proxy will fail &quot;Oops this link appears to be broken&quot;    This is what *usually* happens to me  although with some fiddling (restart   of chrome browser) I can often get it to work.        Page renders.        &quot;Oops this link appears to be broken&quot;      In more detail:    Looking at chrome://net-internals/ :    HostResolver (chrome://net-internals/hostresolver)  HostCache (chrome://net-internals/hostresolver.hostcache)  Size: 29  Capacity: 100  Time to live (ms): 60000    [...]  wpad	UNSPECIFIED	net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED      This cache resolver entry doesn't seem to expire (its been hours+ since I   observed that entry).    A sometimes work around is:  * Specify a different URL for the wpad host (e.g. wpad.full.domain.name)   * Change networks to force the proxy to be re-resolved    I'm not confident about how to force chrome to re-resolve the proxy or   that it is even re-resolved when the network is switched.    Some of the problems reported in:    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13423">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13423</a>    ...may be caused by this issue. And that bug may also exacerbate this bug.   </pre>
