<title>Issue 32100 -   chromium -    Breakpad-enabled build is all busted and stuff - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While linking the framework:    ld: duplicate symbol MachMessage::CalculateSize()       in   /chrome/trunk/src/xcodebuild/Release/libbreakpad_utilities.a(MachIPC.o)   and /chrome/trunk/src/xcodebuild/Release/libbase.a(mach_ipc_mac.o)  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status  Command /Developer/usr/bin/g++-4.2 failed with exit code 1    This began in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35977">r35977</a> (<a title="The Task Manager is not implemented" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13156"> bug 13156 </a>).  The MachMessage class was added to   src/base/mach_ipc_mac.[h|mm].  In a Breakpad-enabled build  we already   have this class present at breakpad/src/common/mac/MachIPC.[h|mm]. </pre>
