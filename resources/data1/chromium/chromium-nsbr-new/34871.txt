<title>Issue 34871 -   chromium -    Titles are to long in the Menu-Bar (History/Window) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.320.0 (38304)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested      1. go to a site with a long title.     For example: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=34869&amp;sort=-  id&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20  Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS    2. go the Menu-Bar &quot;Window&quot; and click !      The Title of the Window should be cut earlier !!        There is to much to see of the title  that the Menu-Context goes to the left.   See the first Screenshot!    The title is also to long in the history-menu! (Second Screenshot)    In Safari  Camino and Firefox it is OKAY !!! (Third Screenshot)    Thanks and regards  Mehmet   </pre>
