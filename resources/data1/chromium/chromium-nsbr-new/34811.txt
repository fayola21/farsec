<title>Issue 34811 -   chromium -    Certificate information sheet can get hung and prevent closing Security Information windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open more than one Security Information window.  (These can even be   from the same site.  See <a title="Possible to open multiple Security Information windows from the same site"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=34810">bug 34810</a>.  2. Click the ��_��_��_Certificate information��_��__��_��_��_ button in each.  3. Try to close the certificate information sheets.      Expect: the sheets are all closable.  Observe: clicking the OK button on any sheet closes the most recently   opened one.  After that  the rest of the sheets aren't closable.    Since the certificate sheet is modal on a Security Information window  all of   these windows wind up totally unclosable.  The controller probably thinks   it's a singleton or something. </pre>
