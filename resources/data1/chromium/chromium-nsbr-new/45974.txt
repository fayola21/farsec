<title>Issue 45974 -   chromium -    Downloads with &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; are not handled by plugins... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Any from my knowledge.    URLs (if applicable) : Try a download from any website with header Content-  Disposition: attachment           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK        MIME Type is not passed to plugins when a &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot;   header is returned on a http request... Download managers like IDM or FDM   that installs plugins to handle downloads with MIME Types are not started   and plugins for any Content-Type are not working also...        Launch plugin (chrome://plugins/) accordingly to the Content-Type received   in any http header independently from the Content-Disposition.        File is always downloaded within Chrome.    I tested many URIs on headers within Visual Studio with that code :    Dim Soc As HttpWebRequest = Net.WebRequest.Create(&quot;&lt;MY_URI_TO_TEST&gt;&quot;)  Debug.WriteLine(Soc.GetResponse.Headers.ToString)  Soc.Abort()    It returns that URIs with a &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; are not   started correctly within Chrome. </pre>
