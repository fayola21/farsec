<title>Issue 36467 -   chromium -    Crash when switching to fullscreen window after adjusting monitor arrangement - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 0) Have two monitors.  1) Make a window fullscreen.  2) In System Preferences -&gt; Display -&gt; Arrangement  adjust the position of the monitor that   contains the fullscreened window.  3) Switch to the fullscreen window --&gt; Crash in saveWindowPositionToPrefs    Most likely because [savedRegularWindow_ screen] no longer exists at this point  so getting its   frame returns garbage.  Fix is to not save the window position if there is no current screen.  (Longer   term fix may be to not save window position at all when in fullscreen mode  but I'll have to think   about that more.) </pre>
