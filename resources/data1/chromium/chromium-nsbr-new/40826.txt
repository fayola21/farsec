<title>Issue 40826 -   chromium -    Going from no network to having network should reload tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Safari has this nice feature where if you find yourself in a state where there is no network (and thus   loading pages generates a network error page)  when the network does come back  it automatically   reloads these pages so that you don't have to. It's a really nice touch and saves you having to go   through all your tabs and hit reload.    We should do something like this. Wan-Teh mentioned that there is now a notification you can   observe when the network comes back. I'm not sure at what level it needs to go  though  so I'm not   sure where to assign it. What's the proper Area tag for this? </pre>
