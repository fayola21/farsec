<title>Issue 32525 -   chromium -    Ability to submit form into new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: ?            IE 8: ?      1. You want to try to submit a form but also want to keep browsing the currently open page. As a simple example type   &quot;flash&quot; in the search projects box above then command-click expecting it to go to a new tab.        In Safari (Mac) if you hold Command when doing any open-link action it will open in a new tab. This includes click link    click button  press enter in a textbox  click back/forward  javascript:  probably some others.        Most of the cases (links  back/forward) work right  but submitting a form doesn't - it just goes to the form's action page in   the current tab. </pre>
