<title>Issue 41454 -   chromium -    crash on pageopen attempt when no connection available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.3 dev    Since the last update (or the previous one as well?) Chrome crashes every time:  - when I disconnect internet connection while one there's an opened page  which frequently polls a server (like wiki edit page which checks whether  anyone else started editing the same page)  - also  when I attempt to open a new site when there's no Internet  connection available    However  the crash doesn't happen when Chrome restores saved session when  started when no internet connection available. </pre>
