<title>Issue 27470 -   chromium -    Unpainted line of green / Off by one error in themed floating bookmark bar? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Be in floating bookmark bar mode in Linux.    Install a theme with a bottom aligned NTP image (Ratchet / Good Smile /   Infected Mushroom / etc). Resize the height of the window to tall enough   that the background image is entirely in the renderer portion. Note the   green line where the renderer and bookmark bar touch.    Install the DJ Tiesto theme  which is also has a bottom aligned NTP image.   Resize the window so the ellipse at the top of the image is . Note that the   image is discontinuous right at where the bookmark bar / renderer touch;   you can see it on the ellipse.    I suspect that there is an off-by-one error somewhere where the bookmark   bar / renderer area don't line up correctly and that it's causing both   these problems. </pre>
