<title>Issue 35836 -   chromium -    sending several messages in a row via WebSocket from Chrome eats all messages except first one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (and also latest stable version)  URLs (if applicable) : not applicable           Safari 4: None of theese support WebSocket :-(    Firefox 3.x: None of theese support WebSocket :-(           IE 7: None of theese support WebSocket :-(           IE 8: None of theese support WebSocket :-(            1. Create ws.html:    ---- start of ws.html ----  &lt;script&gt;    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:6009/ws.html');   ws.onopen = function() {   	ws.send('{ &quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;AFLT&quot;  &quot;exg&quot;:&quot;micex&quot;    &quot;action&quot;:&quot;subscribe.stakan&quot; }');   	ws.send('{ &quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;IRGZ&quot;  &quot;exg&quot;:&quot;micex&quot;    &quot;action&quot;:&quot;subscribe.stakan&quot; }');   	ws.send('{ &quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;LKOH&quot;  &quot;exg&quot;:&quot;micex&quot;    &quot;action&quot;:&quot;subscribe.stakan&quot; }');   }    &lt;/script&gt;  ---- end of ws.html ---     2. deploy to your web-server;    3. change url from 'localhost:6009/ws.html' to url of your deployment;    3. load deployment url in Chrome.        Server should receive 3 messages.      Server receives only one message (the first one)!    Later sends will push first messages (one send pushes one message).    Now if I interact with Chrome (that's important) inbetween ws.send() calls   (click in browser window) - everything works as expected: server receives   everything immediately.    If I DO NOT interact with Chrome - messages still stuck  no matter how long   do I wait. You can execute setTimeout(function(){ ws.send('foo'); }  5000)   and still - nothing! If you do not touch browser.   </pre>
