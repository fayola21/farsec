After I did this  every time I log in into my account or any other account   on my PC it takes like a minute and a half to completly log on into my   account  after that I can log off and log in with no problem.    It's only when I reboot the PC  that it takes so long to finally log me in.    If I uninstall Chrome  then I'm logged in within a second...    I uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome multiple times with the same result.    I enlisted all my currently installed software  please don't tell me it's   because Visual Studio or any other MS software... I really like Chrome and   wish to use it on...    If I can provide any other additional info  just ask.   </pre>
