<title>Issue 27593 -   chromium -    Buggy voicemail playback in Google Voice - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.246.0 (31887)  URLs (if applicable) : www.google.com/voice  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Normal  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Normal  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ?      1. Go to any voicemail.  2. Click the play button.      The voicemail should play out.      The expected result sometimes occurs  sometimes it works only if I double click the play   button. Sometimes I can't get the voicemail to play at all. Similar problems occur when   attempting to pause the already playing voicemail  move forward in the voicemail  or go   back in the voicemail.    This problem has been around for as long as I've been using developer builds of Chromium   for Mac. </pre>
