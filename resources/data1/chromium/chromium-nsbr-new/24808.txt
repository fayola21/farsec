<title>Issue 24808 -   chromium -    Fix nested message loop while waiting for print settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For some reason the SendAndRunNestedMessageLoop call in   PrintWebViewHelper never returns on the Mac  so I had to land with Send   instead. That means the whole renderer blocks while the print panel is   showing  which is obviously not ideal.    We need to figure out why the nested message loop isn't returning. </pre>
