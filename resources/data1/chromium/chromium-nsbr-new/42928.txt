<title>Issue 42928 -   chromium -    Text selection behavior problem on Chrome for Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.23 dev  Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 10.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64bit   Window manager: Ubuntu Gnome      Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Text selection works fine.     On Windows edition of Chrome text selection works in this way:    I double click on a word. The word is selected. Then I click on a word (while pressing shift key) to the right of it. The second word is also   selected.     On Ubuntu edition... Double clicking on a word selects it fine. But on selecting a word (while pressing shift key) after it selects the entire   paragraph instead of the content 'till that word'.     In fact  if Chrome on Ubuntu behaves correctly on random occasions. I have to wait for a while and click on the second word very precisely to get   the it selected instead of the whole paragraph.     I assume triple click is for paragraph selection and the behavior on Ubuntu version is slightly buggy.      </pre>
