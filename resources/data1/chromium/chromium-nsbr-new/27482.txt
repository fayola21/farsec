<title>Issue 27482 -   chromium -    Should have user ability to tint the default theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The user should be able to go into options  open a color well  and drag   around while the browser UI changes color.    Cole knows how to do this on Mac. I suggest either he or dmac implement it   there first and the other platforms can clone. </pre>
