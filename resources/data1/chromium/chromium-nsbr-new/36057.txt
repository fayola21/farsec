<title>Issue 36057 -   chromium -    &quot;Save page&quot; downloads are not added to history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> originally written by Paul G  and seemingly lost in the shuffle up till   now:    My change (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=12799">r12799</a>  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/45048">http://codereview.chromium.org/45048</a>) exposes an issue   with the way that the Save Page feature uses the download shelf.    Previous to my change  saving a page added an item to the download shelf.   Saving a second page replaced the first item on the download shelf. Since   this happened synchronously  the removal of the first item and addition of   the second item made it look like the shelf didn't disappear. The removal   and addition actually hides then shows the shelf  but the very next paint   operation processed only shows the final state with the second saved page   displayed on the shelf.    My change makes this operation asynchronous:  - saving a page displays the shelf  - saving a second page removes the first saved page (possibly hiding the   shelf if the   first save was the only item on the shelf) and displays the save dialog  - clicking &quot;OK&quot; in the dialog displays the shelf and adds the second saved   page to it    I guess you could call this a regression  but I think it begs a more   fundamental user interface question: if a user saves multiple pages  should   we only show the latest save (our current behavior)  or should we show them   all the way we do with downloads?    The reason that we only show the latest save page is that the Save Page   feature creates a fake download in order to use the download shelf. The   download manager isn't aware of it  so the &quot;fake&quot; download representing the   saved page is stored in the WebContents. The next time a page is saved in   that WebContents  it over writes the first. This implementation is   incredibly hacky  but fixing it is beyond the scope of milestone-2.0.    My proposal is that we leave this bug as is for now  and that we re-think   how saved pages are treated (i.e. should they just be considered downloads    managed and displayed by the Download Manager?). </pre>
