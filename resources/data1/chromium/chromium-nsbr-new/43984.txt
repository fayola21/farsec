<title>Issue 43984 -   chromium -    Feature request:  System setting to sandbox browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.380    There is a use case for an exported browser run on a remote server over   something similar to X11 forwarding  in which the user does not have a   desktop or anything but does have a browser.  In this case  it is   disadvantageous to have Open/Save dialogs and access to file:// URL paths.    In this case  it would be useful to have a collection of system settings   (HKLM or /etc/chromium/) to lock these down.  These settings would:     - Block file:// URL paths.   - Prevent the Open/Save dialogs from ever appearing   - Allow downloads only to a pre-specified location (such as   $HOME/chromium-downloads)  automatically.   - Block downloads entirely.   - Prevent any opening of any downloads (which would open other programs)    These could be individualized settings; although they only make sense   together.  The third in this list makes sense in the context of a server   sharing the users' $HOME directories over the network  so they can retrieve   downloaded files locally; the fourth makes sense in the context of a public   information kiosk. </pre>
