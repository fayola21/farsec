<title>Issue 27654 -   chromium -    Chromium sometimes makes metacity to crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.246.0~svn20091112r31785-0ubuntu1~ucd1  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : metacity (of gnome included in Ubuntu)    Sometimes (especially when using search function as I could notice  but I   am not sure since it does not happen all the time  only rarely) window of   chromium flashes and some window of applications got minimalized  changed   the workspace  etc. As I could imagine it can be caused by crashing of the   window manager (metacity) and its reloading by gnome-session manager (or   something like that). I found this in .xsession-errors by grep'ing for word   &quot;metacity&quot;:  Window manager warning: Failed to read saved session file   /home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db125813327697010800000  038230072.ms: Failed to open file   '/home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db12581332769701080000  0038230072.ms': No such file or directory  metacity:ERROR:core/bell.c:211:bell_flash_window_frame: assertion failed:   (window-&gt;frame != NULL)  Window manager warning: Failed to read saved session file   /home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db125813327697010800000  038230072.ms: Failed to open file   '/home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db12581332769701080000  0038230072.ms': No such file or directory  metacity:ERROR:core/bell.c:211:bell_flash_window_frame: assertion failed:   (window-&gt;frame != NULL)  Window manager warning: Failed to read saved session file   /home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db125813327697010800000  038230072.ms: Failed to open file   '/home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db12581332769701080000  0038230072.ms': No such file or directory  Window manager warning: Failed to read saved session file   /home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db125813327697010800000  038230072.ms: Failed to open file   '/home/lgb/.config/metacity/sessions/10a5f2c38d8e7a97db12581332769701080000  0038230072.ms': No such file or directory    Is this a chromium blog that chromium makes metacity crash and/or bug in   metacity? If it's metacity problem only  then sorry for the unwanted   bugreport here  and please let me know  I try to report it to Ubuntu's   launchpad instead. </pre>
