<title>Issue 39436 -   chromium -    Native mouse cursor not hidden in Flash application when embedded with wmode=opaque|transparent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Offici��_��_le build 42199)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open file &quot;index.html&quot;  2. Click on the button &quot;Hide cursor&quot;      Cursor to be hidden.      Cursor is still shown.      As a side effect  when flash applications use there own custom cursor in  Chrome they always see a double cursor  that's because the native cursor is  also shown.    Note: this only happens when Flash is embedded with the wmode set to  &quot;opaque&quot; or &quot;transparent&quot;.    The file &quot;HideCursorChromeTest.swf&quot; is a compiled version of the file  &quot;HideCursorChromeTest.mxml&quot;. </pre>
