<title>Issue 28333 -   chromium -    Downloads folder doesn't bounce after a finished download. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.253.0 (32522)  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK        1. Make sure you set to have your downloads stored in a folder that is also   located in the Dock.  2. Download something.      Downloads folder should bounce once  just like in Safari and as Apple   previewed when they introduced Stacks.      Nothing. The file just appears there without any visual notice. I usually   don't know when a download is finished.   </pre>
