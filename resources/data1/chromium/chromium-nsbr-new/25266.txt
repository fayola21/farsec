<title>Issue 25266 -   chromium -    [sync cleanup fixit] untangle SyncerSession et al - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The way we determine if we were throttled in the is to check the value of   Syncer::silenced_until_  which is set from the SyncerSession and read by the   SyncerThread.    My proposal: The SyncerSession (or equivalent) should just be accessible to   the caller of SyncShare (the SyncerThread in this case)  so it is free to   calculate whatever it needs from it (were there transient errors? are we   throttled?) and HasMoreToSync should just be a static method on SyncerSession   that  given a session  could evaluate this.  This would be called from the   loop in SyncerThread::SyncMain. </pre>
