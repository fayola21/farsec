<title>Issue 38466 -   chromium -    hook extension analysis into diagnostic mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The shell of a diagnostic mode is in Chrome (--diagnostics).  We should add   some extension diagnostics to the system to help diagnose problems that might   be caused by extensions.    Example ideas:  - simply dump out the list of extensions currently installed/enabled  - verify that Preferences and Extensions are both writable  - if there are any extensions  test if there's a browser crash with   extensions enabled  and if so  test with them disabled    see related <a title="Provide a way to remove crashing extensions"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29067">issue 29067</a> </pre>
