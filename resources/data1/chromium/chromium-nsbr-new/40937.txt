<title>Issue 40937 -   chromium -    sometime see old confirm form resubmission - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.373.0 (Developer Build 44080)  Win7  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.december.com/html/demo/form.html">http://www.december.com/html/demo/form.html</a>    i don't know when it happens exactly but i could something like following      1. go to page  2. submit  3. click on the link on bottom of page ... &quot;script archiv&quot;  4. press back button ... on some other pages you then see the old &quot;confirm   form resubmission in the window&quot; not the Dialog and in this case you see   only the page and no confirm  i think: if you disable cache header on server (?) than you see the old   confirm because it will reload page  have no page with this header found :(      don't know exactly ... show new confirm or no confirm but not old confirm </pre>
