<title>Issue 40442 -   chromium -    Downloads page should unescape URLs and format for display - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The downloads page shows the source URL of each download.     CreateDownloadItemValue in download_util just does  file_value-&gt;SetString(L&quot;url&quot;  download-&gt;url().spec());    This doesn't format the URL  or do any unescaping. We should use the same   URL presentation formatting that we do for the omnibox and the status bar.    If you download a file from a site that uses IDN or has non-ASCII characters   in the path  the URL will look crazy to the user here  as opposed to the   omnibox/status bar.   </pre>
