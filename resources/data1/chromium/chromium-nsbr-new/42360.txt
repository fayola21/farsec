<title>Issue 42360 -   chromium -    Disappearing Animation Does not Present for Bookmark Folder Menu Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Cut or delete (via contextual menu) a bookmark item from a folder menu off of the bookmark   bar.    What is the expected output?  - I expect to hear the 'poof' sound and see the 'poof' animation.    What do you see instead?  - I hear the 'poof' sound but do not see the 'poof' animation.    It appears that the folder menu window redrawing may be interfering with the poof animation. </pre>
