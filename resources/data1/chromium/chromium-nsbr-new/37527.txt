<title>Issue 37527 -   chromium -     [Native Translator] There should be a manager option to manage chrome's native translator on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There should be a default checked checkbox on the under the hood tab of  options labeled &quot;Offer to translate pages that not in my language&quot;.    The checkbox should appear above the &quot;Change font and languages&quot; button.    (Same bug as 34520 but for Mac) </pre>
