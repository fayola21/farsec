<title>Issue 38070 -   chromium -    &quot;New Session&quot; feature like IE8 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I think &quot;New Session&quot; feature (File-&gt;New Session) in IE8 is very useful and i   need it very often. I think Chrome should have this nice feature.    When open a new window by click &quot;New Session&quot; every window has own session.   For example can be open different gmail accounts in different windows. </pre>
