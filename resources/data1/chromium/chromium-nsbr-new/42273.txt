<title>Issue 42273 -   chromium -    Browser locks with Autofill profile!! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Trunk (r 45197) and 5.0.383.0 (Official Build 45131)  OS: XP.    Splitting this comment: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=40965&amp;#c14    -Have a single tab opened - This is IMP.  -Navigate to a webpage (eg: facebook.com)  and trigger autofill profile   (select a profile from the suggestions drop-down list).    That's  it Chrome is locked -&gt; Create a NNTP and navigate to any webpage. The   page rendering locks until unless the hanged autofill tab is closed. </pre>
