<title>Issue 38543 -   chromium -    Pinned tab throbbing (when document.title changes)  notice the user until he click the tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The tab throbbing (when document.title changes) feature is nice (see fixed   bug: <a href="http://crbug.com/37333">http://crbug.com/37333</a>) but i still don't notice the icon throbbing    could you do something else like:  make the icon big until i click on the tab   make a new background color until i click on the tab   or add a &quot;New Icon&quot; as an overlay to the normal icon    the second suggestion could be done on every tab (to set it on and off you   could make a menu entry like &quot;Pin tab&quot;) </pre>
