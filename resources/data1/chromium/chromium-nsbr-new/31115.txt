<title>Issue 31115 -   chromium -    Arabic characters in URLs cause Omnibox to &quot;shift text down&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Copy and paste the following URL into the Mac Omnibox:  <a href="http://www.assafir.com/Article.aspx?EditionId=1420&amp;articleId=2249&amp;ChannelId=32919&amp;Author=��__��__��_����_%20��__��__��_��_��_��_">http://www.assafir.com/Article.aspx?EditionId=1420&amp;articleId=2249&amp;ChannelId=32919&amp;Author=��__��__��_����_%20��__��__��_��_��_��_</a>  2. Notice that the url is displayed a little lower than it should be.  3. Delete the arabic characters at the end of the URL  note the URL now displays correctly again.    An easier repro is to type 'a' and then paste in a single Arabic character - note the baseline shift.    The attached screenshots illustrate this more clearly.        The baseline for the URL in the Omnibox should remain the same regardless of which characters are entered.    Other browsers tested:  * Chrome/Mac 4.0.249.3 : FAIL  * Safari's URL entry field doesn't display this behavior.    I wonder what we're tickling in Cocoa to make this happen :) </pre>
