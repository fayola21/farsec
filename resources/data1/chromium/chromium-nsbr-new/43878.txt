<title>Issue 43878 -   chromium -    Memory leak on bookmark manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev    My system:  Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit  Intel Core2Duo E8400 3.0GHz  3 GB RAM    There was 55 opened tabs when problem occured.  I have about 1000 bookmarks.  When I was trying to open Bookmark manager it went to a loop of refresh and   wasn't opened and it started use %100 cpu and growed memory until I close   bookmark manager's tab (last state is 1GB).    Then I reduced opened tab count and I could open bookmark manager.  Btw  growed memory size remain in spite of I closed related tabs.    I attached a video that shows problem. </pre>
