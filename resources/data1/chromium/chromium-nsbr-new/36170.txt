Set time zone to EST  2. Launch Chrome  3. Set time zone to PST  4. Go to facebook.com. Look at a time stamp on a wall post or comment.       &quot;Posted at 7:38 pm&quot; (i.e. PST)      &quot;Posted at 10:38 pm&quot; (i.e. EST)    Chrome isn't notified when Mac OS X system time zone changes.     NSDate.h contains NSSystemClockDidChangeNotification (available Snow   Leopard and later)    There's a Carbon for older OSes (kEventSystemTimeDateChanged).    CFTimeZone.h contains   kCFTimeZoneSystemTimeZoneDidChangeNotification (available Leopard   and later). This might not be needed in SL. </pre>
