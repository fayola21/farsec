<title>Issue 44898 -   chromium -    Intermittent crashes on wake (Mac) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.6 dev  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):OK      1. Open chrome  2. Hibernate computer... one easy way to do this is to use the application here:   <a href="http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/">http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/</a> Or the dasboard widget here:  <a href="http://deepsleep.free.fr/">http://deepsleep.free.fr/</a>  3. Wake computer      No problems      Sometimes chrome will crash on wake from hibernation (I think Mac calls it 'safe sleep') &quot;The   application Google Chrome Quit unexpectedly  etc.&quot; dialog.  I'm not sure if this is also happening on   normal sleep.  It usually happens to me on safe sleep.  It seems to not matter how many tabs I have   open.  This has even happened when I have no web pages loaded. </pre>
