<title>Issue 37336 -   chromium -    AX: Mac: Tab buttons should not have children as the close button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Buttons should not have children. Right now the child of the tab button is the close button. So when   VoiceOver lands on it  it says Close button. Generally on the Mac  the close button is not exposed   because there's a keyboard cmd-equivalent. There's probably some API that mac os x accessibility   should expose to perform a close on a button as an action. That does not exist however.  </pre>
