<title>Issue 28252 -   chromium -    Windows: NTP bookmark bar animation ugly with Brushed theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (presumably with some other themes as well)      1. Install the Brushed theme (from &quot;Themes by Google&quot;).  2. Get rid of the infobar if present and go to the NTP.  3. Press Ctrl-B a few times.      One expects a nice  smooth animation. Instead  everything animates   smoothly  except the background colour of the bar  which jumps. Well  the   borders also jump. Everything should smoothly (cross-)fade  of course.    I'm still having nightmares about this.    This is on the 4.0.249.0 dev channel running on Vista. (In comparison  it   looks fine on ToT Mac Chrome. Take that  Win Chrome!) </pre>
