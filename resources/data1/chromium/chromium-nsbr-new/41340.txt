<title>Issue 41340 -   chromium -    Netflix streaming drops frames in in-window mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STR:  1. Run with --user-agent to bypass UA sniffing  2. Stream a video in a large window.    CPU usage is very high  and we get frame dropping. The ideal solution (for 10.6+) would be for   Silverlight to switch to CG  but we should try to make CG-based drawing faster and more efficient.    From looking at samples  I think there are some optimizations we can make for non-transparent   plugin instances that could have noticeable impact on CPU usage. </pre>
