<title>Issue 43249 -   chromium -    deleting individual cookies does not work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Build 43360) Ubuntu    In the Options dialog  there's a dialog to manage cookies (Click the   &quot;Content settings...&quot; button  then click &quot;Show cookies and other site   data...&quot;).    That dialog has two buttons on the bottom: &quot;Remove&quot;  and &quot;Remove all&quot;.   It's nice  except that they don't work. They will only remove the cookie(s)   from the view  but if you refresh the cookie list by changing the   filter/search terms (ex: type &quot; &quot; and then do backspace)  the cookie(s) you   just deleted will show up again.    Note: deleting all the cookies by using the &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot; button   (in the main Options dialog) does work.    I'd prefer being able to delete select cookies instead of nuking everything   :) </pre>
