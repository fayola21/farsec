<title>Issue 33506 -   chromium -    Window won't maximize on startup when browser window is higher than screen resolution - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.309.0 (Developer Build 37488) Ubuntu  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Make Chromium's window larger than the screen size.  2. Restart Chromium (possibly using a lower screen resolution).  3. Try double-clicking the title bar or clicking the maximize button.      The window should maximize as normally.      The window doesn't maximize at all. Can be fixed by temporarily enabling   system borders  maximizing  and then disabling again  but Chromium should   just be able to resize at any time.    A related suggestion that would also automatically fix the issue: check   the (available) screen size on startup and resize any windows that are   larger. </pre>
