<title>Issue 28094 -   chromium -    Incognito window should have a way to dock on a regular window's tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796)    The incognito window should be able to dock on a regular window's tab (but   not vice-versa).  This will allow a user to have separate google accounts   open in the same browser without having to contort to using separate windows   and clutter their desktop.   </pre>
