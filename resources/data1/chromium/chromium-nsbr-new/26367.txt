<title>Issue 26367 -   chromium -    Omnibar shouldn't have a yellow background while typing in it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to a secure site to get a yellow omnibar  2. Go typing in it.      Expect: white background (as on Windows)  Observe: yellow background    If there's some extra text like &quot;Press [tab] to search Google &quot; the extra text   has a white background  and stuff looks bad. </pre>
