<title>Issue 41405 -   chromium -    Clean up test_output_xml_to_json.py dependencies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The script is kicked by a slave buildbot at the last stage of running each   gtests  and has dependencies in upstream (as layout_tests package is moved   upstream and it now sits in   WebKit/WebKitTools/Scripts/webkitpy/layout_tests).  This has caused python-path errors on bots several times.    Clean up dependencies in test_output_xml_to_json to make it less fragile. </pre>
