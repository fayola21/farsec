<title>Issue 29229 -   chromium -    Incorrect Default Browser status message in Options dialog after fresh install - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 4.0.249.22 (Official Build 33427)  OS: Windows Vista    This is a follow-up on <a title="If Google Chrome is not registered during the installation  it can not be set as default" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27403"> issue 27403 </a>  comment #20. Please refer to that issue  for further background information.    &quot;On Vista if user doesn't elevate during installation Chrome doesn't get  registered as a browser on the system.&quot;      1. Fresh install of Chrome on Vista.   2. Options &gt; Basics &gt; Default browser.    What is the expected output?    The message should read  &quot;Chrome is not your default browser.&quot;    What do you see instead?    &quot;Google Chrome cannot determine or set the default browser.&quot;  This is  incorrect  because the &quot;Make Google Chrome my default browser&quot; button is  enabled and functions properly.   </pre>
