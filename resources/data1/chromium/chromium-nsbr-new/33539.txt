Drag n dropping web pages  2. Bookmarks tab        Bookmark get's added to Bookmark bar and is able to move around to preferred area.      Nothing. I drag and drop  but instead: New Window. I need bookmarks.   And not just bookmarks imported from firefox. I need to manage my   bookmarks. I can drag around the bookmarks I already have or add new   ones  but not to my main bokmarks bar. Fix this  </pre>
