<title>Issue 44927 -   chromium -    Find box goes missing when opening any flash sites like youtube.com  hulu.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-mac-mini-3.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.3 (Build 10D573)    Processor: 4 Intel 2.66 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 6.0.413.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=47978">r47978</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 113    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2    I am not able to repro this problem on other machines except my Mac Pro (running SL).  After opening any site which uses flash a lot (ie. youtube.com  hulu.com)  Find box won't open.   Find box functionality works fine  but only UI goes missing.  If I open any normal sites like yahoo.com or times.com  Find box works fine. I have attached the   screen-shots.    I am able to repro this problem very easily on this Mac Pro machine  even after restarting the   browser  so please let me if you want to access this machine.    Will try to find the steps and will update the bug. </pre>
