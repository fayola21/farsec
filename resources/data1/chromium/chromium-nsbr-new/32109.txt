<title>Issue 32109 -   chromium -    Complex text selection loses selected font attributes  sometimes making text fail to render - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Simple test case attached.    Spent some time with this one.  Here's the problem.    1) We pick a font family using fontconfig based on coverage of the script   (FreeSans in my case).  For the bold text  fontconfig sees that   FreeSansBold doesn't include this script and instead provides FreeSans with   the fake bold flag.  2) We then later attempt to draw  where we pass to fontconfig use the   chosen family name of freesans and the bold flag.  fontconfig then picks   FreeSansBold as the best match.  3) Now we're using a font that doesn't have coverage of the text.    I think the best fix is to not call fontconfig twice  but the webkit API   makes this difficult.  I will investigate more. </pre>
