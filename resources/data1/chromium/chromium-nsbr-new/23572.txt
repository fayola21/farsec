<title>Issue 23572 -   chromium -    Flicker when dragging tabs near the bottom of the screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open two windows  one tab in each.  Position one window partially off the bottom of the screen.  2. Drag the tab to move the window around.    Notice the flicker of a window in the middle of the screen.  We think this is because we are creating   a new window partially offscreen  but Cocoa is moving it to be completely onscreen.  Sometimes   you can even get the backing window to stay visible even as you're moving the overlay window   around. </pre>
