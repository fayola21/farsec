<title>Issue 42279 -   chromium -    Clicking on dock icon does not open new window if task manager open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open the task manager (View -&gt; Developer -&gt; Task Manager) and then close all the open browser   windows.  Now click on the dock icon.  A new browser window will not open while the task manager   is still open.    Is this desired  or should we be opening a new window in this situation? </pre>
