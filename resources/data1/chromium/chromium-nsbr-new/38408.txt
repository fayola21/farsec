<title>Issue 38408 -   chromium -    All instances of Chrome stop responding. Have close down. Does not produce crash report.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Not exactly sure  but:  - some users including me think the problem more likely when many tabs open  - some think it happens when you navigate away from the current tab  while   it is trying to retrieve data  - I have had the problem several times when either the LAN I am using or   one of the web sites I am visiting has performance problems  - I have now twice had the problem when my ISP also has an issue and   internet access has been disrupted   on the other hand I cannot recreate it by disconnecting my pc from the   network.    Alan Watson          Chrome should work. And if the user has to close it down  you should try to   find a way of producing a crash report so that you can analyse the problem   properly.        All instances of Chrome stop responding. Even if you leave them for an hour   or more they do not restart working. They do not produce a crash report.   Usually  when Chrome is restarted it does not recognise that it has   encountered a problem  but sometimes it does  and prompts you to have it   reopen the tabs that have been closed.    <b>Please provide
