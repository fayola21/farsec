<title>Issue 45184 -   chromium -    When copying text from the omnibox that looks like a URL  prepend http:// even no navigation has happened yet - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When copying go links  I usually do    1. cmd-t  2. type in go/prefix and wait for completion of go/prefixsuffix from history  3. hit cmd-l cmd-c to copy the recalled link from the omnibox  4. hit enter to check it's the right link  5. paste the url copied in 3 in an email.    Since http got stripped  I need to manually add http:// back. Chrome should do this  at least for   stuff it completes from history. </pre>
