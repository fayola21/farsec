<title>Issue 42791 -   chromium -    Free old transport DIBs on the Mac in webplugin_delegate_proxy.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the Mac  webplugin_delegate_proxy.cc stores old transport DIBs in  old_transport_dibs_ while waiting for geometry change acknowledgements  and  then has the browser free them when the geometry change is acknowledged. If  the geometry change is never acknowledged  these DIBs and their shared  memory sections will be leaked. This is a shared memory and an FD leak.  webplugin_delegate_proxy should at least free old transport DIBs when it��_��_��_s  destroyed or at some other good time. </pre>
