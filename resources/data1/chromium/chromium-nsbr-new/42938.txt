<title>Issue 42938 -   chromium -    Chrome caches a resource even though it was told not to - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This may not be an actual Chrome bug  however other browsers do what I   intended.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.19 (Official Build 45417) dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://goto.google.com/kxvbo">http://goto.google.com/kxvbo</a>         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open the web inspector  2. Visit the given URL (Google Internal only  will redirect to actual page)  3. Take off the path part to visit the servers status page and hit enter  4. Press the back button      EITHER     no server interactions take place  the page is fully in the back cache  OR    the &lt;script&gt; is reloaded from the server as it's marked uncacheable      The main inline script is re-evaluated and the XmlHttpRequest is repeated   but the &lt;script&gt; is reloaded from memory cache and not refetched.    Please note the following:    1. This URL is part of a currently confidential Google project. Sorry non-  Google Chromers.    2. The page itself is quite simple at a high level. I didn't provide a   reduction because as far as I can tell the page is already reduced to the   basics. The details of what the loaded script does are extremely   complicated so let me know if you wish to discuss this further. However I   don't believe anything the loaded script is doing would affect this issue   which seems to be entirely related to caching decisions scripts can't   affect.    3. The reason this is a problem is that the loaded script generates a   response that expires after a few minutes. So if you hit &quot;back&quot; enough   times to reach this page  the now expired response is resubmitted to the   server. </pre>
