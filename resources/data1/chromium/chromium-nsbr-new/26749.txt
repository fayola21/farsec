<title>Issue 26749 -   chromium -    All classes which derive from RefCounted should have private destructors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Otherwise objects could be deleted while references exist.  I've seen at   least one example of this.  If they had private destructors  this would have   been caught at compile time.    I'm going to fix all the existing usage so that copy&amp;paste leads to good   patterns.  I've updated the wiki. </pre>
