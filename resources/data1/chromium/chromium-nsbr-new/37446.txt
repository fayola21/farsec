<title>Issue 37446 -   chromium -    SPDY: &quot;Number of headers&quot; field in SYN_STREAM and SYN_REPLY is not parsed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to spdy_protocol.h  &quot;Number of headers&quot; field is actually not part   of the SPDY headers  but part of the name/value header block. Therefore    it's a) compressed b) may get eaten by the compiler if it decides to pad the   SpdySynStreamControlFrameBlock to be 4-byte aligned c) is not accessible to   the user. We should fix the code to do none of those. </pre>
