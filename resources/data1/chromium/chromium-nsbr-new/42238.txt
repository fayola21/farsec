<title>Issue 42238 -   chromium -    ffmpeg.gyp should reside in /deps/third_party/ffmpeg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Having the patched source code and gyp file that builds them separate is too   big of a nightmare.    Moving ffmpeg.gyp alongside with the source code and using DEPS to pull   everything in will allow us to patch  update and test FFmpeg incrementally   without introducing regressions.    Ideally this should be completely before we attempt to do another round of   FFmpeg updating. </pre>
