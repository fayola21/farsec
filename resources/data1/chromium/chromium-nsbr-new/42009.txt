<title>Issue 42009 -   chromium -    view-source URLs are constructed without a scheme  and these don't work. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.375.9 (Official Build 44625)     1. navigate to any &quot;http:// URL  2. hit ctrl-u to view source  3. edit the hostname in the new tab  keeping the remainder of the URL   intact.      the source of the newly-edited URL should be rendered      the browser renders a blank page  and the URL in the url bar is replaced by   &quot;view-source:&quot;      It even fails if the URL is not edited: just hitting the key sequence   &quot;ctrl-u  ctrl-l  enter&quot; from any page exhibits the bug.    I think this may have something to do with hiding the &quot;http:// since   originally the view-source URLs looked more like &quot;view-  source:<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot;  and now they look like &quot;view-  source:www.google.com/&quot;.  On URLs for which the protocol scheme is shown    the bug does not manifest:    navigate to <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>  hit ctrl-u  you get a tab with &quot;view-source:<a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>&quot;  hit ctrl-l  the URL bar is focused  hit enter  the source is rendered anew  and the URL bar is unchanged.    this also works (no bug):  navigate to <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>  the url bar changes to www.google.com/  hit ctrl-u  you get a tab with &quot;view-source:www.google.com/&quot;  hit ctrl-l  and edit the URL to &quot;view-source:<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot;  hit enter  the source is rendered anew  and the URL bar remains &quot;view-  source:<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot; </pre>
