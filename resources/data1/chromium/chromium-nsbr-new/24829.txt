<title>Issue 24829 -   chromium -    The extension toolbar is missing a rightclick option to hide it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.6    The bookmark-bar has a right-click option to hide it (and toggle it on again   on the new tab page)  The extension toolbar is missing that option.    The only way to hide the toolbar atm is Ctrl + Alt + B  A regular Chrome user don't know that shortcut. </pre>
