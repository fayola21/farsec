<title>Issue 37638 -   chromium -    Backward system time jump delays setTimeout call - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 dev (and older)    <a href="http://ludios.net/browser_bugs/chromium_time_jump_bug.html">http://ludios.net/browser_bugs/chromium_time_jump_bug.html</a>           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK (on Windows)             IE 8: OK      1. Load <a href="http://ludios.net/browser_bugs/chromium_time_jump_bug.html">http://ludios.net/browser_bugs/chromium_time_jump_bug.html</a>  2. Move the system clock back 2 minutes.  3. Observe that timers are delayed. On Linux/Mac  this happens right away.  On Windows  this happens after a short period of normalcy.        Ideally  timers would be scheduled with a monotonic clock  and not  interrupted or sped up by system time jumps. Ideally  Chromium would not  conceal the time jump and let Date.getTime() go backwards  as in other  browsers.        For Chromium  the test page describes what happens the 'Observe:' sections.  Behavior for other browsers is listed at the bottom. The behavior for  Chromium/Windows is especially bad  because:     1. It looks like it works  if you don't test for long enough.     2. The behavior doesn't match any other browser.     3. The -2 min time jump is typical of what happens with Windows Time   and this probably does affect the real world. </pre>
