<title>Issue 25196 -   chromium -    Fix GTMTheme workarounds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In several places in the code  the code tests for a 90% white value being  returned from GTMTheme  realizes that it's a default value  and resets it  to nil. GTMTheme should provide nil in those cases (as the comments  indicate that it should)  and the workaround should be removed. </pre>
