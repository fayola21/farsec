<title>Issue 42450 -   chromium -    SyncerThread shouldn't listen to TalkMediator via event_sys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> event_sys is deprecated and needs to die.  NotificationService should be   used  however event_sys is multithreaded and SyncerThread doesn't use message   loops (<a title="[linux] Highlighted text color doesn't change with GTK+ theme. " class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26639"> bug 26639 </a>).  The correct solution would be to listen to TalkMediator   via a component that can post to the SyncCoreThread  which could handle   getting this message to the SyncerThread. </pre>
