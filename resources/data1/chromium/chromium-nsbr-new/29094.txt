<title>Issue 29094 -   chromium -    linux tab edges draw wrong after theme switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. install infected mushroom theme  2. go about your business  3. at some later point  install mariah carey theme    The edges of the tabs that are already open remain green instead of   switching to Mariah-colored. New tabs seem to work as expected. Causing   repaints on the tab in question does not fix it.    I haven't tested this enough to know how reproducible it is.    I suspect <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=23771">r23771</a> is related. </pre>
