<title>Issue 27039 -   chromium -    SingleBeforeUnloadAfterWindowClose is Flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> First seen here:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Linux/buil">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Chromium%20Linux/buil</a>  ds/7337    The test has randomly failed about 9 times on several Linux bots. The   output is:    Note: Google Test filter = BrowserTest.SingleBeforeUnloadAfterWindowClose  [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.  [----------] Global test environment set-up.  [----------] 1 test from BrowserTest  [ RUN      ] BrowserTest.SingleBeforeUnloadAfterWindowClose  [22040:22040:1107/115507:2840614562629:INFO:/b/slave/chromium-rel-  linux/build/src/chrome/browser/bookmarks/bookmark_model.cc(142)] Loading   bookmarks  The program 'browser_tests' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.    (Details: serial 7 error_code 3 request_code 15 minor_code 0)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()   function.)   </pre>
