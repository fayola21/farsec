Cursor inserted in the position clicked  original text not selected. Have   to do Ctrl+A to select all before type in new address or do a triple click   instead. Not sure if it's a bug or it is designed to be so  however in the   older linux version or the current windows version a single click on the   omnibox still select all the text.    <b>Please provide
