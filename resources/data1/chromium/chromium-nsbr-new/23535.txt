<title>Issue 23535 -   chromium -    Enter in find bar searches previous  not next occurence - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.213.1      1. Press Ctrl-F  2. Enter search string that occurs multiple times on the current page  3. Press Enter        The second match should be found and highlighted        The previous match is highlightet  i.e. Enter goes to the previous  not the   next match.  I know that Ctrl-G will find the next match  but the behavior   of Enter  which used to work like Ctrl-G  is now very counter intuitive.   </pre>
