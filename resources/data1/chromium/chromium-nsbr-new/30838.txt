<title>Issue 30838 -   chromium -    Non-visible plugins (background tabs  hidden/minimized windows  etc.) should use less CPU - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.276.0 (35044)    OS version               : Mac OS 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Camino 2.x (if applicable): OKAY  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: not tested    Hello Chromium-Team     when a window with Flash-Content for example (or quicktime-content ...)  is minimized into the   dock  the cpu-usage should go down.    This behavior you can find in Safari/Firefox/Camino !      1. open a new Chromium-window  2. go to youtube for example and play a video  3. minimize the window (CMD+M) into the dock      The cpu-usage should be reduced      The minimized window has the same cpu-use like it is not minimized.    Note: It works fine (the CPU-USAGE goes down)  when I open a new Tab in the front of the flas-  content.    Thanks in advance.    Mehmet       </pre>
