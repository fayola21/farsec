<title>Issue 23571 -   chromium -    Mac: menu bar visibility needs to be refcounted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Open two windows.  make one fullscreen with cmd-shift-F.  cmd-` to switch to the other one.    Make it fullscreen as well with cmd-shift-F.  Toggle it back to non-fullscreen with cmd-shift-F      Expected: menu bar stays hidden until no windows are full screen  Actual: menu bar appears when any window toggles back to non-fullscreen  leaving a fullscreen   window plus menu bar visible.    This also affects plugins  which can create fullscreen windows of their own (see   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/257008">http://codereview.chromium.org/257008</a>).  We should be tracking outstanding requests for   fullscreen and only showing the menu bar when that counter is zero (since the menu bar is per   app  not per window).   </pre>
