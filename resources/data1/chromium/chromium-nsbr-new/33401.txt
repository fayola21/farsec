<title>Issue 33401 -   chromium -    browser actions hidden after extensions autoupdate - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install multiple extensions with browser actions that have updates   available.    2. Run autoupdate from chrome://extensions.    3. Notice that some/all of the browser action buttons end up hidden.      Evan  assigning to you because when I mentioned this to Finnur he pointed the   finger of blame at some recent changes you made to the browser actions   container. Feel free to unassign yourself if you disagree :).   </pre>
