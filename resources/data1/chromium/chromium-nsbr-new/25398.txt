<title>Issue 25398 -   chromium -    Can't select dates on analytics - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;There appears to have been a regression on this bug fix on the 64bit   version any   way. I have been testing this for several weeks to see if it improved and it   has not.   The version I tested on this morning was 4.0.224.0 (29623). Basically you   can't select   the dates with the mouse  but have to type them in manually. I have tested   this with   Firefox 3.5  3.6 and 3.7 on the x86_64 Ubuntu platform and it works   correctly. This   may be affecting other issues as well.&quot; </pre>
