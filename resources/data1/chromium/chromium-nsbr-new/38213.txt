<title>Issue 38213 -   chromium -    Chromium adds .txt extensions unnecessarily to text-like downloads - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Chromium	5.0.344.0 (Developer Build 40590)  WebKit	533.2  V8	2.1.2.5    Running under up-to-date Arch Linux            Firefox 3.x: OK      1. View a text file with a non-txt extension  such as .patch or .diff (e.g.   <a href="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/40959543/contextinfo.diff">http://launchpadlibrarian.net/40959543/contextinfo.diff</a>)  2. Right-click and choose &quot;Save As...&quot;      The save as dialog shows the filename as provided by the server (e.g.   contextinfo.diff)      The save as dialog adds a .txt extension  even though the perfectly good   .patch or .diff extension is already there! (i.e. contextinfo.diff.txt)       </pre>
