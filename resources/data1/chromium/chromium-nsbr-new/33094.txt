<title>Issue 33094 -   chromium -    Pressing Esc in omnibox sometimes loses focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> That is  it'll revert the contents of the Omnibox (which is right)  but also move   focus to the web contents (which is wrong).    I don't have a good repro other than that it seems to happen fairly   consistently in long-running windows with lots of tabs. (In such windows  it'll   happen 100% of the time.) In newly-created windows  I can't really reproduce   this. </pre>
