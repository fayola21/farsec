<title>Issue 46035 -   chromium -    Arabic points (e.g. U+064B) are rendered with empty rectangles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported internally (http://b/2692225 but I couldn't reproduce myself on Mac OS 10.5.x (with 6.0 dev channel build)     Arabic glyphs on Chrome on Mac show rectangles in place of diacritical marks (short vowels).    Attached are screen shots of the same page opened on Chrome and on Safari showing the issue. The issue occurs on Chrome but not on Safari.    Chrome version: 5.0.375.38 beta for Mac  Mac OS X: 10.5.8  Example URL: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?edchanged=1&amp;ned=ar_ae">http://news.google.com/news?edchanged=1&amp;ned=ar_ae</a>    To be more specific  it doesn't seem to be a general problem. It only happens with specific fonts.  For instance  on this site:  <a href="http://www.alwatan.com.sa/Nation/News_Detail.aspx?ArticleID=2875&amp;CategoryID=3">http://www.alwatan.com.sa/Nation/News_Detail.aspx?ArticleID=2875&amp;CategoryID=3</a>  the diacritics are showing properly in the headline in the word: ��__��__��_��_��__��_��_    On this site:  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/middleeast/2010/05/100518_citienship_lebanon.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/middleeast/2010/05/100518_citienship_lebanon.shtml</a>  you can see the the rectangle instead of the diacritics    ----------------------    The 3rd file (html) is my attempt to make a reduced test  but it works fine even on the original reporter's machine.            </pre>
