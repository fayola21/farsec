<title>Issue 26472 -   chromium -    DevTools UI briefly hangs when the &lt;select&gt; element lists are expanded/collapsed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a web page with many external resources (js  css  images  etc.)  2. Bring up the DevTools window  switch to the Resources panel  and select   the &quot;All&quot; filter type at the top.  3. Click the &quot;Sort by...&quot; selector in the status bar.    What is the expected output?  The option list appears and no other changes to the UI take place.    What do you see instead?  The option list appears but the resource list sidebar and the toolbar turn   grayed-out the same way as they do when the DevTools window loses focus.   The graying-out takes just under 1 sec and causes a noticeable delay. The   DevTools UI stays unresponsive during that time. [The same result can be   achieved by clicking the script source selector in the Scripts panel but   the Resources panel case causes a longer delay] </pre>
