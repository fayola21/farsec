<title>Issue 35881 -   chromium -    Home page loads only when you &quot;quit&quot; Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.7 beta  OS: Mac OS X    1. Open Chrome  2. Click on Chrome -&gt; Preferences  3. For &quot;Home Page&quot; select &quot;Open this page&quot;  4. Set a new default home page  5. &quot;x&quot; out of Chrome  6. Open it again      As a user I leave my main applications (browser  mail  etc) running   constantly  just &quot;x-ed&quot; out so that it's not on the screen. For a lot of users    this is the definition of &quot;closed&quot; without killing the process. When I click on   Chrome to open up a new window I would expect to see my new home   page appear.      When the new window opens the user sees the &quot;New Tab&quot; page. This is   also the case when opening a new tab. The user should have the option to   display &quot;home page&quot; when opening a new tab.   </pre>
