<title>Issue 31374 -   chromium -    MessagingContentScript &amp; MessagingExtensionTab failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I disabled these two tests in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35391">r35391</a> during the WebKit roll from 52633 -&gt;   52667.    Something in that roll broke these tests on Linux.  But I didn't know how to   just disable for Linux. </pre>
