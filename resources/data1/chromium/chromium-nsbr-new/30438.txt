<title>Issue 30438 -   chromium -    Instead of a confirmation dialog for uninstall  it might be nice to have &quot;undo&quot; support instead - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sometimes when I want to uninstall a few extensions at once I miss the good   old days when we didn't have the uninstall confirmation. Maybe we could move   to the model like gmail message deleting where it does the action immediately   but puts a little yellow &quot;undo&quot; link at the top of the page just in case you   accidentally clicked on the wrong one  etc.    </pre>
