<title>Issue 43540 -   chromium -    &quot;Report a Broken Website&quot;  page doesn't get the website details if a language change is needed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 6.0.398.0 (46661) under windows  one of my computers had the &quot;Report a Broken Website&quot; page (from the page   menu) redirect to a Hebrew page saying something along the lines of 'we   can't support your language. if you would like to contact us  please choose   one of the following languages'.    after choosing a supported language form the list (English) the report   website page  which appeared didn't have any of the original website data   filled-in (URL and title text boxes were blank).    btw  how does the report website page determines my language? originally   chrome UI web indeed in Hebrew  but even after changing it to English  and   messing with my Google account default languages it wouldn't change to   English.  only after deleting all cache it started loading in English and now nothing   i do seems to bring it back to default on Hebrew. </pre>
