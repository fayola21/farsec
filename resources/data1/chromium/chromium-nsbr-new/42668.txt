<title>Issue 42668 -   chromium -    Server-DNS-Resolution for secure connections - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For years  we've discussed the possibility of allowing servers to include   DNS resolutions as part of the HTTP response.      For example  a request to www.google.com could add a response header such   as:     X-DNS-Resolution:  images.google.com=74.125.127.99 74.125.127.106    The problem with doing this is that the client has no way to know that   www.google.com has the authority to declare the lookup for   images.google.com.      We'd like to add a feature to Chrome where we enable this feature.    However  to make it work  only use it in conjunction with TLS (https)   requests.  When the client establishes a TLS request for images.google.com    it will get a strong-server authentication that the destination server   really is images.google.com.  As such  if the origin server   (www.google.com) was trying to be malicious  we can detect that and   fallback.    The work becomes as follows:    a) If the server sends such a resolution  store it within the client's   local DNS cache as a &quot;unverified&quot; resolution.    b) When making any TLS based connections  check the local DNS cache.    c) If the local DNS cache has a resolution  use it.  If the TLS handshake   fails  remove the entry from the local DNS cache.    Benefit:  We believe this can save 1 DNS lookup for subdomains which can be pre-  resolved.  Further  because this lookup is done server-side  rather than   through the hierarchical DNS system  server-farms may be able to better   resolve lookups for the specific client  allowing the client to more   accurately connect to the closest edge of the server's network.    Current worldwide DNS lookup times (excluding failures) from chromium are:   48ms @ 50%tile   75ms @ 70%tile  146ms @ 90%tile  247ms @ 98%tile       </pre>
