<title>Issue 26758 -   chromium -    Chrome offers suggestions in text fields when it shouldn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a website that remembers text inputs (like Wolfram|Alpha)  2. type something in (lets say &quot;life is good&quot;) and press enter  3. Then  on the say field  type something that starts with the same letter   as you previous input (like &quot;living my life&quot;)  4. Notice that Chrome give you the suggestion &quot;life is good&quot; even though   you already type beyond the &quot;l&quot; letter (see attached Pic).        Chrome should not give you any suggestions after the similarity between the   first input and the current input and no longer there.        Chrome gives you the suggestion anyway.    <b>Please provide
