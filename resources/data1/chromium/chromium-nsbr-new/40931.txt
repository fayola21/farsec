<title>Issue 40931 -   chromium -    Javascript split method of string object returns array with some additional strange keys - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.371.0 dev        Firefox 3.x: OK    Chrome 5.0.342.9: OK       1. open about:blank URL in new tab  2. open JavaScript console  3. run following JavaScript:  var names = &quot;a b c d&quot;.split(/ /); for (i in names) {console.log(i);}      following lines should be written into JavaScript console  0  1  2  3      following lines are written into JavaScript console  0  1  2  3  index  input      Values under 'index' and 'input' keys are undefined. It seems to me that problem doesn't depend   on site where test JavaScript is executed.      If array is created statically as    var names = [ï¿½_'a'  'b'  'c'  'd' ]; for (i in names) {console.log(i);}    strange keys 'index' and 'input' doesn't occur. </pre>
