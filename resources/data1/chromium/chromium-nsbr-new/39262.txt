<title>Issue 39262 -   chromium -    GPU Process failure on Mac OS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hardware: MacBook Pro 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo  2GB memory  MacOS 10.5.8  NVidia GeForce 8600M GT  OpenGL Version 2.0 NVIDIA-1.5.48    Chrome is built from top of tree  as of 24 March 2010.  Start chrome as: ./xcodebuild/Debug/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium  --internal-nacl --no-sandbox --internal-pepper --enable-gpu-plugin  Load: nativeclient/nacl-x86-32/staging/pepper_plugin.html    In the Chrome task manager the GPU process can be seen starting then  crashing. Sometimes it allocates a large amount of memory first (100s of  MBs). Sometimes it crashes after a few seconds.      3D test output - rotating square pattern.       </pre>
