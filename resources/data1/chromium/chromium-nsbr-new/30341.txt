<title>Issue 30341 -   chromium -    Junk data reported for svg elements on the metrics tab in developer tools - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (Official Build 33928) (Linux 32-bit)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/demos/photos.svg">http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/demos/photos.svg</a>  Other browsers tested: N/A  Firebug has similar issues  but some efforts have been made to correct it.   See: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=1953">http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=1953</a>      1. Open developer tools on a page with svg  and go to elements  2. Find an element that would have spatial properties  3. Open the metrics tab  and observe      Unclear. Some level of spatial information. In the latest version of   firebug  the bounding rectangle is used.      A size of 0x0 is reported  and nothing else.    There is no clear right way to do this  but the bounding rectangle is   certainly helpful when debugging svg documents. The provided screenshot is   of the development tools panel on the provided url.   </pre>
