<title>Issue 29192 -   chromium -    Don't move the window when opening a download shelf - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new download shelf works really badly for windows at the bottom of the screen.    STR:  1) Put a window flush to the bottom of the screen  2) Download something  3) Close the download shelf    The window should be just the way it was before; instead it has its original size but has been moved   upward by the height of the download shelf.    Ideally I'd like it to shrink content  but having it remember that it moved up and then move back   down would be okay. </pre>
