<title>Issue 29214 -   chromium -    mouse clicks on Chrome controls malfunctioning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11 (Official Build 32790)    Starting this morning  when I:    - click on any tab (in the tab bar) Chrome closes that tab    - click on any bookmark folder  it opens all bookmarks in the folder    - click on the page or wrench icon  it does nothing    This started happening after my (WinXP) laptop hung and had to be power-  cycled while Chrome was running.  But that happens all the time. </pre>
