<title>Issue 29629 -   chromium -    Download Shelf enlarges window when appearing  does not shrink again when closing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.264.0 (33820)  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ???      1. If needed  close the downloads shelf and resize the window so that it suits you well  2. Download something -&gt; the download shelf appears and enlarges the window downwards. This by itself is an   unfortunate development  earlier versions did not change the window size which IMHO is preferable behavior.  3. Close the download shelf -&gt; the window stays at the enlarged size. Repeating steps 2 and 3 will enlarge the window   stepwise until it hits the bottom screen border (or the Dock).      The browser window should not be resized  or if it has to be resized at all costs  it should at least restore the original size   when closing the download shelf.      The browser window is resized and the size is not restored. </pre>
