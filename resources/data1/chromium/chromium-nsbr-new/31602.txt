<title>Issue 31602 -   chromium -    More control over the sites that appear in the home page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature/Enhancement Request    Users should have more control over which sites appear on the Chrome home   page.  Currently  you can pin and remove  but you don't seem to be able to   add arbitrary sites (if you can  it's not obvious how).    This is a feature of Safari 4 that I really like.  I can add sites to my start page    and every time I open a new tab  and I can see if any of the sites have   changed (Safari will highlight sites that have changed since my last visit).  This   is incredibly useful for keeping an eye on my favorite sites. </pre>
