<title>Issue 24518 -   chromium -    New feature: merge all windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28160)  Sorry if I use wrong place to suggest new feature  but dont found any other   place for it.     I miss &quot;Merge all windows&quot; feature from Safari in Chrome. Think it can be    located under Window menu on Mac.  </pre>
