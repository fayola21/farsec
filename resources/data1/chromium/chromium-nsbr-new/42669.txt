<title>Issue 42669 -   chromium -    Implement IP-based connection pooling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Often we have virtually hosted related subdomains where we can utilize the   same connection but don't know it.  At google  for instance  static content   is served from a set of servers at t0.gstatic.com  t1.gstatic.com    t2.gstatic.com.  If the browser has a connection open to t0.gstatic.com  it   can safely use that for also fetching resources from t1.gstatic.com.    Update the connection pooling architecture such that if a domain resolves to   an IP which we already have a connection to  allow the request to be pooled   into the same connection pool.    There are some additional caveats to this feature to be discussed.     </pre>
