<title>Issue 38630 -   chromium -    JSON Values interpretation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> * Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 (41514)  * URL :  Local URL (app in development)  * Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Not tested  * Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Work fine    * What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Load the translation.js script  2. Check the translation.js content    * What is the expected result?   A big set of values into the TSL object    * What happens instead?     I have only one litlle value    * Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  possible.  In my app  I transform Java properties file into a set of JSon keys:values.   I use this set into a JavaScript object to translate my UI.  With firefox  all works fine  the Javascript object is perfectly generated    interpreted and used.  In Chrome I have only one litlle entry in the JSon set. But the file is   served with the same server...    As attachements  you can find the file as he is displayed with Firefox   (translation.js) and a copy of this file as he is displayed with Chrome   (translation_CHROME.js)    Thanks   </pre>
