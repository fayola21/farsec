<title>Issue 35524 -   chromium -    dns check for crappy isps should happen anytime network changes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the check to see if the isp generates dns replies for all hosts is done   at startup  we should also hook this into the notification for when the network   changes  and redo the checks.  This recheck is needed for moving a laptop   between different wireless networks  across sleep/awake cycles.    Will - I believe you did the notifications  and you add a pointer here for what   to wire up?   </pre>
