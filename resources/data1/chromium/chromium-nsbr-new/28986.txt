<title>Issue 28986 -   chromium -    Offer to copy the application out of the disk image if run from there - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you double-click Picasa.app from its disk image  it offers to copy itself   to /Applications.  That's nice.  Chrome should do the same thing.    This touches auto-update (in that I'd like to recycle some of the   .keystone_install bits) and Keystone ticket promotion (in that if the user   authenticates to install into /Applications  we can do Keystone promotion at   the same time.) </pre>
