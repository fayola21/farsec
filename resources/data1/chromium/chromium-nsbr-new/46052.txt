<title>Issue 46052 -   chromium -    Refactor chrome sync integration test code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The chrome sync integration tests were designed over the past few versions of chrome  and were originally designed with only bookmarks in mind with other data types retrofitted.    The test code requires a major refactor  keeping in mind the fact that there are multiple data types today with more to come. Specifically  this work will involve splitting the code into separate header files for each data type  with a class hierarchy rooted at class LiveSyncTest  where derived classes share some common functionality and contain other data type specific functionality.    This is a tracking bug  and is to be resolved when the refactor is complete. </pre>
