<title>Issue 43486 -   chromium -    Session lost if browser is launched with --incognito and closed without opening any normal windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set options -&gt; on startup -&gt; reopen the pages that were open last  2. Open some tabs  3. Quit the browser  4. Launch the browser with --incognito  5. Close browser  6. Launch normally (without --incognito)    What is the expected output?  Browser should launch with the tabs you had open after step 2.    What do you see instead?  Starts with empty browser.          You can use the reopen closed tabs functionality to get them back  but this   should not be required.    Note that in step 5 if you instead open a new non-incognito window without   quitting  it does restore your previous session at that point.    Sort of similar to <a title="Restore tabs on startup doesn't work when close an incognito window after the main window"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32591">issue 32591</a>. </pre>
