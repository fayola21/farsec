<title>Issue 44647 -   chromium -    Close button image should be mirrored when window management buttons are on left - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The close button image has a (barely) cut corner  so it should be mirrored   across the Y-axis when the buttons are placed in the top-left corner of the   window.  I think we already have code to flip images for RTL  right?    <a href="http://ponderer.org/images/chromium-buttons-left">http://ponderer.org/images/chromium-buttons-left</a> </pre>
