<title>Issue 38680 -   chromium -    Fade to and from fullscreen mode is too slow and jarring - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.356.0 dev  OS version        : 10.6.2      1. Activate fullscreen mode  2. Wait 3 seconds  3. Deactivate fullscreen mode      A smooth and quick transition.      A slow and jarring transition.    I just upgraded  and while I love fullscreen mode  the new transition is jarring. I feel strongly   that it needs to be made much more subtle. It might be sufficient to just make it faster  I'm   not sure. </pre>
