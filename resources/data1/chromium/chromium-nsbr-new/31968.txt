<title>Issue 31968 -   chromium -    Chrome extensions disappear under windows 7 64bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 dev      1. Install several extensions (for example I have XMarks  UndoIt!  Chrome   Bird and AdBlock Chromium).  2. After some actions (can't yet figure out exact order)  like   restart/hibernate I run Chrome.          All previously installed extensions should still function.        I can see only Chrome Bird icon is on the button and it works  all other   extensions don't and there are no folder for them at   C:Users&lt;user&gt;AppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultExtensions  except for the Chrome Bird.   </pre>
