<title>Issue 30239 -   chromium -    Mac: penchant for putting pop-ups under Dock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Put your Dock on the left.  2. Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/popup.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/js/popup.html</a>&gt;. Under   &quot;Arguments&quot;  uncheck &quot;top=200&quot;  &quot;left=400&quot; (actually  it suffices to only   uncheck the latter).  3. Click on the corresponding &quot;Open popup&quot; link.      One expects the pop-up to end up somewhere reasonable  e.g.  the   upper-left of the working area. Instead  it ends up partly under the Dock.    This is on the 249 beta channel and on ToT.    Since this is pissing me off  let me do something about it. </pre>
