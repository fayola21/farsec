<title>Issue 34471 -   chromium -    Add support for side-by-side installs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  users can only have one installation of Chrome on one channel;   they have to use Chromium to get any other version of Chrome.    We should add support for side-by-side installs  so users can run multiple   channels.    Not sure if we should track this here as well  but it would be great to have   the channel switching built right into the UI somewhere. </pre>
