<title>Issue 25730 -   chromium -    Chrome starts downloaded application without asking to save it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?</a>  extra=devchannel             IE 8: You'll have to click the download link 3 times... is that OK   or FAIL?      1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?extra=devchannel">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?extra=devchannel</a>  2. Click the install button  3. Notice that it launches automatically    If chrome does not allow to automatically open all programs  it would be   very very unfair to others to allow it on your own website. This site   should also ask where to save it  before it can be opened  just like all   other downloads!!! </pre>
