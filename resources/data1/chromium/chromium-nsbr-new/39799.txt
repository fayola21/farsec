<title>Issue 39799 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: single-line labels are line-wrapped with Views for Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     See a Chromium OS bug.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=2296">http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=2296</a>    We originally thought it's a chromium os specific bug  but it seems to be a bug in   Views for Linux.        Single-line labels should not be line-wrapped  but these are line-wrapped as shown in   the attached screenshot.        As described in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=2296">http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=2296</a>  this has   started since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=42527">r42527</a>. I have a pending CL to fix this. I'll be sending it out for a   code review. </pre>
