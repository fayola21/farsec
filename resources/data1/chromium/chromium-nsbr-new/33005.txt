<title>Issue 33005 -   chromium -    location-bar search: history search should always appear last [feature] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    Overview:  When typing something into the location-bar  one gets a popup box of   suggestions. Perhaps the last suggestion of this box should always be a   &quot;fuzzy&quot; history search  for when the url history search doesn't work   correctly? </pre>
