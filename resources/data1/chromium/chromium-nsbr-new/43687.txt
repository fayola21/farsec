<title>Issue 43687 -   chromium -    Chrome uses nvidia over integrated intel HD gpu in macbook pro unibodies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev    OS version               : 10.6.3    Macbook Pro Unibody 15&quot; / 2.66GHz Core i7 / Nvidia 330M + Intel integrated HD / Product code:   6 2      Chrome should not require the greater gpu for rendering webpages.

I use this little application to tell which gpu is currently active on my macbook pro:    <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/</a> </pre>
