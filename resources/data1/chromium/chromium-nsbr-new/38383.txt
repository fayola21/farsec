<title>Issue 38383 -   chromium -    Chromium browser crashes due to shm fd leak when loading pages with flash repeatedly  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   (1)launch google chrome or chromium and let it   load &quot;test_chrome_fd_leak.html&quot; in the tarball attached  and make sure   PLUGIN support is enabled  (2)find out the renderer process id (usually it's the 4th process listed   by 'ps -A | grep chrom')  supposing it's R_PID  (3)check the number of fd owned by the renderer process during the testing   from time to time  e.g. 'sudo ls -l /proc/R_PID/fd | wc -l'  (4)note that when the fd number reaches 1024 and you see the crash           There's no fd leak and browser/renderer doesn't crash         This issue appears only if there're plugins in the web page and no   pause time between two adjacent loads. Possibly it's related to some bug   in the IPC between the renderer process and the plugin process    <b>Please provide
