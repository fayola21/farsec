<title>Issue 45721 -   chromium -    Custom installation directory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm fully aware of the pros of installing under the user profile  however   even a simple command line switch to specify the installation dir would be a   great enhancement.    Any official word on the issue? I've searched for about an hour  haven't   found even a Fixed/WontFix.    Thanks. </pre>
