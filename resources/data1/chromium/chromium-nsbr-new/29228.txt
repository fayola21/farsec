<title>Issue 29228 -   chromium -    race between page cycler tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Seems like each time I'm on sheriff duty  one bot hiccups with:    091202 13:53:23 httpd_utils.py:145 INFO Starting http server  (48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address   127.0.0.1:8000  no listening sockets available  shutting down  Unable to open logs  Traceback (most recent call last):    File &quot;../../../scripts/slave/runtest.py&quot;  line 266  in &lt;module&gt;      sys.exit(main_mac(options  args))    File &quot;../../../scripts/slave/runtest.py&quot;  line 73  in main_mac      (e  output_dir))  google.httpd_utils.HttpdNotStarted: Failed to start httpd on port 8000. See   log file in /b/slave/chromium-rel-mac/httpd_logs/page_cycler_tests    When I've looked in the past  it was because the httpd for one test hadn't   spun down/release the port for the new one to grab in time.    Can the script be changed to use dynamic ports or reuse the httpd between   tests to avoid this? </pre>
