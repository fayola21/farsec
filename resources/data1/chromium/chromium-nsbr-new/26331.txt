<title>Issue 26331 -   chromium -    WebGL examples at http://www.x3dom.org/ lock up renderer process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Build Chromium from trunk and run with --no-sandbox --enable-webgl.  2. Visit <a href="http://www.x3dom.org/">http://www.x3dom.org/</a>  3. If the renderer hasn't locked up yet  navigate to the examples and run   any of them.        Expect that the browser renders the example. Instead  the renderer process   stops allowing user interaction.    Setting breakpoints indicates that the attached stack trace is triggered   over and over again  though not in a spin loop; the renderer process   consumes about 6% CPU when this occurs.    I don't think the WebGL code is involved in provoking this lockup.    The WebKit nightlies with WebGL enabled render this site correctly. The   examples start a little weirdly -- the zoom animation executes and then the   sample takes over the entire web page -- but the browser doesn't lock up.   </pre>
