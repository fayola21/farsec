<title>Issue 27372 -   chromium -    Chrome RTL on WinXP RTL: unexpected mouse cursor icon change. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;4.0.237.0&gt;    I am using WinXP Hebrew edition (everything is RTL  also the START button   appear in right)  It's happen only with Google Chrome Hebrew.    1. Put the mouse cursor in empty space inside the omnibox. (not over the   url address).  2. Move the cursor vertically down or up (to the page contet or tabs bar).    The problem is that the cursor icon change from LTR cursor to RTL cursor   and also it's move a little to left.    See the atachment image. </pre>
