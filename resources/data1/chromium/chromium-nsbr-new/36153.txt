<title>Issue 36153 -   chromium -    Dynamic tabs error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)      1. Start with two Chrome windows with multiple opened tabs.  2. drag any one tab from one window to the tab bar of the other window.      The tab should be merged into the new window      The tab doesn't 'lock' into place and remains a separate window.    Merging tabs into existing windows doesn't work  nor does reordering tabs  only   tearing tabs from existing windows works. </pre>
