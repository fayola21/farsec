<title>Issue 34489 -   chromium -    Make multitouch features optional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 (Official Build 37331) dev  OS version               : 10.5.8    Thanks for implementing multi-touch for Macs   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16305">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16305</a>).  However    can this please be made optional?  I hit pinch-zoom accidentally every few   minutes while browsing  especially when i zoom/scroll a lot with two-finger   swipes.  This is quite apparent on Google Maps  for instance.  A preference   setting to enable this would be awesome  or at least allow for the sensitivity   to be tuned.  I cannot disable pinch-zoom altogether in System Preferences -  &gt; Trackpad  or I'd just do that instead. </pre>
