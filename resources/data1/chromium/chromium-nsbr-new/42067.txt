<title>Issue 42067 -   chromium -    Revert changes to the Omnibox (or have an option to do so) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev    <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/04/dev-channel-update_08.html">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/04/dev-channel-update_08.html</a>      1. Upgrade to 5.0.371.0+      As of 5.0.371.0 changes to the omnibox have been made  quite reckless ones   I might add. You can't just change the layout without an option to turn it   back.    For instance if one should have wide monitor (~2000px+) one must travel   possibly quite large area to click bookmarkbutton because most mouse action   should be on the left side of the screen.    About the http strip... how is one supposed to add &quot;s&quot; to the and of http   if one would can't see it? I'm a developer and i juggle between http/https   a lot.    Main point:  Have an option to revert changes to the Omnibox that were introduced in   5.0.371.0. </pre>
