<title>Issue 36599 -   chromium -    VerifyUpdates should not write stuff to the DB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Verify updates in sync doesn't actually just verify updates  it does some   modifications too. It should be cleaned up so that it's not actually doing   things like that. It currently does ID association as well  which could be   moved to a new syncer command that operates on the output of verify updates.    verify_updates_command.cc </pre>
