<title>Issue 39583 -   chromium -    Mac bookmark bar activates hover state on title bar buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 beta    OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.2      Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Point our mouse pointer on the bookmark bar on a Mac.  2. Pay atttention to the title bar buttons  which will now &quot;activate&quot; (display X / - / + symbols    respectively).      That pointing your mouse button on browser UI elements won't change the hover state on the   title bar buttons.      The hover state changes.    ---    Own comments: Not a major bug  seemingly at least  but it's kind of annoying and probably   violates some obscure Mac guideline somewhere. :p </pre>
