<title>Issue 26909 -   chromium -    Full crome crash - full crash  not just a tab ! on problematic dictionary - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  URLs (if applicable) : all  Other browsers tested: n/a         Safari 4:n/a    Firefox 3.x:n/a           IE 7:n/a           IE 8:n/a      1.Just right click on a miss-spelled word and crash the system    The problem that I have found is that when I select the Greek language   as default for spell checking  when chromium see a word  is try   to correct it - the moment I open the menu on this word the full chromioum  is crash (I have let it send a crash report)    So I found that the Dictionaries directory  that have the el-GR-1-1.bdic  and discover that this file  was corrupt !  delete it and restore it and no problem    I think that even on that case  when a dictionary is corrupt  chrome must be work and not crash that hard !        Crass the full chromioum  not just a tab.       </pre>
