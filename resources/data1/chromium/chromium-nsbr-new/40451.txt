<title>Issue 40451 -   chromium -    Ugly scrollbars in linux notifications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go to your notification demo page.  Leave the icon blank  type in &quot;aslfkasdjlfk&quot; in the title field  and paste   &quot;this guy did the drawing I think   :<a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/Previews/99-353">http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/Previews/99-353</a>&quot; into the body field.    Display the notification  and you see some pretty ugly looking black bars   where the scrollbars should be.    Also  we should use word-wrap:break-word in the template so that long lines   don't force horizontal scrollbars in notifications. </pre>
