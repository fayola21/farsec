<title>Issue 33038 -   chromium -    &quot;//foo.com&quot; should not default to file protocol - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Type &quot;//foo.com&quot; into the address bar      Autocomplete to &quot;<a href="http://foo.com">http://foo.com</a>&quot; like all other browsers      Autocompletes to &quot;file://foo.com&quot;  which is a weird default and definitely   isn't the majority case.    I am used to on other browsers typing a '//' to make sure that I don't   inadvertently search for something (this isn't actually necessary on FF   anymore  but it's in my hands now)  especially for internal-sites which use   hostnames (like http://coolintranetsite    I realize the bug isn't common  but the flip side is that assuming it's a File   protocol is pretty unexpected / strange IMHO. </pre>
