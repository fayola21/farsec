<title>Issue 29231 -   chromium -    Windows 7 x64 has ~500ms delay in most requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11 (Official Build 32790)             Safari 4: Not installed    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: Not available in W7 to test without a VM            IE 8: OK    OS: WIndows 7 Professional x64  NIC: Realtek RTL8168D/8111D Family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.20)      1. Load any uncached (static or dynamic) resource from any non-busy LAN or  local server - to really notice the issue load an HTML page with many graphics      For the resource and child resources to load almost instantly as IE 8 and  FF does  and as Chrome does on other O/S I have tried (XP x64  Vista 32)      Delay of around 500ms before resource loads    Attached is net-internals in it you will see requests to http://beast/  which is an under-utilised  speedy LAN web server which takes about 500ms  to load static resources or simple Apache directory browse pages.    You will also see requests to <a href="http://gwilym7.interspire.corp/">http://gwilym7.interspire.corp/</a> which is the  local machine.    Here is my post to Chromium-discuss:  ------------------------    I don't know exactly how to report this or what component would be  responsible  so I'll open this for discussion instead.    Does anyone else using Windows 7 find that Chrome is somewhat slow to  finalise any http request?     I have tried with both latest public Chrome release and the current  dev channel release: 4.0.249.11    For example  if I'm browsing an Apache server's generated directory  listings - LAN or lo - there is always a noticeable delay for page and  icon loads. Something that should load in 50 - 100ms total takes 500 -  600ms instead.    Firefox 3.5 and IE 8 on the same machine are unaffected. Both will  load pages and icons instantly.    IPv6 is disabled using this method:  <a href="http://www.home-network-help.com/disable-ipv6.html">http://www.home-network-help.com/disable-ipv6.html</a>    Wireshark seems to show that the TCP traffic is the same (for example   no extra calls to external services holding things up). Just in case   disabling the 200ms ACK delay in Windows to be instant does not change  the issue.    This Windows 7 machine is up to date. I have no other Windows 7  machines to test on.    Local servers are affected. Issue remains after disabling the network  adapter.     Sorry I don't know how to save net-internals in the same format as it  displays so it's in plain text... save-as is disabled when viewing it and I  have no pdf printer. </pre>
