<title>Issue 35447 -   chromium -    Chrome has a delay when CPU is at high usage. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. When I do something that requires the high CPU usage (for example   burning video to a DVD or running a program that causes computer to use  higher CPU) Then Chrome will have a long delay at times before rendering  webpages.     2. Let's assume I go to www.yahoo.com  firefox browser or IE will be  already going to the page while Chrome will not yet have started to work.       There should not be a long delay before the chrome browser starts working.      There's a delay....        </pre>
