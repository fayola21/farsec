<title>Issue 40493 -   chromium -    Find a more robust window activation interposing point for Mac plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The fix in <a title="Fix event handling in Unity on 10.6" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38996"> bug 38996 </a> isn't quite selective enough  because setWindowNumber: is too early to get   visibility info (for example  the Flash attachment window from in Gmail is picked up with   setWindowNumber  and it's invisible at the time of the call). As it is now  Unity causes a one-time   process switch when it first gets a mouse event.    Ideally we would be catching activation more specifically  so that we can distinguish between   opening the Gmail attachment window and the invisible Unity window. </pre>
