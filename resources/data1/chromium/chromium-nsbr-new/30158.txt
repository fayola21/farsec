<title>Issue 30158 -   chromium -    Opacity-fading - Color bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.249.25  URLs : <a href="http://hackerman.se">http://hackerman.se</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. None      The scollbars fade in opacity with the right colors.      Scrollbars fade in opacity with random colors like &quot;Pink&quot;  &quot;green&quot;  &quot;Orange&quot;  &quot;Red&quot;  and some more colors.      Personal tech info:    When graphical objects fade opacity the scrollbars colors change in strange colors while fading  Firefox and IE works   fine without any color-loss or weard looks.  </pre>
