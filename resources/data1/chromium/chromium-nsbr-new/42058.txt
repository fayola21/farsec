<title>Issue 42058 -   chromium -    Can't connect to localhost when offline unless passing --enable-ipv6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This report is courtesy of &quot;netdur&quot; from IRC. We debugged through the problem and found the   culprit to be the disabling of IPV6.    When the user is connected to the internet  loading http://localhost/ loads correctly in Chrome.  When the user is disconnected  loading http://localhost/ fails in Chrome  but succeeds in Firefox.    We found that if he passes --enable-ipv6 then chrome works correctly again in the offline mode.  The culprit here appears to be the IPV6 disabling probe.    Here is the raw data:    <a href="http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/7067/screenshot1iw.png">http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/7067/screenshot1iw.png</a>  <a href="http://pastebin.com/NAfReF0y">http://pastebin.com/NAfReF0y</a>  <a href="http://pastebin.com/ZFvwET5v">http://pastebin.com/ZFvwET5v</a>  <a href="http://pastebin.com/jsTPE3f5">http://pastebin.com/jsTPE3f5</a>    Here is a summary of the data:    * User is using chrome on linux.    * Not using any proxy .    * With default flags  &quot;localhost&quot; resolves to:     [::1]     127.0.0.1  (Both when offline and online)    * With AI_ADDRCONFIG (and AF_UNSPEC) resolves to:    127.0.0.1    127.0.0.1  (When online)    and:      ::1    127.0.0.1  (When offline).    * Lastly  when doing the resolve with AF_INET in offline  getaddrinfo() is failing. </pre>
