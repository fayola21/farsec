<title>Issue 42911 -   chromium -    maps.google.com broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.23 (Official Build 45554) dev  URL : <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a>  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a>  2. Wait 1 second.  3. Try to pan the map  zoom  or search for an address. Nothing   works. The page says &quot;Loading...&quot; at the top  then says &quot;Still   loading... Slow? Use the troubleshooting guide or basic HTML&quot;.   Doesn't get better after several minutes.    It was working OK with the previous version of google-chrome-  unstable (on Linux  Fedora 12)  I believe. The previous version   was: google-chrome-unstable-5.0.375.19-45417.i386    chrome://net-internals/ (Full logging enabled  cleared right   before loading maps.google.com  copy taken after &quot;Still   loading...&quot; is displayed).   </pre>
