<title>Issue 32938 -   chromium -    Valgrind for chromeos is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The valgrind chromeos bots are broken      They fail with 15:35:13 memcheck_analyze.py [ERROR] FAIL! Couldn't parse   Valgrind output file    example:   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20UI%20(va">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20OS%20UI%20(va</a>  lgrind)(1)/builds/980/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio    We need to fix this before we put it back on the main page.     I could not find anything that changed that could have caused that.       </pre>
