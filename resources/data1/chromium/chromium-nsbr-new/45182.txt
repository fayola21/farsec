<title>Issue 45182 -   chromium -    Safe Browsing does not work in Chrome OS 408.4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using Chrome OS 42.4 with Chrome @ 408.4... not anything released  but I   don't have an easy way to do a regression hunt to see if prior releases are   affected.    [x] Enable phishing and malware protection is enabled in Options &gt; Under   the Hood.    Visit www.ianfette.org    EXPECTED: SafeBrowsing interstitial warning    ACTUAL: No warning    It seems like safebrowsing is not active at all. I could not find a related   bug in this or the chromium-os issue tracker.   </pre>
