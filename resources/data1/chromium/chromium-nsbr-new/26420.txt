<title>Issue 26420 -   chromium -    The popup blocker should block (javascript?) alerts that appear on 'onunload' (means closing of tab) time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    Other browsers tested: IE 8: FAIL      1. Go to a page (or create one) that displays an alert at the 'onunload'   event.  2. Try to close the page  3. You get annoyed by a stupid alert  most of the time asking if you really   want to leave the page      To block them  just like popups      they are shown </pre>
