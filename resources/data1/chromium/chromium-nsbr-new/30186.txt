<title>Issue 30186 -   chromium -    Allow extensions to prevent more event defaults - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13891">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13891</a>.    Extension developers should be able to prevent e.g. ctrl+w from closing the   current window.  If you want to implement a rich-text editor  you may want   ctrl+r to right justify  not reload  and ctrl+w might delete a word  not   close the window.     </pre>
