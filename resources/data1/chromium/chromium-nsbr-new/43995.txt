<title>Issue 43995 -   chromium -    Chrome is too aggressive in focusing page menu on Alt key release - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using a ToT Chrome OS build this morning:    1. Click in a Chrome window's omnibox to move the cursor there.  2. Hold Alt.  3. Hit Tab to cycle through all of the windows until you end up at the one   that you started at.  4. Release Alt.    After step 3  while the Alt key is still held  the cursor is still located   in the omnibox.  After step 4  the focus gets moved from the omnibox to the   page settings menu.    I think that this is caused by <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=43216">r43216</a>.  Chrome sees the initial Alt key   press  the window manager sees the Alt-Tab events (since it has those keys   grabbed)  and then Chrome sees the Alt key release and activates the menu.    Chrome needs to do more to avoid misinterpreting these key releases.  Dave   and I talked about this.  We think that Linux Views should only focus the   page menu if the Chrome window sees both an Alt key press and an Alt key   release  with no activation changes or other Chrome-level accelerators   between the two. </pre>
