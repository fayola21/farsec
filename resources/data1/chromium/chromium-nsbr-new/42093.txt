<title>Issue 42093 -   chromium -    Accelerated Mac plugins animate location change on tab switch from NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> STR:  1. Make sure the bookmark bar is hidden by default  2. Open a page with a CA plugin (e.g.  a Unity sample) in one tab  3. Open a NTP in the other tab  4. Switch back and forth between tabs    Because the content area is shifted down on the NTP by the floating bookmark bar  the layer with   the plugins gets adjusted. The plugin visibly animates up the page to its correct position from a   position that's offset down by the bookmark height. It should immediately have the right location    (or at least not animate). </pre>
