<title>Issue 41729 -   chromium -    &lt;select&gt; rendering difference Linux/Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.376.0 (44312)    A &lt;select&gt; menu with height:20px is rendered a bit different in Linux than   it is in Windows. In Linux 18px are used for the actual menu  with a 1px   grey border. In Windows 20px are used for the menu with no border. This is   both with border:0px.    This isn't really noticeable until you try to pixel perfect an &lt;input   type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; field next to it on a dark background which &quot;eats&quot; the 1px grey   border. Two html files attached plus screenshots. I first noticed this in an   extension popup.    Firefox in Linux renders it like to Chrome in Windows. </pre>
