<title>Issue 31348 -   chromium -    Silverlight: Mouse-drag tracking doesn't always work correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When dragging the volume slider in Netflix instant-play  the slider sometimes doesn't move  and   sometimes continues to move after the mouse button is up. My guess is that something about the   event order that causes Silverlight to get confused about the mouse button state (possibly the race   condition in carbon calls vs mouse events that I was looking at earlier).    It would be good if we could find a test-case for this that doesn't require a Netflix account and   user-agent tweaking  since it probably affects Silverlight in general. </pre>
