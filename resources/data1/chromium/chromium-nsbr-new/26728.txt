<title>Issue 26728 -   chromium -    need command line switch to force new window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> currently `google-chrome url` will open the url as a new tab in an already-  open chrome window  if one exists. This is particularly confusing if the   window is on another virtual desktop. We should have a switch to force a new   window.    John Spiegel has volunteered. </pre>
