<title>Issue 34359 -   chromium -    Preferences file isn't very user-friendly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium's Preferences file could be a little more user-friendly.  Chromium   does a few things that make it difficult for users to edit configuration by   hand.  Here are a few examples:    1) It writes data to the file that aren't actually user preferences  such   as the huge list of tips at ntp:tips_cache:tips.  If this application data   is removed  Chromium adds it again.  Likewise for the keys   profile:exited_cleanly  extensions:autoupdate:last_check  and   extensions:autoupdate:next_check.  Having such application data in the   Preferences file makes it hard for users to edit it and awkward to keep in   version control.  Ideally  the Preferences file would only be modified when   the user changes a preference.    2) Suppose the user tries to store the Preferences somewhere else and   symlinks to it.  Chromium will read the data correctly  but when it   rewrites the file  it deletes the symbolic link instead of rewriting the   target of the symlink.    3) Chromium does not seem to have a system-wide Preferences file.  From the   standpoint of system administration  it would be great to have an   /etc/chromium/Preferences file that would set the defaults for all users. </pre>
