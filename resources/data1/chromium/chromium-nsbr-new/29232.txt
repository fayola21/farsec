<title>Issue 29232 -   chromium -    &quot;Email Page Location&quot; menu command is unimplemented - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Mac version of Chrome has a File &gt; Email Page Location command. It's disabled  and apparently   unimplemented.    I couldn't find any bug report covering this  so I'm filing one. I'm looking for some easy Mac stuff to   do  so I could take this on. </pre>
