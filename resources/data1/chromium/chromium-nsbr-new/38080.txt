<title>Issue 38080 -   chromium -    Chrome sends malformed queries to LinkDoctor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Google Chrome 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)    In case of navigational error (HTTP 404  DNS or connection error) Chrome   sends the request to LinkDoctor server for the error page and includes the   failed url to it. To avoid privacy issues the CGI parameters are stripped   from the url  but the question mark should be left at the end of url to   notify LinkDoctor that the url has been truncated.    Currently Chrome strips the query parameters and does not keep the question   mark at the end of the url.    The patch fixing this issue is attached. </pre>
