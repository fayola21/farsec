<title>Issue 42324 -   chromium -    suggestion popup menu does not move together with its input text element. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://ponderer.org/tests/inputsize.html">http://ponderer.org/tests/inputsize.html</a>      1. Type &quot;abc&quot; and press enter.  2. Type &quot;a&quot;  suggestions popup should appear.  3. Move with your mouse chrome window across the screen (or similarly type   Ctrl+ to zoomin).      Suggestions popup should move along its parent input element.      It's frozen at the same location on the screen. In case the chrome window   was moved  it can even stay outside of the chrome window.   </pre>
