<title>Issue 42082 -   chromium -    copy+paste of url is broken in X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.376.0 (Developer Build 44292) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : www.google.dk/  Other browsers tested: Firefox  Konqueror.      1. Highlight the url in the omni box (drag from one end to the other)  2. Paste with middle click in another application.    I'd expect the url &quot;<a href="http://www.google.dk/">http://www.google.dk/</a>&quot; to be pasted  but in stead I get   the part of the url after the protocol &quot;www.google.dk/&quot;  this is pretty   useless as the pasted string doesn't get linkified in any application.    Please always show the full url when the user does anything at all with the   omnibox  that way copy+paste will continue to work as in all other   browsers.   </pre>
