<title>Issue 44480 -   chromium -    Allow content settings changes in incognito  but forget them on leaving - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We initially persisted user changes to content settings past the end of   their incognito section.  People felt uncomfortable with this  but simply   forgetting changes on exit also caused problems  in that the prefs window   would display a mix of the incognito and non-incognito changes and it was   extremely unclear what would happen on making changes.  So we grayed out   the options to toggle these from the content settings bubbles  and then   made edits in the prefs window persistent.    I think a better fix here would be to allow changes from the content   settings bubbles and the pref window  but any exceptions added during   incognito mode (from either source) would be presented differently in the   table  either in italics or a separate section of the table (or both).    Then we could delete these on exiting incognito and it would not be so odd.    (I need to check what we currently do with geolocation infobar actions in   incognito.) </pre>
