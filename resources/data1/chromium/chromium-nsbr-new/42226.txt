<title>Issue 42226 -   chromium -    Delete  backspace  and arrows are sent to a &lt;select&gt; popup even once dismissed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Can��_��_��_t tab away from &lt;select&gt; pop-ups that have been opened  breaks other content keys like backspace  arrows  back/forwa..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41390"> Bug 41390 </a> follow-up.  The fix for <a title="Can��_��_��_t tab away from &lt;select&gt; pop-ups that have been opened  breaks other content keys like backspace  arrows  back/forwa..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41390"> bug 41390 </a> is incomplete on the trunk.    Steps to reproduce:    1. Go to a page with &lt;select&gt; popups and text fields.  2. Use a &lt;select&gt; popup.  Make a choice.  Close it.  3. Focus a text field.  4. Enter some text.  Try to use the delete  backspace  and arrow keys.    Expect: Once the pop-up is not focused  the keys behave appropriately for their context.    Observe: The keys have no effect.  They��_��_��_re being sent to the closed and defocused popup.    Note that if you use the up and down arrow keys  you will cycle through the available selections   in the popup  indicating that the keys are being sent to the popup.    You don��_��_��_t actually need to be in a text entry field to experience this problem.  Using the arrow   keys when the page as a whole has focus is supposed to scroll the page  but it doesn��_��_��_t.  Using the   backspace key when the page as a whole has focus is supposed to go back in history  but it   doesn��_��_��_t.    I see this bug on the trunk at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45196">r45196</a> and verified it��_��_��_s still present at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45209">r45209</a>.  pinkerton saw it it   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45187">r45187</a>.  These are all after <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45154">r45154</a>  when WebKit DEPS were rolled past <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=57891">r57891</a> to pick up the fix   for <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37721">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37721</a>.    I don��_��_��_t see this bug on the 375 branch at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45188">r45188</a>  which is after what I thought was the   equivalent fix landed at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44989">r44989</a>. </pre>
