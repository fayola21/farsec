<title>Issue 46154 -   chromium -    Automatically notify developers if their CL brakes the memory waterfall - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We can copy the &quot;main waterfall&quot; functionality  we just don't need to close the tree if bots go red.    As Marc-Antoine said   &quot;Yes  it just needs a MailNotifier in chromium.master.memory/master.cfg.&quot;    I'll try to implement. </pre>
