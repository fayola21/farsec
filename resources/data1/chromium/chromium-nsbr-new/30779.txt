<title>Issue 30779 -   chromium -    Bookmark menu disappears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a new bug to track the new issue detailed in now-closed <a title="Rightclick - options does not work correctly" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8764"> bug #8764 </a>. I have not been able   to reproduce this myself but may need to try with a different environment.      1.Create a bookmark folder in the main bookmark-menu.  2. Create some folders in this folder  3. If you open your folder  the sub-menu appears  4. Rightklick on one folder  weather name or folder works BUT:  5. Try to rightklick another folder afterwards (maybe I want to rename more than one)  6. And: Tada: The menu disappears without doing anything    What is the expected output?   The Menu should remain open.    What do you see instead?  You have always to reopen your main folder again  for renaming    Note:   Same problem  same issue on normal bookmarks (just names  no folders)  within a folder    More notes from user on bug:  It is a main chrome problem. So every version till now had this behaviour  on PC.  I think  test it on Linux and Mac too  for sure it is a main problem caused through   some forgotten lines in your code. (Mark Icon only instead of both &quot;Text and Icon&quot;).     I forgot to mention  that the behaviour of the bookmark menu when loading tabs  the   problem mentioned in comment 4 before is always there (that the menu disappears after   second click) - and especially without no click when loading tabs. Because every tab   has its own process  your global-bookmark-menu has conflicts when beeing loaded or   included into every tab  it must be something like this.         </pre>
