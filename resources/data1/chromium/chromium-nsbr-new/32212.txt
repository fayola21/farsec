<title>Issue 32212 -   chromium -    Select and open links in tabs from  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;any&gt;    Google Chrome/Chromium lacks a feature which my wife and I sorely miss.   From the Manage Bookmarks screen we wish to be able to select a few links   right click and open the selected links in tabs.  To reiterate  we're  requesting an &quot;Open in Tabs&quot; or &quot;Open all in Tabs&quot; item in the right click  context menu when one or more bookmarks are selected in the Bookmarks  Manager.  Thank you for your consideration.    Don Crowder </pre>
