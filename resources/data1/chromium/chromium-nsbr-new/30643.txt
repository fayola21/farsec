<title>Issue 30643 -   chromium -    Text input in Flash isn't working (10.1 alpha) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.273.0 (34783)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ?      1. Open any Flash-based game or chat  2. Type in the text box      What is the expected result? Text appears in the box as you type      What happens instead? Nothing. No text is entered.    I play several Flash-based games and have been having this problem for a   little over a week  around the time that the right click crash was fixed  so   I'm assuming this has something to do with the workaround that was   implemented. The cursor blinks in the text box  but the plugin seems to be   ignoring key presses. This is a crucial function for chatting live in-game   and sending messages to other players.   </pre>
