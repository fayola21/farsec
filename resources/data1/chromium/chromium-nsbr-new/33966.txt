<title>Issue 33966 -   chromium -    Chrome console keywords for selected element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> One of the most useful features of the developer tools menu is the ability to   inspect an HTML element  selecting it in the DOM tree panel and looking at   its Javascript and style properties  etc. But it would be nice if this   features could interact with the Javascript console below. Specifically  it   would be extremely useful to be able to select an element in the DOM tree   tool and then reference it with some special keyword in the console  like   'Chrome.selectedElement' or somesuch. </pre>
