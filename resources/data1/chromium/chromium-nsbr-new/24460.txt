<title>Issue 24460 -   chromium -    Instrument -sendAction:to:from: to help track down msg-after-free bugs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [I spent a little time prototyping  posting to provoke buy-in.]    We have many stack traces with essentially no information because they are Cocoa functions   terminating in isendAction:to:from: to a potentially-free object.  Example:    http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=6780bf8640af6720    Now that we intercept that function  we could register some keys with Breakpad to report:   - actual class of sender (usually stack has NSControl).   - action being sent.   - sender's tag  if appropriate (-commandDispatch:).    I think in many cases the action and tag would provide immediate triangulation on what control   was sending the message  which would in turn probably make it clear what the freed target had   been.    If this doesn't flush everything out  we could also consider additional tidbits  like:   - sender's title  if appropriate.   - sender's window's title  if appropriate.   - information derived from inspection of the target internals (even a freed object may leave useful   info to extract).   </pre>
