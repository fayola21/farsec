<title>Issue 45451 -   chromium -    Images blurry when zooming using CSS3 Transform Scale - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     1. Visit <a href="http://www.dominicpettifer.co.uk/Files/Mosaic/MosaicTest.html">http://www.dominicpettifer.co.uk/Files/Mosaic/MosaicTest.html</a>  using the latest Opera  Firefox or Safari (not Chrome yet)  use your mouse  wheel to zoom into the Mosaic to an individual tile. Notice the image is  resonably clear/sharp. (Note: my zoom implementation is a bit buggy and may  jump about a bit  sorry about that  but it should be good enough to  demonstrate the bug in Chrome).    2. Try the same thing with Google Chrome  notice that the image is  incredibly blurry        Images should be sharp and detailed.        Images are blurry.    Please provide
