<title>Issue 41549 -   chromium -    The Security Information dialog of a page should display the certificate errors. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Certificate errors used to be displayed in a tooltip when you hovered  above the triangular warning icon in the location bar.    In M5  the tooltips from the warning icons were eliminated.  Now there  is no way to get the certificate errors.    After discussing with pkasting  we think the certificate errors should  be displayed in the Identity section of the Security Information dialog.     </pre>
