<title>Issue 31907 -   chromium -    Cannot navigate to &quot;about:&quot; URLs from History - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open &quot;about:credits&quot; (or any other &quot;about:&quot; URL)  2. Open the History (Wrench -&gt; History  or Ctrl+H)  3. Click &quot;Credits&quot; (or the name of the &quot;about:&quot; page you were on)      The page associated with the clicked title should be opened  but instead   &quot;about:blank&quot; is opened.    Observed on Ubuntu 9.10    I suspect this is related to <a title="Reopened tabs with &quot;about:&quot; URLs do not display properly" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31905"> issue 31905 </a> and <a title="Reopening a &quot;view-source:&lt;url&gt;&quot; tab opens a tab for &lt;url&gt;" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31906"> issue 31906 </a> </pre>
