<title>Issue 41464 -   chromium -    drag drop to bookmarks bar doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Grab a link on a web page and drag it to the bookmarks bar. It gets the drag handle  but doesn't go   in the bookmarks bar when you drop. This is particularly painful for bookmarklets since you can't   just navigate to them and then star the page like you can with regular links.    Tested on 5.0.375.6 (Official Build 44316) dev on Mac. I assume this is Mac only  but leaving it   general since I haven't tested elsewhere. </pre>
