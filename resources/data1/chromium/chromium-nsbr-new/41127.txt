<title>Issue 41127 -   chromium -    Extension API docs should point out differences between channels - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   We have docs pages for dev  beta  and stable:    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/${CHANEL}/pageAction.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/${CHANEL}/pageAction.html</a>    but there i no standard way to warn that a function exists in the dev but not the stable channel.  A   developer who is testing on the dev channel may waste time trying to figure out why an extension   doesn't work for stable users.        A new key in extension_api.json that denotes the first version the function will appear in could   generate a message in the docs that says &quot;new in version X&quot;.  This message will not be generated   once X is less than the current stable version. </pre>
