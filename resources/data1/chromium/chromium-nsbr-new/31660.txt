<title>Issue 31660 -   chromium -    Can't install extension until load event fires - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the extension gallery  you don't seem to be able to click the install  button until the load event fires.  If the page takes a long time to load  (or never finishes loading)  the user experience sucks because the user  can't actually install the extension. </pre>
