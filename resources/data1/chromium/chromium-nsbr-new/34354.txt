<title>Issue 34354 -   chromium -    Nice to have : Logo in the tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello   Some use a very simple methode to get passwords  they simply send a fake  URL of a fake website (only one page will be necessary).  Let's take the facebook exemple somebody send you this  http.www.facebbook.com/34O5/_krn3 and write a message ; it's realy funny or  hot or something like this. Almost of other people will not see the  difference    In this page you find a login and password space  this page will only get  the information et will give a blank.  I think that you can use a variable witch contain the offcial website's  logo and it will be cripted:  If this variable will be true so put the logo in the tab  Else put a warning in the tab.  It will make users sure that they are surfing the real web site.  Best regards. </pre>
