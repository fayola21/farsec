<title>Issue 25921 -   chromium -    www.cnn.com blank above the fold - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to www.cnn.com  2. See blankness  3. Scroll down to see content.    Resizing the window does not directly bring the content back  but it does allow you to see more or   less content when you scroll down.  Only the topmost screenful of the web content is blanked out.    Works in Safari and IE  doesn't work in Firefox and Chrome (all platforms).  There appears to be a   flash overlay  so maybe we are screwing up plugin drawing somehow?    The problem might also be on their end  but filing anyways because this is a big site. </pre>
