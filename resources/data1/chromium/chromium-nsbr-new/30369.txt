<title>Issue 30369 -   chromium -    Google Earth Building Maker does not work in Chrome on Windows 7 64-bit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Browse to <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html">http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html</a>  2. Press button labeled &quot;Try Building Maker.&quot;  3. Zoom into a single building e.g. Hanger One  Moffett Field. Select this   building.  4. Add a new block.  5. Mouse over a vertex of the block.    Expected: as mouse passes over vertex  the vertex is highlighted with a   circle. Clicking on the highlighted vertex allows the user to reposition   the vertex.    Actual: as mouse passes over vertex  cursor changes briefly to a crosshair    but no other UI changes take place.    Additional info: Windows 7 RTM build  64-bit. For additional machine info   contact me (ilewis@google.com)  Tried the same steps in Internet Explorer 8 64-bit and was successful.   </pre>
