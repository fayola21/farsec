<title>Issue 42175 -   chromium -    [Request] Introduce a new switch like '--disable-http-stripping' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hey guys  please don't take it granted that exporting characters in the   omnibox is all the cases you have to deal with after http:// has been   castrated. People may not be ready to act with this change for various   reasons you haven't considered.    For example  when I find myself not using a secure connection in   gmail/greader  if I need https  I have to leave the mouse which is being   holded by my right hand to hit H-T-T-P-S-SHIFT-;-/-/ keys then enter. But   in older builds which still have http:// I just click the gap between 'p'   and ':' then input S and enter without leaving the mouse.    Especially in China  many google services and other sites are blocked  I   often use this method to try whether it can be accessed via secure   connection. I will absolutely be tired of making such keystrokes every time   I want to go https if http:// disappears. </pre>
