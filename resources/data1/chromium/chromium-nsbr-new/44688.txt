<title>Issue 44688 -   chromium -    WebKit cache no longer cleared correctly when using benchmarking extension and --single-process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It appears that active references to the resources in WebKit's cache  prevent the cache being entirely cleared between benchmarking runs. This is  only a problem in --single-process mode  because in that case the same  WebKit instance is behind each run even though the extension creates a new  tab each time. This isn't high priority but it would be good for us to  figure out a way to fix this some time. </pre>
