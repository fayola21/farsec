<title>Issue 23364 -   chromium -    Chrome does not fall back to IPv4 when using IPv6 fails with Webpage Not Available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.212.1  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK      1. Visit a URL whose host has a broken IPv6 address from a machine with   working IPv6  e.g. <a href="http://www.sofaraway.org/ubuntu/tmp/chromium-">http://www.sofaraway.org/ubuntu/tmp/chromium-</a>  popcon-8.png (as of this writing)  2. Wait a while while the IPv6 fails to connect  3. Notice that it does not fail over to IPv4  instead the &quot;webpage not   available&quot; page shows        Chrome should fall back to the working IPv4 address after a timeout trying   to use IPv6.        It fails and displays the &quot;webpage not available&quot; page. </pre>
