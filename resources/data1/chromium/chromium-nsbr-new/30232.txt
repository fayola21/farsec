<title>Issue 30232 -   chromium -    hang on first click after login to gmail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Login to Gmail  2. Click any mail Icon  3. Experience Lag        Same speed as after the first hang.      ok  my repro is this:    This happens in gmail after logging in the first time. Note  the login be   automatic   or via web form does not matter. Both result in the first click on any   trigger to   cause the &quot;Loading...&quot; to hang  and sometimes the &quot;Error: Some Gmail   features have   failed to load due to an Internet connectivity problem. If this problem   persists  try   reloading the page  using the older version  or using basic HTML mode.

I am on 4.0.270.0 (Ubuntu build 34426). But this repro's in both windows   and linux.            <b>Please provide
