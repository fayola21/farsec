<title>Issue 37611 -   chromium -    Chrome does not allow me to close a popup that was blocked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Visit any site that has a popup  2. Click on popup blocker icon in address  3. Click &quot;Close&quot; button      The popup should close without me having to have to acutally  open the popup and click the close window button.      I should be able to right-click the popup in the address bar and close it   or when I click the close button it should close the popup.  Suppose there is some Javascript in the popup that will cause problems?      <b>Please provide
