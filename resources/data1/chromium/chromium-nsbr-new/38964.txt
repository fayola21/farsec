<title>Issue 38964 -   chromium -    browser crash when browser action is removed and context menu is showing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. install a browser action  2. leave the browser action container big enough to show said action  3. right click on it  4. cause extension to go away while the context menu is showing (crash    disable  uninstall) --- to test this I made the task manager kill processes   5 seconds after you press kill process      context menu should close + browser action should vanish  instead  browser crashes       </pre>
