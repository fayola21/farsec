<title>Issue 31932 -   chromium -    Injected &lt;style&gt; tag breaks page rendering on Google Health - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :    Google Chrome	4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.16  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.43 Safari/532.5    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://health.google.com/health/p/">https://health.google.com/health/p/</a>      1. Install an extension which  at document_start  injects the following     tag as the first element in &lt;document&gt;:     &lt;style&gt;div[style=&quot;foo&quot;] { background:red; }&lt;/style&gt;  2. Open a new tab to the health.google.com URL above.        The page displays normally.          The page does not display the final &lt;table&gt;  which contains almost all of   the page's UI.    If you then use the Element Inspector to remove the &lt;style&gt; element  the   page renders correctly.    The [style=&quot;anything&quot;] part is the culprit.  Adding any of the below rules   instead  either leaves the page unaffected (because the selector matches 0   elements) or modifies the page as expected:    div { background: red; }    div[src=&quot;foo&quot;] { background: red; }    div { display:block; }  Furthermore  if you were to instead insert 2 or more &lt;style&gt; tags  where   one of them referred to div[style=&quot;foo&quot;]  then removing *any* of the style   tags would cause the page to render correctly.  It's as if the &lt;style&gt; tag   caused the page to stop rendering  but that a followup render would work   fine.    The AdBlock extension (chromeadblock.com) caused this problem as of version   1.2.65  but has since been updated to work around the problem.  I'm the   author  so let me know if it would be helpful to attach the .zip of 1.2.65. </pre>
