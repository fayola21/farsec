<title>Issue 37221 -   chromium -    Doubleclick on whitespace - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4-5            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Double click some white space on any site.      Nothing special. Maybe some of text ahead is selected.      All surrounding whitespace is selected  or even whole page text is   selected.    This is especially annoying in RIA applications that use doubleclick functionality regularly  like extjs apps.     </pre>
