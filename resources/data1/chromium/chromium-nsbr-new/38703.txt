<title>Issue 38703 -   chromium -    Outbound HTTP requests (POSTs) should use fewer packets when reasonable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current network stack does a separate call to DoSendHeaders() vs   DoSendBody().  I think this may result in placement of data for a post in a   separate TCP packet in all cases.  I think it would be a minor optimization   to coalesce these into fewer packets when possible.  This *might* be   significant for latency in small post (form submits).    There is a chance that the extra packet is actually a feature (i.e.  it   reduces latency).  There is a current test to see if splitting the first   packet (ensuring a second packet) on a cold-connection is helpful.  I've   referenced this bug in that CL  as it is related.  When we have warm   connections  the splitting of the header vs body is probably of no value (and   is a minor perf bug). </pre>
