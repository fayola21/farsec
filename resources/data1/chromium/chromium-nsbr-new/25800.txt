<title>Issue 25800 -   chromium -    Chrome does not update cache with newer/modified files  keeps the old files in cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29903)  WebKit	532.3  V8	1.3.16.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.3 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.223.11 Safari/532.3                 Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK      1. This is rather unclear now.    Description of the problem:    I'm working on a web application on my own machine  using Apache/2.0.63   (Win32) PHP/5.2.6.    (1) I recently edited some of the images that are used on the site. Now -   when I go to the site with Google Chrome  I get the old images. This is not   alarming by itself  but the following things are.    (2) I naturally do a refresh of the site  either with the refresh button    or just activating the address field and pressing enter. Now  with a reload   I get the new images like I should.     THE BUG: At this point I close the tab and do the whole thing again   starting at point (1) - I go to the site with Chrome. Now  I get the old   images again! This is the problem/bug. Seems like Chrome didn't update   cache  and the old files are still in the cache and Chrome shows them. If I   do a refresh  I get the new images like I should  but I can repeat this bug   indefinitely - I get the old images every time when I do an &quot;initial page   load&quot; in Chrome.    If I watch Apache's log  I see the following: On initial page load  there   is now requests for images. On subsequent page loads  there is  and the   server returns the images with the http code 200.     Summary:  I would expect Google Chrome to update its cache but it's not updating it.     </pre>
