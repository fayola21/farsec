<title>Issue 27639 -   chromium -    Add links to FFmpeg source code on license page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It's difficult to find exactly where our patched source code lives.  This is   an important requirement for projects such as FFmpeg such that we do not   appear to violate the LGPL.    A link to   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/ffmpeg/">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/ffmpeg/</a> from the   license page would be fine. </pre>
