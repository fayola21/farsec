I haven't been able to reproduce with different content   scripts  1. Go to a page that activates the content script.  2. Open the Developer Tools for that page.  3. Navigate away from the page (Back button  or clicking another link.      Tab goes to the next page  Developer Tools is updated for that page.      Developer Tools shows a (program) &lt;source is not available&gt; Paused (top   right status). The Call Stack reads &quot;link 185 /   chromeHidden.dispatchOnUnload&quot;.     Pressing the &quot;Play/Pause&quot; button quickly lets the new page load. If I wait   a while longer  the tab crashes with Aw  snap!    <b>Please provide
