<title>Issue 37997 -   chromium -    HTML Bookmark Manager should support copy when dragging inside same profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the html bookmark manager and navigate to a large list of bookmarks  2. Drag one of the bookmarks while holding the copy modifier (option on mac  control on windows)      This should add a + sign to the cursor  and allow you to copy the bookmark.  It doesn't work on any   platform  while windows always shows the + sign even when it's moving and not copying.      Here is the code review that fixed it for the macs native bookmark manager  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/790001/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/790001/show</a>  </pre>
