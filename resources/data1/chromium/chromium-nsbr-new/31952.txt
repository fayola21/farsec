<title>Issue 31952 -   chromium -    implement linkhelp/fixurl internally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/fixurl">http://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/fixurl</a>      1. visit page returning 404 code      show html code supplied by webserver in 404 response and offer google   search and google cache.      browser is redirected to   <a href="http://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/fixurl?{something...}">http://linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/fixurl?{something...}</a> where   error is handled. and data send by webserver in 404 response are lost.    OMG WHY? similar page can be implemented internally in javascript so why we   are making even more trafic to google? (even when i am not trying to reach   some google page). it's just kind of sneaking from my angle of view. please   don't be evil and give it away. </pre>
