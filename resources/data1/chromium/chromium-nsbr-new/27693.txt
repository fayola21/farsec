<title>Issue 27693 -   chromium -    NTP bookmark bar text bounces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some of these are noticeable only if you slow down the animations:  - timing for mid-flight animation changes (reversals) is incorrect  - &quot;For quick access...&quot; message doesn't animate correctly  - state changes on other tabs can cancel animations (causing them to snap to   their final state)  - hover states of buttons are incorrect on animation (they can stay &quot;stuck&quot; or   they can fail to appear) since the bar and its contents are moving under the   mouse    I'll take this  but I'll let it go through triage. </pre>
