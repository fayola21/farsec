<title>Issue 40094 -   chromium -    Invisible blinking cursor on address bar when GTK theme has set text default color to white. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  	Chromium	5.0.342.7 (Developer Build 0)  	WebKit		533.2  	V8		2.1.2.7    Is this the most recent version: ?  OS + version: Gentoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  Window manager: OpenBox  URLs (if relevant): Nah.  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Not tested  but isn't really relevant. But I   remember that FF didn't had this issue because it obeys GTK themes. Problem   here is rather that Chromium does obey GTK theme only in case of this   blinking cursor.  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Haven't tested   Chromium with GTK on Windows. ;)      1. Set GTK theme: backgrounds black  text white (I use Audacious default   theme as my GTK theme)  2. Run Chromium.  3. Click on address bar.  4. See no blinking cursor      I expect to see blinking cursor.      This cursor stays &quot;invisible&quot; (same color as address bar background color).   </pre>
