<title>Issue 28262 -   chromium -    tarball and install instructions don't match. [tarball has extra directories] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       After &quot;tar xvfz&quot; on the downloaded tarball  I expect 'gclient sync' to   only update some files.   But it Adds all files.    The tarball has extra directories: &quot;home/chrome-svn/tarball/chromium&quot; before   src.  Either that directory needs to be removed or the build instructions need to   be updated to say &quot;cd home/chrome-svn/tarball/chromium&quot; before the &quot;gclient   sync&quot;     </pre>
