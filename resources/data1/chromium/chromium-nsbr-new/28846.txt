<title>Issue 28846 -   chromium -    Downloads page provides no way to retrieve link after crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Start downloading a large file. Observe that it's visible at   chrome://downloads/  2. Cause the browser to crash (presumably quitting works too)  3. Return to chrome://downloads/ to try to retry the downloads that were   interrupted by the crash. Observe that the filename of &quot;canceled&quot;   downloads are not links to the original URL  and the URL is truncated so it   can't be copied.        The name of each file in chrome://downloads/ should be a link to the   original file  or the URL listed on this page should not be truncated so that   it can be copied.    (Even better  but presumably a separate bug  Chrome should support   Resumable downloads).        I can't find an obvious way to resume the downloads that were terminated   due to the browser crash other than finding all the files again.    <b>Please provide
