<title>Issue 27939 -   chromium -    UI feedback on RSS extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From Brian:    &quot;We spent some time on this today and identified a few items:  -use the font sizes from Reader preview (increase title font size)  -&quot;Add new...&quot; should be &quot;Manage...&quot; and should have a manager just like the search engine manager   (but in HTML)  -Remove the &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; links since this is now handled in the manager&quot; </pre>
