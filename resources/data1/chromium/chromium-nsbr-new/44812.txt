<title>Issue 44812 -   chromium -    Web site scrolling very slow while animation playing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 dev  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): also kinda slow  but much better than chrome  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Smooth  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Ok      1. Go to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/18/the-beauty-of-typography-writing-">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/18/the-beauty-of-typography-writing-</a>  systems-and-calligraphy-of-the-world/  2. Scroll to the animated yellow logo (about 40% down)  3. Wait for animation to start  5. Try to scroll        Smooth scrolling.        Incredibly janky scrolling (~0.1fps).      Doesn't happen in win/linux. Probably CoreGraphics related  but since it's faster in Safari  that   can't be the only cause. (Does someone know what Firefox uses? CG as well? Firefox is superfast   here.) </pre>
