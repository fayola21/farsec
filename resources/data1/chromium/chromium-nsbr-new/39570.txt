<title>Issue 39570 -   chromium -    Need to increase timeouts for worker tests under valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Worker tests are routinely timing out within valgrind  yielding spurious test failures.    Part of the problem is that the layout test timeout within ui_tests cannot be overridden via command   line flags  so any worker layout test that takes &gt; 60 secs will fail. </pre>
