<title>Issue 27687 -   chromium -    Downloads should go to a temp filename before renaming as the final filename - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.0 Mac OS X      1. Right click  and do Save As on a file.    It proceeds to start appending to a file by the name I selected (or the   default name). However  if chrome crashes or the download gets   interrupted  then I have a half-completed download.    And unfortunately after a crash  I'm not able to tell whether the   downloaded file is a completed file or a half-completed corrupted file.    I believe safari and firefox write out as a temporary file  and then rename   at the very end after the file has been transferred. This makes it very clear   that the file is a completed file.   </pre>
