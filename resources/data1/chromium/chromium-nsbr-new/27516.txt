<title>Issue 27516 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: Footer missing in camendesign.com only on Chrome 4.x - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> URL : <a href="http://camendesign.com">http://camendesign.com</a>    camendesign.com shows a footer under each article (that's the e-mail and  search box  not the category links--that's the header)  this footer is  visible in Firefox 3.5  Safari  Opera and Chrome 3.x    However  it does not appear in Chrome 4.x  it's hidden by a change in  calculation somewhere. Search the CSS for fixed-footer  and you'll see that  box-sizing is used to exclude the footer from the 100% height via padding  on the HTML element. </pre>
