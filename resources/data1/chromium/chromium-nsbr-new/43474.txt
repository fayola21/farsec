<title>Issue 43474 -   chromium -    ap key should never be deleted on install from Omaha - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps:  1. Set ap key to cf-test  2. Install chromeframe from google.com  3. Notice that while Chrome Frame is getting installed  the ap key value   changes from cf-test to cf-test-full  then changes to -full and finally gets   deleted on finishing the install.    Expected:  ap key should never be deleted. </pre>
