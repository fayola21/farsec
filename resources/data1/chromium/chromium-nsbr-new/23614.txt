<title>Issue 23614 -   chromium -    Toolstrip item doesn't show up after mole is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.0 (27823) WinXP    How the problem can be reproduced?  Our extension has a toolstrip which contains a DIV button.  When the button is clicked  the   extension uses chrome.toolstrip.expand to open a mole.  The mole contains some some DIVs    and the mole  acts as a menu. When one of the DIV menu items is clicked  a URL is loaded into   the main browser or a new window with a page in the extension is opened  and then the mole is   closed by calling chrome.toolstrip.collapse.  The problem is that the toolstrip button doesn't   show up after the mole is closed and it happens quite randomly.      The mole is closed and the the toolstrip button becomes visible again.      Sometimes  the toolstrip button doesn't show up after the mole is closed.     </pre>
