<title>Issue 23443 -   chromium -    Middle-click should remove item from download bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Notice:  I'm creating a duplicate issue for this because the previous one was   prematurely labeled as &quot;WontFix&quot;. See <a title="Middle-click should remove item from download bar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18810"> issue 18810 </a>. Original content follows:    Recently  a feature was added to remove items from the download bar (Not   remove them from the filesystem). To maintain consistency with tabs  I   request that middle-clicking an item on the download bar should be the same   as clicking the &quot;Remove from list&quot; option. </pre>
