<title>Issue 46178 -   chromium -    &quot;Restart and update&quot; should persist session cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From my reading of 27941  it looks like clicking &quot;restart and update&quot; through Chrome is supposed to persist your session. That wasn't the case for me--it looked like Chrome threw away all the session cookies  so I had to login to Gmail  etc again. </pre>
