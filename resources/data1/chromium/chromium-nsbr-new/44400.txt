<title>Issue 44400 -   chromium -    iframe contentDocument is undefined when page loaded locally  but OK (HTMLDocument) on the internet - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://aurelio.net/chrome-bug/foo.html">http://aurelio.net/chrome-bug/foo.html</a>         Safari 4: OK    This page foo.html is a simple test I've made to isolate the problem. When you load it from the   Internet  everything works fine and the contentDocument property of the iframe contains an   HTMLDocument.    If you download foo.html and foo.txt from that URL and open foo.html in Chrome    contentDocument is undefined. Plus  I've got this Warning:    Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL file://localhost/a/www/chrome-bug/foo.txt   from frame with URL file://localhost/a/www/chrome-bug/foo.html. Domains  protocols and   ports must match.    (See screenshots in attachments)    My guess is that Chrome is doing some mistake when comparing files location when the protocol   is file:  raising the warning and not filling contentDocument.    Funny thing is that the frame contents show up fine in Elements inspector.    It used to work in previous Chrome versions (4.x I think). </pre>
