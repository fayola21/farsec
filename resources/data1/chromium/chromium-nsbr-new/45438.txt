Browse to any URL (e.g. <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>)  2. Try to write a character with an accent using the alt-option key (e.g. for &quot;��_��_&quot;  alt-e  then e)  3. Google Chrome will ignore the accent combination and type the character without the accent   (e.g. it will ignore alt-e and write only &quot;e&quot;). If we type the accent combination twice and then the   character we will obtain the desired result (e.g. alt-e  alt-e  then e).  4. Any other character with accent written in pages of that domain will be shown normally after   this initial glitch.      Google Chrome should process the first accent combination normally.      Google Chrome ignores the first accent combination typed.        Please provide
