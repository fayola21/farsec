<title>Issue 45502 -   chromium -    Cannot join chromium extensions group as Google Apps-hosted email account. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : N/A      1. As user who has a Google-Apps-hosted domain email address try to join   the new chromium extensions group   (<a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions</a>).   2. You will go to Chromium login page(?)   (<a href="https://www.google.com/a/chromium.org/ServiceLogin2?">https://www.google.com/a/chromium.org/ServiceLogin2?</a>  continue=<a href="http://groups.google.com/a/..etc......">http://groups.google.com/a/..etc......</a>) As you don't have a   chromium.org account you should try to use the section below that says:   &quot;Don't have a Chromium account? Enter your email address to access the   document&quot;.  3. Enter your email address &lt;you&gt;@&lt;your-google-apps-hosted.domain&gt;      Login  and probably redirection back to the chromium extensions group.      The page gives the message below:  &quot;Google Apps - Bad request&quot;  &quot;Bad request&quot;  &quot;Unknown service name: groups2&quot;     </pre>
