<title>Issue 30941 -   chromium -    gmail scrolls up as soon as I stop scrolling down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     I can't reliably reproduce this issue  but after using my personal gmail   for most of a day  it started scrolling up automatically any time I started   to scroll down. When I used PageDown  the down arrow key  and the scroll   wheel on my mouse  the page started scrolling back up slowly  at about the   rate it does when I hold the up-key down.          The page should stay fixed at the position I scrolled to.          Instead  it starts scrolling up as soon as I stop scrolling down.      <b>Please provide
