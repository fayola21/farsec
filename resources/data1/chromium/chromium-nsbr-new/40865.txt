<title>Issue 40865 -   chromium -    Closed  because you can't stop talking about removing http. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is my attempt to summarize today's meeting.  Please correct me if I   have things wrong.    The following changes are in the pipeline already  but have not yet landed:  * Removing &quot;http:// from steady-state display  * Final tweaks to toolbar colors (to make things grey)/shapes/whatever    The following changes will now also happen per mutual agreement:  * https scheme coloring: mixed-content goes from blue -&gt; grey  normal https   goes from blue -&gt; green  * SSL icon modifications: mixed-content goes from blue-with-triangle -&gt;   grey &quot;ghost lock&quot;  normal https goes from blue -&gt; green (not clear to me   whether the normal and EV locks are the same)  * SSL label moves: the EV and &quot;broken https&quot; labels move from the right   side of the URL to the left  between the lock and the URL (need a UI   treatment of exactly how to separate this section from the URL  or if we   just use padding)    The following further changes are possible if after landing all of the   above  we still deem the UI deficient:  * Change EV and normal https from green-icon-and-text-on-white to a green   background (like Fx 3.x); change broken https from red-on-white to a red   background  * Modify coloring/treatment of the hostname    *******    I can begin implementing this stuff for Windows immediately; completing   that will require the new SSL icons and perhaps some graphics or UI design   on the treatment of the label area. </pre>
