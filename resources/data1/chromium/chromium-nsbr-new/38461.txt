<title>Issue 38461 -   chromium -    URL overlaps  content settings blocked icons and gives redirect loop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Goto any Application like gmail or google docs  2.From Wrench menu -&gt; options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Privacy Content settings  3.In Cookies dialog box select Ask me when a site tries to set data close  content settings  4.Try logging into gmail or google docs now   5. We see cookie dialog box   6. Enable the 1st cookie   7. Block the 2nd  cookie.  8. Enable the 3rd cookie.    What is the expected output?  The application must work fine    What do you see instead?  The application (gmail/google docs) gets into an infinite loop  even if we  enable cookies  it doesnt come out of the loop and we see a blank page.  It doesnt prompt user to allow /block cookies also      **Attached screenshot of google docs page   </pre>
