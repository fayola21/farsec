<title>Issue 43316 -   chromium -    Web Fonts appear to render smaller / different than in any other browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 Beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://konstantin-grcic.com/">http://konstantin-grcic.com/</a>  OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.3        The web font on the above website should appear more or less at the same size and letter spacing   across all browsers.        the texts rendered using web fonts appear at the same size on both Safari and Firefox  but noticeably   smaller on Google Chrome. At the same time  the spacing seems wieder on Chrome than on the other   two. So it appears that Google Chrome is currently misinterpreting a few things when rendering web   fonts. The difference between Safari and Firefox are very subtle on and probably only due to differences   in the way kerning is handled.    Refer to the attached screenshots to see examples of Safari  Firefox  Chrome  and the difference Safari-  Firefox and Safari-Chrome.       </pre>
