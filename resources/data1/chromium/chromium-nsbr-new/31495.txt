<title>Issue 31495 -   chromium -    Extensions Feature Request: Enable Purge Memory Function From Extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)    Sometimes having too many Extensions creates memory to increase  and using the new feature to purge the   memory is really helpful.    I was trying to create an extension that would automatically use the   Purge Memory function  and Purge the memory every (specified amount of   time). I asked on the Chromium-extensions Group  but apparently there is not a way to do so.    Could it be possible to enable a feature for Chrome Extensions to do this  it might be helpful to even   enable extension specific feature  so that a developer notices that the memory of an extension continues   to increase  then it would purge the memory of it's extension every given amount time.    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/af5a08f507eae6">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/af5a08f507eae6</a> </pre>
