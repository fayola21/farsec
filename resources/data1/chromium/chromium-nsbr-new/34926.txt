<title>Issue 34926 -   chromium -    Mac startup perf regression - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Mac startup regressed recently.  The regression is triggering the   expectations system to warn us the results are slowing down.    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/mac-release-</a>  10.5/startup/report.html?history=300&amp;rev=-1&amp;trace=t&amp;trace=t_ref    willchan's <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38052">r38052</a> could have something to do with the regression.  Perf is   getting worse  though  which makes me believe something else is wrong in   the build or on the system.  It might be a concert of regression due to   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38052">r38052</a> and those other factors.    Will  do you think <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38052">r38052</a> may have regressed startup on Mac?    (There's been no startup regressions lately on Linux or Win  which doesn't   jibe with the theory that <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38052">r38052</a> regressed startup somehow.) </pre>
