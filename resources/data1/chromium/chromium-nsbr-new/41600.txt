<title>Issue 41600 -   chromium -    Incredible big outbound traffic on every session start to google docs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.376.0  URLs (if applicable) : docs.google.com  Other browsers tested: No    There is a problem with networking just after starting Chromium session         1. Just start chromium  2. And try to see what is going on outbound network connection:  3. There are numerous packets Chromium sends to docs.google.com (for me it   is about 120MiB every session start)    I think this is very disappointing issue with syncing profile data with   Google docs  I understand that I can disable syncing  but if it is enabled   than it eats up all cpu and wifi card resources for me  wasting outbound   traffic on unlimited approach  spending for this operation about 5-10   minutes.         I expect a behavior that it was before google docs updated - all syncs was   incremental I suppose  those were small and overall sync procedure was very   fast. Also I expect some kind of network QoS when use outbound sync - using   all available bandwidth for sync makes my network unusable for me   (currently 10MiB/s).    I have tryed to remove a directory with data to Sync  but it seems that it   does not help - Chromium try to send all data anyway.   </pre>
