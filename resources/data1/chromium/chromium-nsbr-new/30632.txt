<title>Issue 30632 -   chromium -    PluginProcessHost leaking in NPAPITester.* under Mac valgrind - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As soon as the NPAPITester tests were turned on for the Mac  they started showing a bunch of leaks   scattered across the tests  which all boil down to leaks under one of the following two lines in   plugin_service.cc:  168    plugin_host = new PluginProcessHost();  169    if (!plugin_host-&gt;Init(info  ui_locale_)) {  (directly in new on 168  and inside Init on 169)    So it looks like we are leaking PluginProcessHost instances in some cases. (Note that these tests   don't run on Linux yet  so we don't know if they would leak there or not.) </pre>
