<title>Issue 28721 -   chromium -    popups UI doesn't reload on page reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.popuptest.com/">http://www.popuptest.com/</a>  2. Click on &quot;Multi-PopUp Test #2&quot; link  3. Close the popup UI on bottom right corner of page  4. Click on the back button  5. Click on the same link in step 2    What is the expected output?   Not sure what should be the expected behavior here.     If the popup UI is closed  when you visit the page again (in same tab)  the   popup UI doesn't show up again    If you don't close the popup UI  then when you reload the page  the popups   are created and the count is just increased.       </pre>
