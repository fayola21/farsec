<title>Issue 36814 -   chromium -    Close  Minimize and Zoom Show as Active while Mousing over Bookmark Buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chrome.  2. Have some bookmarks of any kind in the bookmarks bar.  3. Move the mouse over the bookmarks.    What is the expected output?  - The state of the window's close  minimize and zoom controls should not change.    What do you see instead?  - The window's close  minimize and zoom controls show as active (i.e. with a X ��_��_��_ + shown over the   buttons).   </pre>
