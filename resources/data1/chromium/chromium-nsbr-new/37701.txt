<title>Issue 37701 -   chromium -    GPU and Core Animation plugins stop rendering when you open a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - build the Pepper test plugin  - run Chromium with the following command line (from src/xcodebuild):    Debug/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --no-sandbox --internal-pepper --enable-  gpu-plugin -load-plugin=Debug/PepperTestPlugin.plugin [path to source   tree]/src/webkit/tools/pepper_test_plugin/test_page.html    - Once you see the pepper plug-in rendering  open a new tab  - switch back to the original tab    Expected:    - pepper plug-in should still be rendering    Actual:    - blank space where plug-in used to be. It's still chewing up CPU  just no longer drawing.    This same issue affects the CoreAnimation plug-in drawing model code I'm working on  so I   imagine it's related to the CALayer created in the browser to host/render the CGLContext. </pre>
