<title>Issue 43638 -   chromium -    &quot;This page is tracking your location&quot; popup cannot be copied - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.29 (Official Build   46008) beta  Is this the most recent version: Yes      1. Open a page that tracks locations (such as an igoogle widget)  2. Click the cute little icon in the omnibox  3. Try to copy text (such as the url)    You can't copy and it's really annoying if i want the superlong url for   example. Untested on windows/mac so not sure if this is a bug or a feature   request. </pre>
