<title>Issue 27840 -   chromium -    Pack Extension feature should ignore .svn directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  4.0.245.0 (Official Build 31763)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.6      1. Checkout a working copy of an extension from a Subversion server.  2. Select Pack Extension... and pick the working copy directory.      The crx should not include dot files or hidden files (on Windows.)      The crx contains these files (and is therefore noticeably and reproducably  much larger.)    To verify simply pack the extension from an export and a checkout.  If the  resulting crx is not roughly the same size  it definitely includes the  working files.    -[Unknown] </pre>
