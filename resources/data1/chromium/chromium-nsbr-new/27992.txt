<title>Issue 27992 -   chromium -    You have to click on a textbox (&lt;textarea&gt;) to recover the previous text if the page has a script that puts a default text in it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0  URLs (if applicable) : this url  Other browsers tested: none      1. Type some text into the textbox below (the one used to post a comment.   Don't press the save-changes button!)  2. go to google.com  3. press back  4. Notice the textbox is empty  5. Click on the textbox  6. Now the text appears      To immediatly see the 'old' text  without having to click on the textbox.   As far as I tested it  this only works for textboxes that have a text on   loading  not for 'empty' textboxes.      you'll have to click first </pre>
