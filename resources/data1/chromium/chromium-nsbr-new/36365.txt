<title>Issue 36365 -   chromium -    crash during tab drag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.307.9 beta  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Archlinux - up to date  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: KDE       Tabs expected to tear off normally and spawn another window in the process.      Chrome Crashes  opening chrome after results in &quot;chrome crashed restore&quot;   bar which opening usually returns the browser to the state before the tab   was torn off.    Additional information:  this problem occurs in chromium  google-chrome-beta  both with the same   crash report.    Problem possibly caused by update in Xorg  have yet to downgrade X to   confirm.    Crash Reported:  The program 'chrome' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.    (Details: serial 29869 error_code 3 request_code 140 minor_code 6)    (Note to programmers: normally  X errors are reported asynchronously;     that is  you will receive the error a while after causing it.     To debug your program  run it with the --sync command line     option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful     backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()   function.)
