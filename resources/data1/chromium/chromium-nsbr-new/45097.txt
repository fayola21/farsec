<title>Issue 45097 -   chromium -    Chrome is sometimes not listed in the Windows 7 Default Programs -&gt; Set Associations dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55  URLs (if applicable) : N/A          Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK        Go to Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Default Programs -&gt; Set Associations  Scroll down to find the list of protocols (ftp/http etc)  Select HTTP and click 'Change Program'    Chrome is missing  though other installed browsers (IE/Firefox) are listed   correctly.        Chrome should be listed alongside other browsers for those protocols it   supports.    This problem only occurs occasionally  and seems to be associated with   Chromes ability to make itself the 'default browser'. On occasions where it   occurs Chrome also reports that it is not the default browser and choosing   to make it so then restores correct behaviour in Set Associations dialog   and I can pick and choose between installed browsers using the dialog.     </pre>
