<title>Issue 29417 -   chromium -    Video Caching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33    Suppose if i accidentally click a link when I am watching a youtube video    the link opens immediately. But in this process  I am losing all the video   that was buffered and when i come back  the video starts re buffering the   video again. So We waste time on some thing which was already buffered in the   system.     Can Google chrome solve this issue by not deleting the buffered video when i   switch back and forth on the same tab at least. Firefox does this well. So   even if i go to another site on the same tab and when i come back to the same youtube video  the video buffer is not deleted and i can watch the video   immediately. </pre>
