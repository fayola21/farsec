<title>Issue 27361 -   chromium -    Implement chrome.extension.getMessage() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is already partly implemented  but this bug is to update it to be more   like the proposal  here:    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/78f661ff16fc8f6a#    Specifically  I think that we need to load message catalogs right before   starting up the extension process.    Also  we should make this API work inside the content script. This will   require sending the catalog data into renderers. </pre>
