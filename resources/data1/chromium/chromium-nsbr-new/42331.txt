<title>Issue 42331 -   chromium -    High memory usage on Facebook  causing swapping  crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a Facebook page (any)  2. Wait.  3. Look at memory usage in Chrome's task manager (Shift+Esc)        Memory usage should be at a reasonable level  and the computer should not  be forced to swap memory.        Memory usage (of just the Facebook tab) approaches 800MiB  which is a lot  on my computer (I only have 1.5GiB)  and the computer begins swapping  memory. As a result  everything becomes slow  and it's difficult to even  kill the page. Eventually  if left alone for long enough  non-critical  processes are killed by the kernel  but the tab remains alive (don't ask me  why...).    <b>Please provide
