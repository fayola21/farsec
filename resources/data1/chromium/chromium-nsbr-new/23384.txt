<title>Issue 23384 -   chromium -    InfoBubble should move itself in response to ConfigureNotify events on browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.213.1 (Official Build 27053)    The first-run bubble currently gets opened by a timer that waits 200 ms to   give the window manager some time to determine the browser window's initial   placement.  The InfoBubble class should instead be passed a position   relative to the browser window and move itself accordingly in response to   ConfigureNotify events on the browser window. </pre>
