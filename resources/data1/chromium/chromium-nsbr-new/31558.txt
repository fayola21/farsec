<title>Issue 31558 -   chromium -    Add 64-bit configs to ffmpeg for ChromeOS and ChromiumOS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Though we currently don't have any 64-bit builds of ChromiumOS  some people   still develop with a 64-bit build of Chromium running on their 64-bit   desktop.    We should add a config.h for this target. </pre>
