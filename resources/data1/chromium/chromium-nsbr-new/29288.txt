<title>Issue 29288 -   chromium -    mp3 file UI issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This file does not play well  <a href="http://www.louderproductions.com/mp3/Killshot.mp3">http://www.louderproductions.com/mp3/Killshot.mp3</a>    The mimetype the site uses is not supported  so plugins are used.  If quicktime is installed  it plays  but the controls dont work.  tested on Mac and Windows.  On windows without quicktime  media player is used and works.  But ideally   chrome would play it </pre>
