<title>Issue 33206 -   chromium -    Clean up a few bits of options UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are a few problems with the Options UI that should be fixed:    * The &quot;last shown tab&quot; pref is hung off Browser instead of the options window   class.  * The window uses code that isn't multi-profile-aware to ensure multiple   dialogs don't come up at once.  * This code also leaks every time the window is closed. </pre>
