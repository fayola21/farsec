<title>Issue 45109 -   chromium -    cookie domain wildcard fails for https://mail.google.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 beta  URLs (if applicable) : mail.google.com/      1. Clear all cookies from *.google.com  2. In Content Settings  select &quot;Block sites from setting any data&quot;  3. Clear &quot;Block all third-party cookies without exception&quot;  4. Enter a cookie exception  &quot;[*.]google.com&quot;  5. Navigate to //mail.google.com/ (redirects to   <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail...">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail...</a>)  6. Enter username and password      Log in to gmail account      Warning about redirect loop:    This webpage has a redirect loop.    The webpage at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?">https://mail.google.com/mail/?</a>  ui=html&amp;zy=l&amp;pli=1&amp;auth=[redacted]&amp;gausr=[redacted]%40gmail.com has   resulted in too many redirects. Clearing your cookies for this site or   allowing third-party cookies may fix the problem. If not  it is possibly a   server configuration issue and not a problem with your computer.    ...If I manually add &quot;mail.google.com&quot; as a cookie exception and hit   reload  the login succeeds.  I would've expected &quot;[*.]google.com&quot; to   include &quot;mail.google.com&quot;.   </pre>
