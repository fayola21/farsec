<title>Issue 44573 -   chromium -    No window.home() support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Developer Build 43360) Ubuntu           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Navigate to a non-home page  2. Open the javascript console (shift+ctrl+j)  3. Type &quot;window.home()&quot; into the console      Chromium should switch the current tab to your home page.      &quot;TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'home'&quot;    More info:  There is currently no way for javascript to request that a page be changed  to the home page.  It's not a frequent use case  but it comes up sometimes.   Most non-IE browsers support the home() bit of &quot;DOM 0&quot;.  IE (and others  too probably) use about:home.    Mozilla's minimal documentation on it is here:  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.home">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.home</a>    I'm attaching a patch I wrote that adds support for window.home().  There  are definitely issues with it:  1) WebKit bits should probably be pushed to WebKit too (they have a bug for  it: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13163">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13163</a>).  What's the process for  that?  I go attach the minimal patch there?  2) I duplicated the GetHomePage() bit from chrome/browser/browser.cc.  It  should ideally be brought to a neutral place and called from both locations.  3) I hardcode CURRENT_TAB when calling RequestOpenURL.  That seemed pretty  clearly wrong to me  but I wasn't sure how to do it right.  4) There may be other correctness issues  please let me know.  I'm not a  chromium hacker  yet.  :) </pre>
