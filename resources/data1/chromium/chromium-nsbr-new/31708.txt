<title>Issue 31708 -   chromium -    Allow theme to modify minimize/maximize/close buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.292.0 (Developer Build 35659)  OS + version : Linux      1. Try to create a theme that matches a given linux desktop      =&gt; you should be able to copy various aspects 1:1  =&gt; one of those aspects being window deco's minimize/maximize/close   buttons  which are currently hardcoded to kind of bad looking remake of the   old ubuntu theme's window deco      =&gt; themes cannot change the look of minimize/maximize/close buttons    It would be nice if themes had *optional* fields to allow passing custom   pngs to modify the window button appearance. </pre>
