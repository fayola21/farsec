<title>Issue 34662 -   chromium -    i18n manifest translations are not substituted. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install the Smooth Gestures extension (or  maybe  any that use   __MSG_name__ format to insert i18n translations into the manifest.json?)  2. go to chrome://extensions/  3. observe the extension name and the description (The variables are not   substituted)      __MSG_description__ should be replaced with the correct translation for   description. The gallery correctly deals with these manifest properties    but the extension page does not.      Instead  they show the __MSG_description__ style variable unsubstituted.   (Smooth Gestures hard coded the title because of this issue  but the   description still displays this problem.)    <b>Please provide
