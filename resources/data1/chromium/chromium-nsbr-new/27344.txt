(On my instanstance  DISPLAY=localhost:11.0 and is   vectored through ssh)  4. in the terminal running on LaptopComputer and displaying on Desktop   computer  use the command line to open a new tab  e.g.: type chromium-  browser <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>        new tab should open on the chromium instance running on DesktopComputer  (i.e.  the open-tab command should follow $DISPLAY)        new tab opens on the chromium instance running on LaptopComputer  (the open-tab command always runs locally)    Please provide
