<title>Issue 27397 -   chromium -    Mac: command-tab doesn't switch to Chrome's workspace (Spaces) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mac  4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 4: OK       Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open Chrome in one Spaces workspace.  2. Go to an application in another Spaces workspace.  3. Command-tab to Chrome.      The Chrome window appears.      The Chrome menubar appears  but you remain on the workspace of the other app.    A workaround is to switch to Chrome's space manually  or to command-N to open a new Chrome window (which does   switch to Chrome's workspace)  but both are highly annoying.    In the attached screenshot  I've switched from Firefox (workspace 3) to Chrome.  You can see the Chrome menubar  but   we're still on workspace 3.   </pre>
