<title>Issue 33055 -   chromium -    Chromium won't build for armv4  but it can be fixed trivially. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : svn <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36622">revision 36622</a>  OS + version : Linux-2.6.32  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): armv4 (SA1110)    With tiny changes to the source code I am able to build (a non-functional yet  need to find out why) chromium for   an armv4 cpu (SA1110).  I think it's worth trying to adapt chromium sources to be armv4 compatible.    Non-armv4 compatible things:    * src/v8/src/arm/cpu-arm.cc:128 - bkpt 0 - armv4 doesn't support bkpt    * src/v8/src/platform-linux.cc:246 - same as above    * src/base/debug_util_posix.cc:188 - same as above    * src/v8/src/arm/constants-arm.h:43 - gcc-4-4.2 can build EABI binaries for armv4. It doesn't use thumb   instructions though - armv4 doesn't have them (<a href="http://www.lwithers.me.uk/usr/src/arm-eabi-on-armv4/">http://www.lwithers.me.uk/usr/src/arm-eabi-on-armv4/</a>).  For an armv4 target the build system defines USE_THUMB_INTERWORK here  which causes compilation errors on   src/v8/src/arm/macro-assembler-arm.cc (missing bx/blx instructions).    * src/third_party/skia/include/core/SkMath.h:165 (probably the same problem as above) preprocessor enters the 'if'   part here instead of 'else'  but armv4 doesn't have the smulbb instruction  so we need to go for 'else' when   building for armv4.    For now i've managed to build chromium for armv4 after running these three commands on the checkout:      sed -i 's:&quot;bkpt 0&quot;:&quot;nop&quot;:' src/v8/src/arm/cpu-arm.cc src/v8/src/platform-linux.cc src/base/debug_util_posix.c    sed -i 's:^# define USE_THUMB_INTERWORK 1$:# undef USE_THUMB_INTERWORK:' src/v8/src/arm/constants-arm.h    sed -i 's:!defined(__ARM_ARCH_5T__):0:' src/third_party/skia/include/core/SkMath.h    The build doesn't work correctly (the sad face appears instead of web pages despite proper title in the tab)  but   I don't know whether this can be caused by above sed commands (first one)  so I've decided to report this now.   </pre>
