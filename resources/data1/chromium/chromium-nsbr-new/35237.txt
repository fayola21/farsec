<title>Issue 35237 -   chromium -    Layout Test fast/events/multiline-link-arrow-navigation.html is failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following layout test is failing on [insert platform]    fast/events/multiline-link-arrow-navigation.html    Probable cause:    We get an error message saying:  Invalid name for preference: WebKitEnableCaretBrowsing.  I'm not sure why   we need this considering the test passes anyway.   </pre>
