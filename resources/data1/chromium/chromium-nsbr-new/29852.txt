<title>Issue 29852 -   chromium -    AJP-Incompatibility - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.255.0 (Official Build 32762)  URLs (if applicable) : NVIDIA inhouse webapp  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Using mod_jk or mod_proxy with ajp connection between apache and tomcat  2. opening such a page with http protocol is fine  3. opening such a page with ajp protocol sometimes looses the session after  an indeterminate number of session    What is the expected result?  No session lost.    What happens instead?  The session is lost.    ---    ��_��_��_ AJP-Incompatibility  The first big problem we noticed that Chrome incomprehensibly loses its  session from time to time ��_��_��_ which in practice simply logs the user out w/o  notification. So I started to log on the client and on the server side to  see when and why the server assigns a new session id to an already  established connection. I turned to use mod_jk instead of mod_proxy and  changed a lot of options w/o success. Then I tried to connect Chrome with  Tomcat w/o Apache in between  WHICH WORKED! So pure http obviously was/is  OK for Chrome ��_��_��_ not that fast but acceptable. The solution (use http  instead of ajp between Apache and Tomcat) then was not far away. I��_��_��_m  relatively sure that Chrome has issues in his transmission protocol  that  screws up our proxy. BTW: we essentially need the proxy since we otherwise  would run into cross-site-restriction issues with our ajax and future comet  stuff. I unfortunately expect the same problem with IIS and the mod_jk  bridge to Tomcat on the production side. </pre>
