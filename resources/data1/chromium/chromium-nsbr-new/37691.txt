<title>Issue 37691 -   chromium -    BookmarkTreeNode doesn't contain any info about fav icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)    This is probably a feature request  but here it goes:    In Chrome Extensions - BookmarkTreeNode  there is no fav icon  nore a url to   a fav icon so developers have to do all the work themselves.  I would assume   Chrome stores at least the urls to the icons for it's own list??    It would be nice to either   a) have the url to a local copy of the fav icon  b) have the direct url to the fav icon if chrome doesn't download the icons   </pre>
