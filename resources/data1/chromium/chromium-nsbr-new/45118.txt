<title>Issue 45118 -   chromium -    Improved UX for named anchors towards bottom of web pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a web page with named anchor towards the bottom of the page  e.g.    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  ...  ... lots of content here...  ...  ...  &lt;h2&gt;Distracting heading&lt;/h2&gt;  ... little bit of text..    &lt;h2&gt;Another distracting heading&lt;/h2&gt;  ... again a little bit of text..    &lt;a name=&quot;near_bottom_of_page&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Near the bottom&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  ... just a little bit of text here...  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;    2. Navigate to this named anchor  e.g. <a href="http://foo.com#near_bottom_of_page">http://foo.com#near_bottom_of_page</a>        Either:  a) The document is scrolled so that the location where the named anchor appears is at the top of   the page. [In this case this is not possible since the anchor appears very near the bottom of the   page.]  b) The location where the named anchor appears is made evident to the user in some other way.          Page is scrolled to the bottom of the page  but it's not at all obvious to the user where their   anchor is. They visually scan the top of the page (where their result normally is) but can't find it   there.    <b>Please provide
