<title>Issue 42721 -   chromium -    spdy_network_transaction_unittests could probably handle multiplexed tests better - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  all of the tests in spdy_network_transaction_unittests are  uniplexing; they watch at most one HttpNetworkSession at a time (see  SpdyNetwortkTransactionTest::TransactionHelper).    To implement MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS  a Spdy setting  I need this.  So I'm  going to implement a simple framework to let you create multple  HttpReqeustInfo  describe their relationships  and replay them against an  array of reads[] and writes[]. </pre>
