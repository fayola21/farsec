<title>Issue 36827 -   chromium -    Non ASCII IDs causing issues in sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Non ASCII IDs are causing issues in sync  so I've disabled non ASCII IDs in   favor of hex encoded hashes. This makes them much longer though  so it's not   a good long term solution.    Revert changes in syncapi_unittest.cc and renable length limits on the   server. </pre>
