<title>Issue 37933 -   chromium -    partial PDF download hangs Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. The site was responding oddly  only serving 2.4 to 2.6 MB of a 3.24 MB  PDF file  during the period the site was not serving the file (it would  give you 2.4 to 2.6 MB and then stall) chrome stalled as well  with no way  to close the tab or cancel the file load  I had to kill the entire Chrome  browser.

I repeated this a few times   then tried wget:    $ wget <a href="http://www.trustedcs.com/documents/SecurityBlanketBrochure.pdf">http://www.trustedcs.com/documents/SecurityBlanketBrochure.pdf</a>  --2010-03-10 21:43:43--   <a href="http://www.trustedcs.com/documents/SecurityBlanketBrochure.pdf">http://www.trustedcs.com/documents/SecurityBlanketBrochure.pdf</a>  Resolving www.trustedcs.com... 38.103.17.71  Connecting to www.trustedcs.com|38.103.17.71|:80... connected.
