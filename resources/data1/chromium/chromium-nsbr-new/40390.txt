<title>Issue 40390 -   chromium -    GET requests are sent as nGET - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.366.2 (Official Build 43280) beta        1. Request webpage  2. Receive 501 Error      Proper page rendering.      I encounter a common 501 Error from the server and looking at logs chrome   is sending nGET instead of just GET randomly.    I setup a logging webserver to test on my own and looking at the logs I get   the following:    24.205.13.*** - - [04/Apr/2010:15:15:41 -0700] &quot;nGET /leaf.gif HTTP/1.1&quot;   501 357 &quot;-&quot; &quot;-&quot;  24.205.13.*** *********** - [04/Apr/2010:15:18:59 -0700] &quot;GET /leaf.gif   HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 345 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)   AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.366.2 Safari/533.4&quot;    The issue is seemingly intermittent as you can see from above all I did is   hit refresh. The second request used a proper GET while the first prefixed   the GET with a n for some reason resulting in the error. </pre>
