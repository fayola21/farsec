<title>Issue 33481 -   chromium -    Need nss_ninit-like behavior on OpenBSD - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37492">r37492</a>  we disabled some resolver code that would be good to run on   OpenBSD due to lack of an API.  We can solve this either by introducing   locks around the existing OpenBSD API or by adding API to OpenBSD that   matches the Linux/FreeBSD API. </pre>
