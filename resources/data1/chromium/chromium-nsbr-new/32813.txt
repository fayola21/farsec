<title>Issue 32813 -   chromium -    Some QuickTime content hangs the renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/ironman/">http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/ironman/</a>  2. Click the Watch Trailer button  (This may be 10.6-only; I haven't tried 10.5)    The plugin and renderer hang. From the stack  the problem is that we're   deadlocking because the plugin is trying to call into GetWindowScriptNPObject   from within the window focus event we are sending them. That makes this a   regression from <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36754">r36754</a> in <a title="Cocoa NPAPI support: Send NPCocoaEventWindowFocusChanged events" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31847"> bug 31847 </a>.    If nothing else  I can stop sending that event to QuickTime for now. </pre>
