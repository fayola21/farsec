<title>Issue 29430 -   chromium -    remove direct_output=False code from RunCommand() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The direct_output=False code in RunCommand() was a stop-gap while we   experimented with enabling direct_output by default.  Now that direct output   appears to work without issue  we should remove the direct_output=False code   from RunCommand(). </pre>
