<title>Issue 42677 -   chromium -    Disable drawing from the browser process for windows that draw via the gpu process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a window uses the gpu process for rendering (currently only triggered when   doing GPU accelerated compositing) the browser process needs to be notified   so that it doesn't try to also update the contents of the window from its own   backing store.    This can be implemented by adding an additional IPC call from the renderer to   the browser to notify it when the gpu process takes control of painting.   </pre>
