<title>Issue 27584 -   chromium -    Mac Chrome + Onion News Network = Falsh Crash for ALL browsers until next reboot. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/ultra_realistic_modern_warfare">http://www.theonion.com/content/video/ultra_realistic_modern_warfare</a>  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works (until Chrome kills it)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works (until Chrome kills it)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Not tested    I know this bug looks like it might be a joke... but I assure you it is not.      1. Go to the onion news network  any video..  (for example    <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/ultra_realistic_modern_warfare">http://www.theonion.com/content/video/ultra_realistic_modern_warfare</a>)  2. Watch the video  and let it complete  it will automatically start the next video with some advertisements in between  etc... Do   not click anything... just let several videos play.  (Yes I know... best.. bug.. ever.)  3. Sometime after about the 3rd video (sometimes only takes 1 video  sometimes takes as many as 5) the flash plugin will crash   and show up as a sad plugin.  4. Flash will no longer work at all  in any browser.  5. Reloading (or opening a new tab which uses flash) in chrome will result in hung tabs  and not-responding Google-Chrome-  Helpers in the activity monitor.  Tabs which do not need flash will continue to work.  6. Firefox and Safari will simply hang and become non-responsive when you visit any page that uses flash.  5. Reboot the mac to get flash working again.      Not killing flash utterly and completely for all browsers.      Kills flash utterly and completely for all browsers (until you reboot).   </pre>
