<title>Issue 29701 -   chromium -    [www.housebling.org.uk] Site blocks Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.housebling.org.uk/">http://www.housebling.org.uk/</a>      The site should allow the user to enter and decorate using street view.    Instead  there is a block message saying they don't support Chrome.    Spoofing 4.0.250's user-agent as Firefox 3.5 seems to make it work fine.  We   should reach out to them and let them know. </pre>
