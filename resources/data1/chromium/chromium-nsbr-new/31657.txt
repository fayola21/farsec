<title>Issue 31657 -   chromium -    Fake Trojan Scan using Chrome !  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1.I was just surfing on the web (looking for vegetables actually) when   suddenly the page attached appeared and it seemed that Windows was doing   some scanning about trojans in my hard drive. I swear I am not stupid with   computer and all that stuff but this seemed so real !! I thought that   Chrome was less vulnerable...                The fake scanning kept running as it was real. It found a few &quot;trojans&quot;.   Then  a pop-up with a buttom REMOVE ALL (AKA INSTALL VIRUS HERE) appeared.   I try to press the keyboard buttom ESC but nevertheless the website tryied   to make my Chrome download the Virus.    So  that's is. What do you guys think of that?   </pre>
