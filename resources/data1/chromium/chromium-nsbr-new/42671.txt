<title>Issue 42671 -   chromium -    Optimization: Add short cut for NPOT checks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As it is now  for every DrawXXX call  the code has to go through all the   textures that will be used and check their draw state.     Optimization: If no textures in the entire system are bad there is no reason   to check all the textures to see if any one texture is bad.     </pre>
