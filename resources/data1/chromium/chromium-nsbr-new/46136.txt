<title>Issue 46136 -   chromium -    Chrome leaves dangling bookmark menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you open the bookmarks menu  a submenu and then something causes the menu to be closed  the submenu remains on the screen and there's no way to get rid of it. This is in MacOSX.    I'm not totally sure which events cause the dangling menu  I'll try to get a screenshot next time.    The only way to get rid of it is to restart Chrome. </pre>
