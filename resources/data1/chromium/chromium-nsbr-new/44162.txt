<title>Issue 44162 -   chromium -    Selection and Drag en drop behaviour! of the URL of the omnibar into the correct (sub)-folder of the bookmarksbar  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : 6.0.401.1 dev  OS version 10.6.3              : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;        The user selects with one-click the URL in the omnibar.  He/she drags with the mouse the URL into the correct (sub)-folder of the   bookmarksbar; the list of subfolders and URL's in such a subfolder   automatically becomes visible while hovering with the mouse above.  The user then releases the mouse and the URL has been put in its correct   place.    1. Selection of the URL in the omnibar on the Mac cannot be done in one-  click.  2. Dragging the selected URL directly  out of the omnibar into a (sub)-  folder of the bookmarksbar is not possible (the subfolder list does not   appear). The user first has to drag the URL into the bookmarksbar and then   in a second step can drag it into the correct subfolder.   3. Therefore  the user is confronted with two additional steps in total   that can be avoided.      Should be identical on the Mac to the correct/user-friendly Windows-  implementation.       See above. </pre>
