<title>Issue 39774 -   chromium -    Wierd minimize behavior when you press Windows+M (show desktop) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open at least two tabs.  2. Press (Windows)+M (windows command for show desktop)  3. Chrome windows get resized to lower left corner  but not minimized (see   attachment)    Hi     I'm not sure if this is a bug or something by design  but it seemed very   strange to me. I'm running Windows 7 (RTM fully patched). I have seen this   on two  different laptops using the latest version of Chrome (dev).    Perhaps this has already been reported  in which case I appologize in   advance.    thanks                <b>Please provide
