<title>Issue 24520 -   chromium -    Print selection means  user can't print any more ??? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repros on DEV:4.0.221.6 and Trunk(r 28487)    May be related to <a title="Print selection does nothing" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24519"> issue 24519 </a>  but still filing this as tracking purpose   so we don't miss it.    -Navigate to any webpage and select/highlight a part of the web content.  -Ctrl+P to print dialog and select 'Selection' radio button  in page range  section.  -Click on Print dialog.  [as per <a title="Print selection does nothing" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24519"> issue 24519 </a> it does nothing.]    -Now try to bring up print dialog using ctrl+p/menu on the same tab.    Basically  after print-selection  user can't bring up print dialog on the  tab  unless user navigates to different domain webpage's on the same tab. </pre>
