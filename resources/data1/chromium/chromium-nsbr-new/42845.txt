<title>Issue 42845 -   chromium -    Build chrome with NEON disabled failed at ffmpeg-mt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. On Linux  set GYP_DEFINES as follows   export GYP_DEFINES=&quot;target_arch=arm armv7=1 arm_neon=0  sysroot=/usr/local/google/proj/arm-rootfs disable_nacl=1 werror=  chromeos=1 branding=Chromium ffmpeg_branding=ChromeOS buildtype=Official  linux_use_tcmalloc=0&quot;  export CHROME_BUILD_TYPE=&quot;_official&quot;  2. use CROSS_TOOLS  /home/jiesun/proj/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_G++_Lite/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi  3. make omx_test.   out/Debug/obj.target/third_party/ffmpeg/libffmpegsumo.so: undefined  reference to `ff_h264_pred_init_arm'  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status      Disable NEON for NVIDIA. we should also add arm_fpu=vfpv3-d16 in  GYP_DEFINES  but turns out remove that did not resolve the problem.  I had heard that build chromium ( without 264 support ) successfully with  this config.   </pre>
