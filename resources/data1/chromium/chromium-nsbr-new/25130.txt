<title>Issue 25130 -   chromium -    Mac: Sometimes URL entry does not work when waking from long sleep - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate to a website in a tab  2. Close lid on MacBook and enable sleep for a long period of time. (I   haven't found the greater than time)  3. Open Lid  and enter a URL before the wireless connection has been   properly initialized    Other possibly mitigating factors:   I am on Verizon which redirects DNS all query fails to an html page  even if   they are non HTTP requests. However  I have not seen this error in Safari or   Firefox.       Chrome should either return a DNS error  page not found  or should wait   for the connection to be available      Entering a URL into the address bar does nothing. Links within the tab are   clickable  and Chrome will navigate to other pages. However direct entry   into the address bar will not produce a result. I did not think to look into   whether bookmarks work or not  but I will next time.     <b>Please provide
