<title>Issue 44039 -   chromium -    Dragging a Bookmark from the Bar to the Manager Should be a Move  not a Copy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open the bookmark manager.  2. Drag a bookmark from the bookmark bar or one of its folders to the bookmark manager.    What is the expected output?  - The bookmark should be added to the new place in the manager and removed from the old place   in the bookmark bar  i.e. 'moved'.    What do you see instead?  - The bookmark is added to the new place in the manager but it is also left in the old place in the   bookmark bar  i.e. 'copied'. </pre>
