<title>Issue 41275 -   chromium -    Add background pages for web apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to add something similar to the extension systems background page feature for web   apps.    Web apps should be able to load background pages by doing this:    window.open(&lt;url&gt;  &lt;name&gt;  &quot;background&quot;)    The &quot;background&quot; feature overrides all other features (visual attributes make no sense   combined with it).    The URL would be to a real live web page. If &lt;name&gt; matches an existing name from the   same (origin? app?)  that window reference is returned just  as today.    The background page is ref-counted and is destroyed automatically when nobody refers to it   anymore.    Multiple background pages can be created  but that doesn't seem particularly useful. </pre>
