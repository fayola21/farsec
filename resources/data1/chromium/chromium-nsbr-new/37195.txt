<title>Issue 37195 -   chromium -    FATAL:chrome/browser/renderer_host/safe_browsing_resource_handler.cc(150)] Check failed: url == deferred_url_. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     This happens infrequently ... I'm browsing happily and then suddenly things go boom.    I changed the CHECK line in safe_browsing_resource_handler.cc(150) to:    CHECK(url == deferred_url_) &lt;&lt; url &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; deferred_url_;    and ended up with this in the most recent &quot;crash&quot;:    [29524:29572:144217557110:FATAL:chrome/browser/renderer_host/safe_browsing_resource_handler.cc(1  50)] Check failed: url == deferred_url_.  <a href="http://l.yimg.com/g/images/context_closed.gif">http://l.yimg.com/g/images/context_closed.gif</a>    Note that there is no trailing space on that line so I'd assume url was empty and deferred url   was not.    I also note that one possible caller of this code with an empty url is:    void SafeBrowsingResourceHandler::OnCheckUrlTimeout() {    CHECK(state_ == STATE_CHECKING_URL);    CHECK(defer_state_ != DEFERRED_NONE);    safe_browsing_-&gt;CancelCheck(this);    OnUrlCheckResult(GURL()  SafeBrowsingService::URL_SAFE);  }    I'm unfamiliar with the code though ... my initial guess would be the CHECK is actually wrong.    Using Linux  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40383">r40383</a>. Only been happening for the past couple of days but it seems as if the code   in question was introduced in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40184">r40184</a>.   </pre>
