<title>Issue 30748 -   chromium -    Add maximum memory usage support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to talk to the Chrome team about how they want us to manage memory.    Adding OpenGL support gives a client program (JavaScript  Pepper  NaCl) the   ability to allocate very large amounts of memory. Apparently Chrome does   something special for IMG and CANVAS tags. We'll probably need to do   something similar. </pre>
