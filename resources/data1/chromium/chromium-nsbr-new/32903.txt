<title>Issue 32903 -   chromium -    Regression: Typing does not always overwrite inline autocompletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I reproduced this on <a href="http://chromium-status.appspot.com/">http://chromium-status.appspot.com/</a>.  When I visited the   page the status was &quot;tree is open&quot;  and I had previously typed the following   long string: &quot;tree is open (Reliability: huanr; XP unit purify: nsylvain;   Linux UI valgrind: ?; WebKit purify: dglazkov; Mac valgrind: smorgan)&quot;.  I   put my cursor at the end of the existing (short) string  hit space  and got   inline autocompletion for the long string.  Then I typed '('  and instead of   moving forward one character  the entire autocompletion became unselected  my   cursor went to the right edge of the string  and the field didn't scroll  so   I couldn't see the cursor. </pre>
