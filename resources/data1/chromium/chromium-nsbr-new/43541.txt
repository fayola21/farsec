<title>Issue 43541 -   chromium -    Numerous UI issues (inconsistent alignment in Bookmarks bar) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5+  OS version               : 10.6    There are numerous issues with the bookmarks bar UI - mostly inconsistent alignment.    I went ahead and highlighted them in the attached screenshot:    - RED: The arrow should be aligned to the top of the text (in between the rulers)  - PINK #1: spacing between edges of the highlighted bookmark differs on both edges  - PINK #2: the dropdown is misaligned by 1 pixel to the right (see how the dropdown and bookmark   bar icons are not aligned).   - GREEN to PINK: spacing between edges of the highlighted bookmark differs on both edges  </pre>
