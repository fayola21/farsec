<title>Issue 31784 -   chromium -    triggered window.location.reload() recently broken on new tab page which is not open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.290.0 (Developer Build 35507) Ubuntu             Safari 4: n/a    Firefox 3.x: n/a           IE 7: n/a           IE 8: n/a      1. Create an extension with a background page with the following code:  chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {                 //SEND MESSAGE TO NEW TAB PAGE TO REFRESH                 chrome.extension.sendRequest();          });  2. And an overridden new tab page with the following code:  chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener( function() {                 window.location.reload();  //CRASH IF THE NEW TAB PAGE IS   NOT OPEN          });  3. Click the browser action button.      The new tab page is refreshed if it is open  no result otherwise.      The extension crashes if the new tab is not open.      I made an extension that gives a button to bookmark/unbookmark a page   which is then shown in a list on an overridden new tab page   (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fpjlhlkdcfibeodfpekjbfapdjjlflj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fpjlhlkdcfibeodfpekjbfapdjjlflj</a>  a).  When the button is pressed the new tab page should be refreshed to show the   new bookmark so there's a sendRequest on button click in the background   page and a listener on the new tab page that does so.   This used to work just fine. I just did an apt-get update and with version   '4.0.290.0 (Developer Build 35507) Ubuntu' and now my extension crashes   when the new tab page is not already open.     Attached is a small extension that causes this crash. </pre>
