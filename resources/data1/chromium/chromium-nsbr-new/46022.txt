<title>Issue 46022 -   chromium -    Closing a Pinned tab reloads the page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 - Beta on Linux  Stable on Mac OS  URLs (if applicable) : Any  Other browsers tested:  NA                1. Open two tabs  load a not-incredibly-fast site like gmail in the first tab and Pin it.  2. Close the Pinned tab  and you'll be taken to the second one  3. Go back to the first tab and notice it's reloading whatever page was there        Either:  1. The pinned tab closes  OR  2. I can't close the pinned tab.  It shouldn't be in the right-click menu and the ctrl-w should have no effect        The tab stays but reloads.  It may be that the tab is killed and whatever supports pinning is bringing it back though as you are taken to the next tab.   </pre>
