<title>Issue 45951 -   chromium -    location.reload undefined [Chrome extension] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;5.0.375.70 beta&gt;    Hi     I'm creating this bug report as Antony Sargent asked to do.    See original mail at :   <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/4c2b39224ee331ef    I followed the how-to about debugging chrome extension at :   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tut_debugging.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tut_debugging.html</a>     So I put a breakpoint at some line of my popup  then I went to the   console and entered location.reload() in order to trigger a reload of   my popup  and here I got an &quot;undefined&quot; and the popup didn't reload.    NB : it seems to work well in version : 6.0.408.1    Thanks ++  Reda ABDI   </pre>
