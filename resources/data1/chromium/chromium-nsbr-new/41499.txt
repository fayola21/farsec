<title>Issue 41499 -   chromium -    omnibox not updating switching tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry if this is a dup  I'm not finding it.  This might be related to <a title="Omnibox icon not updated correctly" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41362"> issue 41362 </a>.    Mac Chromium	5.0.378.0 (Developer Build 44489)      1. Load <a href="https://www.verisign.com/">https://www.verisign.com/</a>  note the icon in the omnibox  2. Open a new tab  note the icon is search  3. Switch back to the first tab  4. Switch back to the second tab  5. Load cnn.com (in place of new tab on tab 2)  6. Switch to first tab  7. Switch to second tab  8. Open a new tab  9. Switch to first tab        @3 the icon stays search  @4 the icon changes to the generic globe    @6 icon is correct for https state  @7 icon is correct for a random site    @9 the icon stays search again    Seems like the search icon of new tab is what can cause problems moving away from it to any other type.   </pre>
