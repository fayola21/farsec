<title>Issue 25286 -   chromium -    Introduce a class to hold the various enableFoo functions from WebKit.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Introduce a class to hold the various enableFoo functions from WebKit.h    Possible names for this class:    WebFeatures    WebExperiments    WebExperimentalFeatures    One concern I have is that the WebKit API should never have methods removed   from it.  (That way we can use a new WebKit with an old Chrome.)    So  it might be nice to design something a bit more dynamic  with named   features.      class WebFeatures {    public:        WEBKIT_API static void enableFeature(const char* featureName);        WEBKIT_API static bool isFeatureEnabled(const char* featureName);    };    String processing here kind of sucks  but an enum or a function per feature   has the problem that we would be stuck having the optional feature forever   (or until we choose to break API compat). </pre>
