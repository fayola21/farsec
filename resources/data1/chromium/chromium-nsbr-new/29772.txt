<title>Issue 29772 -   chromium -    Developer tools javascript debugger breaks keyboard input after stopping on an error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the javascript debugger breaks on an error while a textbox has focus    after resuming javascript  the backspace button now makes the browser go   back  just like if there was no text field in focus.    Also in certain conditions  breaking on errors (or possibly breakpoints?) will   stop F5 from working. But im not sure how to reproduce that one. </pre>
