<title>Issue 29706 -   chromium -    text and favicons disappear from the tabbar when there are many opened webpages. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.22            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Open many webpages (it depends upon horizontal screen resolution).  2. See how text and favicons vanishes from tabbar tabs while you open more   webpages.      When length of tab in tabbar is too small to contain favicon and  say  12   symbols  the button which calls the list of opened pages appears right to   tabs.      Text and favicons disappear from the tabbar.    See the screenshot. I have 46 tabs opened and it is normal for me and my   wife. We track a lot of scientific journails and other places of interest   in evening. </pre>
