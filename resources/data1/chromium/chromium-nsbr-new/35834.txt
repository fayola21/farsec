<title>Issue 35834 -   chromium -    Page inspector  option to attached it to tab of the browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is not a bug but rather a feature request.  It would be nice if the page inspector ( Inspect Element ) window could have   the option to be attached to the tab it is inspecting.    When I use it I now often find it a bit annoying as the inspector is overlapping   the view of the page.    Kind regards   Wim. </pre>
