<title>Issue 26311 -   chromium -    &quot;Chromium Helper&quot; orphan renderer processes remaining even with no tabs open after using a pop-up menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After running for a while (a few days  up to a week)  I see many (10+)   Chromium Helper (renderer) processes sitting around even if I close all of   my tabs. They are taking up 0% cpu.    Mark sees this too  and says they are all renderers as opposed to plug-in   processes. I couldn't verify.    The good news is that when you quit  all the processes are correctly   cleaned up and go away. The bad news is once you do this  you can't get   them back to debug them and have to wait another week for this to happen   again.    I most recently saw this with a release waterfall build from 10/21  well   after jrg's change to fix exit_(). Current builds are very crashy  so it's   difficult to keep one running long enough to be able to reproduce this.    Assigning to darin so he can find someone to take a look. Maybe we can   get QA to help run some tests and see if we can't catch a stray renderer   hanging around due to surfing patterns. We could be leaking a   TabContents which would leak the process  but that seems unlikely. I think   all of our UI code is tearing down the infrastructure correctly in just about   all cases. </pre>
