<title>Issue 34520 -   chromium -    [Native Translator] There should be a manager option to manage chrome's native translator - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Suppose following scenarios:    1. If user want to disable/re-enable the native translator feature  how  could he achieve that?  2. If user want to bring some language/website back from translate  exception list  how could he achieve that?    It may needs a manager UI so that user could manage this native translator. </pre>
