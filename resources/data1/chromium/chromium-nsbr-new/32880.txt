<title>Issue 32880 -   chromium -    The active page freezes for a bit while a background page is being loaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.64 (35722)  OS + version: Arch Linux (current)  CPU architecture: 32-bit  window manager: KWin  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): in Linux - same defect  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): no such defect      1. Open up a page with a link to a complicated page  2. Open said page in background with a middle-click  3. Try scrolling the current page      The current page should be responsive and smooth while the background page   is being loaded      The current page is a bit jerky  somewhat unresponsive.    I suggest that the tab currently being viewed by the browser be given a   higher priority (e.g. via the 'nice' parameter of this tab's process) than   that of the background tabs  so that pages not being currently viewed do   not impact the performance of the more important tab. In Chromium  I think   this should be easily achievable  in contrast to e.g. Firefox  which does   not use separate processes for different tabs. </pre>
