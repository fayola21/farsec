<title>Issue 45206 -   chromium -    Smart bar is not smart at all - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I got used to &quot;smart searching&quot; from a few places  like the Firefox address bar  Quicksilver    Spotlight  etc.    The problem is that when I type something in the address bar  it does a very poor job at actually   finding what you want. It only searches your history for ADDRESSES that START with the string   you typed. That is NOT the smart thing to do.    For example. I'm a heavy flickr user  and in firefox I used to type just part of the name of the   user  because firefox searched (1) *any part* of an address in my history (2) any part of the TITLE   of any page in my history.    If I ever visited URLs like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/username/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/username/</a>    I could just type &quot;usern&quot; and   it would know what I mean.    The same thing works for the title of a page. If I read an article on particle physics recently  I   typed something relevant like &quot;parti&quot;;  if I want to go back to that photo of a user on facebook I   type part of his username OR part of the funny name he gave to that photo  NOT &quot;www.facebo&quot;.    What I have to do now is go to history  search it for something and then click that.    These smart searches (FF  QS  SL) also have some learning behaviour implemented; the more you   used a specific term to look for something  the higher it was ranked in your results. You are   google  you should be good at searching :)    It's really annoying to disrupt people's basic ways of finding information.     I attached a FF screenshot.      Cheers! </pre>
