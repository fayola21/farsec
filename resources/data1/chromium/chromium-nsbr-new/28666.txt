<title>Issue 28666 -   chromium -    No active views for extensions after all windows have been closed on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.256.0 (Developer Build 32892)  URLs (if applicable) : chrome://extensions/      1. Visit chrome://extensions/    2. Turn on developer mode    3. Install an extension with a background page  You should see &quot;Inspect active views:&quot; and then a link to the background   page.    4. Close all Chrome windows  but do not fully shut down the application  Probably needs to be the Mac version for this to happen as a result.    5. Open a new window and go back to chrome://extensions/  It will no longer show any active views for the installed extensions.  In   addition  extension scripts will still run  but do not appear to be able to   communicate with the background page anymore.    Incidentally  inspecting the background page  then closing everything but   the inspector keeps the background page alive  for whatever that's worth. </pre>
