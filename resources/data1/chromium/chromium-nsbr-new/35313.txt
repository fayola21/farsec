<title>Issue 35313 -   chromium -    Cookie Allow/Block prompt appears even when all local data is allowed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure how I reached to this state but when I launch Chrome I see a   cookie allow/block dialog on google.com  All the cookies are allowed and they should be set without prompting. Also    there are no exceptions on the list.    Happening with Google Chrome 5.0.322.0 (Official Build 38504). Please see the   image.    Please let me know if you need User Data </pre>
