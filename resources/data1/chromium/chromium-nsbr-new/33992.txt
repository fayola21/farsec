<title>Issue 33992 -   chromium -    Incorrect password saving when two different passwords asked on the same domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome won't save passwords correctly when two different passwords asked on  the same domain.    Note: Maybe this one is the same that submitted to Bugzilla (me too) and  fixed in Firefox 3.0.    See my test setup here: <a href="http://lab.fotofabrik.hu/435531/">http://lab.fotofabrik.hu/435531/</a>    How to reproduce:  Try to login at the url above  the script accepts provided password only  Then try to login on the second page too.    Chrome will save the first password only  second one missed.    Greets   Adam Marton </pre>
