<title>Issue 26376 -   chromium -    Clicking on 'Other bookmarks' on the bookmarks bar doesn't not work correctly in the RTL UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start Chrome in RTL (e.g. &quot;chrome.exe --lang=he&quot;).  2. Create a folder on the bookmarks bar.  2. Click on the leftmost bookmark on the bookmarks bar (this would be the   &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; folder on RTL).    What is the expected output?    The &quot;Other bookmarks&quot; bookmark menu should open.    What do you see instead?    The menu of the rightmost bookmark (the one created on step 2 above) is   opened.    It looks like the problem has to do with the click coordinates not being   flipped correctly.       </pre>
