<title>Issue 44399 -   chromium -    Add policy to make options read-only - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Once the policy abstraction is complete  we should add a policy to make   options read-only.  If a user is in this state  they should see a message   that says their options are locked down by an administrator.    This may involve:  1. UI changes  including making everything in the options dialog disabled.  2. Just disabling accessing the options dialog all together  3. Making the user's normal PrefStore read-only    #1 would be the most intuitive to the user experience (I want to change an   option  but I go to the options dialog  and it's all disabled with a message   that it's locked down)  but I'm open to the other two. </pre>
