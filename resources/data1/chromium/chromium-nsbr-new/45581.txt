<title>Issue 45581 -   chromium -    MouseLeaveTest takes too long to fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MouseLeaveTest takes more than 5 minutes on Windows to run (and fail). This   is slowing down our build considerably. By looking at the code  it looks like   it's trying to move to mouse... which is only supported as part of the   Interactive Ui Tests.    I'm disabling this test for now. Please fix.     </pre>
