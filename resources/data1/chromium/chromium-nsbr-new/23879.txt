<title>Issue 23879 -   chromium -    Finalize browser actions API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> They should both have the API documented at   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions</a>  except the page   actions API should have an additional show(int tabID) method  and should   not have the badge related methods.    We need to keep the current page action API for compat. This should be easy   to do in extension_process_bindings.js.    I'm currently thinking that we should allow multiple browser actions and   page actions per extension.    My reasoning is that although it would be neat to have one-extension one-  feature  we cannot come up with any way to do this and allow extensions to   communicate easily. Also  it would increase memory bloat (more processes). </pre>
