<title>Issue 30556 -   chromium -    Remove &quot;Total&quot; time column in &quot;Heavy (Bottom Up)&quot; view in the CPU profiler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> By definition &quot;total&quot; execution time is &quot;self&quot; time + &quot;self&quot; times of all function's   children. Thus  in a bottom up view  for leaf nodes &quot;total&quot; time should be   always equal to &quot;self&quot; time (and currently it's not for recursive functions    which also leads to confusion). And &quot;self&quot; time for non-leaf nodes should be 0   (as these entries are corresponding to invocations which doesn't perform any   self work  as such invocations should be leaves).    Thus  currently it's really unclear  how to interpret numbers in bottom-up   view. </pre>
