<title>Issue 24983 -   chromium -    Tab attachment animation is wrong - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Drag a tab and detach it.    When you attach the tab one of two things seems to happen:    - the tab animates in the strip as if it had just been added (submarines up   from below)  - the tab just appears with no animation (animation broken?)    Really  the tab should animate on the X axis from the point it was at at the   time the user released the mouse to its target location. </pre>
