<title>Issue 37091 -   chromium -    Dragging and releasing tab quickly makes window disappear - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Start with two windows  one tab in each.  Pick a window and start dragging its tab by the tab.    Release the mouse immediately (before the overlay window is done flickering).  The window will   flicker a few times and disappear.    Debugging showed that the window is actually being closed (not just going invisible) by a delayed   call to Browser::CloseFrame().  Patching out <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?</a>  view=rev&amp;revision=36755 fixes the problem  although I don't understand why. </pre>
