<title>Issue 32826 -   chromium -    Regression: Inline autocomplete for forms can trigger after deletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit a page with a form field which is automatically pre-filled by the   page  to a string beginning with the same prefix as a string you've entered   in that fiels in the past.    Example: On <a href="http://chromium-status.appspot.com/">http://chromium-status.appspot.com/</a>   the &quot;Tree status&quot;   textfield is automatically set to the current tree status string  e.g.   &quot;Tree is open&quot;.  I can repro this bug if I have in the past entered e.g.   &quot;Tree is closed&quot; (or even &quot;Tree is open&quot;) in this field.    Click at the right end of the field to place your cursor there.  An   autofill dropdown should not appear.  Use shift + left arrow to highlight   all of the string but the common prefix (in my example above  highlight   &quot;open&quot;).  Now hit delete.    Expected: dropdown appears  no item selected.  Actual: dropdown appears  an item is selected and inline-autocompleted.    Second case: Type enough of a string into a form field to get it to inline   autocomplete.  Hit the right arrow  then shift+left arrow to select a few   end characters.  Now hit delete.  Nothing appears to happen.  This is   actually the same bug: we're deleting and immediately refilling.    We must never inline autocomplete after a deletion. </pre>
