<title>Issue 25568 -   chromium -    Mac: View (Page) Source on NTP doesn't work properly (and causes badness) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Get yourself an NTP.  2. Do a View (Page) Source [why is it &quot;View Source&quot; in the main menu and   &quot;View Page Source&quot; in the context menu?].      One expects to view the NTP's source and for things to work properly.  Notice that (1) it doesn't actually show the page source  and (2) that clicking   in other tabs (e.g.  the original NTP) is now messed up.    (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=29749">r29749</a> off the trunk on 10.5.8 and 10.6.1) </pre>
