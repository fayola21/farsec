<title>Issue 28278 -   chromium -    Not able to localize Chromium - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Macedonian    All    All    There is no translation.    Chromium is an open-source browser project  at least thats what it says on the   project web site and yet it lacks a process for localization of the software in   other languages. I want to translate Chromium in Macedonian  it's a language   spoken by around only 2 million people  it's not supported in the current version   cause Google only supports languages that are more widely used. There should   be a process in place  including documentation  PO files (easiest way  all the   open-source project use them) and a way to register localization teams in order   to get Chromium localized in as much languages as possible.     There is no easy way to localize Chromium in any other language than the   languages that are supported by Google for Chrome.   </pre>
