<title>Issue 25138 -   chromium -    Scrolling leaks to other windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;4.0.222.5    OS version               : 10.6.1            1. Load a webpage which can scroll vertically (longer than the window).  2. Place another application's window (which can also scroll) behind   Chrome.  Tested Apple's Preview  Finder  and Firefox  others may also work.  3. Bring Chrome to foreground  place cursor above other application's   scrollbar (currently hidden behind Chrome).  4. Use scroll-wheel (or multi-touch) to scroll Chrome.  Background window   will also scroll.      Background applications should not receive scroll wheel events when   Chrome is in focus  has the cursor on top of it  etc..      Background window scrolls  in addition to Chrome window. </pre>
