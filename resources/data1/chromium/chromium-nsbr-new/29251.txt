<title>Issue 29251 -   chromium -    LayoutTests/websocket/tests/simple.html is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are getting some flakiness in simple.html.    In particular  the test outputs readyState = 2  while the test expectations   expects readyState = 1.    Looks like this test was recently added (webkit@51615 by ap)  so I'm disabling   this test for now so I can roll DEPS.   </pre>
