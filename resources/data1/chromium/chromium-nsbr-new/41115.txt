Press Enter Key  4. Type something more  5. Press Enter Key      The enter key should send the cursor to a new line each time it was   pressed.      The enter key will only works once  and afterwards  will not work until you   give the URL bar focus and then click back into the textarea.    This problem also occurs with single line inputs where enter triggers form   submission.    I have also verified that it's not just my enter key. My enter key works in    Dreamweaver  Word  iTunes  and even other program on my computer except for   Chrome.    <b>Please provide
