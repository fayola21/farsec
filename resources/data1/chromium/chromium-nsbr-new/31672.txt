<title>Issue 31672 -   chromium -    Browser Contents Do Not Resize on control-+/- - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)            1. Install Chrome Frame in IE8 or IE7 (did not try with IE6)    2. Load a page that has the Chrome Frame meta-tag  thereby activating CF  For example: <a href="http://www.sliceratwork.com/projects/cf-ie-update/index.html">http://www.sliceratwork.com/projects/cf-ie-update/index.html</a>    Note: This same behavior was observed for my own CF-enabled GWT page.  Note also that IE resizes properly  even with CF installed  if not on a CF-  enabled page  and Google Chrome browser also resizes correctly  whether on   a CF-enabled page or not.  It is only when IE has CF installed and is on a   CF-enabled page that this anomalous behavior occurs.    3. Attempt to resize the window using control-+ or control--        Window contents should get larger with control-+ and smaller with control--        No change in the size of the window's contents.     </pre>
