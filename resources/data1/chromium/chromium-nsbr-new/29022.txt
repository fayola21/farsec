<title>Issue 29022 -   chromium -    Chrome downloads SVG instead of displaying it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/2009/07/14/selinux.html">http://www.imperialviolet.org/2009/07/14/selinux.html</a>        Svg below &quot;Roles and users&quot; should be displayed.        works in Safari 4  Webkit nightly of today  Ff3.5.    The server sends the svg with mime type application/octect-stream   which   probably causes the problem. (agl says he wants to fix this  so this might   stop reproing).    html5 seems to suggest that this should work  and it works in other   browsers. </pre>
