<title>Issue 36301 -   chromium -    AsyncExtensionFunction args_ changes *type* depending on the number of arguments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The protected member args_ in AsyncExtensionFunction is of type scoped_ptr&lt;Value&gt;.   However the value here changes from different subclasses depending on the number of   arguments were passed to the function.    If 2 or more arguments were passed this is a ListValue.  If 1 argument is passed it depends on what was passed.    If I have a function that takes a js array of strings as the first argument and an   optional string as a second argument I'll get the following [1]:    f(['a'  'b']) -&gt; ListValue containing two string values  f('a'  'b') -&gt; ListValue containing two string values!    It would simplify the code and prevent the indistinguishable case above if args_ was   always a ListValue.    [1] The case above would get caught by the JSON schema verifier but if the first arg   is (string|!Array.&lt;string&gt;) then it impossible to detect what was passed in. </pre>
