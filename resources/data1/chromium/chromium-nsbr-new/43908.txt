<title>Issue 43908 -   chromium -    View Source forces page reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Open a web page  2. View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source      Source of currently rendered page. Same as web inspector.      Chrome reloads the page (a new GET request is issued).  - If form data was POSTed  you may see an error message or the wrong source.  - This is also a performance hit  as you're contacting the server unnecessarily. </pre>
