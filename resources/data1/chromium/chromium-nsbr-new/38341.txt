<title>Issue 38341 -   chromium -    Plugin instantiation should fail if Core Animation and Carbon models are negotiated - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to the spec  if a plugin tries to use CA+Carbon we should immediately kill the instance.   We don't currently enforce that.    (It's unlikely anyone would do this  especially since I think Safari does enforce it  but it's part of the   spec so we should check.) </pre>
