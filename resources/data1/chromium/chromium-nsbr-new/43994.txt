<title>Issue 43994 -   chromium -    Table cell alignment bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.17        Firefox 3.6.3: OK               IE 8: OK    There is a visualization bug in the main datagrid  I'm using Telerik   Asp.Net controls.   I first thought it was a TK bug or mine  then i tested it on different   browsers and chrome was the only one that doesn't align correctly the table   cells.    I link a rar file containing screenshots and XHTML source code of the page.    <a href="http://www.hsim.it/public/shared/ChromeBug.rar">http://www.hsim.it/public/shared/ChromeBug.rar</a>    Note: After pressing CTRL- and CTRL+ the page is rendered correctly  even   pressing X on &quot;Show all downloads&quot; fixes the alignment.    Thanks for your attention.    Luca Di Leo     </pre>
