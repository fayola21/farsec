<title>Issue 35255 -   chromium -    URLs not loading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (Build ufficiale 36714)  URLs (if applicable) : -           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: FAIL           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Open the browser  2. Click onto a link in the Favourites bar or into the Other favorites menu      The page should load.      This problem doesn't always happen: sometimes  if you click onto a   Favourite in the navigation bar the URL appears but the page doesn't seem   to load. After a while it happens  but sometimes it takes some minutes. In   the video attached  you see it takes about 15-20 seconds to load  but the   time changes everytime.    I've found this bug with PCs running Windows XP Professional Edition. I   haven't tried it onto other OSs  but I found the bug on many PCs. You can   see a video of the problem by downloading this zip file (it contains an avi   file where i recorded the problem): <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=FS2YQOL9">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=FS2YQOL9</a>    Regards   Davide   </pre>
