<title>Issue 44289 -   chromium -    Clicking in extension does nothing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use an extension. This happens with two extensions I have  both games. Maybe Flash has   something to do with it?  2. Click (on anything  like &quot;Play!&quot; or &quot;Instructions&quot;  &quot;Skip this Ad&quot;  etc.)        Something should happen.        Nothing happens.    Please provide
