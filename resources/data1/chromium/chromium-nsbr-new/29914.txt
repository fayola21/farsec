<title>Issue 29914 -   chromium -    DNS queries not forwarded through SOCKS v5 proxies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version :  SRWare Iron	4.0.227.0 (Developer Build 0)  WebKit	532.3  V8	1.3.16.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.3  (KHTML  like Gecko) Iron/4.0.227.0 Chrome/4.0.227.0 Safari/532.3          Firefox 3.x: OK      1. ssh -D 8008 remote.host  2. iron --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:8008  3. go to any website      That the DNS queries are forwarded through the SOCKS proxy.      The DNS queries are performed from the local network    Wireshark clearly shows the DNS queries happening on the local network  before the page is downloaded through the SOCKS proxy. This has very odd  results with Google's pages (google.com  youtube.com  gmail.com) in that  they don't work at all while other pages (ask.com for example) are  displayed without issue. These additional problems may be unique to my  specific setup  but the lack of DNS forwarding is certainly not. </pre>
