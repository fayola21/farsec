<title>Issue 39777 -   chromium -    [Mac] Pin tab option no longer available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev (also seen in 5.0.342.7 beta)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Pin is available      1. Right/context click a tab  2. Look for the &quot;Pin tab&quot; option  3. Be sad      The pin tab option should be present and should work. It definitely worked in previous versions   of chrome on the mac (perhaps not since 4.* though).      I cry.   </pre>
