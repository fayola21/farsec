<title>Issue 39002 -   chromium -    Feature request: Provide a full interface to browser history in experimental.history API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Developer Build 42207)    According to  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/extension_api.json">http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/extension_api.json</a>   the experimental.history API doesn't provide a full interface for editing  the browser's history.  There is not a way to add/edit full history objects  with custom dates  view counts  etc.      This is essential for an extension that implements a third-party history  synchronization service  like Mozilla Weave.  The chromium user base would  certainly benefit from open synchronization options.  Please consider this  option.   </pre>
