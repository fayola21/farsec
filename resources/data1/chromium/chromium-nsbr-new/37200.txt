<title>Issue 37200 -   chromium -    Address bar clears after typing url during time of network instability - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Google Chrome	5.0.335.0 (Official Build 39561) dev  WebKit	533.1  V8	2.1.0.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)  AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.335.0 Safari/533.1  Command Line	 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome  -psn_0_7477025      <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a>  ... any url ...      1. During a period of network stability or VPN lockup on macosx (Common  leopard problem)  2. Type any url into the address bar  3. Hit Enter key        The typed url should remain in the address bar until the page loads   possibly giving a network error message        The address bar immediately clears.  If you wait until the network becomes  unblocked  the address bar will repopulate  but this could take minutes  depending on the network outage.    It gives the impression that chrome didn't accept the entry even though it  did.  There is something in code that blocks on a network interface lookup  (dns cache check?) before displaying the entered url. </pre>
