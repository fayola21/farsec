<title>Issue 43444 -   chromium -    Tooltip manager should perhaps not cache the view under the mouse - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The tooltip manager (on Windows) listens for every mouse event and caches the   view under the mouse  so it doesn't need to compute it when asked for a   tooltip.    This seems backwards to me.  We get mouse messages by the truckload all the   time  but being asked for a tooltip is fairly rare.  It seems like the path   of less work is to just calculate the view when we need to. </pre>
