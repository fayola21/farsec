<title>Issue 44913 -   chromium -    Notifications don't work with ChromeFrame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a page that displays HTML5 notifications within ChromeFrame  such as Gmail with the   desktop notifications lab enabled.  2. Click the link to enable notifications for that domain - this causes the page to display an   infobar to enable notifications.  3. Have the page generate a notification (for gmail  receive an email or a chat)      A notification should be displayed  but instead  nothing is displayed.    Ideally  ChromeFrame would support the notifications API and display notifications  but failing   that  it should not expose the notifications API at all so no permissions UI is displayed (see this   code in render_thread.cc that disables notifications):      WebRuntimeFeatures::enableNotifications(        !command_line.HasSwitch(switches::kDisableDesktopNotifications));     </pre>
