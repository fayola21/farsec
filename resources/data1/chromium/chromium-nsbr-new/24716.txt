<title>Issue 24716 -   chromium -    task manager tries to access bogus /proc/ entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : google-chrome-unstable 4.0.221.8-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=28108">r28108</a>  OS + version : 2.6.30.5 #1 SMP PREEMPT  Debian/SID  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit):32-bit  window manager : metacity      1. Open task manager  and watch chrome console. Lots of invalid /proc/   access  and no cpu/mem stats.      1. Nothing on console and mem/cpu stats in task manager.      1. task manager showing mem/cpu stats only for Browser and Plug-ins  but   not tabs.  2. console shows:   [23992:23992:2672026389285:ERROR:/usr/local/google/home/chrome-  eng/b/slave/chrome-official-  linux/build/src/base/process_util_linux.cc(372)] opendir(/proc/85/task/):   No such file or directory  [23992:23992:2672026389315:ERROR:/usr/local/google/home/chrome-  eng/b/slave/chrome-official-  linux/build/src/base/process_util_linux.cc(372)] opendir(/proc/123/task/):   No such file or directory  [...lots...]    These obviously wanted to be the tabs' entries but the pids are bogus.   Maybe there shouldn't be a zombie sandbox and a few zombie renderers   either?    Possibly relevant ps output attached.   </pre>
