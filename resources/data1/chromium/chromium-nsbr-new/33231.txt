<title>Issue 33231 -   chromium -    Bookmark Sync UI and Sync go unresponsive. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testing-119.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.3 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36935">r36935</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.42    Also on   Chrome : .0.305.0  -  OB - 36956       1.  When Merging/syncing or Signing-In disable network.    2.  Click Abort or Cancel .   3.  When the sync hangs Force quit Chrome completely.  4.  Relaunch chrome ( with network On/ or / Off)  5. Try clicking on the Chrome &gt; &quot; Synchronize My Bookmarks...&quot;  Or   6. Preferences &gt; Personal Stuff &gt; &quot;Synchronize My Bookmarks...&quot;    7. Quit chrome again and re-launch and try again .    What is the expected output?  Sync should not go into freezing stage  should work normally.  Quitting and relaunching should bring it back to normal state.    What do you see instead?  click on the link has no response   quitting and relaunching also has no response.   Once we goes to unresponsive state it does not recover.    This is only on Mac works fine on Windows and Linux.    This can be seen switching between networks when merger in progress.    Start merger &gt; disable LAN &gt; connect to wifi ( I connected to Google Wifi ) </pre>
