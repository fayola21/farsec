<title>Issue 26526 -   chromium -    Investigate peephole optimizations in seccomp sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;there seem to be a handful of peephole optimizations that the   sandbox can make  where we see common sequences of system calls that we   could probably merge into one transaction rather than forwarding each on   individually to the trusted thread. I haven't measured if that is worthwhile   the effort  though.&quot; </pre>
