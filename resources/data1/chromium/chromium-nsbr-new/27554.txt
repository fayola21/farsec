<title>Issue 27554 -   chromium -    Crash in ExtensionMessageService::OpenChannelToTabOnUIThread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Load an extension that uses chrome.tabs.sendRequest from a popup. The   messaging/timing example extension is a good one.  2. Open the popup and have sendRequest be called.  3. Close the popup.    If you do #3 while the message call is mid-flight  you get a crash due to the   RenderProcessHost being NULL. </pre>
