<title>Issue 44752 -   chromium -    Convert all CommandLine method return values to string16 type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The CommandLine interface is already a mixed bad of wstring and #ifdef to   string or wstring. GetLooseValues() and program() already returns wstring.    Tasks:  - GetSwitchValue(wstring) and HasSwitch(wstring) should be deleted.  - StringType should be removed and replaced with string16.  - GetSwitchValueASCII() should be removed.  - AppendSwitchWithValue(string  string) should be removed.  - command_line_string() should return a string16 string.  - Add POSIX specific interfaces to get the unformatted string.  - Add caching of the conversion on POSIX/Mac instead of doing it constantly.      On mac and Windows this is a no-brainer as they use utf-8 and utf-16. On other   platforms  it depends on LC_/LANG or whatever they feel like to. Since we don't   plan to support opening files with non-valid character in them  I don't think   we should support esoteric mixed-encoding file paths either.  BIG WARNING: The switches name would stay ASCII due to the above note.    The reason for this change is that this assumption is already done in code that   uses CommandLine arguments so it's better to move the assumption at a single   place. At the same time  the CommandLine interface shouldn't be dependent on   the OS anymore.    Note that the command_line_unittest.cc file as *no* non-ascii character in its   test  this bug is about fixing that too to exhibit any deviant handling.    cc'ing Evan in case he has an opinion against  cc'ing Drew since he added   StringType. </pre>
