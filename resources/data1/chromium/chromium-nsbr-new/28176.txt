<title>Issue 28176 -   chromium -    Native Client in Chrome is not supported on 64-bit Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug is created in order to track our progress towards adding support  for Native Client in Chrome on 64-bit Windows    Below is a brief summary of the plan  a design document will be published soon.  The problem: Chrome runs as a 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows systems.  Native Client inner sandbox on 64-bit Windows systems uses SFI and requires  running Native Client loader as a 64 bit process. Since currently Native  Client loader runs as just another Chrome process  it cannot use the 64-bit  SFI sandbox as planned. In addition  Chrome today only knows how to provide  32-bit sandboxes for 32-bit processes.    The plan: create a 64-bit executable that will run the Native Client loader  as a 64-bit process. This executable (referred from here on as nacl.exe)  will use parts of Chrome code (process startup  IPC  sandbox etc). However   we will try to minimize the dependencies where it is  possible in order to  keep nacl.exe small.
