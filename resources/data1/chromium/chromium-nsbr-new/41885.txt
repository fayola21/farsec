<title>Issue 41885 -   chromium -    HTTPStripping is a misfeature and should be removed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.378.0 (Developer Build 44493)  URLs (if applicable) : Any http:// URL  Other browsers tested: Firefox  IE         Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Enter <a href="http://www.google.de/">http://www.google.de/</a> into omnibox and press RETURN.  2. Chromium will not display the protocol prefix  i. e. http://      The protocol prefix should be displayed like any other browser does.      The protocol prefix is not displayed.    This bug is *NOT* about copying and pasting URLs.    Arbitrarily stripping protocol prefixes shouldn't be done because it's   better to *explicitly* state to the user whatever protocol he's using.   Relying on an implicit statement (i. e. any *other* protocol *is* being   displayed) doesn't achieve the same result.    The attached patch is just to clarify what I'm referring to. There's   certainly a better solution.   </pre>
