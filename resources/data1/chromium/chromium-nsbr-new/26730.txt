<title>Issue 26730 -   chromium -    Disk cache: issue only asynchronous IO requests. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The disk cache uses a mixture of sync and async IO requests. Usually  this is   not a problem (performance wise)  but if the system's file IO is overloaded   we may start blocking the IO thread while waiting for the disks to finish.    We should re-write the disk cache to issue only async requests. </pre>
