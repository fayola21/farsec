<title>Issue 24605 -   chromium -    Eliminate the NativeMetafile #define - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per the cross-platform development design doc  we shouldn't be defining   different types to one shared type  as we currently do with NativeMetafile.    We probably want to make a shared interface for at least the Mac and   Windows class; there's code that passes around metafiles through the printing   system that would be pointless to fork. </pre>
