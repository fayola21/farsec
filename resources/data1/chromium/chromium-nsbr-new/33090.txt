<title>Issue 33090 -   chromium -    keyboard events don't propagate up to the OS when extension page action popups are displayed under linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit CPU w/ 32-bit kernel  window manager : Gnome/Compiz      1. Install an extension that has a page action popup.  2. Activate the extension page action popup so that it is being displayed.  3. Try changing the volume with volume keys on a keyboard or Alt-Tab'ing   between windows.      Keyboard triggered events that aren't specifically tied to the page action   popup should be propagated up to the OS or other applications so that they   can trigger the expected behavior.      All keyboard events that usually work in other applications and even in   Chrome when page action popups aren't being displayed fail to work when the   page action is displayed.  For example  the keyboard volume keys don't work   and alt-tab no longer switches between windows. </pre>
