<title>Issue 25529 -   chromium -    Chrome browser process wastes/leaks memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27      Most of the memory that Chrome uses should be in its tab processes  not in   the core browser.      Chrome wastes hundreds of MB of my laptop's memory  and isn't reclaimed   even when I close and reopen tabs or reload large pages.  My laptop has   gotten much slower since Chrome upgraded itself to 3.0  and there's no way   to fix it except by restarting all of Chrome  which is frustrating and   misses the whole point of having separate processes for tabs.    Some of my relevant behaviors:  - I leave Chrome running for a long time (e.g. weeks)  - I put my laptop into standby multiple times per day  - My most frequently used web pages are GMail  Google Docs  Google   Calendar  and Google Sites    I've noticed that when I switch to tabs I haven't looked at in a few hours    they draw onto the screen veeeerrrrryyy slowly (like 5 seconds to draw the   tab  pixel by pixel) which means to me that it went out to swap.    Attached is a typical Chrome Task Manager report.    In Windows Task Manager  I see that the chrome.exe process uses 151 100K of   &quot;Mem Usage&quot; but ALSO an additional 154 540K of &quot;VM Size&quot;  for a total   footprint of over 300MB!    Even with every tab closed (except for this one) Chrome is still using   300MB of RAM.    I realize that leaks are hard to track down  and that you probably won't do   anything with this because it's not reproducable and/or you developers   restart your Chrome processes all the time so you don't notice it.  But   it's a real problem  and it's much worse than it used to be.    I really loved Chrome 1.x  I wish it would come back.  It was much faster.   </pre>
