<title>Issue 27090 -   chromium -    Chrome should use less memory than any competing browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16    Chrome should (be able to) take less RAM than any competing browser  most   of the time--by default or at least when a user needs it to.  I believe that's a goal stretching enough for Chrome engineering team :-)    It's still a nightmare to use Chrome *heavily* (100 tabs+) on an average   laptop computer (2-3GB RAM  non-SSD 7200rpm hard drive  1.8GHz core duo    winXP)--but that's too informal (and hardly achieavable) for as an issue   report  hence the first paragraph.    It may be difficult to compare actual memory usage--but maybe the following   could help.    Provide a button in Chrome &quot;measure memory usage for current session in   other browser&quot; which would:  1) launch a browser of choice (IE  FF  Opera) with Chrome's current set of   tabs and windows  2) measure memory used by that browser  3) upon a user's confirmation  sends to Google a total RAM taken by each   browser </pre>
