<title>Issue 30905 -   chromium -    IME text input doesn't work in plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30      1. Go to <a href="http://www.givechrome.com">http://www.givechrome.com</a>  2. Click through to the &quot;To&quot; page  3. Try to enter the name of someone how has an Umlaut in their name (hit   opt-u o to get &quot;��__&quot; for example)        &quot;��__&quot; should be inserted into the text field.        Some other random character is inserted.    Stuart  I have a pretty good idea how IME works for normal web content    but I have no idea how it works for plugins. If you can fill me in on that    maybe I can fix this myself. </pre>
