<title>Issue 39785 -   chromium -    HistoryTester tests are disabled/flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See chrome/test/ui/history_uitest.cc:    // TODO(yuzo): Fix the following flaky (hence disabled) tests.  // These tests are flaky because automatic and user-initiated transitions are  // distinguished based on the interval between page load and redirect.    Nobody captured the logs when these tests failed  so we don't have them yet.    One of the tests is going to be marked as FLAKY by my change  others are still disabled because   they fail consistently on my machine. </pre>
