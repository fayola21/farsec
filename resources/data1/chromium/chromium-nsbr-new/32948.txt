<title>Issue 32948 -   chromium -    High CPU use by Browser process in any page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2    Last dev version of Chrome is using tons of CPU when opening the simplest   pages. I even created a new profile but the behavior remains the same.      1. Open Chrome. When in 'New Tab Page' the CPU use is normal.  2. Enter google.com or another simple page.  3. CPU use skyrockets.      Normal use of CPU :)      The 'Browser' process in the Task Manager uses the full CPU and Chrome   gets slow and unusable. After waiting some minutes  the CPU load is the   same.    Windows XP SP3  CPU Intel E8400 (dual core 3.0GHz)  4 GB RAM. </pre>
