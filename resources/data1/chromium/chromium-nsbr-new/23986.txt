<title>Issue 23986 -   chromium -    Chromium does not honor socks proxy on Mac OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I have a socks proxy configured in my location settings in Mac OS X.  2. As seen in the chrome://net-internals/proxyservice page below  chrome   does not see the proxy.  3. This was confirmed using ipchicken; it returns my actual ip adress  not   that of the socks proxy.      Chrome should use my socks proxy      Chrome doesn't :).    <b>Please provide
