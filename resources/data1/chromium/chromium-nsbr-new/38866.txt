<title>Issue 38866 -   chromium -    Bookmarks syncing does not sync up  only down. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I installed Chrome on my third computer and tried to sync my bookmarks   with my other computers I only managed to get all my bookmarks. When trying   to add more bookmarks they disappear after a few seconds. When trying to move   the order of my bookmarks they return to their original state after a few   seconds. Now this has happened on all of my computer attached to my google   account. </pre>
