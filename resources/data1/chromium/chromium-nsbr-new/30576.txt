<title>Issue 30576 -   chromium -    Allow access to custom searches though right-click on selection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11  Other browsers tested: NA      1. select text  2. right click on selection      - In addition to the 'search using google' context menu item  I expected   to find a context menu folder with my custom searches.      - can only search for selected text using google    Other possible improvements of the context menu folder  - by default include 'search using google maps'  'search using google   shopping' etc.  - include a 'translate to' item  - add a link 'define new custom search' which would open the 'custom   search' dialog  to help people find this powerful feature.  - If the user has more than 10 custom searches  populate the context menu   with only the top 10 most used  or use some other selection mechanism to   keep the number of items reasonable.      </pre>
