<title>Issue 42886 -   chromium -    Add ability to set default page colours - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 (Developer Build 43360)    In &quot;Options &gt; Under the bonnet &gt; web content&quot; I'd expect there to be an   option to set the default text and background color to be used on web pages.    The corresponding option in Firefox exists here:    <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Content+panel?">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Content+panel?</a>  style_mode=inproduct&amp;as=u#fonts_and_colors    I currently use an extension (Change Colors) to override colours (to light-  on-dark). However  between page loads  there is a flash of white until the   extension can kick in.

This could be considered an accessibility feature. </pre>
