<title>Issue 44417 -   chromium -    process_singleton.Create often fails on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> process_singleton.Create seems to fail a lot  for me at least.    /tmp is not on tmpfs here.    I'm running chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/test1 &amp; chrome --user-data-  dir=/tmp/test1  and I'd often get the message: &quot;Failed to create a   ProcessSingleton for your profile directory. This means that running   multiple instances would start multiple browser processes rather than   opening a new window in the existing process. Aborting now to avoid profile   corruption.&quot;    I can see this happening for users who accidentally double-click the Chrome   launcher icon when only a single-click is required. This seems bad. Also    that message only appears on the command line. I'll fix that as part of <a title="Convert LOG(FATAL) messages into string resources"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43894">bug   43894</a>. </pre>
