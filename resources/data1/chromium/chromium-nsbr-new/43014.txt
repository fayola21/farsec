<title>Issue 43014 -   chromium -    Please make Ctrl+L activate the location bar in fullscreen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.28 dev            Firefox 3.x: OK          1. press F11 to put the browser into full-screen mode.  2. Press Ctrl+L to activate the location bar.        The location bar becomes visible (somehow)  and subsequent typing &quot;goes   into&quot; it.  So e.g. if I type Ctrl+l google.com RET  I am taken to the   google home page.        Nothing at all seems to happen when I hit Ctrl+l    Firefox works the way I want; this is the only thing I can think of that   firefox does better than chrome. </pre>
