<title>Issue 28716 -   chromium -    Run plugin_tests on Mac buildbot - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> plugin_tests are like ui_tests but test Flash  QuickTime  WMP  Java  Real    and Silverlight.  These tests have helped catch a large number of regressions   and are therefore immensely useful.  Obviously not all of the above are   useful on Mac (specifically WMP)  but this shouldn't take much effort to run   the binary on Mac and install these plugins on the buildbot.  It'll catch a   lot of regressions and save the &quot;Mac folks&quot; from having to track down the   offender etc. </pre>
