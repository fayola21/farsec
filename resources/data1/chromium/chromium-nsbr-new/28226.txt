<title>Issue 28226 -   chromium -    Implement APIs to trigger native context menu within extensions  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Mac / Linux  because of <a title="Right-click context menu shouldn't show before mouseup." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26465"> Issue 26465 </a> and <a title="Context Menu event fires before Mouse up" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26666"> Issue 26666 </a>  it is impossible  for mouse gesture extensions to decide whether the native context menu  should be suppressed.    Mouse gesture extensions are extremely popular on Firefox (i.e.  Mouse  Gestures Redox  FireGestures  All-in-One Gestures)  Opera also has this  feature builtin  however  Chromium doesn't have any working extensions of  this kind for Linux and Mac due to the reasons mentioned in <a title="Right-click context menu shouldn't show before mouseup." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26465"> Issue 26465 </a> and  <a title="Context Menu event fires before Mouse up" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26666"> Issue 26666 </a>.    For such extensions  the right mouse button is usually used as the gesture  trigger. To trigger a gesture  the user press down the right mouse button   move the mouse in a specific pattern  then release the right mouse button.  When a valid mouse gesture is triggered  the extension will execute a  routine to do some jobs. Usually if the user finished a valid gesture (when  he/she release the right mouse button)  the context menu should be  suppressed  otherwise the context menu should show up. Whether to suppress  the context menu or not has to be decided on mouseup events (based on the  movement of the mouse between mousedown and mouseup event). On Mac and  Linux  the contextmenu event is fired immediately after the mousedown  event  this behavior create a dilemma for the developers: if they call  event.preventDefault() on contextmenu events  the user got no context menu  even if they don't want to trigger mouse gesture actions; on the other  hand  if developers don't call event.preventDefault() on contextmenu  events  the user will fail on initiating gestures and see context menus  whenever they press down the right mouse button.    If an API which can generate native context menu is implemented  the  extension developers can create a workground  by using that API to trigger  the context menu when the user failed to perform a valid gesture.    Suggestion:  chrome.extension.contextMenu(callback_function);    Another suggestion is  when a 'contextmenu' type of event is created and  dispatched via dispatchEvent()  trigger the context menu. Currently  by  dispatching 'contextmenu' event manually  Chromium will call event  listeners of the 'contextmenu' event  but no context menus will show up.     </pre>
