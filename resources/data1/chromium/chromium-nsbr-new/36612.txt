<title>Issue 36612 -   chromium -    Adding bookmarks to Other Bookmarks causes folder to flash &amp; chew a ton of CPU cycles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open several windows.  2. Open Chrome Task Manager (Ctrl + Esc)  3. Create a new bookmark in one window  and create it in &quot;Other Bookmarks.&quot;  4. Observe CPU usage of the Browser task.  5. Cycle through all windows  click the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder in each   one to stop the flashing.  6. Observe CPU usage of the Browser task.          The bookmark should be in Other Bookmarks  and the other windows should not   be affected.            The &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; folder on the bookmarks bar pulses/flashes in all   windows other than where the bookmark was created.    The Task Manager reports a lot of CPU usage for the &quot;Browser&quot; task (not any   of the tabs  though).    After step 5 above  the CPU usage for &quot;Browser&quot; is significantly lower than   before.        <b>Please provide
