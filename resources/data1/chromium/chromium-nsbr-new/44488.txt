<title>Issue 44488 -   chromium -    Add more NetLog instrumentation to TCPClientSocket - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the tcp_client_socket_{win|posix}.cc implementations should log the following information:       * [optional] The full address list they were given to connect to     * The individual network address they are connecting to during each attempt     * The OS error that an individual attempt fails with.     * The string that describes the OS error (so don't need to look it up).    This information is useful in tracking down certain connection and IPv4 vs IPv6 issues  and came up   during a bug investigation. </pre>
