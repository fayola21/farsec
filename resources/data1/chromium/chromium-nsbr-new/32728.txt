<title>Issue 32728 -   chromium -    Need a way to pre-install bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  there is no way to pre-set any bookmarks in any distribution of   Chromium.  Users can only import them from another browser.    It would be extremely useful to be able to preset bookmarks from the   master_preferences file  as so:    {    &quot;distribution&quot;: { ... }     &quot;preset_bookmarks&quot; : [      &quot;<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>&quot;       &quot;<a href="http://dev.chromium.org">http://dev.chromium.org</a>&quot;    ]  }    This block would get interpreted by first run  and new bookmarks added so   they are ready and visible for use after first run.    Perhaps this syntax would need to be expanded to include 'bookmark folders'   and other traits of bookmarks. </pre>
