<title>Issue 33352 -   chromium -    Launching an URL from an external application also opens home page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 (Official Build 36665) dev    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Start with Chrome not running.  2. Launch a web page from an external application. (I've noticed this with   applications such as Dropbox  Notify  and the official &quot;Facebook   Notifications&quot; app.)      A Chrome window should open with a single tab showing the desired page.      A Chrome window opens with tabs for both the home page and the desired   page.    If Chrome is already running  it correctly adds a tab for the new page in   either the active window  most recently active window  or a new window if   none are open. This issue only occurs when chrome is not running and   another application tries to open an URL. </pre>
