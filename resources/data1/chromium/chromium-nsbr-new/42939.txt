<title>Issue 42939 -   chromium -    showModalDialog fails to return window.returnValue after being submitted from a form (asp based project) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.10.64  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 4: not tested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    For a working example of the problem  please see the attached test case    test_chrome_modal.zip    Basically its a simple asp page with a href to a javascript function which   calls showModalDialog(...) with a url to another asp page which contain a   form with an editbox and submit button.    using the sample attached...    1. open the test_chrome.asp in your browser  2. click the &quot;Lets test this showModalDialog bug&quot; link  3. the modal window will open  enter a value into the edit box and click   submit.    The expected result is the value entered into the editbox of the modal   window is to be return to the parent window and displayed in an alert.    What happens instead  is the window.returnValue of the modal window  which   was set in javascript before calling window.close() seems to be flattened   completly and the window.returnValue is nullified when we return to the   parent windows call to showModalDialog(...)    The strange thing in all of this is  if you do not use a form and submit   back to the same asp page and just provide a href link which executes a   javascript function to set the window.returnValue and call window.close()   seems to work perfectly well  and the modal window returns the value as   expected  this is also built into my example.    So there is something very odd going on when we use a form to submit back   to the modal windows asp page to set the value and close the window.    All should be come clear if you try my example. Please feel free to contact   me if you need any more details or other help.    Cheers   Darren     </pre>
