<title>Issue 25799 -   chromium -    Adding other accepted language (fur) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : all    Hi  it would be great if Chrome could support other languages for websites'   content. I'm particurarly interested in Friulian    ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language</a>])  ISO code 'fur'. I had a   look in the file app/l10n_util.cc and I found only two letters code there. Is   there a policy behind that choice?  Please note that Mozilla Firefox already supports it.    Otherwise  you should allow the option to insert a custom language code.   Thanks </pre>
