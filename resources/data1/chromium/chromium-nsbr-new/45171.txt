<title>Issue 45171 -   chromium -    presubmit tree closure check should use /status instead of /current - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Presubmit tree closure check currently gets /current and checks it for a   match against the 'closed' string.  The status app has a built-in /status   that returns 1 or 0 (1 indicates the tree is open  0 is closed).  Use that in   the presubmit check  instead. </pre>
