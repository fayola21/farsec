<title>Issue 40871 -   chromium -    Discrepancy in opening web and local bookmarked links from Bookmarks manager. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium OS	0.6.39.0 (Developer Build 3c3739ae - Thu Apr 8 05:22:30   PDT   2010 - )  Chromium	5.0.372.0 (Developer Build 43941)  Type of computer   :  X200      1. Bookmark a few web URLs like www.google.com  2. Bookmark local file links like chrome://newtab  OR    file:///home/chronos/user/Downloads/screenshot.png  3. Go to Bookmarks manager page and click on bookmarked entries to open   them.      In Bookmarks manager - it requires single-click to open web page URLs but   does nothing on single-click of local file links.   Bookmarked local file links require double-click to open.    Please confirm if its expected that - It requires double-click for   bookmarked local files link and single click for a web URL.       </pre>
