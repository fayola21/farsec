<title>Issue 36968 -   chromium -    Web Inspector's CSS attribute editor: arrow up/down bugged with hex numbers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML  like   Gecko) Chrome/5.0.335.0 Safari/533.1      1. Open any page  2. Find a colored element (such as a link)  3. Hit &quot;inspect element&quot;  4. Click the hex css color field and use arrow up/arrow down.       Good question  but something different.      A value of 00C for example on crbug.com will increment to 0.1C ... 100C and over. It can also go   negative with -0.1C ... -100C and so on.   Either way  it shouldnt give invalid hex values.    </pre>
