<title>Issue 39975 -   chromium -    Automatic translation for a page that it's not in the default language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Vers��_��_o oficial 42309) dev  URLs (if applicable) : any that is not written in the default language  Other browsers tested: only for Google Chrome      1. Just enter in any website that is not written in the default language   and a bar offering to tranlate the page will appear under the address bar.      It could offer only once for a site that I enter. If rejected  could keep   an icon beside the address bar  together with the URL.      The bar offering the translation of the page keeps appearing *EVERY TIME* I   enter a site  or reload  or click on a link that's inside one site that is   not in the default language. This thing gradually starts to get boring.    Yes  I know that there's the option &quot;Never translate this page&quot;. Yes  I   know that there's the option for disabling the offering to translate a   page. But these two options are too much &quot;radicals&quot;. I still want to have   the option to translate a page at a single click of the mouse. This could   be done by putting an icon beside the URL. Sometimes I will want the   automatic translation and sometimes not. The options I have today does not   allow me to do this  at least for the same site. </pre>
