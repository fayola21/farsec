<title>Issue 23563 -   chromium -    Chrome linux auto setting the X clipboard beffuer is annoying - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Report from a few Googlers:    Ghassan Mishergh:  annoying chrome linux behavoir:    open two tabs (A  B):   click somewhere within the page on A   click on B   click on A   click on the omnibox   chrome autoselects the url (reasonable)   chrome sets the X clipboard buffer to the URL (unreasonable)     Copying parameters from one url to another is about the most frustrating   experience possible. I believe I've seen applications that do this auto   selection without replacing the copy paste buffer.     Daniel Blandford:  I went back to Firefox because of exactly this bug.   (Well  a related bug: I type &quot;http://ic in the address bar  and chrome   autocompletes with &quot;s&quot;  and sets the clipboard buffer to &quot;s&quot; as well.)    Kevin G. Lim: Oooh  I can top that Chrome bug. Start Chrome on Mac. Even   before I type in a URL  the tab already shows rigor mortis. Dead folder   icon!    Tom Duerig: Yeah  I hate this bug  I discovered the &lt;copy&gt; command in   xemacs just because of this idiocy. Should be unnecessary.       </pre>
