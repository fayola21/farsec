<title>Issue 36994 -   chromium -    Loads page normally  then quickly erases the page and displays &quot;Aw  snap!&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Start Chrome  2.  Try to go to certain websites (for instance  www.yahoo.com)        It shows the web page.      It shows the web page  then quickly erases it and shows the Aw Snap screen  instead.    It doesn't do it on every page  just some pages.  For instance  I can't  load www.google.com.  But I can load anything from:    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/">http://www.google.com/support/</a>    Just using the title bar  I can type in the word &quot;test&quot;  and it does a  search in Google for me.  Some links off the search result work  some don't.    BUT....if I type in the word &quot;stuff&quot; into the title bar  it gives me the aw  snap.    It always resolves the URL.  And it always shows the website I'm trying to  get to  but just for a split second.  Then it's erased for me.    <b>Please provide
