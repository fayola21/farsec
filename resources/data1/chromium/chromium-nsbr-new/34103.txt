<title>Issue 34103 -   chromium -    Browser Hangs and becomes unresponsive with several hundred tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open and close a couple of hundred tabs        Chromium does not crash (as advertised) but it does hang completely. This   consists of tabs simply not loading their pages and other tabs that have   loaded becoming unresponsive to user input (click  scroll etc.).    The cure is to quit Chrome and then kill everything listed under:  ps -A | grep Chrome    Fix? This on Google Chrome on OS X and also on Chromium nightly builds. </pre>
