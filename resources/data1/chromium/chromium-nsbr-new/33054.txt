<title>Issue 33054 -   chromium -    Support for Windows / ActiveDirectory Group Policy settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See similar bug for Firefox: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?</a>  id=267888    Most large companies (including mine) who are on the Internet Explorer   bandwagon  do so because IE is easy to administer from a central point using   ActiveDirectory Group Policies.    I propose that Group Policy support be added to Chromium. </pre>
