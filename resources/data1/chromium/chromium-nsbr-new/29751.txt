<title>Issue 29751 -   chromium -    Drop-down menu does not select option - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.267.0 (34084)    OS version               : Mac OS X 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://translate.google.com">http://translate.google.com</a>  2. Select any item in the &quot;Translate from&quot; drop-down menu.  3. Observe selection doesn't get select and instead menu reverts to first  option in list.    As far as I can tell this happens with every drop down menu. This worked  fine in 3.0 but stopped working somewhere in the past few months. It's also  broken on the official beta just released (4.0.249.30). Might be related to  this closed bug: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22881">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22881</a>      The menu should select the option you selected.      The selection doesn't get selected and menu reverts to first option in list. </pre>
