<title>Issue 37150 -   chromium -    Returning to previous web page.  Wrong spot.. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I am in the middle of a web page(or anywhere on the page) and I click on a   link I go to the correct web page. When I click on &quot;previous page&quot; or   backspace  I am returned to the previous page.  But rather than returning to   the middle of the page I am always returned to the top of the page.    THis happens on my home computer (Win 7 64 bit) and my work computer (XP Pro   32 bit)    Thanks  Monty </pre>
