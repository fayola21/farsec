<title>Issue 29723 -   chromium -    Failing searches minimize other windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to a URL  any URL  e.g. www.google.com.  2. Press Ctrl+F  3. In the search box  search for something that does NOT exist in the page    e.g. &quot;asdf&quot;      Sane behavior.      The entire desktop flickers  as various (random) windows are minimized.  I   haven't discerned any pattern  but I've seen most browser windows FROM   OTHER APPS minimized (Epiphany windows  Firefox windows)  my Evolution mail   window  terminal windows...).    Not ALL windows  mind you  but lots of them.    This is  quite plainly  WRONG.  (WTF is Chrome doing in search that it does   ANYTHING to other windows?!)    <b>Please provide
