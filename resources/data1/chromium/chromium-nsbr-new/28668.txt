<title>Issue 28668 -   chromium -    Cannot apply themes when the download location is not writable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.11 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32790">r32790</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open Chrome Preferences &gt; Under the hood.  2. Change the Downloads location to /Applications. Make sure &quot;Ask where to save each file   before downloading&quot; is disabled.  3. Open <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html</a>.  4. Apply a theme.    Expected:  A .crx file should be downloaded and the theme applied.    Actual:  We get a &quot;Save as&quot; panel which asks for the download location (by default its set to &quot;Documents&quot;).  Chrome shows the file getting downloaded but the theme is not applied.  The .crx files are sitting in the download location the user specifies in the &quot;Save as...&quot; panel.    Note: This bug is related to feature request in 28614.   </pre>
