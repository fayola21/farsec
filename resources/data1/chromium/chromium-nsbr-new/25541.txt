<title>Issue 25541 -   chromium -    Investigate DirectWrite support - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DirectWrite is (I think) a new font renderer in Windows 7.  It provides   things like floating-point advances and has nice output.  Mozilla has a post   about it at <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/nattokirai/2009/10/22/better-postscript-">http://blog.mozilla.com/nattokirai/2009/10/22/better-postscript-</a>  cff-font-rendering-with-directwrite/ .    However  it may be COM-only and thus unsuitable for use in our current   sandboxed renderer.  If we move rendering to a hardware-accelerated   architecture we may be able to use DirectWrite in that. </pre>
