<title>Issue 39106 -   chromium -    Shutdown too slow on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On logout/reboot/shutdown  Chromium receives a SIGHUP. If  for whatever   reason  we cannot shutdown before the system decides to send us a SIGKILL    then Chromium will detect an improper shutdown on the next startup.    On Windows  there is a different shutdown path for when the browser receives   WM_ENDSESSION. Maybe we need to use that on Linux as well? </pre>
