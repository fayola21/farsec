<title>Issue 42146 -   chromium -    Implement the nano tab drawing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We want to experiment with drawing Extension Apps differently in the tab   strip.    The current proposal is to draw it with no background when inactive (just an   icon)  and show a somewhat lowered tab background when active. </pre>
