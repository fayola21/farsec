<title>Issue 26075 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't print google docs documents (doesn't save as .pdf file) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.226.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30140">r30140</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Login to  google docs.  2. Open any document.  3. Click on print button. (In google docs 'print' command means  saving  file as .pdf)    Expected result:  3.1 Chrome saves google docs file as .pdf file.    Actual result:  3.2 Chrome doesn't do anything.    Note:  - Windows/Linux Chrome  Mac Safari and Firefox saves file as .pdf file.  - I am not sure if this is the same as <a href="http://crbug.com/13716">http://crbug.com/13716</a>. </pre>
