<title>Issue 34425 -   chromium -    Security Information window buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The buttons on the bottom of the &quot;Security Information&quot; window do not meet   GTK standards:    a) &quot;Certificate information...&quot; should be &quot;Certificate Information&quot;  =&gt; header case and no ellipsis which is only needed for buttons which   trigger actions that require further input    b) &quot;     Close     &quot; should be &quot;Close&quot;  =&gt; while it is nice to have all buttons sized the same in many cases  it   just looks totally out of place in this case. </pre>
