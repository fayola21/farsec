<title>Issue 40437 -   chromium -    Chrome does not print the bar code image of amazon reshipment order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/orc/returns/labels/load?">https://www.amazon.de/gp/orc/returns/labels/load?</a>  ie=UTF8&amp;rmaID=uhrr35459RMA&amp;printerFriendly=label#PrintButton  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): flawless- prints all page content including the required   barcodes          1. Go to amazon.de and follow the process to return any ordered goods   2. in the last step you have to print a page that renders return stickers to put in the parcel  3. with Chrome the printout does only comprise the textual part  not the bar code images      printout of the page including the barcode images      printout lacks the bar code images    Funny enough this happens in direct printing AND in printing to PDF. So I have attached the PDF   printout of Chrome (lacking barcodes) and Safari (correct). </pre>
