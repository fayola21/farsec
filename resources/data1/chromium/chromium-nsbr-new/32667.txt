<title>Issue 32667 -   chromium -    Need ability to capture screenshot of background tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> captureVisibleTab works great  but I'd like to be able to also get images from   background tabs.  In particular  if I click a link to open a new tab  it'd be nice   to get an image of that page without having to bring that tab in view first. </pre>
