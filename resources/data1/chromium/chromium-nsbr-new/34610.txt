<title>Issue 34610 -   chromium -    protecting password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       i'm using Google chrome 4.0.249.0  in that version the chrome gets crashed   very often  so now i download chrome by ur downloader  that problem is   still in here  and the prob is not only in the windows 7  it also present   in vista and xp. i think the main reason of crashing chrome is consume   equal processing speed of tabs  when we use chrome then it consume lots of   memory with each tab but in IE or Mozilla the primary tab consume major   memory and rest of tabs consume less memory until we did't separate the   tabs  so because of light weight of chrome tab needs more memory and gets   crashed.    the other problem is when we go to incognito mode then websites works fine   on chrome but when we log off to incognito mode then the incognito mode   delete the cookies by which the main browser could not run as it is run   previously and the html text page will open instead of website and it will   very often happens to orkut and yahoo websites  at that time i'm getting   frustrated and uninstall Google chrome and use safari or Mozilla.   in the html text document many information might be seen about the account   by which we can access to another account. the page shows the html view of   redirecting process of an account. i have not yet that type of page but i   sent that you previously as bug report  i hope you have that. i send you   that report bug  many times.    the password saving feature is very good but it should get some password   protection to show saved password (like windows password) as another people   can get the password very easily. as in safari 4 only the username will   display and the password is protected by which no one can access that   account. </pre>
