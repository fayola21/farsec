<title>Issue 41849 -   chromium -    Using Chromium http stack for mobile devices - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     We would like to use Chromium HTTP stack on a mobile platform.     1. Do you see any issue from the memory perspectives (because it has NOT   been used on mobile platforms as of now and mobile devices would have   lesser memory than desktop/laptop) ?    2. Any possible licensing issue ?    Thanks   Shyama Prasad Mondal </pre>
