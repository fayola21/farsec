<title>Issue 28907 -   chromium -    Add homepage_url attribute to extensions manifest.json - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to see a standard homepage_url attribute added to extensions'   manifest.json file  and have that URL appear in the Extensions list when   specified.    As it stands  when I view the Extensions list  there is no indication of   each extension's homepage. This means I often need to do a web search to   locate where an extension may reside on the web. Currently this can be a   hassle  since many extensions are currently found as e.g. attachments on   page 7 of some forum thread.     Duplication between many Chrome extensions and similarly named Firefox   extensions further complicate the matter (especially since 'chrome' is also   a common term found on pages relating to Firefox-version extensions).    I think adding a homepage_url attribute would give extensions a sense of   'place'  and make it much easier to find an extension's support forums    etc. </pre>
