<title>Issue 34443 -   chromium -    login box auto complete first letter case problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Find a login box (login  / password)  where chrome can complete your   login id    2. You can not start to type your login id in a different case letter like   the remembered one login. ( if chrome remembers me like 'ypetya@....com' I   won't be able to login as Y.P.E.T.Y.A@....com  becouse can not start the   login id with capital case 'Y'.    3. Try it with CAPSLOCK it's the same. It will write only   y.P.E.T.Y.A@....com. In a site wich stores case sensitive login   information  it won't work. Like mediawiki in some cases        I need to write my login id with different cases. so please autocomplete   dropdown list do not capture my first letter!!!        I can not log in.    <b>Please provide
