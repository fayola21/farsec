<title>Issue 41618 -   chromium -    &quot;http://&quot; is no longer shown in URL addresses! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to any address on the web.  2. Look at the address bar.  3. There is no more http://!!!        There should be an http:// in front of the address. This is how I copy   paste web addresses to friends  if there is no http:// then it all breaks   and common IM  email programs will no longer recognize these as addresses.  This is terrible!          There is no http://!    <b>Please provide
