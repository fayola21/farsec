<title>Issue 27734 -   chromium -    Recently closed tab problem on Wikimapia page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works Ok   Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Not tested      1. Go to this page: <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#lat=-15.7671444&amp;lon=-">http://wikimapia.org/#lat=-15.7671444&amp;lon=-</a>  47.9264832&amp;z=10&amp;l=9&amp;m=b  2. Click on any tag (place) marked on the map   3. A window will be opened with place information  4. Look the title of the place opened   5. Close the place window  6. Close the Wikimapia tab  7. Go to recently closed tab and open Wikimapia  8. Now open any other tag (place) (Can't be the same you opened before)  9. When you open the new tag (place) you will see that it's not the same   place on the map  but the title is the same. If you click in any other tag    will appear the same title (place)information of the first one you opened.      Should show correct information (title) of place opened.      I see always the same information of the first tag (place) opened.     This problem only happens when I open Wikimapia on recently closed tab  </pre>
