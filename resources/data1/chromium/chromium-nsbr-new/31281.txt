Open the prefs  2. Go to the Personal Stuff pane  3. Click &quot;Clear browsing data...&quot;  4. Have only &quot;Empty the cache&quot; checked (This is the only one i've tried as I   don't want to clear the other data)  5. I have the Everything dopdown selected  and haven't tried other options.  6. Click the &quot;Clear browsing data&quot; button to finally clear the data.  7. Try to go to a webpage using any method  (bookmark  type a url in a   new tab  etc)      I should still be able to go to web pages      The page just sits there unchanged doing nothing. </pre>
