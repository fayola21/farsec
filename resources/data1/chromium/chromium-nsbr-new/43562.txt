<title>Issue 43562 -   chromium -    Hidden scheme in address bar bugs out view-source: - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (Official Build 46416) dev      1. Go to any web page  2. In the address bar prefix the url with view-source:      To view the source of the page in the address bar.      It opens a new tab with an address of view-source: and that's it.    Currently due to the new feature of Chrome Dev that hides the scheme from   the URL in the address bar you have to manually enter it after the view-  source: and before the URL to get it to work. </pre>
