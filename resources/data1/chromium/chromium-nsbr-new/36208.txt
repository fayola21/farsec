<title>Issue 36208 -   chromium -    DCHECK in GoButtonGtk::OnEnter - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start chrome so your mouse cursor will be over (or not over but right   next to it) the Go button.  2. Move the mouse cursor in and out of the go button area.  3. Sometimes a DCHECK in GoButtonGtk::OnEnter().    I've triggered this bug inadvertently twice today  though I've been starting   up and shutting down a debug build of chrome repeatedly.    Tested on normal Karmic. </pre>
