<title>Issue 32820 -   chromium -    Omnibox should still offer to navigate when given input like &quot;who/foo bar&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Omnibox should still offer to navigate when given input like &quot;who/foo bar&quot;    Presently  it only offers the option to search  but if &quot;who&quot; is a server that   i want to navigate to  i should be able to w/o having to manually replace the   space character with %20.    i frequently hit this problem because i copy paste &quot;foo bar&quot; from a page and   then type who/&lt;ctrl+v&gt; in the omnibox.    the accidental search infobar is not an acceptable workaround since it can be   very slow to appear (if the &quot;who&quot; server in this case is slow  which it is). </pre>
