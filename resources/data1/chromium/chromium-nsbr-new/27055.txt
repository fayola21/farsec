<title>Issue 27055 -   chromium -    Fix calls to NSStringToUTF... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> sys_string_conversions_mac has been changed so that the NSStringToUTF...   calls check for NULL values in the conversion method  and will respond with   strings of the appropriate type of length 0  instead of crashing.  Tidy up   the calls to these methods by removing NULL checks which have been made   superfluous.   </pre>
