<title>Issue 38443 -   chromium -    Can we do official builds on 10.6? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're not sure that official builds produced on 10.6 will work correctly on 10.5.  We've got to be   sure we're always using the SDK for headers and libraries.  We've also got to be sure that the 10.6   toolchain doesn't do anything that would frustrate 10.5.    One thing that we found was that in an official build on 10.6 with Xcode 3.2.x  we'd wind up with   this guy being a file:    Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/5.0.350.0/Google Chrome  Framework.framework/Resources/crash_report_sender.app/Contents/Resources/Breakpad.nib    where in builds done on 10.5 with 3.1.x  it was a directory:    Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/4.0.287.0/Google Chrome   Framework.framework/Resources/crash_report_sender.app/Contents/Resources/Breakpad.nib  Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/4.0.287.0/Google Chrome   Framework.framework/Resources/crash_report_sender.app/Contents/Resources/Breakpad.nib/in  fo.nib  Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/4.0.287.0/Google Chrome   Framework.framework/Resources/crash_report_sender.app/Contents/Resources/Breakpad.nib/k  eyedobjects.nib  Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/4.0.287.0/Google Chrome   Framework.framework/Resources/crash_report_sender.app/Contents/Resources/Breakpad.nib/cl  asses.nib </pre>
