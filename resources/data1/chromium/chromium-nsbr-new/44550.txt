<title>Issue 44550 -   chromium -    Polygons with holes not rendered correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://maps.google.com/?">http://maps.google.com/?</a>  q=<a href="http://beardedmaps.com/oil1.kml&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=7">http://beardedmaps.com/oil1.kml&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=7</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK      1.

Uncheck &quot;Oil Trajectory Forecasts&quot;  3. Check e.g. Medium      A polygon with one or more holes should be rendered.      The polygon is completely filled without a hole.    Appearently Chrome's canvas does not use the same winding number algorithm for polygon   filling. While other browsers render holes correctly when all polyline loops are ordered correctly    Chrome does not.  A possible explanantion and additional examples are in   <a href="http://econym.org.uk/gmap/chrome.htm#winding">http://econym.org.uk/gmap/chrome.htm#winding</a>.    I see how I might work around it for simple polygons with a single hole  but how can I get   polygons with multiple holes rendered correctly? </pre>
