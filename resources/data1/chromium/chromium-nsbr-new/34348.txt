<title>Issue 34348 -   chromium -    Clicking an unlinked image doesn't un-select it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 (Official Build 37331) dev (Linux 32-bit)            Firefox 3.x: N/A (selecting image doesn't highlight it)          1. Select an image  either by clicking &amp; dragging the image itself or   clicking &amp; dragging the text on either side of it. For example  see the   main picture on this page: <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?">http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?</a>  id=2512533  2. Click on the image once.      The image should be unselected and unhighlighted  like what happens if I   click once on a text selection.      Nothing. To un-highlight the image  I have to find some text on the page to   click on. This is rather annoying to do when viewing very large images   because of how easy it is to accidentally highlight images.   </pre>
