<title>Issue 29745 -   chromium -    Cocoa NPAPI mouse events have inaccurate clickCount - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Somewhere between the event creation in the renderer and the plugin delegate implementation   getting it  the clickCount of the mouse event gets lost (probably during IPC  but I haven't had a   chance to pinpoint it yet). As a result  plugins always get 0 for the clickCount. </pre>
