<title>Issue 31434 -   chromium -    Extensions can focus tabs but not windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have an extension call tab.update to select a tab in another window that   is either minimized or otherwise not focused.  2. The other window will not focus or restore.  3. Note there is no similar window.update call  no apparent way to focus a   window!        Either selecting a tab in another window should focus that window  or    since that is not desirable all the time  there should be a separate API to   focus a window.    At least  bring it to the top of the Chrome windows  if not the entire   desktop (THAT could be annoying in the right cases).        Currently  the tab is selected in the window  but the window remains in the   background or minimized.  If an extension is updating a tab to show the   user something the user may not know something has occurred!    In my specific case  I am updating my extension One Number to &quot;recycle&quot;   tabs... e.g. if the user has Google Reader open the extension will refresh   that tab if the user opens Google Reader from my extension instead of   making a new tab.  If the tab is in another window or minimized there is no   way for my extension to indicate something is happening and the user may   think One Number is broken.    <b>Please provide
