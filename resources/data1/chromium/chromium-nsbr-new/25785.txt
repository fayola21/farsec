<title>Issue 25785 -   chromium -    Corrupt and/or truncated downloaded files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Try downloading a big file  say an Ubuntu iso image  then compare the   md5sum of the downloaded file to the number on the Ubuntu web site. URL:   <a href="http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/9.10/">http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/9.10/</a>    2. I had same problems with much smaller files but they were mostly rar   archives. Try to download a 10~20MB rar archive and see if you can   reproduce the problem. I encountered the problem trying to download a rar   archive from rapidshare.com The file was corrupted. Downloading the same   file with Opera was fine and the file was extracted successfully.            Files completely download  i.e. not truncated  and when downloaded   completely they would not be corrupt  and they should have the same md5sum   numbers as the originals.        Downloading of big files sometimes is truncated abruptly  download is   complete but the md5sum numbers are different  or the downloaded file is   corrupted.     <b>Please provide
