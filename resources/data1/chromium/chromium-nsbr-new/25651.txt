<title>Issue 25651 -   chromium -    Intermittent: after several windows are open  search in universal box doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	4.0.223.5 (Official Build 29497)  WebKit	532.3  V8	1.3.16  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.3   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.223.5 Safari/532.3          Chrome on Windows    This is an intermittent bug.  After I have four or five windows open in   Chrome  the universal search box stops working.  When I type in a search   string (e.g. &quot;golf clubs&quot;) and hit return nothing happens.  When I type in   a valid URL  I have to hit return twice for it to be recognized.     </pre>
