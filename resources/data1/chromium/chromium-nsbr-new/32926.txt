<title>Issue 32926 -   chromium -    location.replace reuses the renderer process - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I  from a content_script  try to do:      location.replace(chrome.extension.getURL(&quot;foo.html&quot;));    ... it will reuse the renderer process instead of using an extension process.    Obviously  the extension page won't work properly.    </pre>
