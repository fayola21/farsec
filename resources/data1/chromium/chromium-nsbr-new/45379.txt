<title>Issue 45379 -   chromium -    Saving HTTP passwords does not work with sites/devices that change the realm regularly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Originally reported by ineuall in comment 33 on <a title="user name and password details are not saved" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21218"> bug 21218 </a>:    I also encounter such problem on version 5.0.375.55 beta/Linux  installed from .deb   package. On most sites HTTP auth remembers passwords. But I have few  that are not   remembered. They are web interfaces for Zyxel switches. I've run wget with debug   option and saw this:  Site where login/password are saved:    ---response begin---  HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized  Date: Sat  22 May 2010 14:30:39 GMT  Server: Apache/2.2.15 (Debian)  X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2-1  WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=&quot;Restricted area&quot;  Vary: Accept-Encoding  Content-Length: 41  Connection: close  Content-Type: text/html    ---response end---    Site where login/password are not saved:    ---response begin---  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=&quot;ES-3124-4F at Sat May 22 17:35:31 2010&quot;  Content-Type: text/html  Server: Allegro-Software-RomPager/4.30b3    ---response end---    I think the problem may be caused by different realm each time I open the page.   Though firefox/opera save passwords well. </pre>
