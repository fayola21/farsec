<title>Issue 24838 -   chromium -    no keypress event for alt + another key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  3.0.195.27  Other browsers tested: FF3       Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL           IE 8: FAIL      1. Press &lt;alt&gt; or &lt;alt-enter&gt; (or alt+anything)      Receive a keypress event.      Receive a keydown and keyup event  but not keypress event.    &lt;alt&gt; and any following keypress with altKey selected  &lt;alt-enter&gt; in this   case  appear to trigger keydown and keyup events  but not keypress events.      This is inconsistent with Safari 4  but is consistent with IE.  Would be   nice to have consistent behavior here across webkit browsers.
