<title>Issue 38741 -   chromium -    UI Problem. A strange line appears on the right top side of Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       5.0.356.2 dev    UI Problem    Since I updated to the Chrome dev versions of 5.0.356.0 and 5.0.356.2    there is a strange vertical black line appearing on the right top side of   Chrome (as shown on the attachments).     If I switch off the windows Aero theme  the line disappeared. But  when the   Aero theme is on  the line appears.    My testing system is Windows 7 Ultimate  32 Bit  using Aero theme.    Please fix it.   </pre>
