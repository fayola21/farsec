<title>Issue 35371 -   chromium -    Form input autocomplete drops letters as you type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.324.0 (Developer Build 38737)  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_2; en-US)   AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.324.0 Safari/533.1    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp</a>      1. Browse to any page with a standard HTML input (type=&quot;text&quot;) box.  2. Submit a value (i.e. &quot;jack&quot;) to save the value for autocomplete  3. Go back to the page with the input box  4. Type a value with some matching initial letters (i.e. &quot;john&quot;)      Typing in any form that has autocomplete values saved -&gt; works as   intended.  Autocomplete drop-down appears  goes away after a non-matching letter   (&quot;o&quot; in my example) is typed. Text continues to be typed as intended.      After a non-matching letter is typed  drop-down goes away and input box   deletes the offending letter  as if user pressed backspace key. (in my   example: &quot;jhn&quot; if you're typing without paying attention to the form's   display)    ---    Possibly related to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?</a>  id=18201 ? </pre>
