<title>Issue 37099 -   chromium -    cannot typein compact location bar while loading page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. switch to compact navigation bar mode  2. ctrl-l to open compact location bar  3. typein  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">http://www.google.com/ig</a> (or whatever that takes time to load   all pages).  4. start typing url     What is the expected output?  Should be able to type in new url    What do you see instead?  (seems like) address gets updated when it reads resources  which makes it  impossible to type in new url while loading.       </pre>
