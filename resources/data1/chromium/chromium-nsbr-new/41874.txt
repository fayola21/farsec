<title>Issue 41874 -   chromium -    view-source broken/fails because of missing protocol name http - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The changes described in <a title="REGRESSION: Copy URL from Omnibox and pasting into rich text does not include protocol string" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41489"> Issue 41489 </a> and others also brakes the view-source function of the   omnibox.    So if you are developing a site with xml-output and want to test different parameters with view-  source (for better formatting of the xml) the following issue occures:    1. omnibox-input: &quot;view-source:<a href="http://myexample.tld/generator.cgi?param=1">http://myexample.tld/generator.cgi?param=1</a>&quot;  2. rewrite in omnibox: &quot;view-source:myexample.tld/generator.cgi?param=1&quot;    Now just changing param to 2 and pressing enter will break your output because view-source can't   fetch something which doesn't include a protocol. So you have to add &quot;http:// in every test again   instead of just changing the parameter. </pre>
