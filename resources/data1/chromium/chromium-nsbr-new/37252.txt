<title>Issue 37252 -   chromium -    translate: target language selection UI should list only languages available as a target - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> follow-up to <a title="Translate: ping translate api occassionally for new language pairs"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35475">bug 35475</a>.    Once translation pairs are known (obtained from Google translate) and the   source language of the page is detected (or selected by a user manually)    the list of target languages to show in the target lang selection UI is   also determined.    Currently  we list all the available languages in the target lang selection   UI. We also show the source language in the target lang selection UI.     We should only show languages to which the source language can be   translated.      </pre>
