<title>Issue 43596 -   chromium -    Unable to resize unmaximized window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chromium  2. Unmaximize  3. Problem      Expected result is the ability to resize Chromium vertically(when it is not   maximized) by either dragging the top of the window downward or the bottom   of the window upward.      Window does not resize vertically.  The bottom of the window renders well   below the desktop itself making it impossible to reach  and the top edge of   the window only moves the window.  in addition  websites seem to load as if   the whole window was on the screen(no scroll bars present) when   unmaximized.  also  any pop up window opens at the bottom portion of the   screen instead of the mid section.    *this may have already been reported  but after searching for an hour I   couldn't find a single mention of it here or on the OpenSuSE forums.*    <b>Please provide
