<title>Issue 41800 -   chromium -    bookmark bar should be blue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.7 dev  OS: Windows XP      1. Go to the new tab  or any tab if you have &quot;Always show bookmark bar&quot; on.      Bookmark bar is light blue.      Bookmark bar is gray.    All of the rest of the chrome in Chrome is light blue--the title-less title   bar  the inactive tabs  and the &quot;Recently closed&quot; bar.  Having this one   gray is jarring.  Also ugly.    Since this is a UI change I've given it a week to see if it will grow on   me  but it hasn't. </pre>
