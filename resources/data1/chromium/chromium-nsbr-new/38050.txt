<title>Issue 38050 -   chromium -    &quot;Save link as&quot; and &quot;always open this file&quot; conflict - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 (Official Build 40461) dev           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/</a>           IE 8: OK      1. Set a file type to automatically open on download.  2. Download a file of that type by right-clicking and selecting &quot;Save link as&quot;      In all other browsers I'm familiar with  &quot;save link as&quot; overrides automatic open settings - if you   use it  the file saves to the selected location but does not open.      The file opens. This is unexpected behaviour and a pain if I'm doing something like saving to a   network drive for another computer to access (hot folders etc.). </pre>
