<title>Issue 31548 -   chromium -    Spell checker suggestions text colour does not respect desktop theme foreground text colour (Linux GTK/GNOME) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.289.0 (0) Linux GTK/Gnome      1. Select a GTK/GNOME theme with a black background and light/white foreground.  2. Type into a text input box in Chromium with text containing a typo.  3. Right click on underlined typo to display suggestions list/dialog.      Suggested text should have the same foreground colour as the GTK/GNOME   theme and other items in the dialog.      Suggested text colour is the same as the dialog background colour and is   unreadable; see attached screenshot. </pre>
