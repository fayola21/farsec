<title>Issue 29104 -   chromium -    Mac: location bar ugly in popup browser windows (which display them) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not sure which popup browser windows are supposed to display a location   bar  but when we do display it (e.g.  in the Developer Tools window)  it's ugly   and incorrect:  a. The size/height is incorrect  esp. relative to the text.  b. It's not framed properly -- we just let the background kind of leak through   on the border. </pre>
