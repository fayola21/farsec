<title>Issue 34391 -   chromium -    URLRequestContextGetter is getting leaked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like we're leaking URLRequestContextGetter.  I found this out when   trying to land <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/552117/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/552117/show</a>.  It causes   NetworkChangeNotifierHelper::~NetworkChangeNotiferHelper to crash when   DCHECK'ing that all observers have been removed.  It seems to only be   happening in the mac extensions browser_tests   (<a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-</a>  server/builders/mac/builds/16349/steps/browser_tests/logs/stdio for an   example).    I've added a LeakTracker for URLRequestContextGetter in   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/565023/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/565023/show</a>.  This repeatably fails in   ExtensionManagementTest.UpdatePermissions as can be seen in   <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-</a>  server/builders/win/builds/17055/steps/browser_tests/logs/stdio.    I'm going to disable the DCHECK in NetworkChangeNotifierHelper while this   bug gets resolved.  We should also use LeakTracker for   URLRequestContextGetter eventually too  once we fix these leaks.    eroman says cpu often tackles these issues  so I'm assigning this to him. </pre>
