<title>Issue 27448 -   chromium -    Ability to trigger individual builders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not looking for a complex engineered solution  I basically just want a   secondary trigger added each official builder to monitor a build specific   directory.  The purpose of this is to avoid having to cancel unintended   builds  which in itself is tedious and I'm suspicious that it leaves   builders in bad states (cancelling early in the process).    What I'm specifically looking for...     - A DEPS file checked into chrome-official should still launch all   builders   - A DEPS file checked into chrome-officail-cf should launch the CF builder   - A DEPS file checked into chrome-officail-win should launch the Win   builder   - A DEPS file checked into chrome-officail-mac should launch the Mac   builder   - A DEPS file checked into chrome-officail-linux should launch the Linux   builder   </pre>
