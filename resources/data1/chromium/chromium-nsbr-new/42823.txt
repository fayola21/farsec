<title>Issue 42823 -   chromium -    testBookmarkBarVisible fails on windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The pyauto test testBookmarkBarVisible in chrome/test/functional/bookmark_bar.py fails on   windows. It's perhaps for the same reason why it used to fail on chromeos -- the implementation   doesn't consider bookmark bar with height 0 to be visible (while beginning to animate to becoming   visible).    The implementation needs to be fixed  or a WaitUntil() needs to be used in the test. </pre>
