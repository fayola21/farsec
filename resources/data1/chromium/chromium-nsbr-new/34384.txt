<title>Issue 34384 -   chromium -    Cmd+W does not close the tab anymore - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev    According to the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?</a>  hl=en&amp;answer=95743 Cmd+W closes the current tab and Cmd+Q - current   window. This worked for ages  but not since the last update. Now Cmd+W   closes the current window and it's not possible to close the tab via the   keyboard. This breaks both existing workflows and keymap compatibility with   Safari / Firefox.
