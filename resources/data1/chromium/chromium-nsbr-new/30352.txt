<title>Issue 30352 -   chromium -    Magnifying glass icon persists outside of image area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    <a href="http://www.lisisoft.com/imglisi/5/Screensavers/44637landscapes-">http://www.lisisoft.com/imglisi/5/Screensavers/44637landscapes-</a>  2007.jpg  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: don't know      1. Reduce the size of the browser window to that it's less than 1024x768.  2. Load the image at the specified URL.  (This will load a JPG directly into   the browser with no HTML around it.)  3. Move your mouse over the image to make the magnifying glass icon   appear.  4. Move the cursor up to the bookmarks toolbar (and/or beyond).    What is the expected result? The cursor should change back into an arrow.      What happens instead? The cursor is still a magnifying glass.    Note: This will work with any image that's larger than the browser window   -- not just the image specified here. </pre>
