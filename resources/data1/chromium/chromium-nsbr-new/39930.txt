<title>Issue 39930 -   chromium -    Other Bookmarks Menu is Buggy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome Mac	5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897) dev           All Other Browsers: [N/A  only applicable to Google Chrome]   Google Chrome Mac Version (current Beta  and Dev)      1.Click on 'Other Bookmarks' in the Bookmarks Bar      Normal Bookmark List UI (arrows at top and bottom for scrolling and not as wide a list)      A rectangle pops up with all the bookmarks listed  but it goes off the side and bottom of the   screen. Also  there are not any scroll arrows and the ends of the list.     Note: Weirdly  I was able to scroll down by putting my cursor at the very bottom of the screen    but still couldn't scroll up.   </pre>
