<title>Issue 37370 -   chromium -    Tricky Tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am running Google Chrome 5.0.307.1 dev on Ubuntu 9.10. This is a facebook   conversation I just had with a friend Ian:    John  okay  so i just had the strangest bug  i accidentally tore off a tab on google chrome  but it wouldn't release  like  it just would not let me let the tab go  i was able to put it to sleep by pressing the power button and then   navigating the menu through the keyboard  but then when i woke it up  the tab was still stuck to the pointer and i   couldn't click anything  i finally had to restart    Ian  that's really weird    I'm happy to provide more information if necessary. Unfortunately  I'm not   really sure how to reproduce the error. </pre>
