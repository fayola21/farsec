<title>Issue 28597 -   chromium -    Unable to view Google analytics report - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.252.0 (Ubuntu build 32323)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/">https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK        1. You should have a Google analytics account  2. Try to view the report: <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/">https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/</a>   The flash plugin should be installed to view the report      Being able to view the page without errors.      You'll get this error message: &quot;Aw  Snap! Something went wrong while   displaying this webpage. To continue  press Reload or go to another page&quot;    I'm running chromium on Ubuntu Karmic on two machines (at home and work).   The issue started to happen in both machines right after updating   chromium to 4.0.252.0. I was able to view the page before the most recent   update.   </pre>
