<title>Issue 37785 -   chromium -    Support the HTML5 File API - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Firefox 3.6 added support for the HTML5 File API  as described in:    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications</a>    This lets a web app read a local file that is chosen by the user via JavaScript.    Chrome has partial support for this. In the test file I've attached  I can select a   file via the &quot;Choose File&quot; button and get metadata about it: its name  size and   type. However  I cannot read the contents of the file.    This boils down to: add support for the FileReader JS class  as described in:  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/FileReader">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/FileReader</a> </pre>
