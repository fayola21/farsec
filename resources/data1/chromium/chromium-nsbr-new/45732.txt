<title>Issue 45732 -   chromium -    Use colorization color to tint toolbar on Vista+ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The toolbar color is always grey right now. When using Vista+ with glass   enabled  we should tint the grey with the colorization color of the DWM. See   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969513(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969513(VS.85).aspx</a> for more   information on how to retrieve the colorization color.    We should also listen for WM_DWMCOLORIZATIONCOLORCHANGED and re-tint as the   user changes the setting. </pre>
