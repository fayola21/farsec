<title>Issue 43989 -   chromium -    Blue screen while playing with flash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.396.0   OS: XP  Shockwave Flash - Version: 10 1 53 22    I unlocked my personal laptop (Dell inspiron 600m) and launched Google   Chrome. Navigated to <a href="http://andhrawatch.com">http://andhrawatch.com</a> page  opened few link from there   in new tabs and started playing video in one of them. While video is playing    I just switched tabs quickly. Browser locked for couple of seconds  then   immediately got the blue screen. The laptop restarted  by itself  but hanging   on at DHCP.... SO need to forcibly shutdown and restart it for successful   boot up. Unfortunately  I could not find crash report-id in eventvwr or dump   in crash reports.   </pre>
