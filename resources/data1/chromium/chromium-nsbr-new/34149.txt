<title>Issue 34149 -   chromium -    Mac: plugin-related file handle leak (in browser process)? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Sorry for the vague steps; I'll try to provide a better reduction.    Configuration: 10.6.2  Release build of <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37698">r37698</a> off the trunk  running with not terribly blank profile + bookmark sync enabled. Present  in particular: a bookmark folder with   bookmarks to lots of (fairly average/popular) sites -- I counted 57 bookmarks  but take that +/- 5.        1. Right click on bookmark folder and select Open All Bookmarks in New Window.  2. Wait for them to load (or turn sad).    Figure out the PID of the browser process (say 12345)  and do:    lsof | grep '^Chromium  12345' | wc -l    Once its done  do that again  and again  etc. I saw the numbers increase disturbingly quickly. Obviously  one can record the output of lsof for more thorough analysis.    My more thorough analysis reveals that .rsrc files from plugins:  Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flash Player.plugin/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localized.rsrc  Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flash Player.plugin/Contents/Resources/Flash Player.rsrc  Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Google Earth Web Plug-in.plugin/Contents/Resources/libnpgeplugin.dylib.rsrc  Library/Internet Plug-Ins/QuickTime Plugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localized.rsrc  Library/Internet Plug-Ins/QuickTime Plugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/QuickTime Plugin.rsrc </pre>
