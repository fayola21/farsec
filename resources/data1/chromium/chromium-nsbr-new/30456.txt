<title>Issue 30456 -   chromium -    :empty ~ E selector doesn't cause required style changes on later siblings of element that changes emptiness - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)   WebKit 532.6            Firefox 3.x: patch pending: mozilla bug 534804   <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=534804">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=534804</a>        The attached file contains an element with content  and two following   sibling elements.  There is an &quot;:empty ~ E&quot; rule that styles the later   siblings when the first sibling is empty.  Since the first sibling contains   content the rule doesn't apply  but a script removes that content on page   load which should cause the style rule to apply  yet it erroneously does   not.    Inspecting the later sibling elements with the developer tools shows the   base styles being properly overridden by the &quot;:empty ~ E&quot; rule  but the   computed style does not reflect this.  Temporarily disabling and then re-  enabling the overriding rule in the developer tools does finally cause the   browser to properly compute the style. </pre>
