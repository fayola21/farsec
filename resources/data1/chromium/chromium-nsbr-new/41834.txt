<title>Issue 41834 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame Installation problem due low speed network! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 5.0.375.3 (Official Build 44229) unknown      1. Download the ChromeFrameSetup.exe  2. Try to install  3. Then  it tries to connect to net &amp; download the original setup file.   However the download interrupts &amp; it can not download it completely to   install &amp; fails!      Can you please provide a direct link to be downloaded by a download manager   instead of the installer(ChromeFrameSetup.exe)? Therefore  I would be able   to download the main installation files &amp; install it directly.    Thanks </pre>
