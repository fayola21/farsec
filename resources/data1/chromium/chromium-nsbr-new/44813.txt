<title>Issue 44813 -   chromium -    Coalesce and/or Reduce work in browser induced by navigator.plugins.refresh() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MSDN (as well as other websites that follow MS suggested best practice)   poll for the presence of the siverlight plugin by calling the JS function   navigator.plugins.refresh() roughly every 3 seconds.   This call tends to   instigate a lot of disk scanning  as we call to reload our plugin list in   the browser.  In the extreme  if many tabs were present and following this   lead  Chromium would make the browser do a LOT of unnecessary rescans.    In the extreme  it is easy to get a CPU pegged (as shown in browser process   CPU utilization) by repeatedly calling this function.  At a minimum  we   should coalesce and/or avoid doing the real work on this &quot;too often.&quot;  For   example  keeping the spirit of the MS suggested code  we should avoid doing   the actual refresh more often than about once every 3 seconds (even if 10   tabs individually ask us to refresh).       Optimally (as suggested by MBelshe)  it would be nice if we got   notification of disk-change-events  and automatically rescanned when   necessary.  We would then not even have to do any work when asked to   refresh().    I suspect that a number of such similar calls (by tabs  to the browser   process) are among the reason why Chromium sometimes chews up giant browser   CPU resources.  We probably need to find and eliminate (or reduce) these   issues one at a time... and perhaps this can be one of our first.    If other folks are more interested in working on this bug  please look at   <a title="Layout Test fast/events/popup-allowed-from-gesture-initiated-form-submit.html is failing"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43420">bug 43420</a>  as it has a lot of pointers to the functions that are involved   with this issue (although that was in the context of a leak that was   present during these specific calls). </pre>
