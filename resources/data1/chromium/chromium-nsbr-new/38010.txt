<title>Issue 38010 -   chromium -    Cannot scroll through bookmarks in a folder (only first 28 are shown) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.352.0 (41355)  OS version               : 10.6.2        1. Add a lot of bookmarks to a folder in the bookmark bar.        I should be able to scroll through all of my bookmarks using my cursor.        Only the first 28 bookmarks are shown (as in the screenshot)  the rest are not visible despite   moving my cursor at the bottom of the list. </pre>
