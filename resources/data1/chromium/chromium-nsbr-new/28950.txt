<title>Issue 28950 -   chromium -    Clearer presentation of nested bookmark folders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.258.0 (33212)  OS version               : 10.6.2      1. Click on the star in the url bar to create a bookmark  2. Click on the pulldown menu of bookmark folders in the presented   dialog box    The user is presented with a list of folder names.  It's hard to find the   folder you want if you have many folders  and nested ones are particularly   confusing... for example  if you have a folder &quot;misc&quot; inside &quot;DIY&quot; and   another &quot;misc&quot; folder in &quot;photography&quot; things get confusing.     One simple solution might be just to add spaces at the front when folders   are nested... so the list would look like this    Computers      Macintosh      Windows      Chrome          Extensions  Art      Photography  Music  News    etc. </pre>
