<title>Issue 25190 -   chromium -    Chrome Mac sends page scroll events to window immediately behind it as well (when using gestures) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  URLs (if applicable) : Any Chrome web page with scrollable content.            Safari 4:ok    Firefox 3.x:ok           IE 7:n/a           IE 8:n/a      1. Open a web page in Mac Chrome and resize so it has some scrollable   content. For best results make the web page about 75% of height and width   of your screen so you can see other windows in background  2.Use Mac Chrome 2-finger downward and upward gestures to scroll the   web page.   3. Observe the events being 'leaked' to the application directly behind    See attached screencast to demo the effect both in Spotify and the Mac   Finder.       Window behind doesn't scroll      Window  bizarrely  does scroll a bit in the direction of the gesture.      </pre>
