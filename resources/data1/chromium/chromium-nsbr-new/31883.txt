<title>Issue 31883 -   chromium -    Support Panel containers in Chromium browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555) dev  URLs (if applicable) : n/a       Chromium from Chromium OS: OK                Other Browsers: n/a    Chromium (the non Chromium-OS version) should support panels  allowing users to   multitask with notepad and music player applications functioning like Chromium OS.    Also  a easy method of creating &quot;panels&quot; should be created  either as an extension of   window.open with a custom 'feature'(e.g.   window.open('http://www.google.com' 'mypanel' 'panel=1 title=&quot;Google Search Panel&quot;');  )   if the app menu will not be implemented into Chrome.   </pre>
