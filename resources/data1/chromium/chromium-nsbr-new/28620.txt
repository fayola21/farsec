<title>Issue 28620 -   chromium -    Private virtual memory in &quot;about:memory&quot; is different from process explorer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run Chrome dev release (4.0.249.4 for my case) with a few tabs on Vista  2. Open &quot;about:memory&quot; and compare the virtual memory size (private + mapped)   with the numbers reported in process explorer         The difference between these two sets of number is more than 50%. On 3.0   stable release they are much closer.   </pre>
