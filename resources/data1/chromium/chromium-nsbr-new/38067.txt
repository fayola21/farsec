<title>Issue 38067 -   chromium -    Cmd/Ctrl-enter should submit form in background tab  etc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From <a title="Ability to submit form into new tab" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32525"> issue 32525 </a>:    glen: &quot;&quot;&quot;The other thing to consider is having [platform equivalent of Alt + Return] submit the   form in a new tab for forms that are normally submitted by just Return. This should   match the Omnibox behavior with the same keystroke.    I love any submit-form-in-new-tab feature as it lets you spawn multiple result pages   very quickly.  &quot;&quot;&quot; </pre>
