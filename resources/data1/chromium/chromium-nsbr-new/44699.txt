<title>Issue 44699 -   chromium -    about:about should list all about:* pages available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We were fumbling for a particular page this morning (about:net-internals) and realized that it would   be very helpful if there were an easy-to-remember page that listed them. Alex Russell proposed   &quot;about:about&quot;    Bonus points if chrome://about/ lists the chrome://* pages available  or provides a link to a page   that does. </pre>
