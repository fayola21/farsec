<title>Issue 40360 -   chromium -    Zoom in or out on a page also zooms on all child/parent pages in same process. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open webpage (example classic google.com homepage)  2. Open link on page in new window (example language tools)  3. Use menu item or ctrl+scroll wheel to zoom in or out on the content in   the new window      The zoom level should be adjusted on only the new window.      The zoom level is adjusted on both the new window and the &quot;parent&quot; window.   Pages loaded in other tabs (separate process?) are not changed  which is   the correct behavior as zoom should be a per-page effect.    Please provide
