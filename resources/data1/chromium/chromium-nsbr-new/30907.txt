<title>Issue 30907 -   chromium -    repeated form submit broken in chrome 4 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   load the following in Chrome    &lt;html xmlns=&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</a>&quot;&gt;        &lt;head&gt;                &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/  html;charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;    &lt;script language='JavaScript'&gt;      function submitForm() {        form = document.getElementById('myform');        form.action = &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search&quot;;">http://www.google.com/search&quot;;</a>        form.target = 'google';        form.submit();      }        function downloadForm() {        form = document.getElementById('myform');        form.action = 'file.csv';        form.target = 'self';        form.submit();      }    &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;    &lt;form id=&quot;myform&quot; method='GET'&gt;      &lt;input type='hidden' name='q' value='git5' /&gt;    &lt;/form&gt;      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick='downloadForm()'&gt;download&lt;a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick='submitForm()'&gt;submit&lt;a&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;      &lt;form target='_blank'...  - new tab is opened every time submit link is clicked    &lt;form target='named'... - new tab is  opened every time submit link is clicked  if search tab had   been previously closed      I have three scenarios that seem to suggest a bug in chrome for form  submission  please see example code below    1. form.submit with a named target opens a new tab the first time with  the submitted data.  subsequent attempts fail to open a new tab (or pull in the submitted  data to the pre-existing tab)    2. form.submit with target=foobar opens a new tab the first time  subsequent attempts post the new submission data to the pre-existing  tab  as it should.  if we close the tab.. then submit again  it fails to open a new tab.    3. form.submit with target=_blank opens a new tab the first time.  form.submit with no target successfully downloads a file.  form.submit with target=_blank now successfully opens a new tab! (the  same is true if target=foobar both times and we close the tab).      <b>Please provide
