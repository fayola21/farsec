<title>Issue 31575 -   chromium -    Each Incognito window should have its own profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the incognito profile is a singleton  shared by all incognito   windows. This can lead to some confusion scenarios when multiple incognito   windows are open. Instead each new incognito window should create its own   wrapper profile that only it uses.    Need to figure out what the implications are for &quot;Open link in new incognito   window&quot; are. Does it change to opening a tab in the most recent one or create   a new window?   </pre>
