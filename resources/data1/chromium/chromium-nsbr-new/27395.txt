<title>Issue 27395 -   chromium -    Missing events in Google Calendar on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Open Google Calendar in Chrome Mac.  2. Create events with overlapping times.     Events should line up side by side. Instead  only some of the events show up   (see attached screenshots).    I'm using 4.0.223.8. Issue does not reproduce in Safari  Firefox or on   Windows Chrome.   </pre>
