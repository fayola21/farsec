<title>Issue 40425 -   chromium -    Popup menus on Mac translation infobars should be NSSmallControlSize - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See attached screen shot of the translation infobar on Mac. The current popup menus are of the   regular control size and look a little too big/heavy for the space. I used Interface Builder to compare   the size of a popup menu with NSSmallControlSize and put it on top of the infobar for comparison.   It fits much better with the size of the infobar and the other buttons there. </pre>
