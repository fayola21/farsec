<title>Issue 30469 -   chromium -    HttpNetworkTransaction should not return net::OK when the connection is closed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit google.com on a flaky shuttle wireless connection when the moon   is in the third house        If the google logo doesn't load correctly (see screenshot)  reloading the   page should fix the problem. Instead  reloading pull something out of   some cache and the image stays corrupted.        rvargas  since I have no idea where the image is cached  I thought I start by   giving it to one of the http guys :-) Let me know if you need any profile   data. </pre>
