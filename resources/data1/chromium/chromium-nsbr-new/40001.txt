<title>Issue 40001 -   chromium -    Extension Infobar form field doesn't focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add an extension infobar with this form element:    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;myinput&quot;  autofocus=&quot;autofocus&quot; /&gt;    ... or use document.getElementById(&quot;myinput&quot;).focus();    When the infobar opens  the form element does not have focus.     This is similar to <a title="PageAction form field won't focus in Windows"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36646">issue 36646</a>. </pre>
