<title>Issue 26701 -   chromium -    Modal plugin windows should act modal - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a modal plugin window (e.g.  Gmail upload)  2. Note that you can still interact with menus  and background windows to   some extent    With <a title="Plugin-opened windows (e.g.  Gmail upload) don't come forward on app switch" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20798"> bug 20798 </a> the major problem (losing track of the windows) is fixed  but   they still aren't actually behaving as modal windows should. We'll need to fake   a modal state.    It would also be nice if we could get rid of the flicker of the window going   back then popping forward when switching from another process. </pre>
