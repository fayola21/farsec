<title>Issue 45180 -   chromium -    Url tooltip too short - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &gt; Chrome Version       : Chromium 2010-05-26  &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?  &gt; 1.  Hover over any normal long link and you'll see that the url tooltip is too   short and doesn't even show the important part    &gt; What is the expected result?  Show the full link and/or show the most important part.    Perhaps let the user decide how to show the url:  1. show full url if possible (screen/window size decides?)  2. show the most important part of the url  3. scrollable url    &gt; What happens instead?  It's too short.    &gt; Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  &gt; possible.  See screenshot for example of too short url tooltip.   </pre>
