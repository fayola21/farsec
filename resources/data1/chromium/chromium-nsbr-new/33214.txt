<title>Issue 33214 -   chromium -    Why is chrome using IE's proxy settings??  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.3      I want to be able to copy chrome to another folder and set its settings to a   proxy  and leave the 'main' chrome without proxy. Or maybe start it with   command line to use a certain proxy.  It is very limiting and unneccessary to make chrome dependent of IE for proxy   settings. I do not wish to see another IE related window in my life!! </pre>
