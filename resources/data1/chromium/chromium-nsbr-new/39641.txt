<title>Issue 39641 -   chromium -    Consider having chrome.history.HistoryItem indicate that an item is bookmarked. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Fri  Mar 26  2010 at 10:03 AM  Joshua Deltener &lt;hecktarzuli@gmail.com&gt;   wrote:  &gt; It also looks like the history shows you if you have something  &gt; bookmarked because there is a star.. if so  it would be nice to have  &gt; an easy way to access a history item's bookmark without you having to  &gt; do the searching by url yourself.. just a thought.    Look into what it would take to ask if a page is bookmarked.  If this might   be expensive  then it is probably better to have the extension do a separate   query.  Users who don't care about bookmark status should not be slowed   down. </pre>
