<title>Issue 43158 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: pageup / pagedown inside text boxes broken recently - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.29 (Official Build   46008) dev  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: ubuntu 9.1  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: kde  URLs (if relevant): gmail.com          1. go to gmail  2. find a long email  3. press reply  4. pageup/down inside the text box        Move by one screen of text at a time.        The scroll bar jumps by way more than a page  usually all the way to the   top/bottom of the message.  This makes navigating inside replies almost   impossible.    I believe this changed in a build in the last few weeks. </pre>
