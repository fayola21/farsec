<title>Issue 31088 -   chromium -    video player does not display video length - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Chromium	4.0.279.0 (Developer Build 35149) Ubuntu  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.279.0 Safari/532.8      1.watch a &lt;video&gt;      Most flash video players display 2 of the following:  1. Progress in video  2. Video length  3. Time remaining  as a negative number  counting down    Some toggle between these values when you click on the time.      player displays only progress    There are strengths and weaknesses of displaying the various time values or   choosing the toggle on click  but anything would be an improvement. I would   suggest displaying progress and length  with the progress value toggling on   click to time remaining. </pre>
