<title>Issue 27620 -   chromium -    Broken focus if there are multiple http auth dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to http://www/~thakis/cgi-bin/test.html   wait a few seconds  2. Dismiss the first auth dialog        Second dialog should have focus.        It doesn't (but clicking on it gives it focus and having more than one http   auth dialog is very rare anyway).    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/392018">http://codereview.chromium.org/392018</a> happens to fix this. </pre>
