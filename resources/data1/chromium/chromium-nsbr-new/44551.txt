<title>Issue 44551 -   chromium -    Form required attribute on checkbox field prevents submission completely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.375.38  URLs: <a href="http://jsbin.com/ecugi/2">http://jsbin.com/ecugi/2</a>      Opera 10.10: OK      1. Create a HTML form with a checkbox field  setting the required attribute (or visit noted URL)  2. Tick checkbox  3. Submit form      Form submits as required checkbox has been checked.      Focus is placed on the checkbox to indicate it is required  but it has already been checked.    Additional comments:  Bug aside  is this really how a required field should be indicated? Just by focussing on the input? </pre>
