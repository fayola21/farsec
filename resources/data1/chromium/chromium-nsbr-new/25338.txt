<title>Issue 25338 -   chromium -    ProxyScriptFetcher does not hold a reference to URLRequestContext - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is the following dependency cycle:    URLRequestContext --&gt; ProxyService  ProxyService --&gt; ProxyScriptFetcher  ProxyScriptFetcher --&gt; URLRequestContext    To avoid this from creating a reference cycle and leaking  we currently do not hold a reference to   URLRequestContext from ProxyScriptFetcher.    The problem with this approach  is it assumes the URLRequestContext referenced by   ProxyScriptFetcher will outlive it.    For a regular setup this is the case. However  if ProxyService is shared between   URLRequestContexts it stops being true; in which case it could be possible to get a crash during   browser shutdown.    Should express this weak reference in a bullet-proof way. </pre>
