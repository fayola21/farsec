<title>Issue 41226 -   chromium -    -webkit-appearance: slider-vertical doesn't display correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Steps to repo:  Have a webpage which has an &lt;input type=range&gt; with a css class that has   the property -webkit-appearance: slider-vertical or sliderthumb-vertical.    Expected behavior  In the case of slider vertical  it has a vertical line showing the places   that the slider can be dragged to.  For sliderthumb-vertical  it changes it   to vertical slider with no guide line.    Actual behavior  For slider-vertical  it correctly acts as a slider  but the background   guide is horizontal. For sliderthumb-vertical  it changes it to a   horizontal slider. </pre>
