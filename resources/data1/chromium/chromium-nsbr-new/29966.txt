<title>Issue 29966 -   chromium -    Support live editing of original .css files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Quote from a web developer friend of mine:    &quot;For overall development  I'm using Chrome. I do fall back to Fx for one thing   -- the CSS Sidebar. You can override stylesheet changes in Chrome using   their integrated debugger  but you can't take a CSS file and edit it live and see   the changes immediately  then copy/paste those changes to the actual .css   file like you can with Firefox's Web Developer extension. I love that.&quot;    Not sure who the right DevTools people are  hopefully yurys can triage. </pre>
