<title>Issue 26564 -   chromium -    Window Controls Misplaced - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27 (Official Build 28507)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open Chrome  2. Look at the window control buttons  3. They are a few pixels to the right of where they should be      The controls should be in the same place as they are in every Windows 7   program.      The buttons are too far right.    I have provided a screenshot circling the problem in red while circling the   correct treatment of these controls (as done in IE8).   </pre>
