<title>Issue 30200 -   chromium -    mouseover event not fireing if element is drawn/rendered under cursor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://eon-guild.org/javascript/chrome.html">http://eon-guild.org/javascript/chrome.html</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to the url and position cursor over one of the small boxes to the left.  2. Mousescroll up and down. The boxes (elements &quot;menu&quot;+x ) should shift up and down   and the content box to the right should change color.       The &quot;menu&quot;+x elements should shift up and down and the &quot;content&quot; element to the   right should change its background color.       In chrome  the mouseover event attached to the &quot;menu&quot;+x elements doesn't seem to   fire before actually moving the cursor  while in IE and FF it fires once the new   element is drawn/rendered under the cursor and consequently immediatly updates the   &quot;content&quot; background color.      I'm not sure which should be the expected behaviour  or if i've done anything wrong   with event registration. </pre>
