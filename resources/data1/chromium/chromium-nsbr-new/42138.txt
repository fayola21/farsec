<title>Issue 42138 -   chromium -    Chrome should save form input persistently on improper shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9 dev  OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Saves form input  but afaik not persistently      1. Enter text into a form on a site that requires per-session login  2. Kill -9 chrome  or Ctrl+Cmd+Reset to hard-reboot your computer  3. Re-open chrome      I log in again  and when the form comes back  the text I'd typed into it is available. Not   necessarily pre-populated in the form itself  but somewhere.      I log in again  and because the browser didn't open to exactly the same page in the first place    the form text is gone. </pre>
