<title>Issue 31129 -   chromium -    HTTPTestServer::CreateForkingServer breaks TCMalloc's heap checker symbolization - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When net_unittests are ran with HEAPCHECK=strict and gtest_filter contains   tests from URLRequestTestHTTP.*  the leak checker reports memory leaks   without symbols.    This is probably due to the fact that URLRequestTestHTTP.* relies on   HTTPTestServer::CreateForkingServer  which spawns a separate Python   process for each test. The forked processes may confuse heapchecker    because they may call pprof several times for a single leak. </pre>
