<title>Issue 29311 -   chromium -    Chrome does not use the system DPI information to render. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   OS + version : OpenSUSE 11.2  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64 bit.  window manager : Compiz    This bug only happens on large monitors where the user has properly  configured the dots-per-inch setting on the X server.   On SUSE this is  done by the SaX2 program  where the actual resolution of the monitor is  matched with the physical size of the monitor.    This means that a 72 point font will actually measure one inch (72 points  to an inch).    Chrome seems to have a hardcoded DPI setting which might be  fine for small monitors and small resolutions but it means that a 12 point  font (which should be .16 inches) renders much smaller  like say .08 inches  making it hard to read.    Firefox does pick the system DPI setting and properly renders the text.    I'll post a screenshot tonight when I am back at my OpenSUSE 11.2 machine  (at work I use 11.0 and Chrome does not run there). </pre>
