<title>Issue 36389 -   chromium -    Suggestion: add open or save option for download files - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Go to a webpage and try to download something            Chrome will always save the file. It can be annoying if you just want to   open the file and delete it afterwards. IE browsers give you an option to   choose if you want to open or save the file. Sometimes just opening a file   makes a lot more sense (for example torrent files  pdfs  etc).     Another way to implement is to open any file  say  under 5MB  with a save   button on the download taskbar if the user wants to save the file  and save   all files &gt;5MB    Thanks.          <b>Please provide
