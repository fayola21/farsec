<title>Issue 31481 -   chromium -    Feature request: Defer media playback until tab activation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Flash loading is deferred  other   embedded media is not.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): No media playback is deferred.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: No media playback is deferred.    Safari has the unique behavior of deferring flash playback until tab   activation. This is great for loading several pages (YouTube videos  for   example) at once in tabs behind the current one  say by   command+clicking on a page of links. None of the videos begin to play   until their tabs are activated for the first time.    This is a feature I miss tremendously in Chrome. It's distracting to open a   link in another tab  planning to get to it later  and have some media start   running on it unexpectedly.    This feature could be improved for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements that   are set to autobuffer and/or autoplay. They could start buffering in the   background but not play until the tab is activated.    What are your thoughts? </pre>
