<title>Issue 26308 -   chromium -    Share slaves across different configurations (builders) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A buildbot builder can have multiple slaves connected to it and at the same   time a single slave can be shared across multiple builders.    Each builder has its own work directory  since a fullcheckout + built dir   is quite large  it'd be more efficient to share the working directory on   the slave per compatibles builder.    Examples:  - XP Tests (dbg)(1)  2  3 and 4 which could use multiple slaves and be   pooled across the four builders.    - layout_win and win on TryServer could use the workdir 'win' to save disk   space even if their output dir is different. It would mostly improve sync   time and remove the need to have multiple checkouts. </pre>
