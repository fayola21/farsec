<title>Issue 34107 -   chromium -    Need better behavior when storage namespace/area lookups fail in dom storage. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need better behaviro when storage namespace/area lookups fail in dom   storage.    SessionStorage actually deletes namespaces now...which means you can easily   have a message for a namespace that no longer exists.  We need to come up   with something more intelligent to do when that happens. </pre>
