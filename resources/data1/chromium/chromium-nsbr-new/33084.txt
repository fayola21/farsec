<title>Issue 33084 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager: menu item should read &quot;Hide&quot; if command would hide it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.302.2 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36665">r36665</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Open Bookmark Manager  2. From Chrome --&gt; &quot;Bookmarks&quot; menu  Click &quot;Bookmark Manager&quot; option again      Actual:  &quot;Bookmark manager&quot; window hides.  But when the user dont know the status that &quot;Bookmark manager&quot; is already opened. ( Assume the case  it got opened   and hidden between few other opened windows). Bookmarks menu doesn't helps him to say that it is already opened.    What is the expected output?   Show toggle options Show/Hide Bookmark manager with respect to its opened or closed status in the bookmark   menu.    Note: Safari show toggle options as show/hide Bookmarks via  menu.     </pre>
