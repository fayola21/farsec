<title>Issue 26706 -   chromium -    Custom New Tab pages should have a good default title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When you implement a New Tab page  if you don't specify a title you get an   ugly URL as the title.    Developers can work around this by specifying a &lt;title&gt; in the page's HTML   file  but it'd be better if a good default title -- such as the localized   version of &quot;New Tab&quot; -- were automatically provided. </pre>
