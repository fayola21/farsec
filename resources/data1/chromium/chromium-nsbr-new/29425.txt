<title>Issue 29425 -   chromium -    On recent Linux builds  sync is unsupported but Sync menu item still appears - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install 4.0.249.22  2. Open the wrench menu.  3. Observe there is a &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot; menu item.  It is permanently   greyed out and useless.      This menu item should be hidden  since sync is not supported in this branch.       </pre>
