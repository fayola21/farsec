<title>Issue 28726 -   chromium -    Fix release scripts so msvs_guid can be removed from all gyp files. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently msvs_guid makes life simpler for release folks  because they have scripts that post-  process the generated sln files and disable particular targets by guid. It would be better if they use   flags to gyp to do this. </pre>
