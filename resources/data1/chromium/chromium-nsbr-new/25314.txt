<title>Issue 25314 -   chromium -    Multiple content scripts per page triggers a javascript error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a user report:  I am seeing Object #&lt;an Object&gt; has no method 'initExtension' in the  developer console when I load a page on which I have a content script  defined. I am not sure if this is harmful or harmless. Does anyone  know why this exception is happening and if there any we can do as  extension developers to avoid it?  ...  It seems to happen (both on Mac and Windows) every time I load a given page   (<a href="http://www.feedly.com/home">http://www.feedly.com/home</a>) on which I have defined both a start and end   content scripts. It happens every time.    ---    I'm pretty sure the problem is that chrome.initExtension deletes itself   after the first run  and the 2nd content script reuses the first's context.   It should be harmless  but we should fix it. </pre>
