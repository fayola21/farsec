<title>Issue 35920 -   chromium -    we need to autogenerate chrome.* API lists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to be able to autogenerate version-specific lists of the chrome.*   and chrome.experimental.* APIs. Here's why:    * We'll be able to use the same HTML source for all versions of pages like   api_index.html that include API lists. This will let us easily improve the   general content of these pages even when the trunk APIs (see   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/api_index.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/api_index.html</a>) are   different from the stable APIs (see   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/api_index.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/api_index.html</a>).    * We won't accidentally leave out APIs from the list of chrome.* or   chrome.experimental.* APIs. If it's documented  it'll be in the list.    A related feature is that we should be able to help developers compare the   APIs in different versions. If we have an automatically generated table of   APIs by version  developers can choose to use (or recommend that their   clients use) the most stable channel that supports a particular API. Class   granularity would be a start  but we'd probably also want a way of showing   this kind of information for methods  events  etc. </pre>
