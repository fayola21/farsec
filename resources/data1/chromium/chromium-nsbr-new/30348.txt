<title>Issue 30348 -   chromium -    git cl: doesn't handle 'git mv' properly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had a file in my git repo:  login_manager/chromeos_login_manager/emit-login-prompt-ready.cc  I wanted to move it to  login_manager/chromeos_login_manager/emit_login_prompt_ready.cc    so  I cd'd to subdir and did 'git mv emit-login-prompt-ready.cc  emit_login_prompt_ready.cc'  which worked fine.  THen  I committed locally  and tried to 'git cl upload' my change    What is the expected result? It would upload my change appropriately      What happens instead? when I tried to &quot;git cl upload' from  login_manager/chromeos_login_manager  I got the following error:    Got error status from ['git'  'show'   'chromeos_login_manager/emit_login_prompt_ready.cc']:        When I cd'd back to the root of the repo and tried there  it sent up the  patch  but in place of the moved file  I saw this:  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/498006/diff/1/4">http://codereview.chromium.org/498006/diff/1/4</a>     </pre>
