<title>Issue 36479 -   chromium -    Do not save window position on window becoming main or for fullscreen windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we save window positions when the window becomes main and when the window is   closed.  This should probably change to saving on window move/resize and window close.  Make it   so.    We also save the original window's position for fullscreen windows.  I think that we should just not   save anything. </pre>
