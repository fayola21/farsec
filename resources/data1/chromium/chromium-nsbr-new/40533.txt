<title>Issue 40533 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Accept installing external extensions in Windows Registry from CurrentUser in addition to LocalMachine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045 (42898)                    1. Install an external extension via Windows Registry to   HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareGoogleChromeExtensions (instead of   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareGoogleChromeExtensions)      Extension does not get installed. Installing extensions via registry   requires to register them in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. This requires windows   admin privileges which trigger UAC dialogs or just fail silently.  Being able to register extensions under HKEY_CURRENT_USER as well would be   great and make this new feature really useful. BTW  Firefox does this   nicely :-). </pre>
