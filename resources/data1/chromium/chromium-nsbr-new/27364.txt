<title>Issue 27364 -   chromium -    Resource content-type is not available for 304 responses - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>  2. Open DevTools and enable resource tracking.  3. Reload the page.  4. Inspect resources. Some of them have 304 HTTP response code and no   content-type header. Currently we guess the type for some   resources(<a href="http://crbug.com/23260">http://crbug.com/23260</a>) but it should be fixed.    What is the expected output?  Resource content can be seen for each resource.    What do you see instead?  Content is blank for resources with 304 response(e.g. style.css).     </pre>
