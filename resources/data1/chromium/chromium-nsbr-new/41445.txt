<title>Issue 41445 -   chromium -    it should be possible to get the old blue theme back someway - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chromium 5.0.377.0 (44445)    there should be a way to choose between default blue/gray. or an option near   the link to the gallery in the preferences  or at least a theme in the   gallery with ex-default blue.     until chrome 5 stable comes out I guess you can't change the screenshot for   default theme  but adding a blue theme to the bottom of the list would be not   a big deal  and will helps out the dev/betas that dislike gray to get back   default blue. the third option would be a command line.. but a way to get   blue back is needed.    thanks </pre>
