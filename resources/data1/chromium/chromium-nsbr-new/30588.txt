<title>Issue 30588 -   chromium -    Window becomes permanently hidden when dragging tab into window with one tab that is about to close - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Open a couple of tabs in a window.  2.Load the attached extension.  3.Move the new tab (#1) to a new window.  4.Drag a tab (#2) from the old window to the new window and do not release.  5.Wait for tab #1 to close.  6.Drag tab #2 out to make another new window.      EXPECTED: There are now two windows.  ACTUAL: The window that tab #2 originally came from becomes hidden.   Clicking on the window in the taskbar does not bring it back.  The only way   to see it is to maximize it from the taskbar.  Clicking Restore when   maximized hides the window again.     Additional Info.  Does not occur on Mac. Haven't tried linux. I would suggest priority 3 on   this. </pre>
