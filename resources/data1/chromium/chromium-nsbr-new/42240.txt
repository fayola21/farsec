<title>Issue 42240 -   chromium -    Scrolling on a Bookmark bar subfolder - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.383.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45131">r45131</a>     QuickTime Player: 7.6.6    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Add more than 50 bookmarks in &quot;other bookmarks&quot; folder.  2. Make sure that the first 2 bookmarks are folders with multiple bookmarks/subfolders in them.  3. Open &quot;other bookmarks and scroll down till the folders with multiple bookmarks are at the top   of the screen.  4. Open a subfolder with multiple bookmarks  and play with it.    Expected:  The bookmarks should stay on the screen and not scroll down by themselves.    Actual:  The bookmarks list scroll down on their own.    Note:  This is same as <a title="Scrolling up on bookmark bar problem" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39791"> bug 39791 </a>  this time its a slightly difficult to repro.  I can share the test account info offline if you need it.   </pre>
