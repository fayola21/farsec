<title>Issue 40964 -   chromium -    Shift-End at beginning of wrapped line moves cursor to end of previous line - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Linux 5.0.371.0 (Official Build 43900) dev  and also broken on Windows   5.0.360.0      1. Type more than a line's worth of text into a text area  so that it wraps   onto a second line.  2. Move the cursor to the beginning of the second line.  3. Hit End and then Home  and see that the cursor jumps to the end of the   second line and then back to the beginning.  4. Hold Shift and hit End.      All of the text on the second line should be highlighted after typing Shift-  End.  Instead  the cursor moves back one space  to the end of the first   line  and  no text is highlighted.    This is maybe related to <a title="Shift-Home and Shift-End don't change selection as expected in textarea with wrapped text"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40709">issue 40709</a>. </pre>
