<title>Issue 43395 -   chromium -    Chrome seg faults on Linux when there's no network connection - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure who the bug should be assigned to  so I'm CC'ing some Linux   people.    Chrome version: 5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta  Linux version: standard Google Ubuntu installation for laptops  no wired   network connection (tried reproducing this on my Linux desktop too  but   couldn't figure out how to turn off the network connection without having   the entire system hang)    1. Disable the wireless connection  or do this while the laptop is trying   to acquire a connection.  2. Run 'google-chrome' in a terminal.  3. You get a seg fault.  4. Enable the wireless connection and wait for the laptop to acquire it.  5. Run 'google-chrome' in a terminal.  6. Chrome starts running  no seg fault.    I'm quite sure that I didn't have this problem ~3-4 weeks ago.   </pre>
