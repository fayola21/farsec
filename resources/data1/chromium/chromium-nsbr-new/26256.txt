<title>Issue 26256 -   chromium -    Show &quot;Generic FavIcon&quot; for no name bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.226.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30140">r30140</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Launch chrome. Bookmark any site which don't have favicon on the bar or folder     (e.g: www.sakshi.com )  2. Click the Star sign of the bookmark for getting the bubble.  3. Clear the name to make  no title bookmark.   4. Click Close.    Actual: Bookmark is not shown on the bookmark bar. Unless you hover on it assuming blindly the   location.    Expected: If we can show the &quot;Generic favicon&quot; as like windows and linux   It would be easy to   identify the location.    </pre>
