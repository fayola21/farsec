<title>Issue 34709 -   chromium -    Theme and buttons distorted - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) : Not Applicable  Other browsers tested: none  this is definitely Chromium only.        After a new update from the package manager (I am running Ubunt 9.10)  I   restarted my computer and there are suddenly 2 optoin icons and my theme is   distorted in such a way that I hardly can see the text on the taskbar.  The text next to the icons on my links toolbar cannot be read anymore.      Please see screenshot.    good luck and thanks for listening.    kind regards     Peter       </pre>
