<title>Issue 24578 -   chromium -    HTML5 drag and drop event object is not reporting ctrlKey/shiftKey states - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.25 (Official Build 27847)           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    Looking at HTML5 specification one can see that  DragEvent::initDragEvent(...) has arguments for special ctrl/shift key  states. Thus  I'm assuming browser generated DragEvent objects should  include them as well.    Note: tested only with &quot;drop&quot; event. </pre>
