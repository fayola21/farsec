<title>Issue 37894 -   chromium -    Duplicating / cloning a tab should skip interstitial navigation entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a normal page.  2. In the same tab  visit a bad SSL page that leads to an interstitial.  3. Right click on tab and Duplicate it.    What is the expected output?     The newly cloned tab should not have the interstitial page in its back or   forward history.    What do you see instead?    The new tab can go forward to the URL that causes the interstitial.  This   is inconsistent with hiding the interstitial in the original tab  and   visiting the bad SSL page in a second tab will cause the tab to spin until   the user makes a decision in the original tab.    This also leads to problems if you middle click the forward button.  (There   is currently a check that prevents cloning a tab by middle clicking on back   if an interstitial is shown  but there is no reason this is necessary.)   </pre>
