<title>Issue 38501 -   chromium -    Folder selection drop-down is obscured by &quot;bookmark added&quot; window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.307.11 (Official Build   39572) beta  Is this the most recent version: Most probably  OS + version: Ubuntu Hardy  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: Compiz  URLs (if relevant): any  Behavior in Linux Firefox: n/a  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): correct.      1. Go to any page  2. Click the star to add a bookmark  3. In &quot;bookmark added&quot;  click the Folder drop-down.      A list of folders should appear on top the &quot;bookmark added&quot; window.      The drop-down opens behind the &quot;bookmark added&quot; window. I'm unable to   change the folder.    I verified it on one Linux machine  but 2 different profiles: one with   bookmark sync and a theme installed  and one with a default theme  no   extensions and no bookmark sync.    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30065">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30065</a> may be somehow   related. </pre>
