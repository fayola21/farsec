<title>Issue 25145 -   chromium -    Clear Auto Download greyed out / can't use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      When I click on a link to open up a new web page or take me to a new web   page  things with the extension .php always download and save to my   presonal doc files  but I am not downloading anything. I am just trying to   browse the web and open web pages via links.  Also  when I go to options / Under The Hood to click on the auto-opening   settings  it is greyed out and won't let me access the button.   </pre>
