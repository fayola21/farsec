<title>Issue 32238 -   chromium -    Clicking back on a malware interstitial causes the &quot;bad&quot; page to be shown indefinitely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is *not* a security bug / risk*  more an annoying UI bug.    Go to a page that has a subresource from a bad page - e.g.   <a href="http://www.ianfette.com/bad.html">http://www.ianfette.com/bad.html</a> which contains an image from ianfette.org   (this is actually safe). When you hit &quot;back&quot; you will see the &quot;bad&quot; page   and it will stay there for a long time.    Hard to reproduce - Peter and I can both reproduce it sporadically. Not   sure if the navigation controller is still waiting on one of the requests   that got cancelled or what.      * Not a risk because even though the page shows  all the pending requests   were cancelled including the request for the malware subresource. </pre>
