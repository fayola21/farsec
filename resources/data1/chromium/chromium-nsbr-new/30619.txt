<title>Issue 30619 -   chromium -    content script not injected for pages loaded before installing extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0  After installing an extension  it's immediately available to new pages w/o   restarting Chrome. However  content scripts are not injected for pages loaded   before installing extension.  This may be considered a feature request  but it's important  otherwise we   have to explain to extension users that they need to reload the page. </pre>
