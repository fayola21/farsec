<title>Issue 31759 -   chromium -    about:version and About Google Chrome show incorrect channel when there are registry keys present @ HKCU and HKLM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555) --&gt; then mine says &quot;stable&quot; but it is supposed to be &quot;dev&quot; ?  URLs (if applicable) : about:version  or  Wrench menu &gt; About Google Chrome      1. Goto about:version  or  Wrench menu &gt; About Google Chrome      My about:version shows:  Google Chrome	4.0.288.1 (Official Build 35555) stable  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.2  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.288.1 Safari/532.8    My Wrench menu &gt; About Google Chrome shows as in the attached screenshot.    I expect see &quot;dev&quot; after the version since 4.0.288.1 is Dev channel release.      Instead I see &quot;stable&quot;.    I assume I am clearly on Dev channel since I was automatically upgraded to 4.0.288.1.  Why doesn't the channel display properly in   the info panes? </pre>
