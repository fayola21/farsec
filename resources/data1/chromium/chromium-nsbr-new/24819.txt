Launch Chrome. Browse youtube.com  hulu.com...  2. These Search engines were automatically added in the list with browsing  under Chrome--&gt;   Preferences--&gt; Default search --&gt; Manage--&gt; Search Engines.  3. Make default all these newly browser added search engines once. Go back and make default   &quot;google.com&quot;( standard default search engine )  3. Perform clear browsing data --&gt; Everything    Actual:  Clear Browsing data failed to clear automatically browser added search engines.     Note: If browser added automatic search engines are not made default atleast one time. They   were cleared with &quot;clear browsing data&quot;. This issue applies only the entries which were made   default in past or present.    What is the expected output?   Search engines which were added automatically to the browser while browsing should clear when   performed clear browsing data.    Reproducible on all platforms.   </pre>
