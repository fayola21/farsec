<title>Issue 38789 -   chromium -    lifeinthefastlane.ca crash on left click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 (Official Build 42060) dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca">http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to the URL  2. Left click on the page somewhere  anywhere seems to work.      Anything but a crash. I'm guessing there's some (possibly poorly written)  javascript that is supposed to do something. Regardless  it shouldn't   crash.      &quot;Aw  Snap!&quot; crash   </pre>
