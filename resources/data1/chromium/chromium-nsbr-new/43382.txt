<title>Issue 43382 -   chromium -    Support the &quot;persistent&quot; permission in extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to support the &quot;persistent&quot; permission in extensions to allow them   to keep running beyond the last browser window closing.    The two main tasks are:    1) Keep the browser process alive if there's a long-lived extension loaded   (extension with the &quot;persistent&quot; permission) even if all windows are closed.  2) Shutdown the persistent extension if the user explicitly exits the app   (via the Exit menu).    This functionality should be hidden behind a command line flag for now   (disabled by default). </pre>
