<title>Issue 31540 -   chromium -    Restore last non-incognito window after closing all but incognito windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If Chrome is set to &quot;restore my tabs on startup&quot;  and a user has an incognito   and a non-incognito window open  and closes the non-incognito window:  * Closing Chrome and then restarting should &quot;restore&quot; the last non-incognito   window  * Hitting ctrl-n should &quot;restore&quot; the last non-incognito window    This bug was originally reported as <a title="Restore tabs on startup doesn't work when close an incognito window after the main window." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2620"> bug 2620 </a> and closed WontFix.  However    there wasn't strong rationale given in that bug  and in discussing with sky    it sounds like we actually already do the &quot;desired&quot; behavior when the only   remaining windows are app mode.  Consistency with app mode seems important   and I think that behavior is less surprising and less likely to cause   dataloss as well. </pre>
