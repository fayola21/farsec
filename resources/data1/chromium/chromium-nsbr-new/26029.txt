<title>Issue 26029 -   chromium -    Has problems in displaying http://bb.com.br/ - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Linux) and 3.0.195.27 (Windows)  URL                  : <a href="http://bb.com.br/">http://bb.com.br/</a>      Firefox 3.5.3 Windows and Linux: OK                       IE 8 Windows: OK  Opera 10.10 Beta Build 4672 Linux: OK      1. Try to open <a href="http://bb.com.br/">http://bb.com.br/</a>        See the page like bb3.png        The page is displayed like bb1.png (more common) or like bb2.png  Confirmed on both Linux and Windows versions.    It seems that the page is not properly rendered  but it's displayed as if   it was a pure text file. On any other tested browser it is properly   displayed.  See bb2.png  for example. We can see that it displays the source code of   the page  instead rendering it.  It's necessary to refresh <a href="http://bb.com.br/">http://bb.com.br/</a> a lot of times to get one   &quot;valid&quot; rendered page. Reloading the page (pressing F5 or the reload   button) doesn't work too. </pre>
