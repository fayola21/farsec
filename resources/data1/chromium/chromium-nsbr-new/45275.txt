<title>Issue 45275 -   chromium -    Cleanup app shutdown to support background pages outlasting the last open browser window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Background discussion here:    <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/612b6b9f36a43ea9#    In a nutshell  when background pages are loaded we want to keep the browser running even after   the last window is closed  but still allow the user to shutdown the application explicitly via Quit/Exit.    This means we need to generate APP_TERMINATING on all platforms during shutdown  and we need   to change it so the notification is sent out *before* the browser process ref count is zero  not after. </pre>
