<title>Issue 29842 -   chromium -    Support on-demand  per client  per data type sync on/off switch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Two use cases:  1) Command line flags to enable syncing for individual data types during   early development  2) UI allowing the user to pick and choose which parts of their profile they   want to sync *from their current client*.     (2) may be Chromium specific (and not chromium-os)  I don't know.    The current proposal for this is to always sync all schema-supported data   types at the syncapi layer  but do so in a &quot;passive  read-only&quot; fashion.    What this means is that for a client that is not syncing Preferences (for   example)  the syncapi instance will actually receive and store Preferences   data and changes from sync servers  but it will not propagate these   changes into the browser nor will it listen for any changes to Preferences   from the browser  because no ChangeProcessor will be created/registered   for Preferences unless the user chooses to enable Preferences by (1) or (2).    As such  beyond <a title="Add a per-data type ChangeProcessor dispatch mechanism (for syncapi-&gt;chrome)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29839"> issue 29839 </a>  there is really not much of a work item   besides establishing proof of concept and working out any kinks that arise.   </pre>
