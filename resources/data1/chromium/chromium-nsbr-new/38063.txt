<title>Issue 38063 -   chromium -    page-break-before does not print on separate pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 dev      Firefox 3.x: OK        I have a fairly basic html page that uses H1 { page-break-before: always }   to layout the page such that each section should print on a different sheet   of paper.  This works fine in FireFox  but currently seems broken in   Chrome.  When chrome prints  the pages wind up insufficiently spaced and   getting split between sheets of paper.  I've tried multiple printers and   multiple computers; in every case firefox has worked and chrome not.    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Signs&lt;/title&gt;  &lt;style&gt; H1 { page-break-before: always } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   sign 1  &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;  sign 2  &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;  sign 3  &lt;/body&gt;   </pre>
