<title>Issue 38723 -   chromium -    Text Drag Causes Tab to Freeze - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) dev    Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Highlight text  2. Attempt to drag the text to above the omnibar (Like you can normally do   search with that text)  3. Try to do something in the same tab      An arrow appears next to the furthest left tab and when you let go of the   mouse  Google Chrome searches for the text you highlighted and dragged.   Then you return to the original tab and everything is cool.      You can't drag the text  it doesn't search  and the page you go the text   from freezes completely. Even after a refresh.    </pre>
