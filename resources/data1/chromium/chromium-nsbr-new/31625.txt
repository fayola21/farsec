<title>Issue 31625 -   chromium -    Mitigate failure to sanitize user input in links on server side by warning the user when s/he clicks on a link containing 'username:password@' - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A buggy website may allow user input to be injected into a url without proper   filtering  which could allow an attacker to create a link that replaces the   original hostname by adding '@new_hostname'; the link would become   'http://original_hostname@new_hostname' The original hostname would be   treated as a username instead of the hostname.    MSIE 8.0 completely removes functionality for such links: they cannot be   clicked  opened in new tabs  or anything.    FireFox 3.5.6 warns the user about this with a popup when clicking such a   link.    I do not want to use a popup  as they train users to click &quot;OK&quot;. </pre>
