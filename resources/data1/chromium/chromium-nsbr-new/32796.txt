<title>Issue 32796 -   chromium -    Tab Dragging Does Not Respect Spaces - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.295.0 dev  OS version: 10.6.2        1. Open a browser window in Space 1. Navigate to the URL of your choice.   We'll call this &quot;window A&quot; and &quot;tab A&quot;.  2. Move to Space 2 (leaving window A in Space 1). Open a browser window in   Space 2. Navigate to the URL of your choice. We'll call this &quot;window B&quot; and   &quot;tab B&quot;.  3. Drag tab B out of window B and move it to where the tab bar of window A   would be if you were in Space 1; do not change spaces to do this. (If you   have windows open other than A and B  make sure they do not obscure the   tab-bar of A no matter what Space they're in.)          Chrome should respect Spaces  and therefore it should create a new window   in Space 2 containing only tab B.          The user sees the tab vanish; the tab has attached itself to window A  in   Space 1.    Trippy  man. </pre>
