<title>Issue 33144 -   chromium -    Browser freezes when loading the gmail login page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  OS + version :       Ubuntu LInux 8.04   CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  window manager :       XFCE 4  URLs (if applicable) : www.gmail.com       Behavior in Firefox 2.x :  OK      1. Start the Google Chrome browser   from the command line  2. Enter the url : www.gmail.com  3. Wait      The login page should appear  and the user should be able to enter the user  and the password.        The login page appears  but the mouse cursor shows &quot;working&quot; (hourglass)  and the edit boxes are inaccessible : it's not possible to activate them  with click or enter anything.    After a while  Chrome displays the popup &quot;The following pages have become  unresponsive&quot; with choices &quot;Kill pages&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot;.    After I click &quot;Kill pages&quot;:   - the current tab displays &quot;Aw snap  Something went wrong while displaying  the webpage&quot;  - i close the browser (with the X button in the corner)  - only the graphical window is closed  - the processes are still hanging :     21004 pts/2    Sl+    0:23 /usr/bin/google-chrome     21007 pts/2    S+     0:00 /usr/bin/google-chrome     21008 pts/2    S+     0:00 /opt/google/chrome/chrome --type=zygote    - in the terminal window is frozen until i kill the processes.  Ctrl-C does  _NOT_ work. The only way to get the cmd line prompt is to 'kill' all the  PIDs from another console.               </pre>
