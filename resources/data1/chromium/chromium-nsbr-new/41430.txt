<title>Issue 41430 -   chromium -    Support IDN in host content settings exceptions dialogs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split out of <a title="Test content and geolocation settings for IDN" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40278"> bug  40278 </a>    The host content settings dialogs do not format hostnames e.g. to map IDN -&gt; unicode when   displaying them in the exceptions dialogs.  This includes the  the &quot;cookies &amp; other site data&quot; tree dialog  the modal cookie prompt popup   dialog  and geolocation pseudo tree dialog.    Aside: from what I can tell entering an IDN url into the cookie exceptions dialog  for example  (via   add) does not actually match hosts from that domain   </pre>
