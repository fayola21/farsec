<title>Issue 28260 -   chromium -    NaCl: Implement nacl_nice for Windows Vista/7 using MMCSS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (This is a tracking issue for a task assigned to ilewis@google.com)    nacl_nice requires special care on Windows systems because it is possible   for a user process to boost its priority high enough to DOS the system.    The answer to this seems to be the multimedia class scheduler (MMCSS). The   MMCSS service can boost priorities on the user's behalf  but will   deprioritize threads that run too long.     Example:    // Register the current thread with MMCSS.  // Must use a well-known &quot;multimedia task&quot; name   // e.g. Audio  Games  Pro Audio  etc.  //  HANDLE hMmTask = AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics(       L&quot;Audio&quot;  &amp;taskIndex );    // Ask for a priority boost.   //  AvSetMmThreadPriority(hMmTask  AVRT_PRIORITY_CRITICAL);    // Inform MMCSS that this thread has finished its high-priority  // tasks and no longer needs the boost.   //  AvRevertMmThreadCharacteristics(hMmTask);     </pre>
