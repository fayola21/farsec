<title>Issue 30922 -   chromium -    Form method case-sensitive when loaded with ajax - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)       Firefox 3.0.16: OK    Form method seems to become case sensitive when the form is loaded into an   (XHTML-)page by Ajax request.    Lowercase &quot;post&quot; works fine. Uppercase &quot;POST&quot; doesn't.    W3 states that method VALUE is case-insensitive. </pre>
