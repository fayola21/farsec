<title>Issue 36298 -   chromium -    Need to Have the Chrome Native HTML Dialog API Accessible from a NPAPI Plugin. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create an NPAPI plugin.  2. Like gears plugin  we would like to show the permission request page to   the user  whether to allow the access or not.  3. The permission page is in HTML format  so it will be cross platform and   will have consistent look and feel.    See Chrome -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Change Gears Settings.   This is exactly the kind of native HTML dialog that I would like to have (   both the modal and modeless ones ).      What is the expected result? What happens instead?    Google Gears in Chrome has the ability to use the show_html_dialog_modal()   method  exposed in chrome_plugin_api.h. Unfortunately this method is made   somehow ( i.e. hardcoded ) so it will work properly only for Gears.    While  when accessed / used from my own NPAPI plugin  I'm able to make the   dialog displayed with HTML content inside  but the javascript binding part   doesn't work. I'm unable to communicate between the javascript running   inside this dialog with the NPAPI plugin.    Using the javascript:showHTMLDialog() is not a solution as well because   there's the address bar shown and also browser will complain about un-  responsive script when it's shown for a bit longer time.      <b>Please provide
