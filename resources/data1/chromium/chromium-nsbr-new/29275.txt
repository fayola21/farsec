<title>Issue 29275 -   chromium -    Failure to degrade unresponsive page messages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to one of these &quot;active&quot; web sites (gmail  orkut  NYTimes  etc.)   during a period when the network is effectively &quot;down&quot;.     (Orkut particularly &quot;down&quot; 091202 @ 11:00 EST and the window   demonstrating that error was popping up at 30-60 second intervals!).  2. Attempt to refresh or browse pages on said sites  3. Chromium Pop-up Appears:  &quot;Chromium&quot;  &quot;The following page(s) have become unresponsive.  You can wait for them to   become responsive or kill them.&quot;      Due to the fact that network outages may an extended period of time to   resolve  my current problem is at an outage that prevents my from   connecting to the gmail/orkut sites -- it appears to stop (given a   traceroute) at:  18  vw-in-f86.1e100.net (74.125.113.86)  77.135 ms  80.797 ms  89.484 ms    Given the expected/anticipated delays in the network adjusting to the   problem -- the browser should be aware of this.  It should not be popping   up a window every minutes with the message described above.  In theory it   should have a graduated delay pattern -- 2 minutes  4 minutes  8 minutes    etc. up to perhaps 30-60 minutes.  This is essential in cases where ones   home router goes on the fritz and needs to be rebooted (e.g. LinkSys from   Verizon) as they often do and prevent any network communications at all.  I   should still be able to browse local/cached files (e.g. file:///) etc.   without being constantly annoyed by the browser popups informing me   (indirectly) about Javascript problems -- which I would like to turn off in   general anyway -- in part precisely because of this problem and others like   it (needless use of the CPU).      Popup windows displaying the errors occur frequently -- once every 1-2   minutes -- generally requiring mouse movement/click activity to alleviate.    The notices are useful -- but after a while they become   burdensome/boring/annoying.    <b>Please provide
