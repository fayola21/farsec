<title>Issue 31352 -   chromium -    Poor frame-rate in full-screen Netflix playback - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Watching Netflix instant-play (which requires a user-agent override) on my 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo   laptop  I'm seeing poor frame rate. What's really weird is that I'm only really seeing it in full-screen   mode  and we shouldn't be part of the drawing pipeline in full-screen since it's a full-screen   window opened by the plugin  and not passing through our multi-process architecture.    Non-Netflix Silverlight full-screen video examples would be helpful  since I'm not sure how specific   this issue is. </pre>
