<title>Issue 41912 -   chromium -    DCHECK when activating menus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Click on &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; to roll down (a long) menu with bookmarks  2. Then immediately click on the icon &quot;Customize and Cotrol Chromium        Whatever but no crash      Whole desktop graphics is blocked for input (both mouse and keyboard)  (but the applet on the bar - e.g. HW monitor RPM applet - still live)    The only help was &quot;Ctrl-Alt-F1&quot; shell  log as administrator   and do &quot;killall -KILL chrome&quot;    There comes &quot;xmessage&quot; window with backtrace   this windows survives the &quot;killall&quot;   but it is not possible to &quot;cut and past&quot; or otherwise copy from it!!!!  (later I try to install a screenshot utility and send a screenshot)    If you click somewhere else in browser window (no icon) between 1. and 2.  the rolled down menu disappers and no crash happens after 2.      <b>Please provide
