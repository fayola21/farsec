<title>Issue 24984 -   chromium -    When attaching a tab during D&amp;D  consider transition for the content area from the drop position to the target position - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is for a future release since cole thinks it's tricky to get right.    If I detach a tab and then attach it to the tabstrip  the content area of the   dragged tab isn't lined up over the content area of the browser window being   attached to.    When I let go my mouse  the content area just snaps into the attached   browser window. It'd be nice if there were some kind of transition here. </pre>
