<title>Issue 44709 -   chromium -    Very Bad Theora Implementation for years!  (Shame  shame). DO NOT IGNORE XIPH - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Chromium 5.0.375.38 (Developer Build 46659) Ubuntu  WebKit:         533.4  V8:        	2.1.10.13    User Agent:     Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.38 Safari/533.4  Command Line:   /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser    URLs: <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite">http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite</a>        Safari 4:     NA  Firefox 3.x:  OK  Works perfectly  Theora implemented perfectly  IE 7:         NA  IE 8:         NA        1. Just check these test links on the above website  god damn. Is it so   hard to click a link provided by the maker of Therora?  2. If you cannot implement Theora for years despite the test website and   everything explained by Xiph how can we expect VP8 to be any better?  3. Fix implementation of Theora (xiph gave you the test website and links   and you ingnored him!). Compare it with the perfect implementation in   Firefox. Cannot do it? Too LAZY?? COPY IT FROM FIREFOX!!!      Fix the implementation of Theora (add latest 1.1)  How?:  See the test on:  <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite">http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite</a>      Comment:  Is it so f...ing (sorry) difficult to click those links?? We see that an   open source browser is not so much opened as it cannot play properly   Theora? I don't care if VP8 is coming. How can we expect quality from VP8   and webM if already the best (so far) open source codec hasn't been   properly implemented for years in an allegedly best open source web   browser. Want to be better than Firefox? Guess what! You are not better.   Bad  bad  lazy chromium coders. What does it say about the quality of your   work? You should be ashamed.    Copy Theora implementation from Firefox if you do not know what you are   doing.    GO to:   <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite">http://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTestsuite</a>  and read what's there and click links for test.     </pre>
