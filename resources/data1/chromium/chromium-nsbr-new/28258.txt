<title>Issue 28258 -   chromium -    Windows: problems with (regular) bookmark bar at window border on certain themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install the Brushed or Cork Board (or probably some others as well) theme.  2. Go to a normal (non-NTP) page and enable the bookmark bar if necessary   (Ctrl-B).      At the edge of the browser window  the bookmark bar should match the   toolbar (and also the border of the content area). It doesn't.    This is the 4.0.249.0 dev channel on Vista. </pre>
