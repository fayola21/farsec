<title>Issue 30495 -   chromium -    Deadlock in Google Earth plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See http://b/2242480 for the full bug.    Here's the repro scenario    1. using chrome  open  <a href="http://earth-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/drive-">http://earth-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/drive-</a>  simulator/index.html  2. if you're prompted to install the Google Earth Plugin  go ahead and  do it -- the bug occurs with all plugin versions that I've tested  3. click &quot;Go!&quot; to retrieve driving directions  4. after the camera zooms into San Francisco  click &quot;Start&quot; to start  the car animating  5. click &quot;+&quot; twice to set the replay speed to 4x  6. wait        This is fixed in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34593">r34593</a>.  Not sure if want to merge this to M4 or not.  I   imagine it's pretty high priority for Earth folks. </pre>
