<title>Issue 35374 -   chromium -    Dead tabs after restoring a multi-tab Chrome session - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 dev    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Tabs reopen without problems  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Tabs reopen without problems  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: *Untested*      1. Enable &quot;On startup: Reopen the pages that were open last&quot; under   preferences.  2. Open a window with multiple tabs  say 8 to 10 or so.  Then quit Chrome.  3. Reopen Chrome.      Expect all tabs to load / reopen properly.      Very often  one (or more?) of the tabs reopened will not load properly.  It   will instead remain blank  and the &quot;spinner&quot; will continuously spin slowly in   the counterclockwise direction.    As far as I can tell  which tab goes bad in this way seems to be random.    If you attempt to close this dead tab  the entire browser crashes! </pre>
