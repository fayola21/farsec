<title>Issue 36847 -   chromium -    uploading large file locks up browser  spins cpu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta (Mac)  WebKit:	532.9  V8:	2.0.6.6             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. attempt to upload a large file (&gt; 15mb) via a standard html form post  (no javascript involved) to a web server (that is set up to handle such a  large file)  2. the browser becomes unresponsive and upload never completes  3. cpu usage is shown as &gt; 100% on a core2duo cpu  4. eventually the frozen chrome dialog is shown  offering to kill the  unresponsive page. clicking wait over and over sometimes allows the file to  upload  but not usually. closing the tab does not reduce cpu usage--the  browser must be Force Quit.  5. this occurs even on a very fast network where the upload of a 10mb file  should only take a second or two.  6. uploading a smaller file (say  5mb) seems to work just fine.      the form post should proceed until complete in a timely manner. This works  fine in Chrome 4.0.249.89 for windows (official build 38071)  as well as  FF  Safari  IE.     </pre>
