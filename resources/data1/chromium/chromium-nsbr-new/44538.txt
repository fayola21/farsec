<title>Issue 44538 -   chromium -    Circular dependency between base/base.gyp and base/allocator/allocator.gyp - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> base.gyp depends on allocator/allocator.gyp and allocator/allocator.gyp depends on   base.gyp:dynamic_annotations.    This only happens on linux because only linux has the dependency from base.gyp to allocator.gyp.    This works fine right now because circular dependency checks are disabled in gyp_chromium  but   they are not disabled in gyp_webkit (used by an upstream checkout).    Probably the easiest way to fix this is to move the dynamic_annotations into it's own gyp file. I'll try   to whip up a patch for this. </pre>
