<title>Issue 40557 -   chromium -    Chrome shuts down as soon as you launch it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My sister complained to me that Chrome shuts down every time she tries to   open it. She'd see the Chrome window flash briefly on screen and then   disappear.    I took a look and found that she had session restore activated and only one   tab open when she last used it. That tab was a form that on submit did a   window.close.     So  every time she'd start the browser  that tab with window.close would   get restored and since no other tab was available  it would result in the   browser closing.    Essentially  the only way to recover from this is to quickly (after   launching Chrome) press Ctrl+T to get a new tab in before the other tab   closes. This took me about 5 tries to do. And I don't think regular users   are going to figure this out. :)     </pre>
