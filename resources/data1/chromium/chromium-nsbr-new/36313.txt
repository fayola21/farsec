View any web page on a newer model (2009+) MacBookPro with 10.5.x  2. Inadvertently two-finger pinch the trackpad      Want to be able to have Chrome ignore such input.  There is no system preference to make the OS not send these events. Note   in the attached screenshot there is no checkbox to turn off the pinch   gesture.  I make the gesture by mistake at least 5x a day and it is very annoying to   have to figure out I need to undo it.       </pre>
