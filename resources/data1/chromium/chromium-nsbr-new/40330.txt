<title>Issue 40330 -   chromium -    Store chrome-linux builds as .tgz or .tar.bz2 instead of .zip - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I use the unzip utility to decompress chrome-linux.zip  the permissions   are corrupted.  I'm not exactly new to Linux  so if I can't figure out how   to decompress these  I'm sure there are others who can't.    It seems more reasonable to use standard formats like .tgz or .tar.bz2 for   Linux. </pre>
