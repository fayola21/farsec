<title>Issue 31622 -   chromium -    Keypresses sometimes resent to the web. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug probably needs a better title  and it manifests itself in a number of different ways.    Here's one possible repro case:    1) Open Google Reader.  Pick an item and press &quot;v&quot; to open it in a new tab.  2) Press Cmd-W to close this newly opened tab.  Without releasing Cmd  press tab and switch to   a different application.  3) Notice that the just-closed tab has been reopened.    And another:    1) Open anything in tab 1  reader in tab 2.  Be in reader.  2) Press &quot;2&quot; in reader to switch to list view  or click on &quot;Show: list&quot; in the upper right.  3) Press Cmd-1 to switch to the first tab.  Release Cmd.  4) Press Cmd-2 to switch back to reader.  Without releasing Cmd  press tab and switch to a   different application.  5) Notice that reader has switched to expanded mode  as if you had pressed &quot;1&quot; in reader.    It feels as though the last keypress in a tab is somehow resent when Cmd-tabbing.  I'm filing   both these bugs as one because I think they have the same root cause. </pre>
