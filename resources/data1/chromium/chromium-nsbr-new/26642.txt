<title>Issue 26642 -   chromium -    &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; box hides from all opened windows when the new windows opened from it are Closed/Minimized. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.229.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30554">r30554</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Launch chrome Open 3- 4 windows  2. Perform Chrome -&gt; About Google Chrome  and  click any link on the About Box.  3. Close ( Cmd+W)  or Minimize the newly opened window.    Actual: About Box hides from all the opened chrome windows. It stays as the last opened one.    What is the expected output?  How Windows and Linux behaves ?  About box should stay after the newly opened window ( The About box link related window )    Note: When we drag new window down to view the about box  we can view the about box next to   it. But this issue only happens when newly generated window is closed or minimized.   </pre>
