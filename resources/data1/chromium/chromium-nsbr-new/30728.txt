<title>Issue 30728 -   chromium -    Need to audit Windows-specific portions of sync code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> While looking through the guts of the sync code  it looks like there's still a few   places where we do &quot;#if defined(OS_WIN)&quot; and do nothing otherwise.  Some of   these places look important.  I need to audit the code for these blocks to see   what we're missing (for OS X at least). </pre>
