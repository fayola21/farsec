<title>Issue 23575 -   chromium -    Mac: bookmarks bar folder buttons (and menu) need some love - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. The menu isn't aligned with anything.  2. You should be able to click-hold (but not drag! -- see below) and have  the menu appear.    Complication:  3. Eventually we'll want to be able to drag the buttons on the bookmarks  bar. So dragging to open menus would conflict with that. This also requires  that the click-hold time to be quite long.    For comparison:  4. Both Safari (4.0) and Camino (2.0b4)'s folder buttons behave in this  way. (Safari also has a down-arrowhead  upon which you can mouse down and  immediately get the menu; evidently  you can't drag the button if you click  there. Thankfully  we don't have this craziness.)      1. is possibly coincident with crbug.com/17608. 3. is (I think)  crbug.com/17609. That leaves 2. (Perhaps we could modify and use  ClickHoldButtonCell for the buttons on the bookmarks bar? It can already  detect click-holding and dragging; functionality just needs to be separated  and expanded a bit.) </pre>
