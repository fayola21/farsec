<title>Issue 25873 -   chromium -    Mac: weirdness on prefs-&gt;personal stuff-&gt;get themes if window modal active - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Cmd-O to get a window modal.  2. Open the prefs dialog  select Personal Stuff  click Get themes.      Probably  if a window modal dialog is up  the themes page should open in a   new window. Instead  it opens a new tab under the window modal dialog    which isn't so useful.    I thought I got it to crash with this  but I can't currently reproduce it. I   wouldn't be surprised if it could lead to a crash though.    (This is on <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30069">r30069</a> off the trunk.) </pre>
