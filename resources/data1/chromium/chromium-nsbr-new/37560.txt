<title>Issue 37560 -   chromium -    Port SSLClientSocketNSS to use Windows CryptoAPI for SSL client authentication - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a title="Use SSLClientSocketNSS on Windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28744"> issue 28744 </a>  I did the bulk of the work of porting SSLClientSocketNSS  to Windows.    Since we want to support client certificates and smart cards using  Windows CryptoAPI  the remaining work is to port SSLClientSocketNSS  to use Windows CryptoAPI instead of NSS for SSL client authentication.  This may require modifying NSS's SSL library. </pre>
