<title>Issue 33093 -   chromium -    Chrome always crashes on the startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : dev version      1. Start Chrome      It crashes with the popup &quot;Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now?&quot;    It crashes regardless of whether I try opening main shortcut or any of  application shortcuts.    it crashes consistently  already 10 times.    Apparently the only fix now would be complete cleanup of the profile. I  would keep it around for a while for a possibility to debug. </pre>
