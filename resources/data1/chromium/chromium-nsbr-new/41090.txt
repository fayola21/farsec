<title>Issue 41090 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Put 'alt' text of image on clipboard when image is selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When an image is selected  please put the 'alt' attribute of that image on   the clipboard. This is useful in case I am pasting to a field which does not   allow images.     One use case which comes to mind is when I am pasting conversations from   <a href="http://meebo.com/">http://meebo.com/</a> which have emoticons - in Google Chrome  when I select an   emoticon and paste it in a text box  nothing is pasted. In Firefox  the alt   text is pasted.  </pre>
