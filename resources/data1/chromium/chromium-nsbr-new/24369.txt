<title>Issue 24369 -   chromium -    new tab test should include actual history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The new tab tests use the typical history profile in   chrome/test/data/profiles/typical_history.  That profile has some randomly   generated URLs in its history.  Ideally  the new tab page would populate   the thumbnails based on these values.  However  the new tab page only uses   the last 90 days for computing the most visited URLs.  Since the profile   was generated in late 2008  none of them show up.    One possibility is to have UITest migrate the dates in the History database   before starting the test (in UITest::LaunchBrowser  near the   RewritePreferencesFile call).  This would make the tests a bit slower  but   that's probably ok.    Using the Jank label because it makes it harder to measure new tab page   jank since it's mostly testing a new profile. </pre>
