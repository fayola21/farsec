<title>Issue 41059 -   chromium -    Bookmark sync broken (between stable and unstable versions?) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045    I have installations of Chrome at multiplace places  both the stable and the   developer versions. I turned on the synchronization of   Preferences/Themes/Autofill settings in the devel versions.    It seems to me now  that the stable versions don't properly sync their   bookmarks for a while (the devel versions do  between themselves). The stable   versions tell me (incorrectly) that bookmarks are synchronized  though.    If there is any way I can debug the situation  just let me know. </pre>
