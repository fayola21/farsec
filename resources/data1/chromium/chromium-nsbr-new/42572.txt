<title>Issue 42572 -   chromium -    When the buildbot is forced kill a process  we should have a red step. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We were recently getting build failures because the chrome_launcher.exe   process was not closed properly by some failing tests. rev 45591 added this   process to the list of the process we want to kill before we start a build    but it would be nice to know it was left behind  so we should have a red step   somewhere in the waterfall when we are forced to kill such a process.    <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45591">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=45591</a>   </pre>
