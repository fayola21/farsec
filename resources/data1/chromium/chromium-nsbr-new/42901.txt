<title>Issue 42901 -   chromium -    Relax cached media re-validations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently we re-validate every cached media resource to avoid surprises if we   don't actually have the whole resource.    We could relax this requirement and just perform the regular http freshness   test. This will reduce latency and allow playback of cached media without a   network connection at the expense of possible errors mid-playback if the   server doesn't cooperate. </pre>
