<title>Issue 32090 -   chromium -    Inspect element window : &quot;Search elements&quot; box hides into the window when &quot;Not Found&quot; label show up - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.295.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35884">r35884</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Open any web page and get the Inspect element window  2. Type some stuff ( eg: abcd ) in the search element box.    Actual: &quot;Search element&quot; box hides in to the window since &quot;Not found&quot; label shows up before the search element field.  ( Screen shot attached )    What is the expected output?   &quot;Search element&quot; field should not hide in to the window. It would be nice if the default size of the window allows(   increasing the window width) the element field not to get hided when &quot;Not found&quot; label show up.     Note: Expanding the window unhides back with no issue.      -Reproducible in all platforms. </pre>
