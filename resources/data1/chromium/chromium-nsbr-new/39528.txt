<title>Issue 39528 -   chromium -    New bookmark manager is (approximately) ten(s) times slower than the previous one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Windows XP SP3      1. Use bookmark manager      Bookmark manager should be fast.      Bookmark manager is very slow.    I started to use chrome because of very fast bookmark manager. I have   approximately 2-3 thousands bookmarks. Previous bookmark manager (version   with own window) was blazing fast. It reacted without delay. The new   bookmark manager is laggy and slow. When I change folder I wait seconds   than the bookmarks are loaded. I almost can't use it at all.    Make it quick and/or provide option for using old bookmark manager. </pre>
