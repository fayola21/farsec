<title>Issue 46158 -   chromium -    User script with ISO-8859-1-encoded character is silently ignored - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (46659) (Linux)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://jk.gs/foo.user.js">http://jk.gs/foo.user.js</a>  <a href="http://jk.gs/foo2.user.js">http://jk.gs/foo2.user.js</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK    Chromium 5.0.342.9 (43360) (Linux): OK      1. Install one of the above user scripts (first is encoded in UTF-8  second in ISO-8859-1).  2. Navigate to any website.      For both scripts: the website displays as normal and an alert box saying &quot;hi!&quot; pops up.      For the ISO-8859-1 script (foo2.user.js)  no alert box pops up and the user script is not even listed in the scripts tab in Developer Tools. No error messages are provided.    While it might generally be a good idea to recognise badly encoded user scripts  silently dropping them doesn't seem like an optimal solution. I don't have an idea for The Perfect Solution but perhaps someone else has an idea. </pre>
