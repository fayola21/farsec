<title>Issue 35021 -   chromium -    System-level test for Negotiate/NTLM - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Need to add an automated system level test for Negotiate/NTLM which   exercises the system SSPI and GSSAPI libraries.    The current thought is to add a VMWare image snapshot which includes an   ActiveDirectory service for a test domain  an IIS server with authentication   enabled  and probably an Apache server with SPNEGO enabled.    The system-level tests will drive the net library and intercept requests for   populating the username/password fields. The tests need to be set up to   point to the correct ActiveDirectory/KDC - maybe via DNS SRV intercepts? </pre>
