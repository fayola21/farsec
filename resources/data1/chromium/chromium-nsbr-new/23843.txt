<title>Issue 23843 -   chromium -    Bookmark bar context menu shows copy for folders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testing-102.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.221.0  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32.18      1. Create a folder on book mark bar .   2. Add few book marks to the folder.  3. Right click on the folder.    What is the expected output ?  As copy does not work on book mark folder it should not be displayed.    Or     Copy should copy the folder name to clipboard  as edit does.    What do you see instead?  In the context menu Copy is displayed  which is non functional. </pre>
