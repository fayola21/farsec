<title>Issue 35630 -   chromium -    Make client side code handle lost context. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A client side GL context needs to check for &quot;lost context&quot;. This could happen   at any time. Notification needs to happen at 2 places    Anytime the client syncs with the service.    There also needs to be a way to tell the client  even when it is not actively   syncing  that the context was lost.    When the context is lost no more commands should be written  any calls the to   GL emulation should fail with GL_CONTEXT_LOST  the client must create a new   context at that point.    This will probably require a bit of work on the GPUProcess as well. </pre>
