<title>Issue 33630 -   chromium -    Serious pasting problems in Gmail (HTML-formatted text pastes in larger font than original) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 and 4.0.302.2/dev  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com  OS version               : 10.5.8            1. Go to Gmail.com and log in.     2. Increase font size in your Chrome Mac by pressing Command-+ a few   times.  The larger the font size  the more pronounced the problem will be.    3. Copy a segment of any HTML email into clipboard.    4. Paste that copied segment into a new email.  You'll notice that the   pasted text is shown in a much larger font size than it's supposed to.    (see attached video)        Text pasted in the same font size as originally.        (see above) </pre>
