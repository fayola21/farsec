<title>Issue 28840 -   chromium -    Navigation is sometimes ignored for a very short time after tab creation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12      1. Open a new tab  by hitting cmd-t  2. Very quickly (&lt; 0.3s) enter an URL  by pasting one in or by using an   autocompletion that pops up for 1 or 2 characters        Chrome should open that page.        Sometimes  chrome ignores this and clears the omnibox again. When   entering the URL again and hitting enter  it works.    I feel that some race is going on and that the navigation is ignored if it   happens quick enough. When trying to repro this  be sure to &quot;use&quot; your   current new-tab-process by navigating to something in all empty tabs    that increases the chances of observing this.    I know this is a somewhat fuzzy bug  but I see this more or less reliably  so   I'm filing this for tracking.    It's possible I've seen this on Linux too.    jam's patch to launch renderers asynchronously might hide this some of   the time too  don't know if it's merged on the 249 branch.    cc'd people: Does this sound familiar? Trungl says it does. </pre>
