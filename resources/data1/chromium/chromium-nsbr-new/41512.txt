<title>Issue 41512 -   chromium -    Image drag thumbnail doesn't work on google.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to google.com  hope that you get the new version with the _really_ colorful logo (the right   version has an arrow cursor on search button hover (wtf?))  2. Drag &quot;Google&quot; logo around        Should show image drag thumbnail.        No thumbnail is shown.    This works in Safari and chrome/gtk. </pre>
