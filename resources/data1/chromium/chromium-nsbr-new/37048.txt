<title>Issue 37048 -   chromium -    Dead tabs in linux views don't refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a renderer dies on the linux views port  hitting refresh leaves the sad   tab. If you type a new address in the omnibox the title will change after the   page is fetched  but the page itself turns light blue. If you then switch   tabs and switch back the page will be redrawn. Also if you resize the window   even before loading a different address the page will be redrawn </pre>
