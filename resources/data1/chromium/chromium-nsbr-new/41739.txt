<title>Issue 41739 -   chromium -    Tab Restore does not work after using Incognito Window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071  O.S : Windows 7        0. Open some tabs in Google Chrome.  1. Open the Task Manager and kill Chrome from Applications Tab.  2. If you now restart Chrome  it will restore all the tabs.  3. If 2 is OK (this is just a test to ensure that Tab restore works fine)   then perform 1 and jump to 4.  4. Go to Google Chrome and open New Incognito Window.  5. This will open an Incognito Window with no details of previous sessions   (which is OK).  6. If you now open Google Chrome again  It will show you a blank page. All   the previous saved sessions have been wiped away.      Chrome should be able to show all the previous sessions / tabs which were   running before crashing / closing.      Chrome opens up with a blank page and no tabs are restored.     </pre>
