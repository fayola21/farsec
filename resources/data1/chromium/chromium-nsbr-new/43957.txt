<title>Issue 43957 -   chromium -    Command line flags ignored if a browser is already running - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38 (Official Build 46659) beta    I had chrome already running.    I ran google-chrome --proxy-pac-url=... and it opened a new browser window    but didn't use the new proxy settings.    Closing chrome first  then running a brand new instance with the same   command line worked. </pre>
