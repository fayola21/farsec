<title>Issue 27671 -   chromium -    Changing tabs on Mac focuses location bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Load a page with something that takes focus. Gmail will work well. An   input text field (but not always a textbox) also works.  2. Click that page  to move focus off the location bar. In Gmail  note that   you can now use keyboard shortcuts.  3. Open a new tab.  4. Switch back to the first tab by clicking on it.        Focus should still be on the page. In Gmail  you should be able to use   keyboard shortcuts without clicking the content area again.    Instead  focus jumps back to the location bar  where the entire URL is   selected.    This is a pretty recent change in 4.0.237.0  within the last couple of days.   I'm not sure when I got updated. </pre>
