<title>Issue 36036 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Exceptions] The web site strings in exceptions list should support wild matching characters like &quot;*&quot;  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Set &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Images&quot; -&gt; &quot;Do not show any images&quot;  2. In &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Images&quot; -&gt; &quot;Exceptions&quot;  add &quot;*.google.com&quot;  with action &quot;Allow&quot;.  3. Access www.google.com  picasa.google.com  chrome.google.com and etc      Ideally the images of all google applications should be shown  but now  &quot;*.google.com&quot; doesn't take effect so the images are still blocked.    The wild matching characters like &quot;*&quot; are very important  can you imagine  the scenario that user has to add all google applications to their exceptions?    One more thing  string &quot;google.com&quot; currently is not supported yet  maybe  it should be supported with same meaning of &quot;*.google.com&quot;.    This problem not only happens for Images  it happens for all exceptions  feature in Content Settings.    Issue is detected in Beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069)  it  also happens in latest trunk 5.0.331.0 (Developer Build 39220)       </pre>
