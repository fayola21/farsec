<title>Issue 27776 -   chromium -    Windows Live Messenger (MSN Plus) in Windows XP compatibility mode on Windows 7 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33                    1. on Windows 7 run Windows Live Messenger with MSN Plus in Compatibility   mode: Windows XP SP3  2. in an open chat window click a url/link  3. you'll get an error popup window      run Chrome and go to url/link      you get an popup window stating it can not run Chrome.    --------------------------------------------------------  I am runing Windows Live Messenger in Windows XP compatibility mode because   it puts it to the clock and not in the main toolbar.    And thuss  Windows Live Messenger runs Chrome in Windows XP mode.    It is ok if you already have Chrome runing. This only happens when   Messenger tries to run Chrome.    I don't know if this issue is Chrome related or Windows Live Messenger (MSN   Plus)   </pre>
