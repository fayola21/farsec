<title>Issue 44281 -   chromium -    'No file chosen'-message is too long in Dutch and is truncated for this reason - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Dutch      6.0.401.1      Vista       At every 'choose file-no file chosen message  for example at Google Code.   The translation is too long. Therefore the message ('Geen bestand gekozen')   is truncated to 'Geen best... gekozen'.      Screenshot can be found in <a title="'No file chosen'-message is too long in Dutch and is truncated for this" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43761"> issue 43761 </a>. That issue was closed as it should be a Google Code bug  but it isn't:   it happens on EVERY site that uses that button  and you cannot tell me that EVERY site has the same bug  so I   filed a new report.
