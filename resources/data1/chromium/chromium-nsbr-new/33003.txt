<title>Issue 33003 -   chromium -    no &quot;report a bug&quot; Page-menu item on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    All pieces of open software should involve users helping report bugs  which   are bound to appear. In the Page menu should be a Report Bug option.    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95760">http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95760</a> seems   to indicate such an option exists on Mac and Windows; it does not exist in   Linux.    Furthermore  such a menu item should send one to a   code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?version=??????? url  such that ?????  ??? gets inserted into the description automatically  just like the KDE bug   reporting tool. </pre>
