<title>Issue 23213 -   chromium -    AutocompleteEditViewTest tests are failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We rebooted the &quot;Interactive Ui Tests&quot; bot over the weekend  and even   though nothing should have changed (other than running on a quad core   instead of a dual core)  2 tests started failing :    AutocompleteEditViewTest.AltEnter  AutocompleteEditViewTest.BrowserAccelerators    I took a quick look and it seems like the Alt-Enter is not sent anymore (or   not sent to the right window).    When the window appears  if I press Alt-Enter myself  this will make the   test pass.    Other tests using SendKey seems to work fine  so this might be a timing   issue.    I disabled the tests for now. </pre>
