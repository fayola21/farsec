<title>Issue 45596 -   chromium -    Chrome UI ddosable by rapidly changing favicon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 6.0.408.1 dev / OS X 10.5.8      1. Go to <a href="http://sputnik.googlelabs.com/run">http://sputnik.googlelabs.com/run</a>  2. Click &quot;Start&quot;  3. Open a new tab and try to go to some web site.  4. Try to close the sputnik tab by clicking its close button.        After 3  the new tab should navigate. After 4  the sputnik tab should close.    It looks like the message loop is flooded with &quot;update favicon&quot; messages  which blocks normal UI   loop events.    Didn't happen in chrome/win 4.1  didn't check with more recent versions. </pre>
