<title>Issue 36418 -   chromium -    Animated GIFs cause unresponsiveness while loading. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :   Google Chrome	5.0.307.9 (Official Build 39052) beta  WebKit	532.9  V8	2.0.6.6  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.9 Safari/532.9      Any page with an animated gif.    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works fine.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works fine.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't tried.      1.  Visit any page with an animated GIF on it.      The page should load normally and show the animated GIF.      The first time you navigate to the page  the UI for that page will become   significantly less responsive.  Things like scrolling won't work for several   seconds at a time.  During this  the display of the image will stick on one   frame for a few seconds and then jump to some other frame  continuing   until it gets through all the frames.  Once they are all loaded  the browser   will become responsive again  and as the image loops  it will play normally.    The time it takes for the frames to get in this &quot;loaded&quot; state is much longer   than the time it takes to download the image. </pre>
