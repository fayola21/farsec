<title>Issue 32274 -   chromium -    Search keywords trigger for stuff pasted into the omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Paste &quot;A Heated Debate at Top of Google&quot; into omnibox  2. Hit enter        I expected a google search result page for &quot;A Heated Debate at Top of   Google&quot;. Instead  I got a ask.com result page for &quot;Heated Debate at Top of   Google&quot;.    ask.com has a search keyword of &quot;a&quot; in my chrome. I don't know if that's   the default.    To me  it seems as if search keywords shouldn't fire for text passed into   the omnibox. </pre>
