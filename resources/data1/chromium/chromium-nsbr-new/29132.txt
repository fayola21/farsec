<title>Issue 29132 -   chromium -    QuickTime plugin draws offset - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Since I fixed the way we position the dummy window  QuickTime is drawing 22 pixels too low. That   cuts of the control bar (which isn't too big a deal since it doesn't currently work).    Odd  since the new code is pretty clearly correct. Maybe there's something else we need to   interpose to make QuickTime happy. </pre>
