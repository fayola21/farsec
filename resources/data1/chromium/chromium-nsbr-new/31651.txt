<title>Issue 31651 -   chromium -    http auth dialogs don't cause the parent tab to flash or anything - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a window that is not currently active makes a network request and that network request causes   an HTTP Auth dialog to be displayed  there's nothing in the window chrome to indicate that the   HTTP auth dialog is up (the tab is not made active  it doesn't blink or anything).    This is a general problem  but it came up in the context of SharedWorkers where the user may be   interacting with one window  but the SharedWorker is blocked waiting for HTTP auth on a different   window without the user's knowledge. </pre>
