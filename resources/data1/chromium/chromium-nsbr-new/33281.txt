<title>Issue 33281 -   chromium -    Orange Triangle (in omnibar) Security Information Incorrect with secure intranet site. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78  URL : https://hal/ (local intranet)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : &quot;Safari can't verify the identity of the   website 'hal'&quot;.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Works perfectly after installing Root CA      1. Create empty webpage with simple &quot;hello world&quot; in body  2. Create self signed certificate authority.  3. Use new CA to sign a certificate for an intranet computer (e.g. hal)  4. Install CA into OS/Browser  5. Load hello world web page off a secure webserver running on hal.    There might be a few things going wrong here  but two points:    1) It works great in Firefox and IE8 without complaints.  2) If there is a mistake with the set up and certificates (I'm new to it)    Chrome is still reporting mixed content (secure and non-secure) which is   impossible for a web page that only contains &quot;hello world&quot; in the body tag   and has a blank head. (Unless I really need re-educating!!)    I hope this report is helpful and useful.  Many thanks for Chrome  as a web developer I think it's fantastic :) </pre>
