<title>Issue 39426 -   chromium -    Z-index computed as &quot;auto&quot; when margin set to &quot;auto&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.I was trying to layer an overlay background and overlay &lt;div&gt;s over the   window &lt;div&gt;.    (in order of source HTML)  Window &lt;div&gt;: z-index: 1  Overlay background &lt;div&gt;: z-index: 500  Overlay &lt;div&gt;: z-index: 1000    Strangely  the overlay background was displaying correctly (over the window   &lt;div&gt;)  the overlay was displaying UNDER the window &lt;div&gt;.    Chrome was showing the computed value of z-index as auto.  After some mucking around  I found that when I removed the margin: auto;   declaration from the overlay rule  the z-index was computing correctly.      Expected result is that the overlay is visible over the overlay_bg and   other underlying elements. Z-index should remain as set in the CSS   declaration.      Overlay_bg displays over the window &lt;div&gt; but the overlay displays under   the window &lt;div&gt;  z-index computed as &quot;auto&quot;      <b>Please provide
