<title>Issue 26926 -   chromium -    DevToolsExtensionDebugTest duplicates functionality of ExtensionBrowserTest  buggy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DevToolsExtensionDebugTest should inherit from ExtensionBrowserTest and   not reimplement the functionality inside of it. The code is duplicated  and it's   becoming more and more different.    Also  I think there were some important leak fixes in ExtensionBrowserTest    which means that now the copy in DevToolsExtensionDebugTest is probably   buggy.    And fixing this bug would also mean simpler code!    Assigning randomly  feel free to reassign inside the DevTools team  or to me   (I can fix this). </pre>
