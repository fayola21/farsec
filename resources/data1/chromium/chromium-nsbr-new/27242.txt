<title>Issue 27242 -   chromium -    Back/forward browsing with 2 button mouse like in Opera - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request:    Please implement back/forward button using a two button mouse like Opera   does.    Holding the right mouse button and then pressing the left button pages   backward.  Holding the left mouse button and pressing the right button pages forward.    Very cool and handy feature for users that have a mouse with &quot;only&quot; two   buttons. Just try it in Opera to see what I mean. </pre>
