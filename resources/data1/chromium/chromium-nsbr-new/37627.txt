<title>Issue 37627 -   chromium -    Including the GLES2 headers to build a GLES2 plugin or .nexe cause build errors. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In order to build a .nexe or trusted Pepper plugin that uses GLES2  the Chromium-modified GLES2   headers have to be included.  The problem with this is that these headers are (a) buried in   gpu/command_buffer/common and (b) they include other private headers.  As it stands  using the   Chromium-modified GLES2 headers outside of the Chromium tree cause build errors due to   missing .h files.    I would expect to have GLES2 headers that do not require an install of any of the Chormium tree    and do not include private headers from within the gpu/command_buffer directories.    This bug is blocking further development of the Native Client SDK. This issue affects all platforms. </pre>
