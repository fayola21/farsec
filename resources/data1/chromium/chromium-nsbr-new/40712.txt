<title>Issue 40712 -   chromium -    Wish: native proxy setting for chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.312.0 (Developer Build 37686) custom        Chrome detects proxy from the local settings  e.g. settings from IE   Konqueror or GNOME. However like all these browsers it would be better if  it allows to use its own proxy settings where one can specify the proxy to  be used only by Chrome  additionally with saved user name and password. </pre>
