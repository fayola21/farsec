<title>Issue 37684 -   chromium -    Should Chrome also 'relax 3rd party cookie policy' as Safari does? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See webkit issue...  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35824">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35824</a>     and the committed changelist...  <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/55672">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/55672</a>    Which alters the policy when the 3rd party site in question already has a   cookies set.    The change list skips the new test for most ports  we're skipping this test   when rolling to this revision for now (but for all I know  chrome already has   the relaxed behavior??). </pre>
