<title>Issue 31778 -   chromium -    Need central place to manage notifications permissions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Bring up a notification  2. In the notification  click on Options  3. Click on &quot;Disable notifications from .....&quot;  4. Click on Options again    What is the expected output?   It would be better if we can mark it some way that it has been already   selected. May be a simple tick mark to the left???    What do you see instead?  Nothing. It doesn't tell anything whether it's already enabled or not.   </pre>
