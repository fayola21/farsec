<title>Issue 37869 -   chromium -    Mac plugins get stuck in mouse capture mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/welcome.html">http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/welcome.html</a>  2. Click on the movie to start playing it  3. Click anywhere else on the page; nothing happens. Right click  and you get the Flash context   menu.    Yesterday's changes to plugin mouse capture seem awfully suspicious here.   </pre>
