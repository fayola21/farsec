<title>Issue 44192 -   chromium -    Which tab Chrome decides to active when closing a tab is unintelligible and counter-intuitive  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. In a new window go to <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/</a>  2. Ctrl click any 3 apartment listing  3. Click on the second apartment listing's tab  4. Click back on the first tab  5. Ctrl click another listing.  6. Click on the new listing's tab  7. Close that tab    What is the expected output?     Chrome should go back to the tab that was just active. The first tab.    What do you see instead?    Chrome goes to what appears to be a random tab. In this case it's the 3rd   tab but once you do it a little more there's no way to know which tab it's   going to go to from the user's perspective.    You can think of the user's workflow like this    1) Go to craiglist and search for some listing.  2) Ctrl-click a few listings into new tabs and look at them  3) Close some of those tabs  leave others because you might be interested  4) Go back to the search page and ctrl click some more listings  5) Look at the new listings. Each time you close one you'd expect to  to go back to the last active tab (the search results) but instead you  go to some other tab. Some tab you may not have looked at in a while.     </pre>
