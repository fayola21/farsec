<title>Issue 31882 -   chromium -    despite --incognito switch  URL may be opened in a regular instance instead. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.294.0 (35810) Ubuntu        1. Open Chromium  2. Open another Chromium instance in Incognito  3. Open a URL from a terminal window $ chromium-browser --incognito   <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> (or configure an application to open such links as   stated.)      Since I invoked the incognito option  I expect the URL to open in the   instance that's running in Incognito mode.      URL is opened in the chromium-browser instance with the last focus.     </pre>
