<title>Issue 36651 -   chromium -    Very frequent crashes on Windows 2008 R2 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open Chrome  and it crashes straight away sometimes (configured to open   the home page on startup  and the home page is set to show the new tab   page)  2. If the program makes it to the new tab page  type in any URL and press   enter  and it sometimes crashes straight away. Doing DNS lookup perhaps?        Show the page and don't crash.      50% of the time a windows box will appear saying that the Chrome   application has misbehaved and was stopped. There is a Details button which   displays the following text: &quot;  Problem Event Name:	BEX    Application Name:	chrome.exe    Application Version:	0.0.0.0    Application Timestamp:	4b6a7c02    Fault Module Name:	mswsock.dll    Fault Module Version:	6.1.7600.16385    Fault Module Timestamp:	4a5bda77    Exception Offset:	000016b9    Exception Code:	c0000005    Exception Data:	00000008    OS Version:	6.1.7600.2.0.0.16.7    Locale ID:	2057    Additional Information 1:	a7aa    Additional Information 2:	a7aa91f17ea749d42a4de3b390fa5b3d    Additional Information 3:	a7aa    Additional Information 4:	a7aa91f17ea749d42a4de3b390fa5b3d    Read our privacy statement online:    <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104288&amp;clcid=0x0409">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104288&amp;clcid=0x0409</a>    If the online privacy statement is not available  please read our privacy   statement offline:    C:Windowssystem32en-USerofflps.txt&quot;    <b>Please provide
