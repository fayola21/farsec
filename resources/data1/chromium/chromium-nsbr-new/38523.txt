<title>Issue 38523 -   chromium -    Spell checking is on by default  no way of defaulting it to off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.5 dev    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;    Spell checking is on by default in every text field. There is no way of turning it off by default.    There are suggestions on editing the  ~/Library/Application   Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Preferences file and setting spellcheck.dictionary to &quot;&quot;  but this   just makes the spell checking behave awkward  ie. red-underlining commas  and making text input   slow.       </pre>
