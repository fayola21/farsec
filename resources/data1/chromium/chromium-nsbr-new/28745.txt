<title>Issue 28745 -   chromium -    Chrome refuses to load some Google services (but only if you're logged in) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.0 (Official Build 32041)   URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://hjfreyer.com/test_wave.html">http://hjfreyer.com/test_wave.html</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Clear cookies/cache/go incognito.  2. Load a page which has an iframe with src=&quot;<a href="http://wave.google.com">http://wave.google.com</a>&quot; (see hjfreyer.com/test_wave.html for   instance)  3. Type in your user name and password  4. Hit submit.      Wave loads in the iframe.      Login page just sits there.      Also weird symptoms:  * If you enter a bad password  it will successfully reload and say &quot;bad password&quot;.  * If you go into another window and login normally  then return and refresh the iframe page  no content is   loaded in the iframe.  * Could also replicate with reader.google.com and mail.google.com. Tried a couple non-google sites and couldn't   reproduce the bug  but I don't know if it's actually google-related. </pre>
