<title>Issue 28975 -   chromium -    Add DCHECK's in ConditionVariable to ensure that Lock is acquired when Wait'ed/Signal'ed/etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The ConditionVariable class mirrors pthread's condition variables - which   expect the lock associated with the cv to be held when it is signal'ed    wait'ed  etc.    The ConditionVariable class should DCHECK that this is actually the case  as   undefined behavior can happen if this is not true.    Note that the implementation in condition_variable_win.cc kind of does this   already (there is an AutoUnlock in wait which will call AssertAcquired) but   condition_variable_posix.cc does not do any testing.     </pre>
