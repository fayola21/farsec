<title>Issue 25860 -   chromium -     Chromium trunk build crash at start-up (chrome.dll!`anonymous namespace'::OnNoMemory() Line 126) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>       I have recently found that my builds of Chromium crashes at start up.  Attached you will find a debug dump. I have also tested the current trunk  builds and found that builds after 29779 also crash in the same way. Build  29779 and earlier are quite OK. Unfortunately the buildbot builds have no  debug symbols  so I cannot confirm other that they crash in exactly in the  same way. It looks like a regression between builds 29779 and 29786.    This is my setup:    Win XP Professional service pack 3  1024 MB memory  Lots of free disk space    Visual Studio 2005 Debug dump attached  -----      A normal start without crashing      Crash        <b>Please provide
