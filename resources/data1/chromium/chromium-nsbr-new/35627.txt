<title>Issue 35627 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Cookies] Should not prompt user for sites trying to set cookie when checking &quot;Block sites from setting any data&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Check &quot;Block sites from setting any data&quot;  2. Access <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>      A &quot;Cookies from www.google.com&quot; dialog shows  but actually this dialog  should not be shown. This dialog should be shown when &quot;Ask me when a site  tries to set data&quot; is checked.        This doesn't happen on previous build like 5.0.322.2 (Official Build  38810)  it is a regression.   </pre>
