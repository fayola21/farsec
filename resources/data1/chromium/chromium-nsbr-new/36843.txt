<title>Issue 36843 -   chromium -    Reenable slave sharing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Slave sharing causes these buildbot specific problems:  - Breaks the failure_only=true when two builds are happening simultaneously  - Next build selection isn't fair. It always give priority to the first builder  the other builders are   starved  - console view is broken  it miss build happening simultaneously on one builder    Slave sharing causes these build script problem:  - archive layout step uses the slavebuilddir so split webkit testers overwrite archives done by others    this is not an issue for chromium testers since they don't archive anything    ---    The first 3 items must be fixed in buildbot and upstreamed  getLastFinishedBuild() is just wrong; the   last item requires a modification in scripts/slave/chromium/archive_layout_test_results.py </pre>
