<title>Issue 45638 -   chromium -    X resources ignored (regression) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.55 (Developer Build   0)  Is this the most recent version: I just updated Chromium through the   package manager in Arch Linux  so I assume so  OS + version: Arch Linux  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: dwm  Behavior in Linux Firefox: X resources are honoured (dpi  hintstyle)    In 5.0.342.9  the X DPI and hintstyle resources I defined in ~/.Xresources   and load using xrdb ~/.Xresources in ~/.xinitrc are honoured.    In 5.0.375.55  those configurations are ignored  and I get the default 96   DPI rendering with hinting enabled.    In Firefox 3.6.3 (Namaroka)  my X resources are honoured  so I get my 116   DPI rendering (slightly larger menus and GUI  same default 16 px font size   though).    I have a 17&quot; 1680x1050 display which I've measured to be 116 pixels per   inch  so to spare my eyes I use slightly larger fonts when possible. This   means the 125 DPI setting in Windows and Xft.dpi: 116 in .Xresources. Oh    and I like the fuzzy fonts I get when hinting is disabled.    I've attached screenshots of Chromium and Firefox  taken only seconds   apart  along with the .Xresources in effect. </pre>
