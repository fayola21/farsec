<title>Issue 39211 -   chromium -    Can't delete a bookmark by hitting &quot;delete&quot; key - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open dom bookmark manager  - click to select a bookmark  - hit &quot;delete&quot; (backspace) key    expected:    - bookmark should be deleted    actual:    - nothing happens.    Regression from native manager. Makes it hard to quickly delete a bunch of bookmarks from the   keyboard  the only way is to use the context menu which requires the mouse. </pre>
