<title>Issue 33950 -   chromium -    Image can't be dragged to Adobe Photoshop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 beta (36714)             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Open any web-page with the image.  2. Drag image directly to Adobe Photoshop.      Image should opens in Photoshop as new document.      Chrome don't give the posibility to drag the image into application at all.    I'm a designer. During the working process I often drag images from browser  directly to photoshop (skiping &quot;save as&quot; step). It saves my time. I love  Chrome  but I don't use it because of this bag. I guess a lot of designers  think the same. </pre>
