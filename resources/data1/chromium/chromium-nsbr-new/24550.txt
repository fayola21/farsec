<title>Issue 24550 -   chromium -    Password manager prevents me from entering a username that is a prefix of a saved username - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I usually don't use the form fill (&quot;save my password&quot;?)  but I turned it on   the other day  I now I can't login to gmail.    The problem is that I had it save login information for    &quot;mbelshe@chromium.org&quot; when logging into chromium things.  Now  when I try   to login to mail  where my username is just &quot;mbelshe&quot;  it ALWAYS auto-  completes to &quot;mbelshe@chromium.org&quot;.  No matter what I hit  I'm stuck - I   can no longer login to gmail anymore!  It won't let me type &quot;mbelshe&quot;   without autocompleting it!    I suspect this is a common problem  where a user may have one username   which is a stem of another username.  In this case  the auto-save form fill   is broken.   </pre>
