<title>Issue 45705 -   chromium -    Pinned tabs got stuck - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Pin the tab by right-clicking the tab and choosing ��_��_��_Pin Tab��_��_��_.  2. Close and open browser. Due to what looks like another bug  the pinned   tabs will possibly not show (if that��_��_��_s the case  rinse and repeat until   they do -- I had to rinse and repeat about 5 or 6 times.).  3. Now unpin the tabs and close the browser.  4. Reopen the browser.        The tabs that were unpinned shouldn��_��_��_t show when the browser is reopened.        However  the pinned tabs are stuck on. No amount of unpinning will prevent   them from coming up again next startup.    <b>Please provide
