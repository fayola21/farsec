<title>Issue 38446 -   chromium -    Win7 - second icon on switching away from a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split from <a title="Win7 - Second icon spawns on superbar when Chromium is launched from pinned superbar icon" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28104"> issue 28104 </a> @comment64 from dave9821:    With the user-data-dir tag  launching Chromium produces the proper single   pinned   icon. As soon as you open a new tab and then switch over to a different   tab  the new   taskbar icon is spawned like so. The new icon is actually spawned at the   very end of   the taskbar. I just moved it next to the actualy Chromium icon for the   screenshot.   The favicon is the favicon of the site opened in the new tab. The favicon   is   persistent in that it does not change until browser is closed even when   visiting new   sites.     <a href="http://i43.tinypic.com/mrfxad.jpg">http://i43.tinypic.com/mrfxad.jpg</a>      Without the user-data-dir tag  and following the same actions as above    this is   produced instead    <a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/2qxulx4.jpg">http://i39.tinypic.com/2qxulx4.jpg</a>   </pre>
