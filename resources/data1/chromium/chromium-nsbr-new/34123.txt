<title>Issue 34123 -   chromium -    Socket requests can get stuck when multiple disconnected sockets are released - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In ClientSocketPoolBaseHelper::DoReleaseSocket()  we only call   OnAvailableSocket() once.  If multiple disconnected sockets are released   within the same iteration through the IO thread  then we might need to call   OnAvailableSocket() multiple times once the |num_releasing_sockets| count   hits zero.  This behavior changed in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=36144">r36144</a> since we started delaying trying   to handle pending socket requests until there are no more pending   DoReleaseSockets() tasks for a socket Group. </pre>
