<title>Issue 25589 -   chromium -    DromaeoReferenceTest.Perf messes up Mac valgrind stacks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> DromaeoReferenceTest.Perf kills the stacks from valgrind in the Mac valgrind   tests; we lose most symbols for the run. Example:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Chromium%20Mac">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall.fyi/builders/Chromium%20Mac</a>  %20UI%20(valgrind)(2)/builds/1344/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio    I've verified that it's that test by running the whole UI suite locally on two   different machines  but heavily sharded  and on both machines the only shard   with those bogus stacks was the one containing only DromaeoReferenceTest.Perf.    The first bad stack logged in each case is a &quot;Syscall param write(buf) points to   uninitialised byte(s)&quot;. Maybe just coincidence  but it makes me wonder if we   are clobbering something. </pre>
