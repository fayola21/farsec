<title>Issue 44782 -   chromium -    Cannot rapidly close tabs via middle click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open lots of tabs  then hover near the beginning of the strip and start   rapidly middle-clicking.    In the old tabstrip code  if the user middle-clicked while we were animating   the previous tab close  we'd instantly jump to the end of the animation    close the next tab  and start animating that.  As a result  no matter how   fast you clicked  the tabstrip would always be responsive.    In the new animation code  it's easy to click faster than the tabstrip will   respond. </pre>
