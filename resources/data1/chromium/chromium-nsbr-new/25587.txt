<title>Issue 25587 -   chromium -    Custom install of Win7 over XP/Vista fails to restore Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Installing Win7 over XP doesn't have an upgrade option. It's mandatory that   we need to do a custom install where the user loses all the programs that are   installed. This is same if we do a custom install of Win7 over Vista. It   simply creates a directory named Windows.old and place all the files in   there.    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-</a>  to-windows-7    There's an upgrade option for Vista to Win7 where Chrome is retained and it   works fine.     </pre>
