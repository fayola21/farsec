<title>Issue 31769 -   chromium -    Killing a SOCKS proxy used by chromium causes it to crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SRWare Iron	4.0.275.2 (Developer Build 35171)  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.4  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Iron/4.0.275.2 Chrome/4.0.275.2 Safari/532.8          Firefox 3.x: OK      1. ssh -D 8008 remote.host  2. iron --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:8008  3. kill `pgrep -f &quot;ssh -D 8008&quot;`      When the proxy that a web-browser is using stops responding the browser   should respond just as if the user's network connection had been   disconnected. Namely  it should keep sending page requests  and returning   errors when it receives no responses.      A crash. </pre>
