<title>Issue 32599 -   chromium -    Google Chrome can not synchronize with your favorite in Google Bookmarks accounts. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0                  Google Chrome can not synchronize with your favorite in Google Bookmarks   accounts. I noticed that stores favorite in Google Documents  the   folder &quot;My Folder&quot;. In my opinion  Google Chrome should liaise with your   Google Bookmarks  and not with your Google Documents. Synchronization   should probably rely on the fact that the hole in Google Chrome browser on   another computer and account settings to sync automatically should have   already saved bookmarks. Yes  unfortunately it is not. </pre>
