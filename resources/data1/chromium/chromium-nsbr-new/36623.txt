<title>Issue 36623 -   chromium -    &quot;Opening in Paused...&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 dev      1. Start downloading a big file (large enough that you have time to follow   the rest of these steps).  2. In the download bar  click the download status such that it says   &quot;Opening in 1 hour...&quot; (or whatever).  3. Select the menu item &quot;Pause&quot; for the downloading item.        Something other than what happens  like maybe &quot;Opening later (paused).&quot;        It says &quot;Opening in Paused...&quot; It ain't the hugest issue ever  I know. </pre>
