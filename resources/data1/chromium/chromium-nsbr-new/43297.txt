<title>Issue 43297 -   chromium -    Chrome will ALWAYS make a second GET request to any url after the initial GET/POST request.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome will ALWAYS make a second GET request to any url after the initial   GET/POST request.  So 2 requests are made for every one request.  The   second request made is always a GET request regardless of what type of   request the first one is.    The second GET request is usually 1-2 seconds later.    I have tested this with a server on localhost and a remote server of mine.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta  URLs (if applicable) : Any        Firefox 3.6: OK      1. Click a link or post a form   2. Look at the log files at the webserver  3. You will see that 2 requests are made  the initial GET/POST one  then   the second GET request.    Here are my log files on my web server :    1)  This is the real POST request I made :    Processing JobsController#search (for 127.0.0.1 at 2010-05-05 11:33:36)   [POST]    Parameters: {&quot;job_reference&quot;=&gt;&quot;JK&quot;  &quot;start_date&quot;=&gt;{&quot;month&quot;=&gt;&quot;5&quot;    &quot;day&quot;=&gt;&quot;7&quot;  &quot;year&quot;=&gt;&quot;2008&quot;}  &quot;action&quot;=&gt;&quot;search&quot;    &quot;authenticity_token&quot;=&gt;&quot;...&quot;  &quot;branch_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;  &quot;controller&quot;=&gt;&quot;jobs&quot;    &quot;quote_reference&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;  &quot;end_date&quot;=&gt;{&quot;month&quot;=&gt;&quot;5&quot;  &quot;day&quot;=&gt;&quot;5&quot;    &quot;year&quot;=&gt;&quot;2010&quot;}  &quot;sample_number&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;}    2)  This is the automatic GET request that Chrome made :  (it is 1 second   later. This does not happen with firefox)    Processing JobsController#search (for 127.0.0.1 at 2010-05-05 11:33:37)   [GET]    Parameters: {&quot;action&quot;=&gt;&quot;search&quot;  &quot;controller&quot;=&gt;&quot;jobs&quot;} </pre>
