<title>Issue 39658 -   chromium -    Bing ends up enabled by default in Google Chrome! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: Stable  Beta &amp; Dev (today).      1. Install Google Chrome.  2. Chrome allows the import of settings from Internet Explorer. By default    the import of default search engine is already enabled.  3. Currently  the default search  in Internet Explorer  when install it  is   &quot;Bing&quot;.  4. People usually don't pay attention to the settings. IE's default search   remains &quot;Bing&quot;  even they use &quot;Google&quot; search engine.  5. Then  when installing Chrome  they just automatically importing the   default search from Internet Explorer (bringing Bing).  6. Although people use &quot;Google&quot;  they don't understand much of computers   settings. So  Chrome omnibar search becomes Bing in many cases  even if   people don't want that.      The option to import the search engine of IE SHOULDN'T be selected by   default.      Bing ends up being the default search in Google Chrome  even if people   don't like it. :S    Note: The balloon shown in the address bar  right after the installation of   Chrome isn't enough. I realize that few people pay attention to it.   </pre>
