<title>Issue 42352 -   chromium -    Layout tests fail locally unless font smoothing setting is manually changed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tried to run the webkit layout tests on my OS X 10.5.8 MacBook Pro today    but every test with text failed the image diffs due to font smoothing   differences.  In System Preferences -&gt; Appearance the font smoothing style   was set to &quot;Automatic - best for the main display&quot; and font smoothing was   turned off for font sizes 4 and smaller.  I manually changed the font   smoothing style to &quot;Standard - best for CRT&quot; and the layout tests began   passing.  The test harness should change this. </pre>
