<title>Issue 28685 -   chromium -    Different latest versions on different computers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. On one computer (Vista) I check the version and it says I'm up to date   with 4.0.249.11 (build 32790). I check another computer  it says I'm up to   date on 4.0.249.0 (32041).          Should say the same version  or the one on 4.0.249.0 should upgrade  or prompt me to upgrade etc.      They say they're up to date on different versions.    <b>Please provide
