<title>Issue 26290 -   chromium -    window.open calls issued by plugins via NPN_Invoke don't work in chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a NPAPI plugin issues a window.open call via the NPN_Invoke API then the   call is blocked for lack of a calling javascript frame.    The problem based on my debugging lies in the DOMWindowOpen function in   V8DOMWindowCustom.cpp where we fail if we don't find the calling frame  which   will happen if this call was issued by NPAPI.    This issue was reported by the Silverlight group at Microsoft.   </pre>
