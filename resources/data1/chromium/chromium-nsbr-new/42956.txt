<title>Issue 42956 -   chromium -    Resource loading hangs when attempting to play really large videos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Reported by Alex Karpowitsch.    Try loading http://goto/reallyreallybigvideo    This is a really long video and has a large stsz atom (MP4 frame index).    Typically FFmpeg reads in 32kb chunks  however it tries to load the stsz in   one big read (2112712 bytes  or just over 2mb).    If BufferedResourceLoader has enough forward_bytes() (i.e.  renderer was   able to cache enough)  then we're ok and CanFulfillRead returns true.    If we don't have enough forward_bytes()  then WillFulfillRead returns false   because the amount we're reading (2112712) will always be larger than   kForwardWaitThreshold (2097152)  meaning we'll NEVER read.    In summary  we need to handle the general situation where a read is larger   than kForwardWaitThreshold/forward_capacity().  In fact I think we should   get rid of kForwardWaitThreshold and change the logic such that if we were   to get some really huge read (say 20MB -- VERY unlikely)  we bump up   forward_capacity() and wait until we can satisfy the read. </pre>
