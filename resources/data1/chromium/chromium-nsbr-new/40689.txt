<title>Issue 40689 -   chromium -    Autofill does not work in Amazon.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.342.7 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=42476">r42476</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2      1. Enable Autofill for Chrome. (Preferences &gt; Personal stuff &gt; Autofill)  2. &quot;Set up Autofill&quot; in Chrome. (Provide the address and phone numbers too)  3. Go to Amazon.com and try creating a new account by selecting the option &quot;No  I am a new   customer&quot;.  4. Fill in the form presented.    Expected:  Whenever the site presents a form to fill  Autofill should kick in and do the job for us.    Actual:  Autofill does not do anything.    Note:  One can also test autofill when we try buying items from Amazon.com  with a new account.  Works perfectly well with the Autofill in firefox toolbar.   </pre>
