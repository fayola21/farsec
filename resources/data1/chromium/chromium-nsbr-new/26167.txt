<title>Issue 26167 -   chromium -    Get rid of click in download bar for most extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> +ui team  some security people for feedback    Right now  installing extensions requires two confirmations:    1. The scary download bar shows up and you must click &quot;Continue&quot;  2. You get the install dialog  you must press Install    Step 1 is not really necessary or wanted  except that it is a defense   against clickjacking attacks against the install dialog (&quot;double-click here   for ponies&quot;).    Firefox solves the same problem by having a countdown timer that disables   the OK button for 5 seconds  which seems to be universally hated among   Chromium developers.    We could solve the same problem without the extra click by making the   download in the download bar always take at least 5 seconds. If we require   that  then click jacking the install dialog becomes inpractical  and we can   auto-open extensions after download. </pre>
