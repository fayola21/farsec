<title>Issue 32650 -   chromium -    Dragging a bookmark folder should open the menu. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) dev           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: FAIL  Opera 10: OK      1. Position the mouse over a folder in the bookmarks bar  2. Hold the mouse button  3. Move the mouse down        The folder should open like a pulldown menu when manipulated in this   fashion. This makes it faster to access the contents of the bookmark   folder  and makes its behavior more consistent with ordinary menus. If it is   dragged to any other direction  the normal drag and drop behavior can still   work. </pre>
