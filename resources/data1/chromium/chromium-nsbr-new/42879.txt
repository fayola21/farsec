<title>Issue 42879 -   chromium -    ~15ms regression on xp-release-dual-core moz page cycler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There's about ~15ms regression on xp-release-dual-core moz page cycler.  This   regression is enough to turn the cycler red.  See:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/moz/report.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/xp-release-dual-core/moz/report.html?</a>  history=150&amp;rev=45984    We need to fix the cause of the regression by reverting or patching the bad   CL.  The bad behavior possibly begins at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=45666">r45666</a>  Yuzo's WebKit roll   58261:58279.    Yuzo  WDYT?    I will update perf expectations so the cycler stays green in the meantime. </pre>
