<title>Issue 37454 -   chromium -    ClientSocketPoolBaseHelper can sometimes start too many ConnectJobs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ClientSocketPoolBaseHelper::OnConnectJobComplete() will call   MaybeOnAvailableSocketSlot() when the ConnectJob just completed with an   error.  This will create another ConnectJob if there's still an available   slot.  We should only do this if the group was blocked for some reason   (global socket limit or group socket limit).    Note that it's also important to call MaybeOnAvailableSocketSlot since we   might want to erase the group if there are no more pending requests.  So we   should call it if we were previously blocked by some limit  or the pending   requests is empty.  Otherwise  we might just unnecessarily create more   ConnectJobs. </pre>
