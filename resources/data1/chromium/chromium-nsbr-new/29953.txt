<title>Issue 29953 -   chromium -    x builds pending precommit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not sure who to CC for this.    It's awesome that we have a precommit warning that there are many builders pending when   trying to commit  but everytime I've gone to commit today I've gotten the following message:    Build(s) pending. It is suggested to wait that no more than 6 builds are pending.    ***************  Linux Builder (ChromiumOS) has 46 build(s) pending  Linux Builder (Views dbg) has 42 build(s) pending  ***************    Can we ignore these two builders for the purpose of this check since they appear to be much   slower than the other builders? As it is  it's just training people to ignore the presubmit because   there's always warnings. </pre>
