<title>Issue 43375 -   chromium -    Histograms in client_socket_handle.cc should not change names between macro calls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The histograms in client_socket_handle.cc are created with name arguments   that include a dynamically generated string.  Unfortunately  the macro   snapshots the first name used  an then reuses that name (via a static   variable) for all future calls  ignoring the newer names :-(.    I put in a DCHECK() to spot this in future uses  and to silence the DCHECK()   (for this file) I'll add code that makes it more clear that only the first   supplied name is used. </pre>
