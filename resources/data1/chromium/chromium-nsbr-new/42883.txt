<title>Issue 42883 -   chromium -    Right-click on windowless flash plugin hangs renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to www.hulu.com  2. Right click on the flash image   3. Open a new tab and load www.youtube.com    What is the expected output?   Renderer responds to user and loading other pages should work fine    What do you see instead?  2.1 Renderer of hulu tab hangs  3.1 Youtube  CNN  Yahoo and other sites never finish loading all the   elements and their renderers also don't respond    All of them start responding only upon killing Flash plugin    Using Flash10.0 seems to work fine. Since we enable Flash10.1 by default    we need to fix this I guess.    Google Chrome 5.0.375.28 (Official Build 45883)  Shockwave Flash - Version: 10 1 53 22  Ubuntu9.04 </pre>
