<title>Issue 26267 -   chromium -    Compact nav bar: painting anomaly in tabstrip on using the Omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeOS: 0.3.20.1  Chrome: 4.0.227.0      --------------------------------------  1. Title bar icon menu &gt; Compact nav bar &gt; New window.   2. Enter a URL in the Omnibox.  3. Hit Enter.      What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  Tabstrip should be drawn normally.      What do you see instead?  ------------------------  A strange anomaly in drawing the tabs appears.  It seem to be triggered by  the resizing of the Omnibox when it gains keyboard focus.   </pre>
