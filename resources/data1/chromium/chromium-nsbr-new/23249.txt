<title>Issue 23249 -   chromium -    Presubmit/build-time check for security settings on DLLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We ship a number of pre-built DLLs (avcodec*  gears  syncapi  icudt).    We should be checking these whenever they change to make sure settings like   NX compatibility are in place.    Looking to Marc-Antoine for advice  but anyone could pick this up. </pre>
