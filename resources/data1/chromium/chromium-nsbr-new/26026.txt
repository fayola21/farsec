<title>Issue 26026 -   chromium -    When context menu is activated  the active tooltip should be hidden. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are currently doing some hacks that removes the active tooltop when we   activate a context menu.    In accessibility the hack we are doing is simply hiding the keyboard tooltip   when we are navigating (ALT+SHIFT+T) to context menu (Page  App  and Other   bookmarks).    We should somehow hide all active tooltips when Menu is being activated. </pre>
