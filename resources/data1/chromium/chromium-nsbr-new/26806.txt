<title>Issue 26806 -   chromium -    Download Confirmation is redundant - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.229.1  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):Does not ask  just downloads.   Opens safe files automatically. (Best)  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Asks if you want to save or   download.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Same as Mac OS X      There shouldn't be a confirmation box when you download something on   Mac OS X. This is redundant because Mac OS X (maybe Windows) flags   downloaded files that could potentially be dangerous and confirms when   you run it. If I didn't want to download that particular file  you can either   cancel the download or delete the downloaded file.    See &quot;Why Software Sucks&quot; by David Platt.   </pre>
