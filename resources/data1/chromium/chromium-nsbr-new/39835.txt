<title>Issue 39835 -   chromium -    If cookies are blocked bookmark synch will not work on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.342.7 (Build 42476) beta  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86  Window manager: Gnome  URLs (if relevant): not relevant  Behavior in Linux Firefox: not applicable  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): ok (Chrome 4.1 @W7)        1. Stop bookmark synch  2. Delete all cookies  3. Delete all cookie exceptions  4. Set &quot;Content&quot; --&gt; &quot;Cookies&quot; to block all cookies  5. Start synchronizing bookmarks  6. Login with your Google Account in the synch window that appears  7. Login will work  however afterwards the synch window enters an infinite   loop (only cancel will work)          Bookmark synch should work even if cookies are blocked (or at least the   &quot;Allow cookie for...?&quot; dialog should appear and trigger further actions).   Chrome 4.1 on Windows 7 bookmark synch works even if cookies are blocked   (as expected).          The bookmarks snych window enters an infinite loop if cookies are blocked.      I'm wondering if there is a connection to <a title="Bookmark sync does not work after removing cookie and then reopen chrome" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38938"> issue 38938 </a>.     </pre>
