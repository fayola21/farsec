<title>Issue 38974 -   chromium -    Clean up and reconcile wait-for-debugger-children and [process type]-startup-dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It appears that --wait-for-debugger-children=[proces type] has bit rotted   and at least on the Mac platform does not function. There has been a   proliferation of --[process]-startup-dialog flags which have subsumed the   functionality of waiting for a debugger to attach.    The wait-for-debugger-children flag and its filters should be fixed and   updated. The startup dialog flags should either be changed to do what they   claim or eliminated.   </pre>
