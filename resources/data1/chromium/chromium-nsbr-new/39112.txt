<title>Issue 39112 -   chromium -    Chrome spins CPU 100% about:blank - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1036 (Official Build 41514)  URLs (if applicable) : about:blank           Safari 4: cannot reproduce    Firefox 3.x: cannot reproduce           IE 7: cannot reproduce           IE 8: cannot reproduce      1. Set 'Reopen the pages that were last opened' in Options/Basics.  2. Open more than four web pages (w/o Flash player embedded).  3. Keep browser open  then reboot.  4. When the browser starts to spin (meaning take up 100% CPU time) for no   apparent reason  open a tab to about:blank and close all other tabs.        Chrome should fall to 0% CPU.      Chrome stays spinning at 100% CPU.  There are two chrome.exe processes: one   with about:blank at 0% CPU and one with no detectable page (the parent of   the other) at 100% CPU.  This is viewed from Microsoft Process Explorer   procexp.exe.   </pre>
