<title>Issue 40580 -   chromium -    Dialog changes size back and forth rapidly under XMonad - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Manage your windows using XMonad  and set it up to float dialogs  2. Go to Options -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Clear browsing data...  3. Or Options -&gt; Personal Stuff -&gt; Import data from another browser...            A dialog pops up  but it's shaking all the time and basically useless.   Tiling the dialog does make it usable  but it's just a workaround.      Please provide
