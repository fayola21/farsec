<title>Issue 23608 -   chromium -    Implement binary support in try server - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> svn diff doesn't support binary files  git diff --binary  patch --binary    So we need to emulate binary support in svn (as usual  svn diff sucks)    This is a common issue with checked-in .png and other binary files that   cannot be tried on the try server. </pre>
