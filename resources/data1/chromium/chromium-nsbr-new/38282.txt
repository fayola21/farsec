<title>Issue 38282 -   chromium -    Log of all revisions doesn't show log of all revisions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm rather surprised that I couldn't find a bugreport for this. All Chrome release posts on:    <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/</a>    include links to a changelog tool which is supposed to show a log of all revisions between two   builds  URLs like this:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?</a>  url=/branches/342/src&amp;range=41124:40685&amp;mode=html    For me this only shows a blue search bar without any information about changes  screenshot   attached. Same problem in Safari and I've been having this problem since the beginning of times   (Mac Beta for me). If you read the comments on the Chrome releases blog you see more people   with the same problem. </pre>
