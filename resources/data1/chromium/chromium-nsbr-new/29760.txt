<title>Issue 29760 -   chromium -    verify interactive slaves are in an interactive mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Interactive slaves require that the user be logged in so certain kinds of   events are sent to Chrome.  If the tests are running where those events   aren't sent  the test will fail sometimes in mysterious ways.    We should verify before those tests (via assertion  via a previous build   step  whatever) that the current environment supports sending the right   events so we can more quickly assign system failures to their root cause. </pre>
