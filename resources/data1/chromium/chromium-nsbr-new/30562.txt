<title>Issue 30562 -   chromium -    Links to source code doesn't work when resources tracking is turned off - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Links to source code used in CPU profiler and console doesn't work when   resource tracking is turned off. And there are no hints for an user that can   guide her to enable resources in order to make links work.    Two possible resolutions for this problem:  1. Add hints  2. Make source code links point to debugger. This is even more useful for   profiler because when investigating performance issues it's more convenient   to jump to debugger in order to e.g. put a breakpoint in a heavy function. </pre>
