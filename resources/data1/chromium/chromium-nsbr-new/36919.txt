<title>Issue 36919 -   chromium -    Low contrast scrollbar thumb in chrome theme mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> see <a title="Low contrast scrollbar thumb" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=17254"> bug 17254 </a>    This was fixed if you are using the gtk theme because we take the scrollbar   color from the system theme. Since we now have that system-compatibility   mode  I think we can revisit the desire to change the scrollbar appearance   for chrome-theme mode.    Screenshot attached. Taken in Hardy.    Notably:  In Gtk theme mode  a) we don't match the appearance of the system scrollbar thumb or trough   (hard to fix)  b) we do match the color of the thumb  but not the trough seemingly (might   be hard to fix)    In Chrome theme mode:  a) we have the lowest contrast between thumb and trough of any   configuration (easy to fix) </pre>
