<title>Issue 29600 -   chromium -    serious rendering regression on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (Developer Build 33962)      1. download devchannel chrome on google's hardy bundle  2. browse the web.      normally rendered pages.      Horribly fuzzed out or missing images.  Two screenshots of google   properties attached.  It's not 100% of the time: sometimes it self corrects   and sometimes it does not.     I noticed this last week  I had no problems two weeks ago.   Sorry I don't   have a tighter frame for changes.    </pre>
