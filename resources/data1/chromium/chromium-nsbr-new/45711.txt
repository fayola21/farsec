<title>Issue 45711 -   chromium -    Opening bookmark manager from Incognito window should open it in Incognito window? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if you open the bookmark manager from an incognito window  then   the tab opens in the main (normal  non-incognito) window. Is this   intentional?    The history  download  and extensions managers all open in the incognito   window if spawned from the incognito window. </pre>
