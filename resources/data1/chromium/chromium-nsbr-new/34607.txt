<title>Issue 34607 -   chromium -    Mac support for &lt;keygen&gt; tag (generating SSL cert signing request) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Split off from <a title="browser does not send valid certification requests for creating SSL client certificates"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=148">issue 148</a>  to cover the Mac implementation of support for the   &lt;keygen&gt; tag  which generates a key-pair and certificate-signing request for   creation of a client-side SSL cert.    (The cross-platform code for this exists already; see the patch in <a title="browser does not send valid certification requests for creating SSL client certificates"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=148">issue 148</a>.   Only one platform-specific method needs to be implemented  the one that   actually:  (a) generates a key-pair in the user's Keychain  (b) creates an X.509 Subject Public Key Identifier in DER encoding  (c) signs it  (d) base64-encodes it. </pre>
