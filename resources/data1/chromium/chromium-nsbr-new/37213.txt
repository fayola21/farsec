<title>Issue 37213 -   chromium -    UTF not being rendered properly... - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-2000">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-2000</a>      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Goto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-2000">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-2000</a>  2. Under &quot;Examples of language dependent characters&quot; there is a table  3. Each row of characters should show some variation. In Chrome... all   characters in a row appear to be the same. In FF  one or more characters in   a row look different.      The language variations of the characters should show properly in the   browser.      Only one form of a character is being shown.     </pre>
