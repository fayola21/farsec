<title>Issue 34883 -   chromium -    Linux clipboard access failure - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.  Visiting this page and highlighting the svn command and pressing Ctrl-C   does not place it on the clipboard  but the clipboard is blank (i.e. in   other applications it is &quot;armed&quot; for pasting  but nothing appears when   pasting).  I tried just highlighting also.  What seems to reconnect Chrome   to the clipboard is when I copy text outside of chrome and paste it in some   text box on Chrome.  Then I may selected/Ctrl-C to get a copy of text.                    <b>Please provide
