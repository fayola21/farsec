<title>Issue 40500 -   chromium -    Infobar text disappears after switch to fullscreen and back - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Trigger an infobar.  2.  Go fullscreen.  3.  Ungo fullscreen.    The infobar text will be gone.  If you resize the window bigger  it will show up again.  If you go   fullscreen again  the text comes back! Magic!    Looks like it was caused by <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=42985">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&amp;revision=42985</a> .    /vote Releaseblock-Beta    Thakis  if you know what's going wrong  let me know.  Otherwise I'll poke at it tomorrow. </pre>
