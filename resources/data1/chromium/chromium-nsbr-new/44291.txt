<title>Issue 44291 -   chromium -    Popup Runs Automatically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has to do with the way Chrome handles Pop-ups. I just opened a link    which was for a popup YouTube video. The video started to play before I even   told Chrome to allow the popup from the icon in the Omnibar. This means that   even if the popup has not been allowed to open by the user  it still is   allowed to run. So  a mallicious popup can run even if the user does not   allow it.   I have the &quot;Do not allow any site to show pop-ups&quot; enabled  so pop-ups show   up as an icon in the omnibar. It says &quot;the following pop ups were blocked   from this page&quot;  but this can't be true if the video starts to automatically   play. This probably means that any other &quot;auto run&quot; file  such as YouTube's   videos  would also be able to run. </pre>
