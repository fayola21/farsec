Have a couple of bookmarks that will fit in the bookmarks bar (so there  isn't an overflow chevron yet)  2. Bookmark one more page in the bookmarks bar (or drag one from the other  bookmarks folder)        The overflow chevron should show up indicating there is one more bookmark  not shown in the bar    See screenshot.        Nothing. The newly added bookmark doesn't appear until you resize the  browser window.     Or  overflow chevron will only start to show if there are 2 or more excess  bookmarks    <b>Please provide
