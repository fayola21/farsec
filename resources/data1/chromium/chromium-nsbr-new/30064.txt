<title>Issue 30064 -   chromium -    [REQ] Configurable address bar results - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.267.0~svn20091208r34059-0ubuntu1~ucd1~jaunty  OS + version : Ubuntu 9.04  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : GNOME    Could be possible to configure the number of the suggestions to show in the   addressbar while writing something? Chromium doesn't ever show more than 6   results  and they're really few for me; this number should be configurable.    Another cool thing would be the ability of configuring which type of results   should be shown (i.e. allow to disable the search engine suggestions  the   history...) or prioritize them :P   </pre>
