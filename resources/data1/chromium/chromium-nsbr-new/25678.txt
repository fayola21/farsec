<title>Issue 25678 -   chromium -    CL 29512 broke supporting relative paths - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Launching from a relative path will no longer work with CL 29512.    See <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/295001">http://codereview.chromium.org/295001</a>  and  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25131">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25131</a>      1. Try to build and run unit tests from an Xcode project is the easiest way to see this fail.    basic problem is IsParent does not support relative paths (i.e. blah/../foo). It is documented as   such  but all the routines that depend on it need either to be aware of this and sanitize paths   before they get in there  or in turn document this fact.      Unittests fail when launched with relative paths  and Chrome would not work if launched with a   relative path.     </pre>
