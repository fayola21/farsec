<title>Issue 37125 -   chromium -    Disable setting default browser for side by side install/update - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We decide to disable setting default browser for side by side   install/update. Setting default browser for Chrome is already complicated.   We need to register Chrome in HKLM and make changes in HKCU  and the code   paths are different for XP/Vista  system/user install. During uninstall  we   clean up those settings. If both normal and SxS channels set default   browser  there are extra complexity between the interaction of those two   during install and uninstall.    Currently for side by side channel  the installer will return false when   asking for registering Chrome and setting default browser  and do no-op   when asking for unregistering Chrome during uninstall.     We need to graying out all relevant boxes in browser UI. This includes the   default browser setting in option-&gt;basic  and the default browser poll   during uninstall. There might be other places as well.      </pre>
