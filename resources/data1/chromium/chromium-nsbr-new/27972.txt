<title>Issue 27972 -   chromium -    Chrome displays non-ASCII characters in URLs in the URL bar  it should URI encode the URL instead - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.245.1 (Official Build 31796)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/��_��_var%20Arnfj��__r��_��_">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/��_��_var%20Arnfj��__r��_��_</a>  %20Bjarmason/diary/8651  Other browsers tested: Firefox       Firefox 3.x: OK      1.

URLs copied from the URL bar are in same mix of URI encoding and non-ASCII   characters thrown in.    I understand why Chrome engages in this fancyness but it's very prone to   breakage. When I copy URLs from chrome and give them to people they're   sometimes unable to open them because some system along the way converted   the non-ASCII characters from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1  or some automatic   process that scanned for URLs thought the URL stopped at the first non-  ASCII character.    Firefox has an ugly hack to make this work  it displays the fancy URLs in   the title bar but when you Ctrl+C to copy them you get the properly URI   encoded version in your clipboard. This sucks under X11 because if you use   the standard X way of highlighting text to copy it you'll get the fancy   version instead. </pre>
