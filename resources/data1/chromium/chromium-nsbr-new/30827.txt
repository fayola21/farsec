<title>Issue 30827 -   chromium -    Loading worker script from a protected resource does not display an auth dialog. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have a page like this:    Worker test&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;button onclick=&quot;doTest()&quot;&gt;test&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;script&gt;  function doTest() {    var worker = new Worker(&quot;protected/foo.js&quot;);    worker.onerror = function(evt) { alert(evt); }  }  &lt;/script&gt;      The &quot;protected/foo.js&quot; resource is protected by HTTP auth. I expected that I'd get an HTTP Auth   dialog when trying to load this worker. Instead  I get nothing.    Interestingly  if I hit reload on the page  the worker.onerror callback is invoked. So it's clear that   the request is indeed waiting for auth credentials  but that dialog isn't getting displayed.
