<title>Issue 43281 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Javascript API for measuring memory usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have recently solved our memory management problem.  We have managed to reduce our   memory leak problem significantly. We are hoping that the Chrome team can help us to protect this   investment by making sure that we can catch any memory leak regression early.  We already have a   latency lab regression test running periodically  but we want to be able to extract memory usage   data as well.  We are wondering what the best approach is  one path we were thinking about is a   Javascript call that returns the current VM's memory usage and we can log that data.     We are hoping for something like &quot;console.heapStats&quot; that is only available if chrome is launched   with something special passed in via --js-flags?  </pre>
