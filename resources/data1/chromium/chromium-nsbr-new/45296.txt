<title>Issue 45296 -   chromium -    html response race condition - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome: 5.0.375.55  PC/Windows 7    Only tested/confirmed on this OS/Browser combination   am not sure if it   appears elsewhere.      Included are two files    one is a wireshark pcap packet log and the other   the file created by this bug.  While it initially doesn't seem to be   dangerous   I can think of several methods of intentional implementation   that could result in less than desirable effects.     It is hard to explain reproduction of this bug as it exhibits itself   arbitrarily when browsing a website:  www.reddit.com   sometimes happening     something everything works as expected. The problem however resides with   the browser and not with reddit.      I will however explain what happens and the files included will assist in   tracking down the problem that occurs.  At some point the browser requests   the style sheet [time(x) &amp; req(1)](css) for www.reddit.com/r/WTF  the   server responds with the http headers Log @time: [Mon  24 May 2010 05:03:47   GMT]  as the server sends the headers and then sends the gzipped style   sheet   chrome requests the comments from the forum thread [req(2) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/c77w0/store_hit_by_grenade/c0ql7h3">http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/c77w0/store_hit_by_grenade/c0ql7h3</a>   ] which is a permalink url for a particular comment (this c0ql7h3 is   arbitrary and changes   I have about 50 different similar requests that   resulted in this bug   all differing based on this comment permalink url).    The server responds and sends the comment html data for the url; and this   is where the bug kicks in.   Chrome gets confused and believes that   everything the server has responded with since time(x) is part of the   response to req(2).   So what you get in response to this race condition is   the file I've attached second   c0ql7h3.gz   This is not a valid gzip   archive   and I suggest opening it in an editor to examine it   what you   will find is:    1. The 23 byte gzipped CSS  2. server's HTTP headers for the permalink response  3. The 8694 bytes of gzipped HTML corresponding to the permalink    If you need any further info please contact me.   </pre>
