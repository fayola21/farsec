<title>Issue 35493 -   chromium -    No way to look at Greasemonkey scripts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78    <a href="http://home.arcor.de/marlokir/uru/widendrcforums.user.js">http://home.arcor.de/marlokir/uru/widendrcforums.user.js</a>           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK        1. Click on a link to a Greasemonkey-style Javascript file.      Chrome displays the plain-text contents of the script  like any other   Javascript file. Possibly  a bar appears at the top of the page and asks if   you want to install the script.      A bar appears at the bottom of the page  stating &quot;Extensions and themes can   harm your computer. Are you sure you want to continue?&quot; and giving options   to Continue  Discard  and Show Downloads. There is no option to review the   Greasemonkey script before continuing. Clicking Continue leads to a modal   dialogue asking if you want to install the &quot;Extension&quot; or to Cancel. There   is no option to review the script before installing. Clicking Install   installs the script  popping up a notification that the &quot;Extension&quot; can be   found on the Extensions page. On the Extensions page  you are given the   option to either Disable or Uninstall the Greasemonkey script. There is no   option to view or review the Greasemonkey script. </pre>
