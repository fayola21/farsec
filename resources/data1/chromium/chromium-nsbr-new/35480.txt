<title>Issue 35480 -   chromium -    Add a manual &quot;Translate page to %lang&quot; context menu item - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In cases where the CLD fails to detect that the page needs translation or   where users accidentally dismissed the translation infobar  we should give   users an option to translate the page as a context menu.    If possible  we should modify this command when there is selected text to   send that text to translate.google.com in a new tab rather than translate the   entire page. That should have a different string &quot;Translate selection&quot; or   something.    We can use the strings from Google Toolbar (mal mentioned that this was   possible) since we're past the string deadline.   </pre>
