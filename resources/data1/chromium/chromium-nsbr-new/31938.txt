<title>Issue 31938 -   chromium -    multiple proxy prompts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 33928)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. configure chromium for a proxy server  2. open multiple tabs in multiple windows  3. quit chromium  4. restart chromium      I should get a single proxy server account/password box which when filled in   will be applied to all tabs/windows reloading on restart.      I get multiple proxy requests where I have to enter the same account/password   in each one.  Very tedious. </pre>
