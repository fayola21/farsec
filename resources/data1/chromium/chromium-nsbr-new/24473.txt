<title>Issue 24473 -   chromium -    max 1 UI surface per-extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For extensions beta  we want to start out limiting extensions to a maximum of   1 UI &quot;surface&quot;. By &quot;surface&quot;  we mean toolstrip  browser action  or page   action.    UI management gets much simpler if there is a concrete relationship between   user-visible features and extensions. And since we now have the bubble  and   will eventually have the options UI  we think that there should be enough   real-estate for people to do interesting things within this limitation.    At the very least  it easier to add than take away  so we would prefer to   start with 1 and relax over time. </pre>
