<title>Issue 24409 -   chromium -    Close Tab Button is on wrong side for Mac Users - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.5    OS version               : 10.5+  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Close Tab Button is on the left   side of a tab  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Close Tab Button is wrongly on the   right side of a tab  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Close Tab Button is on the right side of   the tab  which might be preferable for Windows users    Close Buttons on Mac OS generally reside on the left side of an item  e.g.   the window title bar. Apps ported from Windows tend to ignore this fact   and put custom close buttons (other than the one in the window) to the   right side of items  which feels wrong. Maybe it's just me...   </pre>
