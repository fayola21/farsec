<title>Issue 24812 -   chromium -    NNTP: &quot;The thumbnail for &quot;Site Name&quot; will no longer appear- Undo &quot;  shows at non-context which is non-functional. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32        1. Launch chrome  Go NNTP  2. Remove any thumbnail from the NNTP  3. Click undo from the message &quot;The thumbnail for &quot;Site Name&quot; will no longer appear-Undo&quot; to   get back the removed thumbnail on the NNTP.  4. Remove again the same thumbnail   5. Perform Clear Browsing data -  Everything   6. Verify the NNTP page    Actual: &quot;The thumbnail for &quot;Site Name&quot; will no longer appear - Undo &quot; shows up on the page.   Do &quot;undo&quot; - Thumbnail doesn't show up again. &quot;Undo&quot; is non-functional.    What is the expected output?   After performing clear browsing data &quot;The thumbnail for &quot;Site Name&quot; will no longer appear-   Undo &quot; should not show. If this is expected &quot;Undo&quot; must be functional.    (Applies for Default thumbnails too   Remove Undo Message shows even when default thumbnail   is on the NNTP page  which is weird )    Note: This can be reproducible on all platforms.      </pre>
