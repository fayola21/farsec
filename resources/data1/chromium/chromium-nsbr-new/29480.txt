<title>Issue 29480 -   chromium -    Navigation Bug Causes All Pages To Behave Like The New Tab Page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I'm not really sure what the requirements are. It doesn't always happen so   it's not guaranteed to be reproducible. (Don't you just love it?)  However  I am able to cause it to happen fairly often by:  1. Create a new tab or open Chromium.  2. Type the location of a local html file into the address bar and press   Enter to load it.  3. Repeat step 2 several times with other local html files.  4. Hold down the backspace key to navigate back very quickly.  5. When the address bar says it's at the New Tab page (even though it isn't   showing it)  navigate forward (normally) to the first html file you loaded.  6. Navigate backward (normally) until you can't navigate backward anymore.  7. Navigate forward to the html files you loaded.  To make it super-easy to understand the process  I recorded a video of   reproducing the problem with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33919">r33919</a> (I had previously been experiencing the   problem with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32">r32</a>-something). Here is the video:   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XBEUTdte-I&amp;fmt=37">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XBEUTdte-I&amp;fmt=37</a>      Normal-ness.      The address bar is blanked. The tab title says &quot;New Tab&quot;. The bookmark bar   behaves like it does on the New Tab page (the strangest effect). You stay   sort of stuck like this as long as you're only navigating forward and   backward. Navigating to an entirely new destination seems to fix it most of   the time  though there are still some subtle signs a problem condition   still exists.    <b>Please provide
