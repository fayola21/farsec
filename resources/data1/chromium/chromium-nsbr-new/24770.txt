<title>Issue 24770 -   chromium -    Spurious commits when two bookmarks share a title - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   0. Enable sync.  1. Create a bookmark folder with several bookmarks that have non-default   favicons.  2. Change the titles of the bookmarks so that the titles are identical.  3. Navigate to the &quot;about:sync&quot; page by typing that into the URL bar; wait   for a status &quot;READY&quot;.  Record the number next to &quot;Updates Received&quot;.  4. Shut down the browser normally.  5. Restart the browser.  6. Check about:sync again.  When it says READY  and the Updates Received   metric should not have changed from step 3.    Instead of the expected behavior  it seems that there are spurious commits in   this case -- the Updates Received counter ticks up.  This may be the root   cause of the extremely high commit rate we've been seeing from a small number   of users server-side.  P1 because of that possibility.    The root cause:    What was happening is that we were filtering out redundant  property changes for the title  but only after we'd uniquified  the name.  This wasn't necessary  and for cases where  there was a sibling with an identical name  the newly  generated uniquified name would result in a false positive.    The fix is to do the filtering on the non-unique name only.  This is the only property visible to syncapi clients. </pre>
