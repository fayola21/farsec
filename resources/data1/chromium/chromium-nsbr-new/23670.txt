<title>Issue 23670 -   chromium -    Not obvious which toolbar buttons are active with &quot;Desktop&quot; theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1      1. Install this theme:   &lt;<a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_desktop.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_desktop.html</a>&gt;        It should still be possible to tell active and inactive toolbar buttons apart.        Active and inactive buttons look very similar. </pre>
