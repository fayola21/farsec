<title>Issue 24041 -   chromium -    We should validate the path of the background page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you mistype the value of &quot;background_pagee&quot; in the manifest  it loads the   404 handler into it.    Funny  but not so useful.    Extra check needs to go into extension_file_util::Validate(). We need to   change Extension to store the relative path instead of the full URL. </pre>
