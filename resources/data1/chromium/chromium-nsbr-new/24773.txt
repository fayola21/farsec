<title>Issue 24773 -   chromium -    two tests extremely slow in Debug mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-implicit-length-limit.html    LayoutTests/fast/forms/input-maxlength.html    Both those tests take 30-40 seconds to run in Debug mode and &lt; 1 second to   run in Release. They got slow with the V8 update to 1.3.15.    It seems likely that there's an expensive dcheck here that is making these   tests and probably others slow.    Not sure if this should be in the V8 bug tracker or not. I don't know who the   right people on the V8 team are to CC. This matters since it has such a large   effect on webkit test cycle time. </pre>
