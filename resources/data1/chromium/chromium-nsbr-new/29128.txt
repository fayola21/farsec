<title>Issue 29128 -   chromium -    Chrome shouldn't have an &quot;about:version&quot; thumbnail in NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.249.22 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33427">r33427</a>      QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Open about:version in a new tab.  2. Close the tab.  3. Open a new tab.    Expected:  Like in windows we should not get the about:version in the NTP   thumbnails.    Actual:  We do get the thumbnail and when clicked on it opens a blank page.    Note:  We also get the about:version in the recently closed tab's list but we have a   separate bug for that since its common for all platforms.   </pre>
