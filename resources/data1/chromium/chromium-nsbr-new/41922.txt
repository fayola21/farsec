<title>Issue 41922 -   chromium -    'http://' only copied when entire location bar url is selected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.9 dev  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: xfce v4.6.1    Problem:  'http://' is only copied from location bar if you select the entire url. If   you try to extract a subsection like a directory  by either dragging across    or by shift unselect  it will not copy the 'http://'    Expectation:  I'm not sure what I expect as the desired behavior. Certainly if I select the   hostname and directory I would like the 'http://' appended to the front. But   if I select something in the middle  like a directory structure  I would not   want the 'http://' added.   </pre>
