<title>Issue 27079 -   chromium -    no clip-path if viewbox &gt;1million - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. load the included africa.svg          You should see a big blue rectangle  a smaller red rectangle and the shape   of the African continent in orange (see attached bmps)        (  Chrome only draws the blue rectangle and the coastline. The clip-path does   not work. The viewbox of the red rectangle is very big (viewBox=&quot;-5000000 -  5000000 9000000 9000000&quot;). If you change the viewbox to viewBox=&quot;-500000 -  500000 900000 900000&quot; and the scale of the clip-path from   transform=&quot;scale(100)&quot; to transform=&quot;scale(10)&quot; everything works fine. It   might be the same problem as <a title="SVG big shape won't show in small viewBox"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26040">Issue 26040</a>: SVG big shape won't show in small   viewBox.      <b>Please provide
