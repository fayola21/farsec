<title>Issue 30447 -   chromium -    Cannot open HTML files from Finder thru double-clicking/Open With - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Browse to an HTML file on your Mac  2. Open it with Chrome from the icon (typically right-click -&gt; Open   With...)        Open the file in Google Chrome.        A pop-up window saying:    The document ��_��_��_index.html��_��_��_ could not be opened. Chrome cannot open   files in the ��_��_��_HTML document��_��_��_ format.    Seems like Chrome should be able to open HTML files found on one's   computer that are opened through double-clicking the file. </pre>
