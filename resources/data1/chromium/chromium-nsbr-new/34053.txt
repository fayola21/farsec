<title>Issue 34053 -   chromium -    Most Greasemonkey Userscripts are not working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Every Version  URLs (if applicable) : userscripts.org           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Userscripts like &quot;Blog comment autofill&quot; or &quot;Twitter Page Follower&quot; are  not working. It's the only reason why I don't switch.      e.g. Autofill the commentform on Blogs (after you Fill your name  Mail and  URL) or follow a whole page of followers with a single click - but there  are many other scripts that don't work      Nothing happens. All is like before installing the script.     </pre>
