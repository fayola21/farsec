<title>Issue 28105 -   chromium -    Mac: mouse cursor incorrectly autohides - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a browser window.  2a. Press Shift-Cmd-B (to show/hide the bookmark bar).  2b. Or press Cmd-C (perhaps after selecting some text; that it does   something even without selecting is another bug).  2c. Or press Cmd-O.  2d. Etc. Use your imagination.      The mouse cursor should not hide for these things. But it does.   (Technically  this is not what I see instead  but what I don't see instead.)    This might be a regression; I'll dig up some older builds to check   tomorrow. I suspect this is due to the fact that we're now plumbing these   commands down to WebKit. </pre>
