<title>Issue 26990 -   chromium -    no way to reordering browser action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> there should be a way to choose the order in wich the browser action are   displayed near the omnibox. for example in the extensions page something like   move left/move right (or move up/move down) or better the ability to move   them directly with the mouse. so an user should order them as he wish. with   many browser action installed can choose the order of them would be very   useful  due to feel and like of users.   </pre>
