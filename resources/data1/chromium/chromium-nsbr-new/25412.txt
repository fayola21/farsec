<title>Issue 25412 -   chromium -    Can't type into flash input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Friends report that they can't type into the login box at all on  <a href="https://online.firsttechcu.com/">https://online.firsttechcu.com/</a>    Both on Mac and Linux.  It works for me on Linux  so I'm not sure what's   going on there; Amanda can confirm on Mac. </pre>
