<title>Issue 32034 -   chromium -    print to pdf suggests untitled for name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. load a web page  2. File-&gt;Print  3. Save as PDF (instead of sending to a printer)        I believe the printer support picks off the window title to suggest the name  it   comes up as &quot;untitled&quot; for chrome  safari gets real titles based on the page   loaded.     </pre>
