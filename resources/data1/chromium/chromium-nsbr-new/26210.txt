<title>Issue 26210 -   chromium -    Mac: Initialize TransportDIBs for plugins all at once rather than one-at-a-time - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We allocate either two or three (depending on the transparency mode)   TransportDIBs for each plugin instance on a web page.    On Mac  we can't allocate shared memory in the sandboxed renderer. The result   is a synchronous IPC message to the browser to allocate the bitmap. This   happens separately for each bitmap  meaning we have either 2 or 3 synchronous   IPC calls in sequence to initialize the plugin rendering context. If we're   doing 3 bitmaps  this is actually 12 context switches.    This should be optimized to get all the backing stores we need in one IPC   call. This should be relatively easy. </pre>
