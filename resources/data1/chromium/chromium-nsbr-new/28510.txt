<title>Issue 28510 -   chromium -    Preferences Dialog Size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.4 (Resmi Derleme 32475)      1. Go to wrench menu in Turkish locale enabled Chrome  2. Click &quot;Se��__enekler&quot; (in English it should be options or preferences)  3. Switch to the &quot;Ki��_��_isel ��__��_eler&quot; tab which is second (in english it should   be Personal Stuff or something like that)        Expected result is all widgets should be accessible and visible.        In the bottom  theme options are placed out of dialog. These are not   accesible because dialog have a fixed size. This problem may affects another   locales too.    I'm using bookmark sync (maybe it's now enabled by default but i didn't check   this i'm still using commandline switch) so on the top of &quot;Ki��_��_isel ��__��_eler&quot;   tab  there's some options about bookmark synchronization.    Also attached a screenshot. </pre>
