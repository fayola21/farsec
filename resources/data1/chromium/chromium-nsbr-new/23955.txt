<title>Issue 23955 -   chromium -    last-of-type-pseudo-class.html fails sporadically on linux/mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I keep seeing sporadic failures for this test after my recent webkit rolls (there   were several CSS changes around <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=48975">r48975</a>-49010  so it's hard to pin it down   further than that).    It's some sort of flakiness as it passes sometimes with the current   expectations.    Note that there's a separate bug for the Windows failure that started   happening back in August (<a href="http://crbug.com/19519">http://crbug.com/19519</a>). I can't tell if these are   related. </pre>
