<title>Issue 45186 -   chromium -    session restoration is too brittle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> i had over 100 tabs open when i force-quit Chrome because it was misbehaving.  upon restart  the   helpful option to restore my pages was shown along with my home page.  today's Google Doodle   lured me into clicking on it and POOF!    i lost the option to restore my session :( </pre>
