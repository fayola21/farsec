<title>Issue 38520 -   chromium -    Bleh Google - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium&gt;    OS version               : &lt;from About This Mac&gt;          Craig said...    How about adding an update feature into the browser? What a nuisance to   have to go and search and download the latest version. Why not make it   possible to download and install new updates from the browsers pulldown?   Also  there are a shitload of extension bugs that make Chrome sloppy as   hell. No copy and paste in the extensions? Come on man.  And the &quot;More Info&quot; link under YouTubes videos isn't always clickable    NetFlix &quot;Play Now&quot; movies can't play in Chrome and the list goes on.   Chrome is a sloppy thing. A real mess. Apple would never let something   like this out.    9:39 AM  March 18  2010      Craig said...    And also  the theme changes by itself and then will not change back to   Google default without a new install of the browser.  In the About Chrome option it checks for an update and says the browser   is up to date when it's not.  More than 9 extensions creates a mess in the address bar  Speed dial   crashes and loses your saved sites over and over again  the Twitter   extension crashes and forgets all your settings and the list goes on. The   extension fails happen in so many extensions which indicates it's because   of the Chrome build.  How can Google really be a good product without customer support?    9:49 AM  March 18  2010      Craig said...    And finally  I just Googled the new Chrome release  the one you're   blogging about here? The Google provided download link doesn't even   come up on the first page. I don't want to go to Softpedia to download it.   Why make your product such a mess?   Ok so you're blogging about it here. Why not put the link up in your blog   post? Google  Google  Google. Your business plan stinks.  I know you'll probably delete my posts because you don't like customers   true feedback.   This is the reason I'll never spend a dime on your products. I will never buy   your phones of anything you release. I predicted know about how you   pissed off your Nexus One customers because of no customer support. It's   frustrating because you make some pretty cool shit but without a line of   contact you're worse than doing business with eBay.    9:56 AM  March 18  2010   </pre>
