<title>Issue 25432 -   chromium -    Investigate media single security origin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now our implementation of hasSingleSecurityOrigin() returns true   because we don't support file types that contain references to other file   types (such as MP4 references).    If/When we do expand to support these types of files we'll need to do   something smarter than return true.  </pre>
