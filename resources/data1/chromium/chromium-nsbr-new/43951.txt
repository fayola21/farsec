<title>Issue 43951 -   chromium -    Devanagari / Thai shaping broken  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Load the test page with Lohit Hindi font installed.   2. Note that U+0947 (vowel sign E) is misplaced and U+0938 ( 'SA' ��__��_) and   U+092E ('MA' : ��__��_ ) overlap each other in Chrome.  In Firefox (see the 2nd   attachment)  neither problem is present.     Somehow  U+0938's advanced width seems to be calculated to be zero.    This is the string chunk with two problems above:    ��___��__��_ ��__��_��_��_��_ ��__�__�___��___��___��__��_     I believe this is a regression (I don't think I've seen this before  but I   might be wrong).    </pre>
