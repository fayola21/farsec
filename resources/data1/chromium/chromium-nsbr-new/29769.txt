<title>Issue 29769 -   chromium -    Push xdg-utils changes back upstream - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> mdm wrote:  &quot;xdg-settings is our own addition to xdg-utils  but really the workaround  belongs in xdg-mime as well (or instead). And of course kdeinit should  be fixed also. This is just the most reliable way to fix it for us since  we don't control the version of xdg-mime that's installed on the system.  Certainly there are upstream bugs to be filed though.&quot;    <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/160184">http://codereview.chromium.org/160184</a> </pre>
