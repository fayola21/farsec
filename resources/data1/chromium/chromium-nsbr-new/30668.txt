<title>Issue 30668 -   chromium -    Websocket in two tabs stops working when closing the first tab window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.272.0 (34668)        1. Open a page with an websocket that periodically sends data to the browser (eg. it sends   the current date 1 time per second).  2. Open the same page in a new tab.  3. Close the first tab (by clicking the tab close button).  4. See that the remaining tab window stops receiving data in the web socket.    NB: I can provide a nodejs sample application for this if you want to. </pre>
