<title>Issue 24148 -   chromium -    Chrome should detect when highlighted text is a URL and give right-click option to Open in new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.221.6    I think it'd be really cool if Chrome could detect when highlighted text is a   URL. Right now  if you highlight a URL that isn't a link  your only option is   to Search Google for it. This doesn't always work well with URLs. I doubt   this would be very difficult since a URL is pretty easy to detect. </pre>
