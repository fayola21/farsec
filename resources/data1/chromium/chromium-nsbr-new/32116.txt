<title>Issue 32116 -   chromium -    sync UI on NTP is broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> when an authentication error occurs (e.g you change your password)  the   NTP receives a message and displays a &quot;re-login&quot; link.  However  this link   is now (since the new bookmark sync / extensions promo) set up to do   nothing except show a &quot;Synced to foo@gmail&quot; yellow box at the top of the   NTP.  The rest of the UI in chrome shows &quot;Bookmark Sync Error&quot;  because   your credentials are actually invalid; clicking this does work as expected.    The problem was caused by   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/462011/show">http://codereview.chromium.org/462011/show</a>.  I (and likely anyone on   this mail list) had no idea this change took place (the code is pretty visibly   broken)... No one on sync was cc'ed  partly my fault for not capturing   new_tab_page_sync_handler.cc in our sync watchlist.    My best fix at the moment is to disable sending any error messages from   sync to the NTP.  A small pretty easy patch.   </pre>
