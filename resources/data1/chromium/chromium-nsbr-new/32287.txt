<title>Issue 32287 -   chromium -    PyAuto: Fill in autodoc constructs for documentation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Look <a title="PyAuto: Implement python interface to Automation Proxy/Provider" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32283"> issue 32283 </a> for pyauto description.    The python interfaces derived from C++ Automation Proxy classes currently   lack documentation. Since these are generated during compile time by SWIG    you cannot put the documentation as-is.    SWIG provides autodoc features that simplify these to a great extent. This is a   tracking bug for filling in the autodoc constructs. </pre>
