<title>Issue 25377 -   chromium -    A UI idea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>      i did a mockup of GUI(in-fact i did it again because of browser/page   action buttons)    tell me how it is..  image link:-   <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_bAD_CMpSlMg/StIJJ4ZNTJI/AAAAAAAAAVk/S1fwAeCqFwo/2009-">http://lh3.ggpht.com/_bAD_CMpSlMg/StIJJ4ZNTJI/AAAAAAAAAVk/S1fwAeCqFwo/2009-</a>  10-09_17-5422.jpg     how is it?please replay   whats the use?   a)       BOOKMARKS FOLDER BUTTON   Chrome��_��_��_s bookmark bar has ��_��_��_Other bookmarks��_��_��_ option at the end which   shows the other bookmark folder were users can save their bookmark.   I just changed the way it looks! In-fact I made it powerful. Now you   need to click on the other bookmark&gt;name of the Folder&gt;the bookmark   Situation 1: Say in session I want the bookmarks only related to study   (say in study related folder) at that time whatever in bookmark bar is   useless. It��_��_��_s really tire some to click on the other bookmark&gt;Study   related&gt;the bookmark each time I want to load a site  don��_��_��_t you people   think a option would be great which loads the bookmarks In the   respected folder? so thing Is I changed only the way i.e. instead of   drop down menu bookmarks will be loaded to the bar itself! I reduced   steps which user should undergo!   b)      ICONIC VIEW   Chrome shows the bookmarks on the bookmark bar with a icon  name of   the site  and floating window with name and little description which   appears when you keep cursor on the bookmark.   I changed it to iconic view in-fact I reduced it to iconic view. if   it��_��_��_s going to be shown in a floating window why do we need to know   twice the same information? Up of all we can easily detect the site   only by icon.   Situation2:in rare occasion user want to have bookmarks of different   pages of a site at that time it��_��_��_s little trouble to put cursor on the   every bookmark and seeing the webpage name so a check marking option   in ��_��_��_bookmark added!��_��_��_ folder would be nice   C)      MINI-UNI-BAR                   It��_��_��_s already implemented in 'browser/page action   buttons' so I��_��_��_m have nothing to say on that matter even though I got   points you can find more about it here   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22099">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22099</a>   Details on how to make browser/page actions is here:   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/BrowserActions</a>   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/PageActionAPIv2">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/PageActionAPIv2</a>   d)      SEARCH BUTTONS                Chrome had a multiple search bars in its previous   versions but unfortunately not now (there is a lot of fuzz about it    you must have come across several post saying the same thing)if you   want a custom search when you having other search engine as default   you must write the site address half/full&gt; press the tab button&gt;write   the key word&gt;hit the enter/press go   According to my mockup all you have to do is  write the key   words&gt;press the search button&gt;click the desired search engine. Isn��_��_��_t   it easier?   leave replay     	   </pre>
