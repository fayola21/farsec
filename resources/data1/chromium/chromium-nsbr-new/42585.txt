<title>Issue 42585 -   chromium -    apps should have a default icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you load an app with no icons defined  you get an empty slot in the   launcher  which looks pretty bad.  I'd imagine that it should be something   other than a puzzle piece  but even the puzzle piece would be better than   blank while we wait for a real default icon.   </pre>
