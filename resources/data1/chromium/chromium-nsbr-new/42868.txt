<title>Issue 42868 -   chromium -    scrollable bookmark folder window initiate on drop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Add a bookmark folder on the bar with 5 bookmarks in it.  Add a bookmark (normal one) to the bar.  Move browser window near bottom of screen so opening this folder causes it to just barely NOT fall   off the bottom of the screen.  Drag a bookmark from the bar to inside this folder; drop.    Note how window stays open after dropping.  This window should be scrollable but isn't.  Close then open it.  See it now scrollable?  Recommend M6.   </pre>
