<title>Issue 38439 -   chromium -    Uninstalling CF doesn't remove registry entries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Install Chrome Frame  2.  Verify that CF registry entries get created.  E.g.  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTCLSID{3E1D0E7F-F5E3-44CC-AA6A-C0A637619AB8}InprocServer32  3.  Uninstall Chrome Frame        I would expect the registry entries to be gone  but they're still there.    This is serious because currently our registration mechanism (ATL rgs   scripts) will not overwrite existing registry keys/values on install.  So  if we overinstall  the new installation will most likely be broken. </pre>
