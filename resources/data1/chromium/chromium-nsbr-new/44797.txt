<title>Issue 44797 -   chromium -    shortcut for bookmark manager on windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  there is no shortcut for the bookmark manager on Windows. On mac    it's ctrl+alt+b. We've been skittish about doing this on Windows because alt   is generally reserved for the system but let's try it out and and see if   anything breaks.   </pre>
