<title>Issue 37641 -   chromium -    Feature request: Display a warning when submitting a password over unsecured HTTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> So I've noticed some high-profile sites launching without SSL in their login and/or signup forms.   This scares me  because I like my passwords kept secret.    It'd be cool if Chrome warned you when you were submitting an &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot;&gt; over   unsecured HTTP. This warning would both (a) raise awareness among users that their passwords are   floating around in plaintext  especially if they're using an unsecured wireless network  and (b)   encourage web developers to use HTTPS  which should be the standard for login forms anyway.    This warning could be in the form of a yellow warning bar at the top of the page or some kind of   notice when the information is actually being transmitted. (Could get tricky with XHRs  etc.) </pre>
