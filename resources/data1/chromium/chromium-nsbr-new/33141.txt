<title>Issue 33141 -   chromium -    Extensions Gallery - Too long descriptions are clipped with no warning while typing or before publishing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Edit a description of an extension  add more than 2000 characters and publish   the extension.  The description was clipped.  No warning is shown regarding the excessive length of the description  while   typing or when clicking &quot;Publish&quot;.    Suggestions -  - Add a counter (as an indicator  to cover this behavior - lame).  - Add a counter that turns red when there are more than 2000 characters (kind of   perfect).  - Add a length validation when publishingwhile typing (kind of perfect).  - Add a length validation while typing that will not let the user type anything else   (not sufficient when pasting and annoying). </pre>
