<title>Issue 36247 -   chromium -    Multiple worker UI tests fail after WebKit roll - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. run ui_tests of workers (see detailed list below)                  Almost all worker-related UI tests failed after updating to WebKit release  54944:54996 (<a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/651017">http://codereview.chromium.org/651017</a>). I tried to debug the  cause  but I'm completely unfamiliar with workers code  so in the end I  disabled them.  The following is the list of failing tests:    IncognitoSharedWorkers  MultipleSharedWorkers  MultipleTabsQueuedSharedWorker  MultipleWorkers  QueuedSharedWorkerShutdown  QueuedSharedWorkerStartedFromOtherTab  SharedWorkerFastLayoutTests  SharedWorkerHttpAuth  SingleSharedWorker  SingleWorker  WorkerClonePort  WorkerClose  WorkerCloseFast  WorkerContextGc  WorkerContextMultiPort  WorkerEventListener  WorkerGC  WorkerHttpAuth  WorkerLocation  WorkerMessagePort  WorkerMessagePortGC  WorkerMultiPort  WorkerNavigator  WorkerReplaceGlobalConstructor  WorkerReplaceSelf  WorkerTerminate  WorkerXhrHttpLayoutTests    </pre>
