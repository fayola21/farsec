<title>Issue 35963 -   chromium -    WorkerTest.StressJSExecution is disabled on Linux and Mac because it crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The test runs a worker and then closes the main window. Apparently  this  causes termination of the worker process while the worker thread is still  running.  I see various effects:  ---------  # Fatal error in /b/slave/linux/build/src/v8/src/handles.h  line 128  # CHECK(cur &lt; current_.limit) failed  ---------  # Fatal error in  /Volumes/500GB/chrome/src/v8/tools/gyp/../../src/objects-inl.h  line 1562  # CHECK(object-&gt;IsCompilationCacheTable()) failed  ---------  pure virtual method called  terminate called without an active exception  (attached file with the call stack)     </pre>
