<title>Issue 42653 -   chromium -    Exiting chrome before initial sync finishes results in broken sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open chrome. Start syncing.  2. Sign in. When you see the dialog box with the green checkbox  quickly hit OK and QUIT chrome   right away. Preferably with a keyboard shortcut for speed.  3. Restart chrome. About:sync will show initial sync ended = false  and initial sync ended will never   finish.     Sync will be broken from now on until you start and stop syncing again.     </pre>
