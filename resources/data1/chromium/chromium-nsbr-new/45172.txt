<title>Issue 45172 -   chromium -    Extensions: chrome.tabs.create active window from extension UI (browser action) in incognito window opens in non-incognito window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The default window (no param passed) for chrome.tabs.create defaults to a   non-incognito window  even if the create is called from an incognito window   (example: Install   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/caehdcpeofiiigpdhbabniblemipncjj">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/caehdcpeofiiigpdhbabniblemipncjj</a>   and press Browser Action &gt; Options from an incognito window.  If no non-  incognito window is open  it will create one.  If a non-incognito window is   open  it will open there.  This serves as distraction and breaks the expected   flow of actions.    (Sorry for lack of minimal test-case) </pre>
