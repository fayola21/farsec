<title>Issue 29432 -   chromium -    Find-in bar disappears on drag and drop. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.249.27 (Official Build 33803) and ToT.    Looks like the <a title="Drag and drop: Paint issues with Find-in bar." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3245"> issue 3245 </a> is back?? The find-in bar is not painted well   there  but it disappears here.    -Ctrl+f to find-in bar and drag and drop the tab out.    Notice the find-in bar disappears  but if you have searched for a word  the   results are still highlighted in the dropped tab.   </pre>
