<title>Issue 40715 -   chromium -    Need to reenable SyncSetupWizard unittests on OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Had to perform some hacks to get the customize UI in for OS X.  A side effect of this is that it breaks   SyncSetupWizard unittests  since it relies on intercepting Browser::BrowserShowHtmlDialog()  and   HTML dialogs on OS X (now) don't do that.    Steps to fix this:  - Make ShowHtmlDialog return a gfx::NativeWindow for the shown HtmlDialog (or maybe pass it to   the delegate via a callback).  - Create a HtmlDialogShower interface and use that instead of intercepting Browser calls for   SyncSetupWizard unittests.   </pre>
