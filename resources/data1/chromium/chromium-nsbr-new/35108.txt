<title>Issue 35108 -   chromium -    LOAD_IGNORE_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID not work with ssl_client_socket_mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When we specify LOAD_IGNORE_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID  it ignores   ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID  and just returns OK to Connect   CompletionCallback.  It works for Windows and NSS  but for Mac SSL socket  the error is returned   in the middle of connect sequence and didn't finish SSL handshake yet.  So  we'll get OK for Connect CompletionCallback  but completed_handshake_ is   false yet. Thus  we can't Read/Write on the socket. </pre>
