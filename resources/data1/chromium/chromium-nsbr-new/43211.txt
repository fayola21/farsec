Operate browser running some version older than 5.0.342.9 in USA.  Default search engine:   google.com  2. Receive update to chrome version 5.0.342.9 while traveling in Ireland.

Default search   engine changed to: google.com        Having not made changes to my default search engine  updates should not affect my selection.

Worse  there does not be any straightforward way (without going online and   installing a 'custom' search engine) to change the build back to google.com without manual   configuration.    <b>Please provide
