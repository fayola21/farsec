<title>Issue 30454 -   chromium -    Content Scripts are enabled in Incognito - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version:  Google Chrome	4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  WebKit		532.6  V8		2.0.3.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)  		AppleWebKit/532.6 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.266.0   Safari/532.    So.  I'm using the &quot;Google Image Relinker&quot; content script (or maybe it was   a user script?).  This is supposed to change the links in Google Images to   go directly to their source and not show the framed page. I came across an   image that I wanted to see the framed page but since there's way to re-  enable the links to the frames  I figured I'd just go into incognito   because I remembered the extensions being disabled for incognito.    ...I still had the same problem though.  I even tried alternate searches   (thinking it may be pulling from the cache) but it's still doing its magic.    This needs to be fixed asap :) </pre>
