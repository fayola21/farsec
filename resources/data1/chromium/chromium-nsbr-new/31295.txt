<title>Issue 31295 -   chromium -    UI locks up after file save/open dialog for Save link as  or Choose file button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)    Other browsers tested: N/A    What steps will reproduce the problem (Choose file)?  1. Click the &quot;Choose file&quot; HTML button on an upload form  2. Enter location in dialog  click Open  3. Wait for UI to become responsive after dialog is closed  and filename to   be shown next to the button on the form.      The UI would respond and filename displayed immediately.      The UI becomes unresponsive for at least a whole second  until the filename   is finally displayed on the form. Also  hovering over say another upload   button (e.g. multi-upload form)  the button highlight does not work  in   fact the button that was click keeps the highlight until the filename is   displayed and the UI becomes responsive again.    What steps will reproduce the problem (Save as)?  1. Right click a link  choose &quot;Save as...&quot;  2. Enter location in dialog  click Save  3. Wait for UI to become responsive after dialog is closed      The UI would respond immediately      The UI becomes unresponsive for at least a whole second. Seems to also   occur when pressing Cancel. When pressed Save  UI becomes responsive   approximately the same time as the download animation begins.        Running Chrome on an Intel Atom N270 w/1GB RAM. This is very repeatable on   my system. </pre>
