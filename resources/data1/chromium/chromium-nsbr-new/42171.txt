<title>Issue 42171 -   chromium -    New glibc malloc hook overrides will break debugalllocation and heapchecker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the odd cases where we still manage to enter libc malloc code  debugallocation and heapchecker   won't work properly  due to the hackiness of debugallocation and different stack frames for   heapchecker.  It should be pretty easy to fix. </pre>
