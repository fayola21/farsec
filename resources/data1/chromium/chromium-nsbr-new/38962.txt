<title>Issue 38962 -   chromium -    Vista perf bot is very slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Vista Perf bot that runs the page_cycler tests is very very slow. It is   much slower than any other perf bot  or than my devel machine. A DB perf test   that takes ~10s to run on any other perf bot takes almost 2 minutes to run on   the Vista perf bot.    I'm not sure where the slowness comes from  but judging by the stack traces   Nicolas and I saw  it looks like it might be caused by poor disk IO   performance. </pre>
