[-] SHELL.APPLICATION 80070002: Failed to open zip file.  ... Failed to checkout svn automatically.  Please visit <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">http://subversion.tigris.org</a> to download the latest subversion   clie  nt  before continuing.  You can also get the &quot;prebacked&quot; version used at   <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/tru">http://src.chromium.org/svn/tru</a>  nk/tools/third_party/      Something a little less vague maybe.  Many of us have disabled Windows integrated zip handling.  You can of course re-enable it with:  regsvr32 %WINDIR%system32zipfldr.dll  And then run gclient.  But a better error message would be nice...it took me longer than it should   have to figure out what was going on. </pre>
