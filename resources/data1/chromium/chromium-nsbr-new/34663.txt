<title>Issue 34663 -   chromium -    Chrome Linux Dual Monitor Restore bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.1 dev for Linux    I have a dual screen setup under gnome.  If I shutdown chrome and then restart it  I will often get maximized 'full   screen' windows on the second monitor (no window decoration  tab bar  or   any other bar).  Pressing F11 does _NOT_ fix the problem.    Please note that F11 works fine on both monitors normally - it just doesn't   work with the weird state that gets restored on startup.  I think a   maximized window on the second screen gets restored as a &quot;super&quot;-maximized   window on the second screen that is F11 immune (even though F11 attempts to   do something).    The only way to fix the problem I've found is to disconnect (via xrandr)   the second monitor -&gt; all apps move to first monitor  then F11 works.  However if I now plug the second monitor back in  the problem comes back.  However  if instead I slightly change the position of the chrome window  so   that it doesn't get pushed back to the second screen  than I get plug the   second screen back in.  I've now fixed that window  and can move it (drag)   back to second monitor  maximize it there  use F11  etc. </pre>
