<title>Issue 37405 -   chromium -    Step Over on the last statement of an event handler does not break in the next handler in chain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have two event handlers for the same element  stop on a breakpoint in the   first one.  2. While on the last line of the handler function  hit F10 (Step Over)    What is the expected output?  The debugger should break on the first line of the next event handler   (skipping the execution of all native code in between).    What do you see instead?  The second handler runs without breaking.   </pre>
