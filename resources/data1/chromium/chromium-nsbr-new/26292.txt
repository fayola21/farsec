<title>Issue 26292 -   chromium -    Titlebar has too little vertical space for easy grab &amp; drag window positioning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29902)                    1. Create enough tabs to fill horizontal space.  2. Drag window by titlebar.    - What is the expected result?    To reposition the browser window.    - What happens instead?    Accidental grab and repositioning/detachment of a tab.    - Why?    Chrome's custom titlebar decoration is very short  resulting in difficulty  grabbing the window.  The titlebar decoration above the tabs should be  larger by default.    I have only recognized/tested this issue under MacOS.   </pre>
