<title>Issue 35698 -   chromium -    Chrome keeps open a Keychain related file descriptor  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I tried and was unable to eject an external drive that's mounted on my   machine because Google Chrome.app is holding open a file descriptor   referring to a path that's part of my Keychain.    The workaround is to kill and restart  which sucks when you've got 78 tabs   open.    $ lsof -p 2275 | grep univ  Google    2275 bvadnais  txt      REG       14 9     99308 3729366   /Volumes/universe/migrations/pop/bvadnais/Library/Keychains/login-  2.keychain   </pre>
