<title>Issue 33010 -   chromium -    reordering does not work on &quot;New Tab&quot; page (by drag&amp;drop) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.306.0                    1. Open &quot;New Tab&quot; page;  2. Drag one of the thumbnails to another place.      The thumbnails are expected to swap positions.      Nothing happens (the thumbnail &quot;flies&quot; back as if the drag&amp;drop operation   failed).    OS: openSUSE 11.2 x86_64 </pre>
