<title>Issue 27642 -   chromium -    crash when doing infinite recursion with console.log - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the 4.0.237.0 dev channel build of chrome  and a fairly recent debug build    (at <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31822">r31822</a>)  I get a crash in v8 when running this code in the javascript   console:    function foo(i) { console.log(i); foo(i+1); }   foo(1)      The crash is somewhere in v8 but only seems to happen when using the   console.log function (if I leave that out v8 properly throws the &quot;Maximum   call stack size exceeded&quot; error)  so I'm guessing this is more of a devtools   issue.   </pre>
