<title>Issue 42734 -   chromium -    incognito window trashing the session if closed last - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (chromium ToT on Ubuntu)      1. open a few tabs in chromium  2. make sure &quot;reopen the pages that were open last&quot; is set in options/basic  3. open an incognito window  4. close the main window  5. close the incognito window  6. restart chromium    What is the expected output?    =&gt; chromium with all the tabs from 1.    What do you see instead?    =&gt; chromium with no tab    fortunately  it's possible to retrieve the tabs from the &quot;recently closed   list in the NTP but the incognito window shouldn't impact the regular   session at all. </pre>
