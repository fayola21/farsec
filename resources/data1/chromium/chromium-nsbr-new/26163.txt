<title>Issue 26163 -   chromium -    Don't reload extensions management page to refresh - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we are being lazy and refreshing the management page whenever the   loaded extensions change. We should instead just modify the DOM.    Raf tells me that this should be really easy. We should be able to just   rebuild the JSON data and send it into the same init() function that we call   on startup and it JSTemplate should just rebuild the DOM magically. </pre>
