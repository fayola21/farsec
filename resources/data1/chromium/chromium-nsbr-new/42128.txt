<title>Issue 42128 -   chromium -    SpdySession::ReadSocket et al may use MessageLoop::PostTask dangerously - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> reviewing net/spdy/spdy_session.cc I think we need to use a ScopedRunnableMethodFactory for the   PostTask calls we make there  otherwise they're potentially unsafe if a SpdySession errors out    removes itself from the pool  gets deleted  and then has its task called.    I can't produce a problem on this yet  but I wanted an issue to check in code against for this   problem.   </pre>
