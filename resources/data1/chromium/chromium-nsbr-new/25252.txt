<title>Issue 25252 -   chromium -    toString fn creates retain/release thrash in V8 bindings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The trivial inline function 'toString' defined in V8Binding.h  which is supposed to be a no-op    actually isn't:        inline String toString(const String&amp; string)      {          return string;      }    GCC generates both a String constructor and destructor call as a result of inlining this  which each   generate code. This can be fixed by changing the result type to &quot;const String&amp;&quot;  after which the   function truly is a no-op.     This simple change shaves 97kbytes of redundant code off of a release Mac build of Chrome. </pre>
