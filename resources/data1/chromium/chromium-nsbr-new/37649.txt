<title>Issue 37649 -   chromium -    src/app should not depend on src/chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Both webkit.gyp and app_base.gypi have:  'include_dirs': [    '../chrome/third_party/wtl/include'   ]     In both cases  this seems like a layering violation.  We should move   src/chrome/third_party/wtl to src/third_party/wtl to avoid this violation.    Someone tell me if this is a dumb idea or if there is another way to get rid of   this dependency. </pre>
