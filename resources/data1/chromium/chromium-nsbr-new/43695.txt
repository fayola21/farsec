<title>Issue 43695 -   chromium -    search box can occlude result - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29 beta OSX    if i search for text that appears at the very top right of a web page  the result chrome is trying   to highlight can be occluded by the search box  itself.  not sure what the solution should be.    maybe shift the page down when this happens so everything is below the search box? </pre>
