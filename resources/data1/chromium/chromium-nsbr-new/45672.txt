<title>Issue 45672 -   chromium -    &quot;google chrome renderer&quot; is active idle per tab on osx  eats laptop battery - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1             Safari 4: OK. 0.4% cpu total w/ 10 tabs after prefetcher exits    Firefox 3.6: OK  0.1% cpu total w/ 10 tabs       1. open chrome.   2. go to www.google.com.  3. cmd-tab twenty times to create twenty tabs.        after loading pages  cpu should idle except as required to re-render tab switches  etc.         Google Chrome Renderer stays CPU active  at about 25%. Increasing per tab. at 30 tabs it stays at   about 32%.    Sampling using ActivityMonitor shows 99.7% of this time in CFRunLoopRunSpecific     Worse yet  opening a second window with a similar number of tabs will create an additional   similar load. </pre>
