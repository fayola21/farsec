<title>Issue 23853 -   chromium -    Linux/Views does not have an external protocol handler dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In external_protocol_handler.cc  ExternalProtocolHandler::LaunchUrl does  not ask the user if they want to launch external protocol handers on  Linux/Views.    (See <a title="Chrome/mac doesn't support OS X's url handlers" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=15546"> issue 15546 </a> for the equivalent Mac bug.) </pre>
