<title>Issue 27480 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame user data directory should be moved to Chrome Frame after updating to latest version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install CF - 223.9   2. In IE navigate to cf:about: - This should create ChromeFrame @   C:UsersusernameAppDataLocalGoogle  3. Install CF - 244  4. In IE navigate to cf:about: - This will create Chrome Frame @   C:UsersusernameAppDataLocalGoogle    Issue: Ideally we should be moving the ChromeFrame data to Chrome Frame. But   it might be an issue if CF is in use.   Also  on uninstalling CF-244  the older directory ChromeFrame still lies   around. </pre>
