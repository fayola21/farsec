<title>Issue 42312 -   chromium -    Report a different behaviour of chrome respect both firefox3.6 an IE7 on a css unspecified situation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1059 (44723)    Hi  I just wanted to report a different behaviour of chrome respect both   firefox3.6 an IE7 on a css unspecified situation that I've come across   during coding my website.    The situation is when you have an element with css position attribute set   to 'absolute' but you have no provided any 'top' 'right' 'left' 'bottom'   properties  in that situation both Firefox3.6 and IE7 (not tested other ie   versions but I suppose behaves the same) applies the top and left values   that would correspond to the element with the normal flow of the page    chrome also assumes top to be according value with the normal flow of the   page but for left it uses zero.    I've had a look to the CSS2 spec and it doesn't explain this situation.    I think the firefox and IE behaviour is better for website design because   the absolute element is positioned in the expected place according to the   normal flow of your html page.    So I think this is an easy fix issue that would improve the html   compatibility of current main browsers.     </pre>
