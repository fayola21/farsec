<title>Issue 25139 -   chromium -    Kill all non-Windows uses of PATH_MAX - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> PATH_MAX sucks.  It's not really the maximum length of a pathname  it's just   a poseur.  Pathnames are allowed to be longer than PATH_MAX characters    although in some cases  if they are  some system and third-party routines will   still break down.    If there are system breakdowns due to PATH_MAX  that's fine.  Well  it's not   fine  but it's beyond our control  so we'll deal.  We shouldn't have any   PATH_MAX-related breakdowns in our own code  though.    I found a handful of uses of PATH_MAX in our codebase.  Almost all of them   will be really easy to kill.  A couple of them will only be fairly easy to kill. </pre>
