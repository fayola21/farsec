<title>Issue 24207 -   chromium -    Rewrite or skip poorly written test: fast/events/attempt-scroll-with-no-scrollbars.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ( Migrated from http://buganizer/issue?id=1166644 ).      iyengar on May 09 2008 14:36  (Assigned)  Summary     The attempt-scroll-with-no-scrollbars.html layout test fails due to the  fix for 1164704  Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; WebKit &gt; Port  Reporter     iyengar  Assignee     iyengar  Verifier     iyengar  CC     chrome-bugs  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  URLs affected     &lt;none&gt;  Notes  The above layout test fails due to the fix for 1164704  which is an issue  with scrolling not working  on a scrollview created with scrollbars disabled. This test also fails with  webkit on windows. We  should monitor this with the subsequent webkit merges.  jonc on October 13 2008 16:24  (Assigned)  Notes  Please check this against the ToT and our recent merge with WebKit.  tc on December 22 2008 15:05  (Assigned)  Notes  Still fails.  FWIW  Firefox on linux also allows scrolling with no  scrollbars.  Not sure this is necessary or important.     </pre>
