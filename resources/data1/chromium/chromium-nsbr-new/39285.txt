<title>Issue 39285 -   chromium -    Chrome stores size and position of popup not of main window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.307.11 (Build 39572) beta  Is this the most recent version: yes (in beta  not in unstable)  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86  Window manager: Gnome  URLs (if relevant): dhl.de (just as an example)  Behavior in Linux Firefox: ok  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): ok      1. Go to <a href="http://www.dhl.de/en.html">http://www.dhl.de/en.html</a> (with Javascript enabled)  2. Click &quot;Advanced Search&quot; (on the left side  popup will open)  3. Close Chrome main window  4. Close popup window  5. Restart Chrome    Chrome will open the main window with the size and position of the popup   window  that was closed as the last window in the previous session. Chrome   4.1 on Windows does not do that  it correctly opens the main window with   the last main window's size and position  even if the popup was closed as   the last window.        Chrome should always start with the size and position of the main window of   the previous session.        Chrome opens with the size and position of the popup window of the previous   session  if the popup window was closed as the last window.   </pre>
