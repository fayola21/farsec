<title>Issue 42151 -   chromium -    Should overwrite corrupt preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As part of the fix to <a title="need more robust handling of Preferences errors" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38352"> issue 38352 </a>  I put preferences into read only mode   when there was a parse error with the idea that a parse error was likely   caused by them hand-editing the file incorrectly and that they could thus   fix what they had done.  However  the error rate turned out to be much   higher than expected  meaning that this is happening in some automated way    which means that users are getting stuck with unreadable preferences and no   easy way to fix it (since most users won't know how to manually repair   this).  You can see the effect of this in that the number of people hitting   the parse error is increasing daily.    <a title="add protections against Preferences corruption"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40546">Bug 40546</a> is for the longer term fix here (backup files  auto recovery    more diagnosis to find the root cause  etc.)  but given how close we are to   mstone-5  it's important to improve the situation on the branch.   </pre>
