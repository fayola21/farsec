<title>Issue 39254 -   chromium -    Form auto-complete menus open upward in some multi-monitor setups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.360.0 (42303) Ubuntu   (chrome-daily ppa)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Kubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): amd64  Window manager: KWin (KDE SC 4.3.5)  URLs (if relevant): N/A  Behavior in Linux Firefox: N/A  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): not yet      1. Set up the monitors vertically  placing the browser window on the lower   one.  2. Bring up a form auto-complete menu (is this the right term?) - my   example are the search boxes on this very page.  3. Observe as the menu opens upward from the cursor position. Doesn't   matter if such menu will render into the monitor above (att #1)  or render   into non-monitor space (att #2)      Menus behave the same way as on a primary monitor at 0x0 offset = menu   positioning logic should take into account:  -changing resolution  -switching monitors  -adding/repositioning monitors after the browser is started  -non-maximmized browser windows across multiple monitors      See above.  The problem here seems to be that whatever is responsible for these menus:  1) does not take into account multi-monitor setups. If I attach a big   monitor after chromium is started and its Y size is bigger than that of the   primary monitor  menus try to fit into the resolution of the original    primary monitor.  2) ignores the Y-offset of the monitor - this bug will show whenever the   menu should pop up outside a rectangle  the size of which is defined by the   (primary) monitor  but Y offset (position) is always at 0 - hence is more   likely to show up in vertical setups than horizontal  though it's possible   to have the menu pop up downwards (correctly) on a vertical setup and   upwards (incorrectly) on a horizontal setup. (examples attached)    Side note - the menu-positioning-with-multi-monitor problem w.r.t. GTK   menus (Config  Page  context menus) was recently addressed and solved in   <a title="Menus open upward with vertically stacked monitors (and get truncated at the boundary)" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14184"> issue 14184 </a> - I don't know if the autocomp. menus are different (webkit   code?) or just don't use the logic (yet). </pre>
