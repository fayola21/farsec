<title>Issue 30152 -   chromium -    Dutch: On Mac OS use the imperative (��_��_��_gebiedende wijs��_��_��_) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dutch    4.0.249.30    Mac OS X 10.6.2    On Mac OS the imperative (��_��_��_gebiedende wijs��_��_��_) is used  instead of the full verb. This   is a better translation for two reasons: 1. more compact words with more distinct   endings (almost all Dutch verbs end in ��_��_��_-en��_��_��_) and 2. the imperative is the correct   way to address a computer. You are effectively telling the computer what to do. In   that situation the imperative is the right way.    Note that this is different from Windows. There the full verb is usually used. It may   be desirable to keep the current translation for Windows (though I am not very   familiar with that OS  and am not very well informed as to what is preferred there.)    I've filed those with the highest visibility as separate issues. There are still plenty   places throughout Google Chrome using the wrong version.    I strongly recommend comparing the translation against the one being used in   Safari. </pre>
