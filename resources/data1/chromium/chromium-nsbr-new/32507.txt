<title>Issue 32507 -   chromium -    Script loads hang with dynamic script tags and multiple XHR requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. load one or more scripts with &quot;dynamic script tags&quot; approach  adding   &quot;script&quot; elements to the DOM  2. at the same time  make 6 or more XHR requests simultaneously        That all scripts and all XHR requests will load properly      Chrome seems to abandon the script tag loading (and sort of &quot;hang&quot; in   loading) once 6 or more simultaneous XHR requests are made. The XHR   requests all complete  but the script requests never complete  and the   browser continues to &quot;spin&quot; forever as if it's still loading resources.      <b>Please provide
