<title>Issue 37001 -   chromium -    files cannot be uploaded normally - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium Version : 5.0.339.0 (Developer Build 40203) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: it is  in ubuntu PPA  I guess ...  OS + version: ubuntu lucid  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  Window manager: metacity    I cannot send mails in gmail with attachments: attachments are simply   missing from the mail if I check the sent mail or ask the rcpt about it.   Also for example youtube video upload reports problem with converting the   stream. All of these works with other browsers it seems and also with older   versions of chromium. </pre>
