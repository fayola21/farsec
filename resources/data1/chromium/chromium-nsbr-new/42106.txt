<title>Issue 42106 -   chromium -    printing with giant font and truncation in latest build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.375.9 (Official Build   44625) dev  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: ubuntu 8.04.4  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: kde    In the latest build of chrome  I printed some pages and they come out with   a giant font  so lines of text with 80 chars don't even fit on the page.  I   noticed this printing from gmail first  where it looks fine on the screen   but what prints out (or saves to pdf) looks bad  with lots of truncated   lines.    Attached is a test case html file with an 80 char line  and what I get when   I print it to pdf.  I expect that line to fit on the page without   truncation.    This used to work fine in the build from two weeks ago.  I was also forced   to reboot since then though  so something else may have changed.  But I   tried in firefox  and it still prints with a more reasonable font and with   lines wrapped correctly when necessary. </pre>
