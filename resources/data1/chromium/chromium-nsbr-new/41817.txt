<title>Issue 41817 -   chromium -    SVG Flakiness  most often in fast/backgrounds/svg-as-background-1.html and fast/backgrounds/svg-as-background-3.html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Somewhere around 57659 -&gt; 57677  the windows svg layout tests for svg-as-  background-1 and svg-as-background-2 started getting flaky.    At first  I thought it was just some font change so I rebaselined it.  Then   it changed again  and also just looked like a small font   alignment/scrollbar alignment issue  so I rebaselined again.  But it keeps   failing.    I'll be adding them to test-expectations upstream in a little bit.    At the same time  the following on linux seems to have started going flaky.    Unexpected flakiness: image mismatch (3)    svg/text/text-intro-05-t.svg = IMAGE PASS    svg/text/text-text-07-t.svg = IMAGE PASS    svg/text/text-tselect-02-f.svg = IMAGE PASS    Regressions: Unexpected image and text mismatch : (1)    svg/filters/filterRes.svg = IMAGE+TEXT </pre>
