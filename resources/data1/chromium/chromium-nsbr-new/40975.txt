<title>Issue 40975 -   chromium -    Chromium needs to restart when an update is available when running in the background. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Run Chromium in the background (--long-lived-extensions flag + persistent extension   installed  but no windows open).  2. Have the auto-updater download an update.    Expected result:  Chromium should auto-restart to pick up the update (at least on Windows/Linux - the Mac is a little   different because we already run in the background there without restarting for updates  so it's not   clear that we should change that behavior). </pre>
