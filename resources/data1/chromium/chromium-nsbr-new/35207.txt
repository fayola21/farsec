<title>Issue 35207 -   chromium -    Chrome javascript or some other issue cause wicked long time for page to finish in Chrome  earlier chrome version was wicked fast. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 (36714)  for Windows  URLs (if applicable) : Not available for everyone  Other browsers tested: Safari  Firefox  IE8         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      I have developed a site for a customer where one page are using a lot of javascript to &quot;organize&quot;   the data sent to the client. (site need login to be able to test  so cannot give access).    Depending on a filter in that page  the client can request for little data or more data beeing   returned to the browser.  The more data  the longer the javascript will take to finish.    Earlier versions of chrome was wicked fast compared to all other browsers except Safari.    After installing this version of Chrome I discovered that Chrome suddenly did not manage to   display this page well (Note: the code for the page has not been changed).    I have tested in latest official version of Safari for win  and it is as fast as before.    I asked a question at Google Chrome help forum where I could get the previous official release of   Chrome for windows. Here:  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?fid=1a6d7b7478fc7ed200047f1f8ac33f17&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?fid=1a6d7b7478fc7ed200047f1f8ac33f17&amp;hl=en</a>    The answer was to download from this site:  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_google_chrome">http://www.filehippo.com/download_google_chrome</a>    My problem is that I'm unable to figure out what was my previous version of Chrome from the site   above.    I'm not using dev channel  just clicking the wrench and &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; to see if there is a   new official release available  and if it is I click update.  (Do not want to use dev channel either.)    I want to switch back to test with previous official released version  do some tests  then install   this version again and run the same tests... so I can post the exact findings here.    Could someone here please tell me which version before this that was an official Chrome release?    Regards </pre>
