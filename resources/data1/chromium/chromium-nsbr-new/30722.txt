<title>Issue 30722 -   chromium -    Extension preferences are not saved when I delete cookies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. I download an extension (such as mouse gestures)  2. I provide preferences for the extension.  3. I delete cookies.  4. Extension preferences are deleted as well.      The expected result is that the extension preferences should not be deleted    when I delete my cookies       The extension preferences are deleted along with the cookies.    There needs to be a way to keep my preferences while also deleting other   cookies.       </pre>
