<title>Issue 41981 -   chromium -    Windowless plugin custom cursors are broken. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Setting cursors in windowless plugins no longer works; I don't have an exact regression point  but   it's somewhere between Jan 15 (when the Carbon part of <a title="Plugin custom cursors are not supported." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20717"> bug 20717 </a> landed) and March 19th (the last   archived build we have.)    It looks like the issue that m_ignoreSetCursor in ChromeClientImpl.cpp was working around no   longer exists  so now the workaround just prevents all plugin cursor setting from succeeding. </pre>
