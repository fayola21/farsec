<title>Issue 23454 -   chromium -    Google Chrome Frame fails to work with the web application we are developing - redirects broken - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     I am developing a web-based application called Meeting Room. Its instance  is available at <a href="https://loft.spartez.com/ve">https://loft.spartez.com/ve</a>    The app works on all decent browsers (FF  Opera  Safari  Chrome  IE8). It  does not look too well on IE6 and IE7 though  so I tried to GCF-enable it  as a quick fix.    The problem is - GCF does not seem to want to get past the login screen. It  also does not seem to support redirections and opening new windows/tabs  properly.    Th easiest way to test this behaviour is to go to the URL above and try to  log in with some bogus credentials. The expected behaviour is that a red  error message will be shown. The behaviour with GCF is that nothing happens.    Supplying proper credentials does not work either - the browser is stuck at  the logiun screen and does not redirect to index.jsp as it should. If after  pressing the login button you actually supply the index.jsp page manually  in the address bar  the web app loads fine and works fine. But all links in  it that redirect do not work.    If you want to test the after-login behaviour of GFC on my web app  I can  set you up with some valid credentials    Cheers  Janusz Gorycki (kalamon@gmail.com)    GFC version that I use (installed today):    Google Chrome	4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)  WebKit	532.0  V8	1.3.11  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)  AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.211.7 Safari/532.0 </pre>
