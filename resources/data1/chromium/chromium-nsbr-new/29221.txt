<title>Issue 29221 -   chromium -    Swedish: Bad translation of &quot;Show in Finder&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Swedish      4.0.249.12      Mac OS X 10.6      1. Open the popup menu for completed downloads in the download bar by   clicking on the arrow button.  2. Look for the menu option &quot;Show in Finder&quot;.  3. In the Swedish localization  this is translated as &quot;Visa i s��__kare&quot;. Which   indeed is the same thing as &quot;Show in finder&quot;  but not using the word   &quot;finder&quot; as a product name  but rather a common word. Finder in OS X is a   built-in application and not translated  not even in the Swedish edition of   OS X 10.6.    Screenshots attached to exemplify Apple's proper translation vs Chrome's   improper translation of the product name as a word. </pre>
