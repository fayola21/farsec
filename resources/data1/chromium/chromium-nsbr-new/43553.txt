<title>Issue 43553 -   chromium -    Pac file processing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 dev    OS version               : Mac OS 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works in Safari on Mac  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Broken in Firefox also  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Works in Chrome on Windows      Set system-wide proxy setting to use auto configuration with PAC file. The pac file contains an if   statement that uses myIpAddress() to get system IPaddress to compare against.      The browser will go to a different proxy server depending on the network it resides on.      The browser is not matching the network check for a network address such as &quot;192.168.1.0&quot; yet   other browsers do (IE  Safari  Chrome on Windows 7). Chrome on Mac just uses the fallback   proxy each time.    Is myIpAddress() implemented for PAC processing? If so does it send the correct host IP address   (IPv4)? </pre>
