<title>Issue 39881 -   chromium -    When a user wipes all history  then all DNS preresolution data should also be discarded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently discard all DNS info when we exit incognito mode.  We should   also call similar hooks to discard all data when the user asks us to discard   all history.    We can't force a discard of more distant records (examples: external DNS   resolvers  etc.)  but we can get rid of records of prefetch savings  and   records of what sub-resources may be helpful to pre-resolve during future   navigations. </pre>
