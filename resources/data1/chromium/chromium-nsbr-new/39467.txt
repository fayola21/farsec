<title>Issue 39467 -   chromium -    Page actions draw weird when dragging tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have an extension that has a page action icon in the Omnibox (I'm using the Dictionary one)  2. Note that icon is drawn correctly (1.png).  3. Start dragging the tab out of the tab strip. The page action icon disappears (2.png).  4. Drag the detached tab back into the tab strip (but don't release yet). The icon will be drawn as   a strange line (3.png).  5. Finally release the tab into the original tab strip and the icon is drawn correctly (looks like   1.png).      Icon is drawn correctly throughout all drag operations. Maybe this is a misuse of converting   points to/from different window coordinate systems?       </pre>
