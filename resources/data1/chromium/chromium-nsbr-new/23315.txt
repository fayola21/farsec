<title>Issue 23315 -   chromium -    archive_build should be driven from the source - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The archive_build step for official builds is a build slave script.    Some of it is driven from file lists checked into the tree  but some of it is not.    When the build output changes  we often have to change the archive_build.py script to keep the official   build working. However  this means that the build slave will likely fail if we then feed it an official build   from an older branch.    I'd like the entire archive step to be driven from files/programs checked into the source tree. That way any   branch should continue to build properly (if something changes  we can patch any branch to do the right   thing).    I don't care how we do this.    Assigning to Eric  but anyone with good ideas and who has any understanding of the current spaghetti   scripts is welcome to help  pitch in great ideas  etc.    The archive step consists of mapping build outputs to some save location and also uploading symbols... do   we need to split that up? </pre>
