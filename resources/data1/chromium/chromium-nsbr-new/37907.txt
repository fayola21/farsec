<title>Issue 37907 -   chromium -    image redirects from https to http should trigger a security warning - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)           Safari 4: FAIL  Firefox 3.0.x: FAIL  Firefox 3.5.x: OK        1.  Host a web page served up via https with an &lt;img src=&quot;/redirect&quot;&gt;  2.  Have https version of /redirect send a 302 redirect to an image served  up via http        Should get some sort of security warning.      Considers the page still secure even though some content was fetched in the  clear.      Would probably be a good idea to test this against CSS and JS resources as  well. </pre>
