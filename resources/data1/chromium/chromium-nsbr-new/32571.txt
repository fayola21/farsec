<title>Issue 32571 -   chromium -    chrome.tabs.move / chrome.windows.create behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> chrome.tabs.move(integer tabId  object moveProperties  function   callback) is described as &quot;Moves a tab to a new position within its   window  or to a new window.&quot;  Is that possible after the creation of a new Window (which opens a   default/custom url within a tab) or is there a tricky way to implicitly   create a new Window on tabs.move?     chrome.windows.create(object createData  function callback) is   described as &quot;Creates (opens) a new browser with any optional sizing    position or default url provided.&quot;   Is there any way to create a new window with no opened   default tab (and assign an existing Tab  instead)?  </pre>
