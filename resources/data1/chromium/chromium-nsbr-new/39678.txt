<title>Issue 39678 -   chromium -    floating drop-shadow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Official Build 42309) dev    I have a drop-shadow floating at some location seemingly fixed to the right-  side edge of the window. The exact placement depends on the window-state; in   normal state  it seems to be fixed at 105px from the right edge (including   the window-border)  but in maximized state it seems to be around 115px. It   also sometimes (I have two windows open currently  it happens in one of them    but not in the other) appears in full-screen mode (F11)  but it seems like it   isn't repainted after I move my mouse over the thing like the &quot;Other   bookmarks&quot;-button (see screenshot #4). </pre>
