<title>Issue 26013 -   chromium -    Send the TLS certificate status request extension (OCSP stapling) on Windows Vista or later - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Schannel supports the TLS certificate status request extension  (commonly known as OCSP stapling) on Windows Vista or later.  However  Chrome is not sending this extension.    I studied the schannel.h header file carefully but didn't find  anything related to &quot;certificate status request&quot; or &quot;status_request&quot;.  I then experimented with the following SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_xxx  flags:    #define SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_END_CERT           0x00000100  #define SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_CHAIN              0x00000200  #define SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_CHAIN_EXCLUDE_ROOT 0x00000400    #define SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_CACHE_ONLY         0x00004000    See the CertGetCertificateChain MSDN page for their meanings:  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376078(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376078(VS.85).aspx</a>    I found that if I specify any of the first three flags  then  the Chrome sends the certificate status request extension.  Among the three  SCH_CRED_REVOCATION_CHECK_CHAIN_EXCLUDE_ROOT  seems to be the most appropriate as we pass  CERT_CHAIN_REVOCATION_CHECK_CHAIN_EXCLUDE_ROOT to our  CertGetCertificateChain calls. </pre>
