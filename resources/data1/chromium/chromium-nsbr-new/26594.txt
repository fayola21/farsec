<title>Issue 26594 -   chromium -    Document extension security issues - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Tue  Nov 3  2009 at 9:07 AM  Erik Kay &lt;erikkay@xxxx&gt; wrote:  &gt; Adam   &gt;  &gt; The other good point that came out of this thread is that we should  &gt; have a security section in the extension docs which could talk about  &gt; the dangers of XSS  etc. I don't think it needs to be incredibly  &gt; comprehensive - to be honest  I'd rather it linked to other more  &gt; detailed docs on XSS  etc.  but it would be good to have something  &gt; that covered the basics of the specific impact of XSS on extensions  &gt; and the mitigations we have in the design.  &gt;  &gt; Could I convince you to take a swing at an initial draft of something?  &gt;  We can have Kathy polish is up for word-smithing  diagrams  etc.  The  &gt; docs are checked in at chrome/common/extensions/docs.  Just create a  &gt; file in the &quot;static&quot; directory.  &gt;  &gt; Erik   </pre>
