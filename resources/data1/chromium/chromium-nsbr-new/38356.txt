<title>Issue 38356 -   chromium -    Add F5 as shortcut for reload - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  if you hit F5 or Ctrl-R on Windows  it refreshes the page. This is consistent w/ IE and FF.   However  on the Mac  only Cmd-R will trigger a refresh. This is consistent with Safari  but not FF   (which also allows F5).    I request that we enable F5 to trigger a refresh on the Mac  to better accommodate people   attempting to switch from either Mac FF or one of the Windows browsers. </pre>
