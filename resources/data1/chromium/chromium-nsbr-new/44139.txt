<title>Issue 44139 -   chromium -    Change google TLD localization from HEAD request to searchdomaincheck - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  Google Chrome does a HEAD request to google.com to fetch the right target google   search domain to load to the user. This is an unsupported way of getting the right google TLD. We'd   like Chrome to adopt the open searchdomaincheck service instead.    There are two ways to do this:  1) To replicate the existing HEAD request behavior  you can send a request to <a href="https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck?format=domain">https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck?format=domain</a>.     2) To request a OpenSearch Descriptor document (if supported)  you can send a request to  <a href="https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck?format=opensearch&amp;client=chrome">https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck?format=opensearch&amp;client=chrome</a>.  </pre>
