<title>Issue 35933 -   chromium -    History search results contain duplicates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.7 beta (MAC OS X)      1. Visit a couple websites  2. Open the history tab  3. Do a search in history that yields very few results      Show the websites in history that reflect that search (only once per visit)      The history loops and displays each entry three times. It is expected that   the further down (back) in history you go  the further back the date/time   that page was accessed. Having entries repeat becomes very confusing.   This may also be the case with history searches that yield more results.    Screenshot attached.   </pre>
