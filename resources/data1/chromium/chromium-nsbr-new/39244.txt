<title>Issue 39244 -   chromium -    Change version_build_patch to allow PATCH &gt; 255 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> version_build_patch in chrome.gyp is built as BUILD.PATCH and then used to set  DYLIB_CURRENT_VERSION and DYLIB_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION on Mac OS X.     These VERSION strings have the format X.Y.Z  where X cannot exceed 65535 and Y  and Z cannot exceed 255 (see the ld man page).    In order to allow PATCH to exceed 255  version_build_patch should be changed to   BUILD.PATCH/256.PATCH%256.   </pre>
