<title>Issue 36155 -   chromium -    Less confirmation prompts on executable download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome always asks the user if it really wants to download executables.   This is a sane decision related to the user security.    But  at least on the Windows platform  there is already a way to notify the   user of the dangers of downloaded files. Microsoft calls it Mark of the Web   (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537628(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537628(VS.85).aspx</a> ) and it   is already implemented in Chrome. The problem is that this makes the user   confirm twice that it really wants the download in cause: once in Chrome   and once when opening the file in Windows.    The is a suboptimal experience for the user that I'm sure can be improved.   Note that already the handling of security prompts for downloads is   platform-dependent.    Personally  I'd prefer a prompt asking whether to save the file or open it   dirrectly  but I doubt that will ever be implemented in Chrome. </pre>
