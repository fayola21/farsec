<title>Issue 44585 -   chromium -    Flaky connection mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38    GMail has a brilliant feature: Flaky connection mode. It adopts well to very   bad / unstable / intermittent connection  and loads new content whenever a   connection becomes available.    On poor connections  Chrome desperately needs a similar feature: don't give   up loading any piece of web page (including images  objects and   stylesheets); automatically reload objects partially loaded due to temporary   connection loss etc etc. And still show at any moment every complete object   (and even incomplete if possible) that it has loaded so far. </pre>
