<title>Issue 35743 -   chromium -    Gallery support for platform-specific installers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've noticed a lot of people on Mac have been to installing Windows-only   extensions like IETab  Cooliris  and leaving upset comments when it doesn't   work.    It would be nice to disable the gallery's &quot;Install&quot; button if the developer   indicates that a particular OS is not supported. It could be an advanced option   for extensions that contain a plugin. </pre>
