<title>Issue 41767 -   chromium -    Mac polish: &quot;Browse...&quot; button in prefs -&gt; Under the Hood -&gt; Downloads doesn't make any sense - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I mean  browse for what?    It *might* make sense if you could at all select the location directly on that dialog  but you can't. It   should be &quot;Choose Location...&quot; or something like that. </pre>
