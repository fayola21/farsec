<title>Issue 39235 -   chromium -    experimental.popup.show(...) extension API displaying at wrong offset when borderStyle=rectangle - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.  Load the sample chrome-extension attached to this bug report.  2.  Typing in the entry field will launch a pop-up with the borderStyle set   to rectangle.        The pop-up should be anchored above the 'anchor popup here' div.  Instead it   is floating far off to the right.       </pre>
