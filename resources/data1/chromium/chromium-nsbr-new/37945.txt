<title>Issue 37945 -   chromium -    facebook: browsing photos became much slower - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Enter any facebook album with many pictures  open Task Manager to see   the CPU rate as well  2. Try to push &quot;next&quot;  &quot;next&quot;  &quot;next&quot;... etc  3. After ~10 pics each next pic is received at a slower rate  the fan   starts to work harder  the CPU usage climbs up.      Just like before the xxxx25 version - all was smooth.      The pics browsing becomes slower  just as explained above. In addition    sometimes when I choose to tag someone  the cursor changes its shape just   as before  but when I click on someone's face it jumps to the next picture   instead of simply giving me the list of candidates. It was in xxx25   version  not sure about xxxx30 (the latest so far).    <b>Please provide
