<title>Issue 36613 -   chromium -    Chrome does not display text in non-standard fonts with text-shadow effect on it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;from About Google Chrome/Chromium or  'about:version'&gt;    Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : Everything is fine.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x: Everything is fine.  IE7 does not display the text-shadow (it does not support it)  but it   fortunately does display the text itself.      1. Use non-standard font (like Papyrus) with bright color over a dark   background.  2. Apply text-shadow on it.  3. Et voila  the text you could see (step 1) has disappeared (step 2)!    I've got the latest (4.0.249.89 (38071)) Chrome.    I've seen 2 other tickets on chromium mentioning this bug with Arabic and   Thai font  but they've been closed claiming the bug does not appear in the   newest Chrome. Well now you know thats wrong.   </pre>
