<title>Issue 31636 -   chromium -    Support RealPlayer plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the RealPlayer plugin will draw the initial player view  but doesn't seem to update or   respond to clips (except the full-screen button  which doesn't actually work correctly). It's not clear   how much at this point is a drawing problem  and how much is something else. </pre>
