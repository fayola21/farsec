<title>Issue 45290 -   chromium -    Tab restore is unpredictable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. open a new chrome session  2. note that tab restore is disabled  3. open a new tab  4. note that tab restore is enabled      I expect that tab restore should be enabled when I start up chrome (it   should restore whatever tab was open last in the last browser session). Also   I expect that _adding_ a tab should not enable tab restore when it had been   disabled. </pre>
