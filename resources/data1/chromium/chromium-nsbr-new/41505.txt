<title>Issue 41505 -   chromium -    Add two pixels of default vertical padding to HTML buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open attached testcase  2. Observe how the first button looks much better      than the second  default button.    I discussed this with Ojan and it seems like we decreased the horizontal   padding for compatibility  but our change of the vertical padding didn't have   a compatibility impact - HTML buttons would look much nicer if they had these   two pixels added. </pre>
