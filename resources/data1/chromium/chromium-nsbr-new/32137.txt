<title>Issue 32137 -   chromium -    Drag-dropping any file from local disk to Bookmark Bar  doesn't creates bookmark. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.295.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35884">r35884</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34      1. Drag different kind of stuff from local HD (eg:files(images docs) folders...) and drop it on Bookmark bar    Actual: On hovering these dragged files or folders on BMB it shows [ (+)i.e which denotes ready to add] but when dropped   it doesn't creates.    Expected: Bookmark should be created on the BMB.    Other platforms behavior:  Windows: Creates the bookmark on BMB with bookmark title as its local path   ( example: file:///C://DocumentsandSettings//Desktop/sample.jpg )  Linux: Creates the bookmark on BMB with bookmark title as its respective dragged file/folder name   </pre>
