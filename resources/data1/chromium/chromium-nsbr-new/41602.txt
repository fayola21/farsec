<title>Issue 41602 -   chromium -    Download fileswith the same name - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Download the same file  and it will be places on the download directory   posfixed with (n) if file with the same name already exists.  For example:    download 1st time my.pdf will be placed in my downloads directory with the   same name automaticly.  download it 2nd time file will be placed as &quot;my (1).pdf&quot; automaticly.  download it 3rd time it will be stored as &quot;my (2).pdf&quot; automaticly.  and so on.    after i reached &quot;my (100).pdf&quot; the number used in postfix will not added    and the browser tries to store it as &quot;my.pdf&quot; and pops up a message which   says it already exists  should i overwrite it?... or something similar all   the time.  When tries to download i will be asked again.        continue to increment the number in the postfix...        it's not :)      <b>Please provide
