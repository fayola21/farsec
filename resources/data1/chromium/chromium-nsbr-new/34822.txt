<title>Issue 34822 -   chromium -    [CF] *apache.org* doesn't work for Chrome Frame registry approach - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have CF 5.0.317.0 (Official Build 38070) installed  2. Add *apache.org* to CF registry  3. Launch IE and access apache.org      Ideally web site apache.org should be rendered by CF  but now it is still  rendered by IE       </pre>
