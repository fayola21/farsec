<title>Issue 44450 -   chromium -    Full page zoom hinders usability and accessibility on small screens (e.g. netbooks) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.38  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a>   <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">https://www.google.com/reader</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. Open Google Reader on a small display (1024x600 on a 9 inch screen)  2. Zoom in one step (Ctrl+)        Text size should increase and lines should wrap as needed to remain visible   (preferably without a horizontal scroll)      Right hand column flows off of screen and there is not even a horizontal   scroll available to retrieve it.      Additionally  when feeds have embedded images  making the font readable   often introduces large amounts of horizontal scrolling. </pre>
