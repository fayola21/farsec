<title>Issue 23823 -   chromium -    Report a bug or broken website in the Help menu of the Menubar doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &quot;Report a bug or broken website&quot; is in the page menu  but should also be in   the menubar some place.    I believe it gets context from the active view  so I'm not sure if it make sense   to go directly in the help menu or not.    Cole/Ben - Where should this go in the Menubar? </pre>
