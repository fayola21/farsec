<title>Issue 37565 -   chromium -    Need UMA stats on default search engine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We're going to be doing some experiments on the search engine selection   screen (<a href="http://crbug.com/37564">http://crbug.com/37564</a>) so we need to measure which search engine has   been chosen by the user. We'll need to correlate this with an experimental   group in the case that the user is getting a different search engine   selection UI. </pre>
