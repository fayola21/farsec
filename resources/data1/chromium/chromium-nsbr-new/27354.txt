<title>Issue 27354 -   chromium -    Feature Ideas for it. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. System Requirements offend the Mac community!     No need for 10.5 when 10.4.11 is working just fine. We rightly hate Windoz  junk and the need for Intel as well  so stop with this web application  requires certain features of your web browser. Show the world you can do it  with this Browser and Version of Chrome by making it work in 10.4.    2. Put a ruler on the right tab line and in the tab:    Neill wants you to put a ruler on the right tab line so the tab position of  the window will show in very long windows. As I read a long page  I can  note that this issue is at 25 and another issue is at 93 or 192 and so on.  This will help a lot and is very easy to do. You may even want to make the  actual line number appear in and be a part of the tab.    3. Bookmarks need better support:    Bookmarks need much better support to alphabetize them and to group them.  Also to remove the duplicates one sometimes finds. And  finally  when we  need to reinstall or fix the OS  the lack of a protection form for the  bookmarks causes major concern. Find a way to protect the bookmarks.
