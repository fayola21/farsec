<title>Issue 31114 -   chromium -    Windows Size exceed WM size and is not shrinkable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.280.0 (Build 35217) Ubuntu  URLs (if applicable) : many URLs                  1. open your browser :-)  2. many pages will enlarge the size of your windows out of the borders of your WM.       never go over WM limits  or at least  allow to shrink.      windows is big  and cannot be shrink.      ---&gt;&gt;&gt; The same identical situation happens with &quot;options&quot; windows: you can   enlarge it  but you cannot shrink.      This happened one about week ago  and I didn't file any bug because I was   expecting you to fix such problem.  I kindly ask you to fix this one  because the browser is unasable... and  please    check these kind of bugs before releasing any new versione. Even if it's a beta   versione I rely on Chromium     </pre>
