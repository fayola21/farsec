<title>Issue 25612 -   chromium -    WebKit render bug: Absolutely positioned inline elements within a container that horizontally centers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.9         Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Go to <a href="http://htmledit.squarefree.com">http://htmledit.squarefree.com</a>  2. Paste the following html in the textarea:  &lt;center style=&quot;background: lightblue; width: 200px; height: 20px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;position:absolute;&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;      The span element should be centered regardless of the position:absolute;   rule  because there are no left or top rules.      The element does not get centered but rather stays to the left.      I'm not certain if this is the standard behavior defined by any standards   body (W3C)  but in every other browser I test this on behaves the way I   described in the &quot;What is the expected result?&quot; part of this issue. This is   an issue with WebKit. Hopefully this can be resolved soon  and both Chrome   and Safari get an updated version of WebKit. </pre>
