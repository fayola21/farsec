<title>Issue 43817 -   chromium -    Flash process startup time is too slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On my fast machine  flash process creation takes 700-850ms  just to start the   process.  I tested with the new gcswf32.dll  and that is not any faster.    This turns out to be quite measurable in my performance benchmarking for   youtube and other pages that use flash. </pre>
