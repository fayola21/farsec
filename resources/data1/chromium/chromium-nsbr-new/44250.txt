<title>Issue 44250 -   chromium -    Extension icons greyed out and unresponsive - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;5.0.375.38&gt;  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : &lt;10.6.3&gt;  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (n/a):  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (n/a):  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: ?      1. Install an Extension  2. Use Chrome  3. Sometimes after Quitting and reloading         Extensions such as those from del.icio.us and GMail from Google should change their icon   according to weather a new email has been received or if the page one is on is already tagged by   the del.icio.us service.        Sometimes the icon are grey; in GMail's icon case the number of emails is not shown and so has   to be clicked to 'wake it up'  this happens less frequently  but still often  it just seems to go   dormant. In the case of del.icio.us it is supposed to turn blue if visiting a page which is already   added to the service (on your own account)  but remains greyed out almost all the time.     This is strange because I can click the grey del.icio.us icon and the extension works as it should   to tag pages and pre-tagged pages show with a yellow Bookmark star (the del.icio.us extension   requires the default Bookmark service) but not the icon itself.    The GMail issue is pretty random  but not uncommon and the del.icio.us extension seems to be   greyed out all the time  but not when I first started using it as I recall (a couple of versions before   the present beta of Chrome). </pre>
