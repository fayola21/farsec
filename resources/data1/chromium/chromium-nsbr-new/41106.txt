<title>Issue 41106 -   chromium -    Implement something like Firefox's about:crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  bug reports about crashes from end users are often hard to do anything with because it's   really difficult to get details about the crash. It would be helpful to be able to point them to a list of   their recent crash IDs  like Firefox's about:crashes  so we could correlate user descriptions of   crashes with the crash server.    That way crash bugs could be routed to the right component  and we'd have a much better chance   of getting live repro cases of crashes we currently only have automated crash data for. </pre>
