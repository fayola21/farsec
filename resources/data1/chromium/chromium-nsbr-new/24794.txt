<title>Issue 24794 -   chromium -    Xmlhttprequest works fine  except when using integrated security - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;            Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: FAIL        1. setup Secured webservice (integrated security) and page with   xmlHttpRequest to that webservice.  2. !Important. Place both on a server within your network  not on   localhost.  3. Try calling the webservice (POST  with arguments)      Authentication by server  normal response      401.1 authentication failed    Full info:  All my tests (using ExtJS mostly) ran excellent with no problem at   all. Until I moved from testing on localhost to testing on a server   within the network.   I came to a rather strange behavior. All my XmlHttpRequests using   method &quot;GET&quot; ran fine  but all &quot;POST&quot; methods failed. Returning a   401.1 authentication failed. As backend I'm using a .net 2.0 (i know    a bit behind here) webservice within a virtual directory secured by   Integrated Windows Authentication. I turned on anonymous   authentication and all worked just fine.   So in short  there might be an issue with method &quot;POST&quot; and sending   Kerberos authentication info. Though no problem using method &quot;GET&quot;.   Fiddler does react with following message:   -------------------------------------------------------------   Fiddler has detected a protocol violation in session #307.
