Even if I was using another window with any flash app  I   can't see it because of this problem. Also when I start Chrome it freeze   down my notebook for some seconds making my work wait for it. Also I'm an   active user of DevianArt but Chrome don't let me loggin to this site    that's so unconfortable  so please check that bug. I send to you my   experience. I love using Chrome but if this continue I should move on to   another browser  like firefox  even if this is heavier than Chrome. Please   answer me as soon as possible.     Thank You =).    my e-mail:  roxana.acosta@live.com.mx   </pre>
