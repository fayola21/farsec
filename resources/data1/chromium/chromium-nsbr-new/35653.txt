<title>Issue 35653 -   chromium -    Translation Bar Problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I feel annoyed when Chrome has updated to 5.0.317.2 and the translation  alert bar always appears. Though it may be convenient for some sites  it  makes me feel inconvenient and not user-friendly when i always need to  close the bar. Can this function be turned off or just be active for sites  in white list? </pre>
