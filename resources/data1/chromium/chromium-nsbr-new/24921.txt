<title>Issue 24921 -   chromium -    ctrl-tab in a page enables strange search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.5  OS version               : 10.6.1      1.open new tab  2.go to a page (google)  3.click in the white area of the page  4.press ctrl-tab. Notice that the controls on the page loose focus  5.type something that's in the page (space is a good example)      Nothing      It seems that after pressing ctrl-tab  the find box is opened up or enabled.  If you press space and some letters  the page highlights the text.    Come on guys.. 4.0.222.5 is the worst release ever.  I found 5 bugs or something in the first 15 minutes using it. </pre>
