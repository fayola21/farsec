<title>Issue 44523 -   chromium -    Create an AJAX console view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Basically  a set of static html/js/css files will drives JSON requests to   aebuild to retrieve data on the fly to recreate the &quot;console view&quot;   experience.    Mohamed has been mostly working on this.    We need to finish the template based console view on aebuild first to make   sure all the infrastructure is there to make this work. </pre>
