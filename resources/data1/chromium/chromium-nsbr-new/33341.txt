<title>Issue 33341 -   chromium -    SPDY server push needs to work when there are multiple FlipSession's for the same domain - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is the possibility that there will be multiple FlipSession's (and TCP   connections) for the same domain.    Some cases include    o A GOAWAY has been issued but the older session still has outstanding   requests.    o Potentially used to deal with small initial CWND (i.e. open 6 TCP   connections to same domain)    o Depending on what packet loss characteristics are  it might make sense   to have multiple TCP connections to minimize bandwidth backoff if packet   loss is isolated to only one connection.    Currently  there is no way to have the client match up a server push   request to the correct FlipSession. One possible solution is to iterate   over all of the FlipSession's for a particular domain and look at the   pending stream id's. Another option is to remove the pending stream id's   from the FlipSession and key them based on domain (with a reference to the   FlipSession that they will be on). </pre>
