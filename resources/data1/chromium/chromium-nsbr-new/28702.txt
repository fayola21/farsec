<title>Issue 28702 -   chromium -    Incognito download history not shown in Incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go into Incognito mode.  2. Start downloading one file and pause it right away.  3. Download several more files until the first file is not on the download   bar any more.  4. Try to resume that paused download.      Should be able to find that paused download to resume it.      It is not on the downloads bar  nor in the downloads window  so I can't   finish that download. The other downloads do not disappear from the   download bar when opened  either.    If I try and close the incognito window  I get a message that downloads are   in progress  and options to wait or cancel downloads  but nothing to resume   the downloads.    <b>Please provide
