<title>Issue 31417 -   chromium -    Opening many tabs results in &quot;Aw  snap&quot; on all of them  even successfully loaded tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Go to Amazon.com  2. Search for 'test' (or anything else)  3. Open ~15 tabs from the search results in quick succession      Tabs should each open and load the page.      Tabs begin loading  and after about 20s  some are still loading  and all of   a sudden all the newly opened tabs go to the &quot;Aw  snap&quot; page--even pages   which have successfully loaded.  On the command line  I get (also attached   as crash.txt):  &quot;&quot;&quot;  V8 error: Allocation failed - process out of memory (CALL_AND_RETRY_2)  --2010-01-01 12:26:58--  <a href="https://clients2.google.com/cr/report">https://clients2.google.com/cr/report</a>  Resolving clients2.google.com... 74.125.91.101  74.125.91.102    74.125.91.100  ...
