<title>Issue 30024 -   chromium -    Absolutely-positioned div doesn't follow its parent - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.21  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/m?q=obama&amp;user-">http://www.google.com/m?q=obama&amp;user-</a>  agent=AndroidAppleWebKit&amp;tbs=mbl:1           Safari 4: FAIL    Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Visit the url <a href="http://www.google.com/m?q=obama&amp;user-">http://www.google.com/m?q=obama&amp;user-</a>  agent=AndroidAppleWebKit&amp;tbs=mbl:1 .  2. Click the &quot;more&quot; link near the bottom of the page to make an absolutely-  positioned div pop up.  3. Wait until a new result scrolls in at the top.      The popped-up absolutely-positioned div scrolls down  along with the rest   of the page.      The div stays where it is  until it is convinced to reflow somehow (e.g. by   messing with its style at all in the &quot;Developer Tools&quot;).      See attached screenshot.  I suspect this is a bug in WebKit itself (but I'm not sure).   </pre>
