<title>Issue 37671 -   chromium -    Extensions feature request: allow extensions to keep per-tab state - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Filing a feature request at erikkay's request. This was originally discussed at   <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/4ebf094d74621d77/dd08a5d11bf95e2c    Browser action buttons can be modified by tab  which is great; you can change the icon    badge  and tooltip on a tab-by-tab basis.  The problem comes when browser action clicks need different actions by tab  too. I think   this is a likely use case  given that you can already set per-tab state. For example    you may grey-out the button for some tabs; in those tabs  clicking it may need to do   something different than when the button is not greyed out.     Since Chrome is already keeping per-tab state for the browser action  I'd like to add an   API method to chrome.tabs for setting arbitrary tab data that lives only until a tab   changes URL or is removed. This data would then be avilable in the Tab object.    Why not just do this yourself in the background page? It's bug-prone (you have to keep   track of tabRemoved events; tabUpdated gets called twice (loading and complete)  for   example)  and seems general enough to be added to the API.    Thanks   matias </pre>
