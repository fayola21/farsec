<title>Issue 43055 -   chromium -    If many bookmarks under &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; difficult to reach ones at the bottom - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9 beta (Mac)  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1.  On Mac OS X 10.6  expand the main Chrome window so that it takes up the entire desktop   (not full screen  though).  2.  Bookmark enough pages under &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; so that  when selected from the   Bookmarks Bar  you cannot see the last few bookmarks in the list  since they go off screen (&gt; 50    for example)  3.  Select &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; from the Bookmarks Bar and attempt to select the last one in the   list.        Bookmarks menu should truncate the list but allow you get to all of the bookmarks by menu-  scrolling.        The last few bookmarks go under the dock and off the bottom of the screen.  You cannot get to   the bookmarks that are off of the screen.  If the bookmarks menu happens to be positioned to   the right of the dock  then you *can* scroll down  but it's not obvious nor is it very easy to do.   </pre>
