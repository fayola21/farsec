<title>Issue 25352 -   chromium -    Chromium Chrome breaks in maximized mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.5 (Developer Build 29395)      1. Maximize window        Everything stays how its supposed to (With all margins intact)        Browser window elements (buttons on the right hand side) bleed out  and are lacking their internal   12px (usually about 12px) right hand margin  and any graphical elements of the page that would   normally take up the right hand 12px are broken. Since I'm running custom themes on XP  this may be   something to look at.     </pre>
