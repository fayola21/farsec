<title>Issue 29118 -   chromium -    Chrome plugins show up as /proc/self/exe in top - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I always get confused about when we can just mutate argv[0] and when we need   to use setproctitle().  If anyone can instruct me on what to do here I will   fix it. </pre>
