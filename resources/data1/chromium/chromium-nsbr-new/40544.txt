<title>Issue 40544 -   chromium -    Pasting Bookmark Misplaces Pasted Bookmark - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Copy a non-folder bookmark using the context menu. I chose 'Tiny' from my bookmark bar.  2. Click on a folder in the bookmark bar so that the folder menu appears. I chose 'Coding'.  3. Move the mouse so that it is hovering over a folder in the folder menu.  I chose 'CVS'.  4. Bring up the context menu and choose 'Paste'. (See &quot;PastingTiny&quot; screen capture.)  5. Make the folder menu show again and look for 'Tiny'. (See &quot;TinyInWrongPlace&quot; screen capture.)  6. Observe that it is NOT after 'CVS'  but elsewhere in the folder structure.     </pre>
