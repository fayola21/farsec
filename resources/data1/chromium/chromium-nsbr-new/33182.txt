<title>Issue 33182 -   chromium -    Window too tall at kayak.com on linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is with 4.0.320.0 dev.      1. go to <a href="http://kayak.com">http://kayak.com</a>  2. search for a flight  leave &quot;Priceline comparison shopping&quot; selected      The Priceline popup window's 'X' go-away button in the upper right  should be visible  but it's hidden behind the Ubuntu menu.  This makes the window semi-immortal :-)    Moving the Ubuntu menu to the right or left side of the screen  exposes the 'X' button.  You can also kill the window by right-clicking  on the taskbar and picking 'Close'.      This works properly in Chrome 4 stable on Windows.  It also works  properly with Linux Firefox.    The bottom of the window is similarly too low.  Looks like we're  not taking the menu or task bar heights into account when sizing that  popup. </pre>
