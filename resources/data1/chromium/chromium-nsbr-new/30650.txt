<title>Issue 30650 -   chromium -    Extra blank window appears intermittently in Expose (ScreenShot inc.) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2377380/Screen%20shot%202009-12-">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2377380/Screen%20shot%202009-12-</a>  16%20at%208.05.17%20PM.png  OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Just creating a new window  and using Expose- 4 swipe up then do four   swipe down 2x  2. This will create an extra &quot;blank&quot; window  useless.      1. Regular windows (there should only be one big window there)      2. There are two windows open for Chrome  1 is the actual window  and   the other appears to be a blank window...    It is interesting to note that I did not see this problem happen during the   ALPHA version of Google Chrome... This occurs in the new 'beta'     </pre>
