<title>Issue 40292 -   chromium -    Mixed content warning dialog is clipped on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a site with a mixed content warning (e.g.  Gmail after viewing images in a message)  2. Click the SSL/triangle icon in the omnibox  3. The message in the &quot;Connection&quot; box is clipped because the box is too small and cannot be   resized.        The dialog box should be large enough to read the whole message.  Worst case  it should be   resizable.    Observed in Mac version 5.0.366.0 dev.  Works ok on Windows and Linux. </pre>
