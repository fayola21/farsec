<title>Issue 35350 -   chromium -    Save image as a background [ubuntu-linux] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It wouldn't be bloat because the option only appears when you right-click on   an image  which a notable percentage should have done so to save as   background. It's also important to consider 376 people starred a similar   feature request.    Please don't toss this aside as Won'tFix. </pre>
