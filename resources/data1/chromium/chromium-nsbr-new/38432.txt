<title>Issue 38432 -   chromium -    Remove duplication across Mac content settings bubble controller and model - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/668075">http://codereview.chromium.org/668075</a> added a cross-platform content   settings bubble model used on windows and GTK.  <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1018003">http://codereview.chromium.org/1018003</a> went part of the way to porting   Mac to use it too  however we still have xib resource per bubble type (cookies    images etc)  localizable strings are still defined within the xib  and   programaticly adding multiple radio items and radio groups is not supported   (this was going to be needed for geolocation but now is not)       </pre>
