<title>Issue 23536 -   chromium -    &quot;No bookmarks&quot; text in bookmark bar does not use correct color from theme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. launch with a new profile dir  2. load   '<a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_floralblue.html'">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_floralblue.html'</a>  3. click &quot;apply theme&quot;  4. show the bookmark bar    Note the no bookmark text is unreadable (black on dark blue).  Revert the   theme and the text will be readable.  The text should be drawing in the   theme color.    NOTE: filed as OS-All because I checked Mac and Win and both have this bug    once someone checks Linux  it can get shifted to just those two OSes if Linux   don't have it. </pre>
