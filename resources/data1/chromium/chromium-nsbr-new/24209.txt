I've found a bug in v8's inline cache for &quot;store to field:&quot; A setter that  is added to a prototype after the inline cache is recorded will not be  called. Here's a testcase demonstrating the bug. It passes in Firefox 3 and  Safari 3.1  but fails in v8.          The basic problem is that the StoreField stub only verifies the target  object's map  and not the maps in the target object's prototype chain.    Should the StoreField stub consult the full prototype chain?
