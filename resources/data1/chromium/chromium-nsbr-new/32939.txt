<title>Issue 32939 -   chromium -    Truncated download warning (some locales) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have searched for this bug and it was known and fixed on Windows and   Linux  but still exists in the current Mac dev-build:    Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.2 dev  OS version               :  10.6.2      1. Set locale / system language to German  2. Download a .dmg      The download warning for potentially hazardous filetypes displays   correctly.      The download warning for potentially hazardous filetypes gets slightly   truncated.    It seems to me like the width of the view that contains the warning is fixed    ignoring that the size of the text may differ due to i18n.  </pre>
