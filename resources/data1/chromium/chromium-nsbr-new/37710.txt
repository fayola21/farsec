<title>Issue 37710 -   chromium -    media/video-src-change.html causing timeout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Throughout the day today  it looks like whenever this test is run from   &quot;Thread-2&quot; on the mac dbg builder  the thread gets wedged and stops   producing any output.  If it is run on Thread-1  however  it seems like   it's fine... strangeness.    e.g. running on Thread-2 (search for media/video-source.html)  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Webkit%20Mac10.5%20(d">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Webkit%20Mac10.5%20(d</a>  bg)(3)/builds/11170/steps/webkit_tests/logs/stdio    and from Thread-1:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Webkit%20Mac10.5%20(d">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Webkit%20Mac10.5%20(d</a>  bg)(3)/builds/11173/steps/webkit_tests/logs/stdio    There's a chance this isn't the root cause of the hang but I talked to   hclam and we decided to mark it as skip for now and see what happens.    May be related to <a title="Lots of media crashes  especially on Mac" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35858"> bug 35858 </a>.     </pre>
