<title>Issue 44520 -   chromium -    Fix aebuild template console view - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The django template console view is a reimplementation of the buildbot   console view. Right now it's not fully working  this task is to make it on   par with the current buildbot implementation but no new feature  i.e. still   doesn't support git or anything fancy.    I would assign this task to Gab. I can't set him in the issue tracker though. </pre>
