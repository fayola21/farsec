<title>Issue 39825 -   chromium -    alsa channel always open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.365.0 (Developer Build   42923) Ubuntu  Is this the most recent version: yes  from the PPA  OS + version: Ubuntu 10.04 beta  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: compiz            1. Open empty Chromium (no pages loaded)  2. Open System &gt; Preferences &gt; Sound go to tab Applications  3. See the ALSA plug-in [chromium-browser]      I expect not to see Chromium listed all the time in the applications that   use the sound device. It should open the sound device only when there is   something to play.      Chromium is always listed as application in the audio stream.    The problem that arises from the always opened alsa channel is that my Bluetooth headset doesn't go to suspend mode and doesn't save energy -   battery needs to be recharged more often and that's not good.   </pre>
