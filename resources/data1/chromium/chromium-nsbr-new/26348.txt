<title>Issue 26348 -   chromium -    MIME type is overriding filename extension - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. File on server has extension of .xml  however server incorrect serves   the file as &quot;text/plain&quot;.  2. Download file. In the Save As dialog  extension appears as .txt instead   of .xml; change the extension to .xml      Since the user overrode the filename  my file should save with an extension   of .xml (for instance  abc.xml). In the current public stable build (not   sure of the build # offhand) this works as expected. Infact  it even   defaults to '.xml' even though the mime type is text/plain.      File will save as ABC.xml.txt (.txt is automatically appended no matter   what  since the mime type is text/plain).    <b>Please provide
