<title>Issue 28522 -   chromium -    Chromium crashes at www.ebay.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.191.0 (0)  URLs (if applicable) : www.ebay.com                  1. Goto ebay.com    This is pathetic. I have no other steps and no logs to describe the issue.   What an awful browser. I just want Chrome with Roboform  which is why I'm   using Chromium. These types of bugs are unacceptable. </pre>
