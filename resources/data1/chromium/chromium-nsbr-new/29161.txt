<title>Issue 29161 -   chromium -    Mac: while dragging tabs  other tabs shouldn't display the hover animation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make a bunch of tabs.  2. Grab a tab  tear it off (so the tab and its contents live in a separate   window)  drag it over the other tabs (especially the unselected ones).      The other tabs shouldn't show the hover (glow) animation  but they do.    Note: It's a lot easier to see the glow in certain themes than in others (in   particular  than in the default).    I don't think they show the animation before the tab is torn off (this is   correct behaviour).    I could have sworn I saw a flash of a tooltip while dragging tabs  which is   also wrong  but I can't reproduce it right now. This also bears   investigating.    I guess I'm working on this already.... </pre>
