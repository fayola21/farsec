<title>Issue 36316 -   chromium -    [Mac] Allow Netscape-style client certs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome's identity picker panel only shows user certs that support SSL client   identification. I did the filtering by looking for the ClientAuth token in the   ExtendedKeyUsage extension. However  there's also a NetscapeCertType   extension that has a SSL_Client flag ��_��_��_ openssl seems to add this instead   when it creates certs. Since my code doesn't look for that  it doesn't think the   cert is acceptable so you can't select it. </pre>
