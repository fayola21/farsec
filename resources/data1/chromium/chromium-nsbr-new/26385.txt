<title>Issue 26385 -   chromium -    Links on sync setup dialog don't direct to the page in the right language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start Chrome in a language other than English (e.g. &quot;chrome.exe --  lang=ar&quot;).  2. Open the sync dialog by opening the Wrench menu and clicking on &quot;Sync my   bookmarks...&quot;.  3. Click on one of the links at the bottom (either &quot;I cannot access my   account&quot; or &quot;Create a Google account&quot;).    What is the expected output?     The page which opens need to be in the same language as the browser   language.    What do you see instead?    The page is always in English.    To fix this  we should add &quot;&amp;hl=[TWO_LETTER_LANGUAGE_CODE]&quot; to the URL. </pre>
