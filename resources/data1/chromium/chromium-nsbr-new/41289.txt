<title>Issue 41289 -   chromium -    Experiment with different socket limits and eviction policies - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the socket limit is set to 100.  Now that we've started including   idle sockets in the socket limit  we're hitting this limit a lot.  This   might be hurting our performance by reducing our ability to reuse idle   sockets.  We should run A/B experiments with different socket limits and   also play around with different eviction policies.    For now  we should up the socket limit to say  256 or so  so we don't hit   the socket limit quite as often. </pre>
