<title>Issue 34051 -   chromium -    GMail with Chat results in horizontal scrollbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: &lt;from cf:about:version&gt;        I found the problem in the Labs in the chat on the right side  it creates a  scroll bar at horizontal  it happens with the chrome and internet explorer  I use here in firefox does not.      1. click on labs  2. enable the service to chat on the right  3. depois que o gmail volta  ele cria uma barra de rolagem na horizontal  isso vale apenas para o chrome e internet explorer no firefox n��_��_o acontece        I hope that does not create the scroll bar will be hampered at times.        I think it's just some setting I do not know if there is frame in gmail  could be that size is related to something.      I've attached a picture so you can see the scroll bar at horizontal chrome   it can tackle better. thanks.   </pre>
