<title>Issue 28575 -   chromium -    Combo-Boxes and scroll panes do not function as expected. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33             Safari 4: Not tested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    We have an app written with GWT and are noticing strange problems that   occur only in Chrome.  After searching the internet for other sites with   similar controls we have ruled out our application and suspect the issue is   with Chrome.    Here are the issues:  Combo-boxes do not retain set values when you click out of them.    To reproduce:   1. Click on a combo box to expand it and display the values in the list.     2. TYPE the letter or number of a value in the list that is not the current   value.  This should set the typed value to the first position in the combo   box.    3. Click once on the set value now to close the expanded combo box.    4. Now click somewhere else on the screen.    Expected Result: The combo box should have the typed set value in it.    Actual Result:  If you follow the steps above exactly  the value will be reset to the old   value of the combo box.  This used to work (most of the time in Chrome   release 1.x)  After upgrading to 3.x it is much worse and happens every   time  or most every time.    <a title="Testing if chromium id works" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2"> Issue 2 </a>:    Our GWT application has a tab panel with scroll panes.  If you scroll to a   certain position in the scroll pane  switch tabs  and then switch back to   the scrolled scroll pane  the position will not be retained and the scroll   bar will be back at the top of the scroll pane.    This is not very helpful when dealing with a very large list of items in a   scroll pane.   </pre>
