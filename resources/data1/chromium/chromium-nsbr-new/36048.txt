<title>Issue 36048 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Blocked Icon] Change from Not Allow Javascript to Allow Javascript doesn't make the blocked icon disappeared from omnibox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a web page  go to &quot;Content Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Javascript&quot;  2. Set &quot;Do not allow any site to run Javascript&quot;  now you will see the  &quot;blocked icon&quot; displayed on omnibox at once.   3. Set back to &quot;All all sites to run Javascript&quot;      Ideally the &quot;Blocked Icon&quot; should disappear from omnibox at once  but  currently it is still there.    There are similar problems to other tabs like Cookies  Images  etc. For  example  change the options in Images tab doesn't make the blocked icon  show/disappear on/from the omnibox automatically.    Issue is detected in Beta candidate 4.1.249.1011 (Official Build 39069)  it  also happens in latest trunk 5.0.331.0 (Developer Build 39220)       </pre>
