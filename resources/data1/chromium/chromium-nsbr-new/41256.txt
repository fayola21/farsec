<title>Issue 41256 -   chromium -    text/html not copied to the clipboard - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Select some HTML  2. Copy  3. Paste into a rich text editor (a contenteditable area)      HTML should be pasted  but instead only text/plain is pasted.    For example  on the mozilla RTE demo page:  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/">http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/</a>    Select some text including the link to &quot;edit your preferences file&quot;.  Try to copy/paste the selection   into the text area.  The link doesn't get pasted.  However  if I drag the selection  it properly   includes the link.    I see the WriteHTML call in app/clipboard/clipboard_linux.cc  but when I run   gtk_clipboard_dump  it doesn't show text/html data (mostly just different text/plain variants). </pre>
