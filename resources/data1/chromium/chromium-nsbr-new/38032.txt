<title>Issue 38032 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Ability to choose behavior of tab undeletion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome should have an option to select between two behaviors for tab   undeletion. Currently the default is to undelete tabs from all windows  and   this would remain the default. An additional option  to only undelete tabs   from the active window  should be selectable as well.    Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1030 (Official Build 40990) beta      1. Open Google Chrome Options window.  2. Look for option to select tab undeletion behavior.  3. Observe that no option exists.      There should be an option to select between two different tab undeletion   behaviors.      There is no such option in the Google Chrome Options window. </pre>
