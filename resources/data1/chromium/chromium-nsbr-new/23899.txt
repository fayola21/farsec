<title>Issue 23899 -   chromium -    Copy URL should be disabled for inspect element - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Launch inspector and check the options menu of inspector. Copy URL is enabled    due to a recent change(<a title="Copy URL in popup menu is disabled" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13488"> Issue 13488 </a>). I think we should disable that for   inspector.    Google Chrome 4.0.221.4 (Official Build 27966) </pre>
