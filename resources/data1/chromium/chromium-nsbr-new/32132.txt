Open any image to content area (eg: <a href="http://i34.tinypic.com/2cdydkz.jpg">http://i34.tinypic.com/2cdydkz.jpg</a>)  2. Drag-n-drop the image from browser content area to BMB    Actual : Creates the bookmark on BMB with no title. Only favicon with no title show up.  Note: It stores the URL of the image to the bookmark correctly as expected.    Expected: Should create a bookmark with bookmark title from its primary domain name of the URL  example: &quot;i34.tinypic.com&quot; will be the title for the image of the URL <a href="http://i34.tinypic.com/2cdydkz.jpg">http://i34.tinypic.com/2cdydkz.jpg</a>    Note: Windows - It creates the domain name as its bookmark name title.             Linux have this issue. ( creates the bookmark on BMB with no title)    - The Image loaded in browser content area can either be online source or offline(stored in HD) both has the   issue. </pre>
