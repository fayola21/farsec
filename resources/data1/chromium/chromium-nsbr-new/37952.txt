<title>Issue 37952 -   chromium -    Download links aren't working at all (Chromium 5.0.352.0 (41264)) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Try to click on any download link from any webpage.  2. It brings no download window (In my case it doesn't asks for destination   details  name of the file  etc. as I've setted in my browser settings).  3. Nothing happens  status bar hides away and it seems like nothing has   been clicked in the first place.      Clicking on the download link should let me really download the file to my   system.      Nothing  as I've said before.    <b>Please provide
