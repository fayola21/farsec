<title>Issue 38047 -   chromium -    Bookmark issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Yes  okay  this is my first time sending an issue report cause I usually don't see the need  but the   issue that I have is actually really annoying.    My &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; tab  all the way to the right  I have multiple folders in there  every folder is   a different category of bookmarks. I used to click on Other bookmarks  mouse over any folder    and it would show me the list of tabs in that folder to the left of the folder. However  in the last 2   updates (I have Dev Version  5.0.342.3)  when I mouse over the tab folders in &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot;   (My Chrome browser is always maximised full screen btw)  the tabs show up on the right. Due to   the fact that my browser is full screen on my 13 inch laptop  I cannot see the tabs on the right    and I really do not want to minimise my browser... Because of this  whenever I want to go to a   webpage in one of my folders  I have to go to the &quot;Bookmarks&quot; tab on the top menu bar rather   then just use the &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; tab on the bookmarks bar.    Can you please fix this or at least let me know how to fix it myself  if possible?    Thank you :)    P.S. I apologize for being so damn detailed  but the retards that I come across... Oh man  you   don't even want to know. I just figure better to be safe then sorry  not really in the mood to send   a second report  thanks for reading :)           </pre>
