<title>Issue 35752 -   chromium -    need a linux shared build slave - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It would be nice if we had a builder using the make shared build.  It seems   like lots of people are relying on the shared build these days (mostly external   contributors who don't have beefy 16core/12gig desktops).    Maybe we can just put something on the FYI/experimental waterfall for now? </pre>
