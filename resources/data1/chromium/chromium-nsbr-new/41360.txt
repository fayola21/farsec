<title>Issue 41360 -   chromium -    Incorrect URL and SSL security status indicator in location bar for revoked and invalid certificates - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug is a regression on the trunk and Dev channel.  The current Beta  channel release &quot;5.0.342.9 (Official Build 43360) beta&quot; works fine.      1. Visit VeriSign's test site for a revoked certificate:  <a href="https://test-ssev.verisign.com:2443/test-SSEV-revoked-verisign.html">https://test-ssev.verisign.com:2443/test-SSEV-revoked-verisign.html</a>    What is the expected output?    The location bar should have the URL  and a security status indicator  (was a triagular warning icon) showing there is a certificate error.  If I click the security status indicator  I should get the Security  Information dialog  which allows me to inspect the bad certificate.    What do you see instead?    The location bar shows the URL and security status indicator of the  previous page  so I can't inspect the bad certificate.  Clicking the  &quot;Back&quot; icon on the SSL interstitial page brings me to the second page  back in history.    Hint on debugging:    Start with the SSLPolicy::OnCertError method in ssl_policy.cc.  The  two classes of certificate errors diverge from there into  OnOverridableCertError(handler) and OnFatalCertError(handler). </pre>
