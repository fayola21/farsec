<title>Issue 29298 -   chromium -    Userscript not working in latest build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.22  URLs (if applicable) : www.blogger.com    Hi     I had a some simple Userscripts that were loaded via my User Scripts   folder.    However  since the last DEV build update they stated that these would no   longer be loaded and you would have to add them manually.    I did this and they appeared to load fine and I can now see them as   extensions. However the 2 use no longer work.    Here is the code that simply creates a larger Editing box when I post to   Blogger.    Is there any reason why these should not work now that they are loaded as   extensions? </pre>
