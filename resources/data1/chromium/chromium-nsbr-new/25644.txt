<title>Issue 25644 -   chromium -    Wrench and Tool buttons should not have a pill look - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4.0.223.8      1. In chrome prefs  check &quot;Show Page and Option buttons on Toolbar  2. Look at it        Should look like on windows and linux: they don't look like buttons until   you hover over them.        They have that &quot;pill button&quot; look like the other buttons to the left of the   omnibox.    Cole: That should be fixed  right? </pre>
