<title>Issue 25811 -   chromium -    Scrolling in Google Spreadsheets is very slow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.8    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Also slow  but more evenly slow   which is less irritating.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Faster and smoother.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Haven't tried it.      1. Open a Google spreadsheet with many rows and columns (and in my   case also colored cells).  2. Try scrolling up and down.        Scrolling should be fast enough that if I wait for half a second or a second    that all changes will be finished.        The scrolling is both slow and choppy -- it stops for over a second which   make me think the browser didn't get some of the events  so I try scrolling   more  then it starts processing those events and overshoots the target.    Repeat in the other direction.   </pre>
