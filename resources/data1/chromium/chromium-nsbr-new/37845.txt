<title>Issue 37845 -   chromium -    Do not initialize more shortcut key in default  please. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Browser just like a operation system  lots of app(webpage) running in it     sometimes  the webpage need set some shortcut key for there functions.   As a frame  a container  less resource we preserve  more resource   webpage can use.    Example:  Google doc use Ctrl+S to save document.  Some email page use F9 to send/receive mail.    We should better do not initialize more shortcut key in default  or there   will be conflict when the webpage use the same shortcut key  this will be   limit web apps future.      Lots of shortcut key of chromium was not really in need  such as:  History - Ctrl+H  Show bookmark bar - Ctrl+B      User do not use these shortcut key frequently  so they can use menu   instead.    btw: If a shortcut key was support  it gone be a burden in future. </pre>
