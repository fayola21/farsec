<title>Issue 36929 -   chromium -    Disable the XSS auditor on 4.1 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a title="Make XSS auditor faster" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35723"> Issue 35723 </a> describes how POST operations get a lot slower when the XSS auditor is active.    abarth improved the situation for the specific test in that bug from &quot;a lot slower&quot; to &quot;'only' 400%   slower than chrome 3&quot;.    Now  the test in that bug is not representative from normal-day usage. Then again we don't have   any tests that do POST requests  so we don't really know how bad 400% worse performance is in   practice.    What should happen on 4.1?    * Merge abarth's patch and swallow the 400% (&quot;Hey  it's much better than chrome 4&quot;)  * Disable the xss auditor on 4.1 (as fast as chrome 3  but less xss auditing takes place).    Discuss. </pre>
