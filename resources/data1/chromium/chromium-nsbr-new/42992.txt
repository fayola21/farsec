<title>Issue 42992 -   chromium -    Icon &quot;128&quot; in extensions is a 64x64 icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.28 (45883)    <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#icons">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#icons</a>    According to this URL the 128x128 icon  which is &quot;128&quot; in the manifest  is   used during the installation dialogue (and when the extension is allowed to   run in incognito mode). However the actual icon displayed is only a 64x64   icon  so &quot;128&quot; is resized. I solved this by making &quot;128&quot; a 64x64 icon.    And slightly related to this: it seems &quot;48&quot; is used as an icon in the   &quot;extension was installed&quot; bubble when an extension is first installed  and is   thus resized as well.   </pre>
