<title>Issue 39085 -   chromium -    Can't do non-contiguous selection in bookmarks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - open bookmarks manager  - click the first bookmark to select it  - command-click the 3rd bookmark    expected:  - 1st and 3rd are selected  per HI guidelines for non-contiguous selection    actual:  - only 3rd bookmark is selected.    Filing for mac  but probably OS-all. Regression because we lost this functionality from the native   bookmark manager. </pre>
