<title>Issue 24319 -   chromium -    Make NTP tips section hideable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.1 (Offizieller Build 27713)    From <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-</a>  dev/browse_thread/thread/243f5a2fffd083ea :    The New Tab Page used to be (somewhen between versions 2 and 3) slick   and customizable. Now there have been added (1) a line telling me to   synchronize my bookmarks  (2) a line with one of about a dozen tips   and (3) a corner trying to tell me that Chrome now supports themes.   IMHO several things could be improved here:    * Either make all of these optional in the way that thumbnails and   recently closed tabs are  so that I can get rid of these elements   which just visually distract but don't help me at all... [or at least fix   <a title="Hide tips on new tab page after a reasonable amount of views"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=24318">issue 24318</a>] </pre>
