<title>Issue 41949 -   chromium -    http:// protocol disappeared from the address omnibox bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.3 dev    Copy/pasting urls from the address bar is an operation I do at least 10   times a day. Even my father (who used to handle his mouse upright/down)   asked me how to do this. This is a common operation that should work among   all browsers.    Copy/pasting urls is broken in chrome since the http:// protocol was removed   from the omnibox.    This is a huge regression. </pre>
