<title>Issue 26902 -   chromium -    Could more aggressively inline autocomplete when trailing whitespace was a match - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we strip trailing whitespace from the user input and prevent inline   autocompletion when it was found.    I think instead it makes sense to try to autocomplete against the original    white-space containing string  and then if we get no matches  strip the   whitespace and prevent inline autocompletion.    The effect of this is that if you have a URL in your history like   &quot;http://who/Peter Kasting&quot;  and you type up through the space  we won't   suddenly drop inline autocompletion for one character. </pre>
