<title>Issue 24218 -   chromium -    Chrome stops being able to load pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This has happened to me two times in the past day now.    I am running Mac Chrome 4.0.221.8 (Official Build 28160)    After a while of running chrome (maybe 3 hours) I become unable to load any new pages.    The existing tabs I have open continue to work. But when I create a new tab  it comes up blank  and even the new page page doesn't load).  It seems like the renderers are getting hosed. Nothing loads  including &quot;about:version&quot;... just get a white page. After about 15 minutes  these   loads end up as sad tabs.    Both times this happened  I had a number of existing tabs open (on the order of 15-20).  In each case  these tabs included gmail  and youtube (where youtube was auto-playing videos in the background).    The spinlock tool did not show any of the renderers as hung.    Restarting Chrome resolved the problem in both cases.    Around the time this happened  I can think of two big changes:      * The dev channel got updated the day before    * Around the same time  I changed my Chrome preferences to include session restore (&quot;Restore the pages that were open last&quot;)  and also   changed my homepage to &quot;about:blank&quot;. </pre>
