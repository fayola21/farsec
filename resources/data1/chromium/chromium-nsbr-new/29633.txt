<title>Issue 29633 -   chromium -    Visual refresh of the extension install UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to do another refresh of the install dialog. There's been a general   sentiment of unsatisfaction with the current design for the following   reasons:    * eng would like something more extensible  so that things like geolocation   could be slotted in easily without having to come up with a bunch more   text.  * ui people have stated that the text sounds too vague.  * power users would like a more specific description of the permissions   that are being requested.    I am sort of envisioning a short list of permissions in the dialog  each   with a little icon and a short blurb explaining. There would be only a   handful of possible permissions  like &quot;browsing history&quot;  &quot;physical   location&quot;  &quot;websites&quot;.    But it may be that it is not possible to do this in such a small space and   we instead want to have a generic warning and a link to more information    or to expand the dialog. </pre>
