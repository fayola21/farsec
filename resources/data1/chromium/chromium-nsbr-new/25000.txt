<title>Issue 25000 -   chromium -    Backspace causes &quot;back&quot; action when using IME in text input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.1 (Developer Build 29238)    OS version               : 10.5.8  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK        1. In a text field  start typing using an IME such as Pinyin or Hiragana. After typing a  few   characters  hit delete/backspace to correct a mistake.      It should clear the last character  allowing you to continue.      It clears the last character  but a split second later  Chromium goes back a page.    Comments from <a title="Back/forward via keyboard shortcuts (command-left/right and backspace/delete) not working" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12557"> issue 12557 </a> which caused this regression:    Comment 53 by ping.nsr.yeh  Today (62 minutes ago)  This newly changed behavior of backspace is producing confusion for users who use   an input method - practically everyone in Japan  China  Taiwan and Hong Kong    maybe Korea too. Whenever I want to correct a mistyped keystroke during input  the   browser goes back to previous page.    See the attached screenshot. (in <a title="Back/forward via keyboard shortcuts (command-left/right and backspace/delete) not working" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12557"> issue 12557 </a>) I'm composing a character that needs 5 strokes. I   typed   3 strokes  see there is a grey underline for the 3 stroke characters to indicate that I'm   still in composition mode. Then a backspace would go to previous page.    Logically I'm pressing backspace to correct a keystroke inside the input box  but   practically Mac must be doing something different to make Chrome think I'm not in   the input box.    It renders Chrome practically unusable unless you are sure to always make no   mistakes while composing Chinese characters.    Comment 54 by paradoxmo  Today (moments ago)  I can reproduce this issue. The thing I have seen is that it does actually does seem to delete the   character in   composition mode but then it goes back a page anyway-- that is  it seems to be sent to both the   IME *and* the   page.    For example I typed &quot;ba&quot; in Pinyin and then pushed backspace. The &quot;a&quot; disappeared but then a   split second later    the browser goes back to the previous page.   </pre>
