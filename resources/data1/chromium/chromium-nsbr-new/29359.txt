<title>Issue 29359 -   chromium -    Chrome should use explicit pointer grabs for Chrome OS-related drags - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome (as of 4.0.263.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33703">r33703</a>) is still using implicit pointer grabs when   the user drags a tab in overview mode or drags a panel  I think.  This   seems to be unreliable in some cases -- I'm not able to reproduce it now    but I was previously seeing (and demoed to Scott) what looked like Chrome   not receiving motion events whenever the pointer moved anywhere outside of   the tab summary bubble or overview mode input windows across the bottom of   the screen: the dragged tab or panel would stop moving as soon as the   pointer left these windows  and then start again when it passed over   another window.    Chrome should just acquire a pointer grab explicitly (i.e. with   XGrabPointer() or gdk_pointer_grab()) when it sees the button press that   initiates one of these drag actions  and release it when it's done with the   drag. </pre>
