<title>Issue 40999 -   chromium -    Mac Omnibox popup wrong under non-1 scale factor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch Quartz Debug  2. Tools/Show User Interface Resolution  3. Set to something nice  like 2.0  4. Run Chrome.  5. Start typing in omnibox.        The popup is half the size it should be  and not positioned correctly.  This is because   autocomplete_popup_view_mac.mm has some confusion between coordinates of the window on-  screen and coordinates of the view.    I have a fix in the bag  but it would cause a merge conflict for one of pkasting's mstone-5 CLs  so   holding off on it. </pre>
