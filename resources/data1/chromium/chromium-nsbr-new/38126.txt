<title>Issue 38126 -   chromium -    Chrome uses too much memory in long run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run Chrome for a long period of time  2. Notice how system starts to jam  3. Look at task manager (screen shot attached)      Chrome is not the reason for system jamming.      Chrome eats up more that half of the memory on my relatively new and   relatively powerful laptop. This causes the system to start swapping I   think  which increases load beyond acceptable.    <b>Please provide
