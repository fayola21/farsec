<title>Issue 36078 -   chromium -    [Content Settings - Blocked Notification Icon] Please remove the unnecessary Close button from the pop-up of blocked notification icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently in the pop-up of blocked notification icon there is a Close  button  however this button is unnecessary since user can click any other  area to make it disappear.    This is also a requirement of consistency behavior in chrome  because  currently in pop-up of extensions page action (same style icon with blocked  notification icon) there is no such button. Also  in pop-up Page and Wrench  menu there is no such Close button.   </pre>
