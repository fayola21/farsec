<title>Issue 42071 -   chromium -    Backspace  arrow keys cease working periodically - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.9             Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK        Undetermined. Approx. 3 days ago I noticed only when using Chrome that my delete/backspace   and arrow keys ceased to work within Chrome  specifically web forms  e.g. when filling out details   for shopping. The issue is sporadic. I can sometimes refresh the page and keys are back. I cannot   determine what causes it but I am seeing this on my home MacBook and also now on my work   iMac.        Keys working.        Keys not working.       </pre>
