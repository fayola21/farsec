<title>Issue 34341 -   chromium -    Mal function on www.bancoestado.cl - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>         DEAR SIR:    WHEN I TRY TO GET IN www.bancoestado.cl  you know is our chilean main   bank  it is impossible to stay in online bank site  you do a login and   inmediately you are get out of online bank system. If you get in wiev   expenses  view charges etc  or doing a wire transference or other online   payment  it is not possible to select your saved destinataries records to   give them founds or bills  as a telephone  basic services bills  etc.    I have tried to describe by the attached images what is wrong with google   chrome  mozilla fierfox  and safari. Please recognize this mistake because   Internet Explorer does work perfectly with this very important web site.        Please check my images and their sequence  and you'll see a mistake   message  while you are selecting one destinatary to transfer money or   after that  once you have logged out for pressing aceptar (ok).      Actually  the risk for this mistake is sometimes  while you are doing a   wire transference  website gets you out of personal private website and   the wire transaction appears to be completed  but your destinatary does   not receive funds which you have transfered  so ... you have to visit your   next Banco Estado for resolving a checking in your account  after that   they resolves completing that operation  in that moment your destinatary   receives his funds.      My complete name:   ANDRES ROA ESPINOZA  Adress: Madrid 1117  Santiago  CHILE  POSTAL CODE: 8360026  PHONE: 562-2456107 (Ask for Andres Roa)    Thanks </pre>
