<title>Issue 29731 -   chromium -    chrome for mac not properly maximizing in window - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.5.8              Open Chrome for Mac. Click the green circle on top left to maximize the   window. The max doesn't have the browser take up the whole screen. The   attached screenshot shows the result after I clicked the green &quot;max&quot;   button. It takes up about 2/3 of my screen  both on my big HP monitor and   on my laptop screen.      Max should take up the whole screen.        Max takes up only 2/3 of the screen. </pre>
