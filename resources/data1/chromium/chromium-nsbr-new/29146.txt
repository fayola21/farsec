<title>Issue 29146 -   chromium -    Navigating in the same tab from site A to chrome:// to site A again doesn't correctly put both site A urls into a single SiteInstance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>  2. Navigate to chrome://history  3. Navigate to <a href="http://mail.google.com">http://mail.google.com</a> (or www.google.com again).    The first &amp; third navigations belong in the same SiteInstance  but they   currently will be placed in separate SiteInstances.   </pre>
