<title>Issue 32061 -   chromium -    Restoring 600 tabs at once can make browser completely nonfunctional - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Restore a complex session windows (66 windows  400-600 tabs) on a single   core Prescott IV CPU over a DSL line.  2. Wait 15-20 minutes with ~100% CPU activity and 100%  more quickly   trailing of to zero network activity.  3. Examine the session.  CPU activity remains moderately high (&gt;60%) while   network activity is moderately low.      Restore session should work completely and CPU activity should fall back to    ~30% (perhaps average for large sessions where chromium has not optimized   the use of the gtk poll() functions and/or the use of Javascript in   inactive tabs/windows to minimize CPU use and power consumption).       Examining the tabs one by one indicates that most are fine.  However some   tabs  perhaps 5% still have active spinners  some with what appear to be   complete pages  some blank (no content)  a couple with messages in the   corner like &quot;waiting for cache...&quot; or &quot;waiting for www.google-  analytics.com&quot;.  One can reload the web pages by hand and they usually load   quite quickly.    However  if one hits the X to stop the load  particularly if it is the last   spinning tab  may completely hang the browser.  It becomes completely   unresponsive to keyboard or mouse commands and all of the display windows   go blank (unredrawn if you switch away from them and then back to them).   attempting to strace the primary process yields no activity (in a normal   chrome there are lots of gettimeofday  poll calls  etc).  In my opinion   this is a fundamental problem (not being able to restore a browser   session).    <b>Please provide
