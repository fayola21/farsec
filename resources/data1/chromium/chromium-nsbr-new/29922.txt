<title>Issue 29922 -   chromium -    theme loading bubble doesn't go away if the utility process crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the utility process crashes  the loading bubble for theme installs never   goes away.  One way to test this is with --utility-cmd-prefix=foo.    The process could fail to start or it could crash while running (I think   there's a pipe error callback for crashes while running).   </pre>
