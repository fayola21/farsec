<title>Issue 33684 -   chromium -    Clean up draggable_button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I extracted a class DraggableButton from BookmarkButton (   <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/180036">http://codereview.chromium.org/180036</a> ). I left the code mostly untouched   in that CL  but it should be cleaned up a bit. For example  mayDragStart_ is   never set to YES. Furthermore  several of Cocoa's drag...: apis may technically   only be called from mouseDown: and not mouseDragged: according to the   docs  so DraggableButton should use the drag detection that safari uses (see   patch set 2 in <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/180036">http://codereview.chromium.org/180036</a> ). </pre>
