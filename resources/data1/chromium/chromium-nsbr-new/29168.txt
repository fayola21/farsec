Create an app shortcut to your gmail account.  2. Respond to an email message.  3. Open the message composition in a secondary window (by clicking &quot;New   window&quot;).  4. Open a main chromium browser window.    What is the expected result? The main browser window is positioned and   sized like the last normal browser window you had open.    What happens instead? The main browser window is sized like the secondary   message composition window.   </pre>
