<title>Issue 46269 -   chromium -    Wrong highlight under Wrench menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.427.0 (Official version 49010) dev  URLs (if applicable) : -           Safari 4: -    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: -           IE 8: OK      1. Click on the wrench icon  2. Hover over the items          The items are highlighted by the system standard hover        The items are highlighted by the old XP/98 style blue highlight.        In the recent releases I found this very annoying graphics bug. While the other menus (like the Page menu) has the system hover  while the wrench icon's menu is using the good ol' (and ugly) standard blue highlight. </pre>
