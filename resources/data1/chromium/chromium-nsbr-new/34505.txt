<title>Issue 34505 -   chromium -    FlipStream or FlipSession should set more members of HttpResponseInfo - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This issue is suitable for a new Chrome developer.    FlipStream is setting only the 'headers'  'was_fetched_via_spdy'   and 'ssl_info' members of HttpResponseInfo.  To see this  inspect the  following functions:    1.  The FlipHeadersToHttpResponse function in flip_session.cc sets  only the 'headers' and 'was_fetched_via_spdy' members of its 'response'  argument.    2. FlipSession::OnSyn and FlipSession::OnSynReply calls  FlipHeadersToHttpResponse and GetSSLInfo on a blank HttpResponseInfo  object  and then pass the HttpResponseInfo object to  FlipStream::OnResponseReceived.    3. FlipStream::OnResponseReceived is the only FlipStream method  that modifies its response_ member.    Compare this with the HttpStreamParser class  which sets the following  member of HttpResponseInfo:      request_time    response_time    headers    vary_data    So FlipStream or FlipSession should also set request_time  response_time   and vary_data. </pre>
