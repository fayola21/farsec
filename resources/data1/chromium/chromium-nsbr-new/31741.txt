<title>Issue 31741 -   chromium -    More control over new tab theming - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.292.0 (Developer Build 35659)    Right now  the new tab page is basicly themed by toolbar  ntp_header and   ntp_section(-*). While text (and the background) can be themed just fine    theming the detached bookmark toolbar and history bar (background and   border) is a mess  because toolbar  ntp_header and ntp_section influence a   lot of elements which should be themable individually.    There should be individual keys (optional  to not break existing themes)   which can override whatever colors are set by   toolbar/ntp_header/ntp_section for:    - detached toolbar background (which does NOT change download bar   background)  - detached toolbar border  - history background  - history border  - link thumbnail border  - link thumbnail hover  - view/layout button tint   </pre>
