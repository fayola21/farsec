<title>Issue 27369 -   chromium -    Minimine-expand-close buttons overflow when Chrome window is too narrow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.27                    1. Narrow Chrome's window as much as possible.      There should be a limit  to which the user can narrow the window.      The buttons in the top right corner of the window overflow  as the   browser's width becomes 0.   </pre>
