<title>Issue 25539 -   chromium -    Clicking on a link to open a webpage takes longer to load than directly navigating to it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If I try to open a bug report in crbug.com/ it takes longer especially when I   have internal gmail running on another tab.    When I click on bug link in gmail  it opens a new tab with that bug but takes   a long time to render sometimes. When this happens  if I close the tab that's   still trying to load and clicking on the link again loads the webpage faster.  Also  I feel it's faster if I navigate to crbug.com and search for the bug.     Chromium 4.0.224.2 (Developer Build 29786) </pre>
