<title>Issue 33640 -   chromium -    google Street view full screen pans infintely and hangs browser and screen  reboot required - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.49 (35163) beta  URLs (if applicable) : maps.google.com  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK      1. Go to maps.google.com  2. select a street location  3. go to street view  4. Select the full screen button  5. use the &lt;left&gt; or &lt;right&gt; arrow screen to pan the view        the view should pan left or right        the view spins forever  as if the 'key-down' event is not being reset    then the street view window hangs and won't die.    The full screen view is a separate process so even a 'force quit' of chrome  doesn't kill the full screen view. you have to be savvy enough to find and  kill the process.    If you aren't running 'spaces' or some other equivalent  you can't break  out of the window (even &lt;command&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; doesn't work) to get to a tool to  kill the process and have to resort to a forced reboot.   </pre>
