<title>Issue 29729 -   chromium -    Chrome sandbox blocks loading of fonts stored outside stock system locations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30  URLs (if applicable) : Any URL using a non-system standard font installed   via FontExplorer X Pro - <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">http://veerle.duoh.com/</a> for example (Century   Gothic in the headlines).     OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. View a site using a non-system font (installed locally via FontExplorer X   Pro) set as its primary typeface.  2. Have that font installed and working on your system.      Chrome displays the font correctly  and if it is not installed locally and/or is   not functioning properly  falls back to a backup font (see font-family code   example below).      Chrome fails to render the font correctly (displaying a &quot;broken font&quot;   symbol [letter A in a square])  and fails to use a fallback font.  For instance    font-family: &quot;Century Gothic&quot;  Helvetica  Verdana  sans-serif; displays   broken font as opposed to displaying in Helvetica.    Also: Tested this out with a few other fonts... occurs with any non-system   font installed via FontExplorer X Pro v. 2.0.3.  FontExplorer is passing fonts   along fine to all other browsers/programs  so it doesn't appear to be the   issue. </pre>
