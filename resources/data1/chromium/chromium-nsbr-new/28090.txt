<title>Issue 28090 -   chromium -    Better error reporting for FTP when permission is denied - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Type <a href="ftp://ftp.coverity.com/">ftp://ftp.coverity.com/</a> in the location bar and hit Enter        Chrome displays a network error page with the error:    Error 6 (net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND): The file or directory could not be found.    Firfox pops up an error dialog with the error:    550: Can't change directory to /: Permission denied    Firefox's error dialog is more informative  suggesting to me that it  could be a login issue.  Indeed  I was given a username and password   but I forgot to use them in the URL.    Can we render the 550 response from the FTP server in the page? </pre>
