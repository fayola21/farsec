<title>Issue 31688 -   chromium -    PDF viewing inline - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Related to Mac <a title="No support for inline PDF on the Mac"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13716">bug 13716</a>.  On Linux  we don't believe we should do inline PDF viewing - instead  we'd  like to not have the pdf appear in the download shelf  but be opened by the  default handler. Does this work for you?  thanks!  Mike    Maybe related to 19587   </pre>
