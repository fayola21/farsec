<title>Issue 37548 -   chromium -    Launching extension apps with --app-id can fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the current start-up sequence  if the extensions_service isn't finished   loading extensions by the time   BrowserInit::LaunchWithProfile::OpenApplicationURL is called  launching an   extensions app with --app-id can fail.
