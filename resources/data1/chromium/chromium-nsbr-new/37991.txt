<title>Issue 37991 -   chromium -    Briefly saw blocked cookie icon in omnibox  but have no cookie blocking set in my preferences - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Running 5.0.342.2 in Windows Vista x64.    I was looking at <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000198-264.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000198-264.html</a>    which was opened by clicking on a link from the browser action popup window   of the Chromed Bird Twitter extension.     When clicking on links on that page  I see the blocked cookie icon briefly   in the omnibox before the new page loads  although my preferences do not   have any of the cookie blocking stuff turned on.     I'm not sure yet whether I can reliabily reproduce this  but I've been able   to show both Peter and Darin so I'm not totally imagining it. I will update   the bug if I have a reliable set of steps.     </pre>
