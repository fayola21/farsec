<title>Issue 24752 -   chromium -    Can't click flash buttons - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Example: I go to youtube to play a video. Nothing happens when I click   (HD) button  I cannot change the volume  I cannot do anything that involves    clicking a button. In firefox I am able to click all of the buttons in a   flash video.

The click will register  I will be able to change from &quot;SD&quot; to &quot;HD&quot; in   youtube  I would be able to begin the speedtest @ speedtest.net        Nothing    <b>Please provide
