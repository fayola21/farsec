<title>Issue 36656 -   chromium -    Feature request: Saving last open tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to suggest implementing a feature that enables the user to save   open tabs when closing the browser. The tabs could be opened upon reopening   the browser.  This is similar behavior to the one offered when the browser crashes. A   dialog pops up offering a &quot;restore&quot; option. What I'm proposing is mostly   like that without the browser crash part. :-)    Keep up the good work. Cheers. </pre>
