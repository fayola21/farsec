<title>Issue 33037 -   chromium -    Aero Issue with Newest Developer Build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Wit the current developer builds  themes which should be showing aero do not   work  any other theme then the default hides aero. This may not be a severe   issue  though it is quite annoying and dragging users with aero away. We   would like this to be fixed soon. ASAP to be honest.   </pre>
