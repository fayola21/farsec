<title>Issue 33536 -   chromium -    Whole URL select first time the address bar receives focus (i.e. is clicked) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  OS + version : Ubuntu 8.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : Gnome  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): It selects the whole URL the   first time user switch focus from the webpage to the address bar (i.e. the   first time one clicks in the address bar after loading a page).      1. Load any web page  2. Single-click on the address bar with the left button  3. The expected behavior doesn't happen: the full url isn't selected. This   happens on Windows and really is a time-saver      To select the entire URL  making easier to type a new address      No select occurs  only a focus. </pre>
