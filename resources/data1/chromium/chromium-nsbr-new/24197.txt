Component     Chrome &gt; Deprecated &gt; Tools &gt; Layout Tests  Reporter     jnd  CC     chrome-bugs  Type     Bug  Priority     P2  Severity     S2  In prod     false  Notes  Webkit had a new test:fast/css/disabled-author-styles.html  which use a new  method:setAuthorAndUserStylesEnabled in layoutTestController. to  enable/disable styles of both author and user. we might to add it to our  test_shell two.  jnd on January 05 2008 21:48  (New)  Notes  So far.

We don't support user-controlled UA stylesheeets in beta.  So no  need to turn them on/off in the layout tests.  eseidel on April 24 2008 10:51  (New)  Notes  Actually  due to this  I'm skipping this test:    // For this test  we have same result with WebKit  the only difference is we  // have a additional error message. Actually the additional error message  // should be part of previous test:disabled-author-styles.html  but somehow  // the message is dumped after previous test's #EOF  which cuase a additional  // error in the header of this test. Maybe we fix this funny problem in  // test_shell later. For now either PASS or FAIL are all OK.  V8 | KJS # LayoutTests/fast/css/display-none-inline-style-change-crash.html  = PASS | FAIL      Now the test line reads:    // BUG 973468: Need a setAuthorAndUserStylesEnabled method in  // layoutTestController. Now we have preference to enable/disable user  // styles(not work now)  we still need to add a preference to enable/disable  // styles of both author and user.  // Deferring  we don't support user-controlled UA stylesheets (in beta)  // Actually  gonna SKIP because it causes an additional error message in:  // LayoutTests/fast/css/display-none-inline-style-change-crash.html   somehow  // the message is dumped after the #EOF  which cuase a additional  // error in the header of this test.  V8 | KJS # SKIP : LayoutTests/fast/css/disabled-author-styles.html = FAIL  pamg on May 19 2008 15:46  (Assigned)  Assignee     pamg  mal on May 19 2008 16:29  (Assigned)  Notes  The following revision refers to this bug:     http://go/crsrc?view=rev&amp;revision=40004    ------------------------------------------------------------------------  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40004">r40004</a> | pamg | 2008-05-19 16:28:44 -0700 (Mon  19 May 2008) | 6 lines  Changed paths:    D /changes/pamg/skip-defer    M  http://go/crsrc/trunk/webkit/tools/layout_tests/test_lists/tests_fixable.txt?<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1">r1</a>=40004&amp;<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2">r2</a>=40003    Mark a test as both DEFER and SKIP  for reasons explained in the bug and the  file.
