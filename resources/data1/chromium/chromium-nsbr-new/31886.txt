<title>Issue 31886 -   chromium -    Fullscreen mode with visible controls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.294.0 (Developer Build 35869)        Firefox 3.x: OK!      1. go to fullscreen mode  2. try to use the browser normally      Fullscreen should be usable for anyone.      If you don't know your ctrl-something keys you will probably not have much   fun using fullscreen.      Don't get me wrong  I can see the use of the current fullscreen mode for   advanced users but for &quot;normal&quot; mouse users  it is unusable. Compare it to   other browsers: Firefox for example hides all system bars etc but keeps the   tabbar and basic navigation stuff visable. I would really like the same in   Chrome  e.g. just expand the whole browser to use all screen space but keep   the tab and navigation bar. Maybe in this mode the &quot;restore&quot; button could   be changed to a &quot;leave fullscreen&quot; button. </pre>
