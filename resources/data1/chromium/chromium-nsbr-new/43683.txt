<title>Issue 43683 -   chromium -    Tabs often hang up during startup - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   I'm not sure if it's reproducible  but it happens for me very often. I have Chrome set to reopen   tabs on startup and have around 9 tabs constantly open (3 of them pinned). When I restart   Chrome at least one tab often hangs up (spinning counter clockwise)  just now it happened 4   times in a row. What's worse is that trying to close a tab that hanged up like that causes Chrome   to simply exit (without crashing or anything useful in Console.app). Otherwise such tab doesn't   seem to ever come out of its state (I had one tab spinning like that for at least 5 hours).        All tabs should open successfully  or if something's wrong they should at least be closable and   shouldn't take the whole browser with it.        Some tabs never come out of counter clockwise spinning phase. Any attempt to close them   causes whole browser to close.    <b>Please provide
