<title>Issue 28604 -   chromium -    Expose some i18n apis via Javascript for dom UI and extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is a meta bug.     Chrome comes with ICU (a rich i18n library for formatting and sorting to   name just two examples) and the C++ part of Chrome can take full advantage   of that.     However  they are not available in Javascript. Therefore  neither dom UI   nor extensions can use them.      Traditional Javascript applications do the following:    * Include the locale-specific minimal data in the Javascript files and  use   them for formatting (e.g. GWT-based Javascript apps do that). When a locale   is changed  a new data has to be loaded  but that's pretty rare.       i18n'ized extensions can take this approach  too. Each locale directory   will have locale-specific data  but if multiple extensions do that  there'd   be multiple copies of data / JS libraries.     * Talk to the server and ask them for sorted list. Obviously there's a   latency issue.     * Alternatively  send down the sort keys along with strings and binary-sort   in terms of sort keys on the client side. This doesn't work well if what's   to be sorted changes dynamically on the client-side.     -----------------------------------    Moreover  in case of Chrome dom UI pages and extensions (and potentially   &quot;local apps&quot; on Chrome OS)  there's no &quot;web server&quot; to talk to. In the   place of &quot;web server&quot;  we have Chrome  with the full access to i18n apis.   However  none of those APIs is exposed via Javascript. As a result  dom   UI/extensions/local apps cannot use them.    For domUIs  we kinda worked around the issue by doing all the work in C++   and filling out html/js templates in C++. This works well for static data    but obviously doesn't work for dynamic data.     One example is the # of recently closed tabs (plural formatting). See <a title="recently closed tabs text is not localized for all plural formats "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21407">bug   21407</a>    The other is <a title="Extensions page uses 'binary sort' when listing extensions as a tie breaker"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28596">bug 28596</a> (perhaps  we can work around this issue  but leaving   the current JS code alone would be nice).     --------------------    We can expose some i18n apis in Javascript (V8 extensions?) in Chrome. Or    we can propose it to webkit or even higher up (like web apps WG). Sorting   and date/time formatting are relatively easy to agree upon  but plural   formatting would be tough to get consensus on (see <a title="recently closed tabs text is not localized for all plural formats "  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21407">bug 21407</a>).      </pre>
