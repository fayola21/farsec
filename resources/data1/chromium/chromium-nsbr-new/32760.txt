<title>Issue 32760 -   chromium -    &lt;a type=&quot;...&quot;&gt; should influence the Accept header - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The type attribute of anchor tags seems to be ignored.  If an alternate   version of a document is offered by a standards-compliant and RESTful link   such as:        &lt;a rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;text/csv&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;Download as CSV&lt;/a&gt;    Then the browser should boost text/csv to the top of the priority list of   content types sent in the Accept header when requesting that link. </pre>
