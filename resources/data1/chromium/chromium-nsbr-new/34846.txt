<title>Issue 34846 -   chromium -    Crashing during a restart from loading Preferences - 5.0.317.2 dev - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Steps to reproduce the issue:  1. After updating to 5.0.317.2 I shut the browser down and  2. Once I opened it back up it crashes before the window opens.  3. If I remove the Preferences file it can start back up.    The only other change I made besides the update was installing this user-  script: <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/41212">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/41212</a> but I've deleted it from   the extensions(?) folder with no change.   </pre>
