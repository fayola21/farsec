<title>Issue 40379 -   chromium -    Chromium Questions...And Suggestions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.370.0 (Developer Build 43585)        Chrome 4.1 Stable - No             What problems?  1. No bookmarks bar on New Tab Page  2. Why was the bookmarks button moved  3. Bookmarks button no longer drag 'n' drop.  4. No CTRL to Copy and Paste      1. There is no bookmarks toolbar on the new tab page. When in other   versions there is. Why?    2. Why was the bookmarks button moved?    3. In Chrome Stable. I could click and hold the Chrome Bookmarks button and   Drag it to where I want the bookmark. But in Chromium now I can't do that.   Could you maybe re-add this feature as the only way I can do it now is   highlighting the url and dragging which is not as easy.    4. When I want to copy bookmarks. I have to right click and copy. Then   right click and paste. But it would be so much easier to hold CTRL and then   drag to a new place and it copies the bookmark.      1. There is no bookmarks bar on the new tab page and you have to use CTRL   +B when I don't want to have it permanently there.    2. It's a question. I preferred the bookmarks bar in the old location    3. When I let go it just adds the bookmark which is annoying and is like   Firefox and that is why I switched to Chrome    4. It just moves the bookmark.            Please follow these. I found the new bookmarks really annoying and like   Firefox and I liked the old way. Please revert it as It's a neat feature of   chrome the way it was. </pre>
