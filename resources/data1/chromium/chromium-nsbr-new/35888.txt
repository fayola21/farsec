<title>Issue 35888 -   chromium -    [extensions/privacy] non-public NPAPI plugins are detectable from web content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 (Offizieller Build 38810) dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a>      1. Install an extension with an in-house  non-public NPAPI plugin (non-  public as in |&quot;public&quot;: false| per   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/npapi.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/npapi.html</a> ).  2. Visit Panopticlick (URL above).  3. Learn that your browser fingerprint is unique due to that plugin being   exposed.    Since the plugin isn't exposed to web content  shouldn't it be invisible as   well? I don't see any gain from this (except maybe that about:plugins is   slightly easier to implement this way). </pre>
