<title>Issue 25526 -   chromium -    &quot;make this my homepage&quot; on NTP should be a button not a link - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you're homepage is not NTP  opening a new tab shows a link at the bottom   that says &quot;Make this my homepage&quot;. That's a great feature  but it needs to be   a button  not a link.    There is no navigation that occurs when pressing the link. It performs an   action. It should not be a hyperlink. </pre>
