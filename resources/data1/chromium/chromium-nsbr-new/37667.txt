<title>Issue 37667 -   chromium -    JavaScript blocking breaks Extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.349.0 (Developer Build 40894)      Firefox 3.x: OK      1. Enable JavaScript whitelisting but selecting Options -&gt; Under the Hood  -&gt; Content settings... -&gt; JavaScript -&gt; Do not allow any site to run JavaScript  2. Install an extension ( I used Vrome and Smooth Gestures )  3. Open a new tab to some web page.  4. Attempt to exercise the functionality of your extension.      The expected result is that the JavaScript content originating from the  visited web pages will be blocked  but that the extensions will function  properly.      The JavaScript from both the visited web page and any extensions are  blocked thus breaking the extensions.    Content blocking in Firefox through the noscript extension does not  interfere with the operation of other extensions. However  the new content  blocking features of chrome are part of the browser itself  and appear to  take precedence over both visited web pages and extensions. There doesn't  appear to be any way to enable extensions without disabling JavaScript  whitelisting  or enabling JavaScript on individual pages.    It seems that a more granular method of blocking content  specifically  JavaScript  is called for here. The content settings mechanism should be  capable of distinguishing between content supplied by visited web pages and  content supplied by browser extensions. </pre>
