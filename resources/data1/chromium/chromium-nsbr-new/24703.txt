<title>Issue 24703 -   chromium -    Tooltips on bookmark toolbar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.222.5 (Developer Build 28702) / Linux        Firefox 3.5: no tooltip for folders      1. Create a folder inside the bookmark bar called &quot;Foo&quot;  2. mouse-over this folder  3. a tooltip pops up  saying &quot;Foo&quot;    The tooltip has no value for Folders because it does not present any more   information.    I also question the usefulness of having the title show again for bookmarks   in the bookmark bar (so the bookmark &quot;Baz&quot; shows &quot;Baz n   <a href="http://www.baz.org/">http://www.baz.org/</a>&quot; in the tooltip). For example the back button only   shows &quot;Click to go back  hold to see history&quot; in its tooltip instead of   something like &quot;Back Button n Click to go back  hold to see history&quot;.     </pre>
