<title>Issue 42624 -   chromium -    URLs copied from Omnibox and pasted into Pidgin may have garbage characters at the end - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Select the URL in the omnibox.  2. Press Ctrl-C to copy the text to the clipboard.  3. Change focus to the text entry window of a Pidgin chat window.  4. Paste the text.      The URL should be pasted into the text entry window as it appeared in the   omnibox  unchanged.      The URL is pasted into the text entry window as it appeared in the omnibox   with one or two extra random characters at the end.  I've observed letters    characters  and those funny boxes with tiny numbers inside that indicate   unmapped font characters &gt; 128.    Pidgin knows that the garbage characters aren't part of the URL  because   the URL is shown blue and underlined  wheras the garbage characters are   shown in the normal text color.  You can see this on the attached   screenshot; the &quot;<a href="http://blip.tv/file/3486428">http://blip.tv/file/3486428</a>&quot; is the proper URL  and the   trailing &quot;1&quot; is extra garbage.  Unfortunately this distinction is not   reflected in the URL that arrives on the far side when the message is sent    thus often resulting in unworking URLs.      <b>Please provide
