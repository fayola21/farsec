<title>Issue 39512 -   chromium -    tab contents do not appear immediately when switching between tabs  brief blank page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Load several URLs in different tabs  but do not activate the tabs yet.  2. When the webpages are loaded  switch between tabs        See the tab contents immediately after switching.      We get a blank page for a fraction of a second (like a brief flash) before we see the contents. Visually annoying. This only happens the   first time a tab is activated in a window.    Please provide
