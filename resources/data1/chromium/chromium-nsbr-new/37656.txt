<title>Issue 37656 -   chromium -    Ctrl+right arrow jumps to incorrect location on Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 (Official Build 39691) beta             Safari 4: don't know    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      1. Enter a multi-word text in a text area  2. Place your cursor somewhere at the beginning of the line  3. Press Ctrl+right arrow      On Windows  all other programs (browsers  text editors  word processors)   jump to the beginning of the next word (e.g.  &quot;|first second&quot; becomes   &quot;first |second&quot; - the &quot;|&quot; shows the current cursor location).      Chrome jumps to the end of current word  e.g.  &quot;|first second&quot; becomes   &quot;first| second&quot;    This inconsistency is annoying.   </pre>
