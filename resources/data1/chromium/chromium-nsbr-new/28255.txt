<title>Issue 28255 -   chromium -    Investigate web font download and layout performance - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/10/13/font-face-and-performance/">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/10/13/font-face-and-performance/</a>  is a great read on web font download and page rendering performance.     Firefox implemented 'FOUT' (Flash Out of Unstyled Text). While a web font  is downloaded  text is rendered with a locally available font. After it's  downloaded  it's redrawn with the downloaded web font.     Other browsers leave the area blank until the font is downloaded.    The font download time can be significant in some cases (CJK fonts) unless  either something 'clever' is done on the server-side (subsetting is one  way  but may not work always) or we (browser  chrome  webkit) come up with  something or both.     And  there are other issues (e.g. what if font download times out).        </pre>
