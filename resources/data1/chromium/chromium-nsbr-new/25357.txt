<title>Issue 25357 -   chromium -    Need to deal with non-SSL reads from shared workers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20176">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20176</a> describes an   issue with dedicated workers - non-SSL reads from dedicated workers   were not reflected in the parent window's lock icon.    We may need to do something similar for shared workers - propagate this   error around to every related window. It gets a little iffy  though - since   shared workers are only connected to windows via MessagePorts  why do   we treat SharedWorkers specially? If two arbitrary windows are connected   via a MessagePort  and one window does a non-SSL read  should that   pollute the other window too (i.e. why are we treating non-SSL reads from   a worker differently than non-SSL reads from a connected window)?    This probably impacts globalscript as well.   </pre>
