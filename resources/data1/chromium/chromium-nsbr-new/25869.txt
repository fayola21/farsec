<title>Issue 25869 -   chromium -    about:terms (Google Chrome Terms of Service) not working on Mac or Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Branded build.  2. About box.  3. Click Terms of Service.  4. about:terms opens.    Expect: it to have some terms.    Observe: nothing.  This error is logged:    [3833:2307:2388091739775:ERROR:/chrome/trunk/src/base/data_pack.c  c(108)] No resource found with id: 21192    You should be able to try this in a debug build by trying to visit   about:terms.  For Chromium  the terms are supposed to be empty  but   you'll still see the error message logged.    21192 corresponds (for me right now) to IDR_TERMS_HTML.    IDR_TERMS_HTML is defined in chrome/app/resources/locale_settings.grd.    A different .html file for each language is used for Chrome branding.    Chromioum uses terms/terms_chromium.html  a blank file. </pre>
