<title>Issue 37360 -   chromium -    [Accessibility] options&gt; offer to save password does not interupt user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Turn on Window-Eyes  2. Load Chrome  3. From toolbar&gt;options&gt;personal stuff tab  select 'offer to save   passwords' option and close window.  4. Navigate to a page requiring you to enter password (ex. gmail.com)  5. Tab to the password field  enter password  and press enter.  6. Start pressing tab to navigate the resulting page.      Offer to save password dialogue box should interupt user and require them   to select an option (yes or no) before they can further navigate through   the page.      When using Window-Eyes 7.11  the dialogue box does pop up however it does   not interupt the user. If the user tabs through the page  they will not   even run accross the dialogue box. In order to catch the dialogue box    they would first need to shift+tab once they have entered the password and   pressed enter.  When using JAWS 11.0.576  the offer to save password dialogue box cannot   be seen.    <b>Please provide
