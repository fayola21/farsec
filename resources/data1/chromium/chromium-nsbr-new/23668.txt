<title>Issue 23668 -   chromium -    Cannot open file without saving it first - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.2 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 27720)      1. Click on a link to a file (e.g. a pdf)  2. You have to immediately choose where to save the file      A window pop should pop up asking if you want to open the file without   actually saving it  or to download it and save the file permanently. There   should be an option to choose whether you would like this feature or not.      Depending on your options  either the file is immediately saved/downloaded   into your chosen directory  or you have to specify a directory  to   permanently save the file. You cannot just open the file without   permanently storing it on your disk. </pre>
