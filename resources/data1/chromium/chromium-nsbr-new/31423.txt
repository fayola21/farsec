Enter a website that has input fields  2. Notice that when pressed backspace when a field doesn't have focus   previous page is issued      At least a configurable setting to DISABLE this terrible behavior.      Brings you back to the previous page  instead deleting the character in the   non focussed field you were targetting. </pre>
