<title>Issue 41383 -   chromium -    Plugins on background tabs do not receive NPCocoaEventDrawRect after calling NPN_InvalidateRect() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   0. install Flash Player  1.run oomstring.html (attached) on tab 1  2.run <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html</a> on tab 2  3.run <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15507.html</a> on tab 3  4.select tab 1  click ��_��_��_start��_��_��_  5.wait for oomstring.swf to indicate yellow OOM triangle icon  6.select tab 2  7.select tab 3        see yellow OOM triangle icons on both tab 2 and tab 3        on at least one of tab 2 or 3 see the last image of the Player from when  its tab was obscured          when oomstring.swf exhausts memory  all Flash Player instances call  NPN_ForceRedraw() and NPN_InvalidateRect().  The Player instance on tab 1  which is visible is then called by Chrome with NPP_HandleEvent(  NPCocoaEventDrawRect ).  The obscured Player instances are not called at  that time which is acceptable.  However  when tab 2 is raised  NPP_SetWindow() is called as expected  but at times NPP_HandleEvent() is  not called.  For tab 3 nearly every time NPP_HandleEvent() is not called.   The result is the Player instances that are not called by NPP_HandleEvent()  do not update their appearance to the Player OOM icon  and the user does  not know to reload them.                  <b>Please provide
