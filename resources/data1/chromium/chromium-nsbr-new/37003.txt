<title>Issue 37003 -   chromium -    can't install extensions from chrome.google.com/extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  URLs (if applicable) : chrome.google.com/extensions        1. use 4.0.249.43 on linux  2. go to chrome.google.com/extensions  3. try to install extensions      Working installation of extensions. Clicking on the install button  and   done. Like it did until a few days ago!      There's a message &quot;Extensions are not yet supported in this version of   Google Chrome.&quot;  which is bogus  because I'm using alot of extensions right   now  and could use the site until not long ago. No problems at all  until   now.    This version is basically the equivilant of the stable windows version. I'm   completly satisfied with it  used it many weeks and didn't have a single   problem with it. Going to the newer (5.0.x) versions of the beta-channel or   dev-channel (and even the later 4.0.x dev versions) is no option for me   whatsoever  I need something that works(tm).  I know my chrome is perfectly suitable to use extensions  so why exclude   me? Why force me to use an unstable version. Yes  this is also a beta  but   trust me  there is a huge  huge difference between this &quot;beta&quot; and the   newer &quot;betas&quot; and &quot;dev&quot; versions.    I even tried to write an extension that fixes the   chrome.google.com/extensions site for me. But it seems extensions are   completly blocked on this site. On all other sites  even https my extension   can work  but not this one.    This is not acceptable. </pre>
