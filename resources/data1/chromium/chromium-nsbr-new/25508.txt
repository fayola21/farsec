<title>Issue 25508 -   chromium -    Unfortunate translation of &quot;N Tabs&quot; in the New Tab Page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Russian      4.0.222.12 (Official Build 29069)      Windows XP      The plural for &quot;N Tabs&quot; is translated as &quot;___�ܕ�__��___ _____��__��__��_____: N&quot;. The   translation does not fit into its region  so only the ridiculous &quot;___�ܕ�__��___   _____��__��__��_____:&quot; (which means &quot;Tab count:&quot;) is visible to the user (and there is   no immediate workaround to turn &quot;N&quot; visible).   </pre>
