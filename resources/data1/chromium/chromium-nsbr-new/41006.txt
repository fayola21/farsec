<title>Issue 41006 -   chromium -    CheckmarksTask Manager&amp;apos;s contextual menu does not toggle checkbox for displayed/hidden columns - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome OS Version : &lt; ChromeOS 0.6.39.0-3c3739ae&gt;  Chrome Version : &lt;Google Chrome 5.0.372.0-43941&gt;  Type of computer : &lt;  EeePC &gt;    Task Manager window displays and hides certain columns by default. The  displayed columns have a checkmark next to the column name in the  contextual menu that appears when you right-click on white space in window.  However  choosing a column name in the contextual menu does not toggle this  checkmark on/off.      1. Login  and press Shift-Esc to display Task Manager window.  2. Right-click anywhere on a white part of the window to display the  contextual menu. Note which column names have checkmarks next to them.  3. Choose any column name from the contextual menu.  4. Repeat step 2  and examine the menu. Note that checkmarks haven't   changed.      Choosing a column name should toggle the checkmark on/off  and display/hide  the corresponding column in the Task Manager window.    Instead  though the columns are correctly shown/hidden  the checkmarks are  not toggled to correspond to the shown/hidden state. </pre>
