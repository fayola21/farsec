<title>Issue 38707 -   chromium -    Google Chrome &amp; vsftpd 2.2.0 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.307.11 beta  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Linux 2.6.31-14-server Ubuntu Server  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64 GNU/Linux  Window manager: GNOME 2.28    Behavior in Linux Firefox: it gives &quot;530 Login incorrect&quot; answer &amp; stops to  connect  vsftp.log:  Fri Mar 19 23:22:31 2010 [pid 2] CONNECT: Client &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  Fri Mar 19 23:22:33 2010 [pid 1] [firefox] FAIL LOGIN: Client &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;    Behavior in Linux Chrome (if you have access to it):  it gives no answer  continues to connect and takes over 50% CPU  never stops  vsftp.log:  Fri Mar 19 23:21:24 2010 [pid 2] CONNECT: Client &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  Fri Mar 19 23:21:26 2010 [pid 1] [chromium] FAIL LOGIN: Client &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;  Fri Mar 19 23:21:29 2010 [pid 2] CONNECT: Client &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;      1. Try ftp://chromium:-password@127.0.0.1/ with right or wrong ftp user and  right or wrong password. Chromium gives an authentication dialog.  2. Type any wrong user and password or don't type at all and click Enter  3. Take the result.      it gives &quot;530 Login incorrect&quot; answer      it eats &gt; 50% CPU  never gives answer or stops    vsftpd.conf:  # Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf  #  # The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file  # loosens things up a bit  to make the ftp daemon more usable.  # Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.  #  # READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.  # Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's  # capabilities.  #  #  # Run standalone?  vsftpd can run either from an inetd or as a standalone  # daemon started from an initscript.  listen=YES  #  # Run standalone with IPv6?  # Like the listen parameter  except vsftpd will listen on an IPv6 socket  # instead of an IPv4 one. This parameter and the listen parameter are mutually  # exclusive.  #listen_ipv6=YES  #  # Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out).  anonymous_enable=YES  no_anon_password=YES  anon_root=/home/trupanka/ftp/anonymous  anon_upload_enable=NO  anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO  anon_other_write_enable=NO  anon_umask=000  #  # Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.  local_enable=YES  chroot_local_user=YES  local_umask=044  #  # Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.  #write_enable=YES  #  # Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022   # if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)  #local_umask=022  #  # Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only  # has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also  you will  # obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.  #anon_upload_enable=YES  #  # Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create  # new directories.  #anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES  #  # Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they  # go into a certain directory.  dirmessage_enable=YES  #  # If enabled  vsftpd will display directory listings with the time  # in  your  local  time  zone.

Not enabling it   # however  may confuse older FTP clients.  #async_abor_enable=YES  #  # By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore  # the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII  # mangling on files when in ASCII mode.  # Beware that on some FTP servers  ASCII support allows a denial of service  # attack (DoS) via the command &quot;SIZE /big/file&quot; in ASCII mode. vsftpd  # predicted this attack and has always been safe  reporting the size of the  # raw file.  # ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.  #ascii_upload_enable=YES  #ascii_download_enable=YES  #  # You may fully customise the login banner string:  #ftpd_banner=Welcome to blah FTP service.  #  # You may specify a file of disallowed anonymous e-mail addresses.

If chroot_local_user is YES  then this list becomes a list of  # users to NOT chroot().  #chroot_local_user=YES  #chroot_list_enable=YES  # (default follows)  #chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list  #  # You may activate the &quot;-R&quot; option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by  # default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large  # sites. However  some broken FTP clients such as &quot;ncftp&quot; and &quot;mirror&quot; assume  # the presence of the &quot;-R&quot; option  so there is a strong case for enabling it.  #ls_recurse_enable=YES  #  #  # Debian customization  #  # Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit the Debian filesystem layout by  # default.  These settings are more Debian-friendly.  #  # This option should be the name of a directory which is empty.  Also  the  # directory should not be writable by the ftp user.
