<title>Issue 34305 -   chromium -    Cookie manager selects wrong cookie sometimes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The cookie manager still selects the wrong cookie on click every now and   then.   Repro:    1. Have my set of cookies  2. Search for &quot;ap&quot; (screenie 1)  3. Reveal &quot;developer.apple.com&quot; (screenie 2)  4. Click &quot;developer.apple.com&quot;    Expected: Should be selected  Actual: Another cookie opens and is selected instead (screenie 3).    (Also  why is no data shown for localstorage?)    See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33248#c8">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33248#c8</a> for   screenshots. </pre>
