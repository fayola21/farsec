<title>Issue 45006 -   chromium -    Hungarian and Bulgarian Chrome should set spell check language to Hungarian/Bulgarian by default - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55      4.1 doesn't have a Hungarian spell checker  while 5.0 at least has it. So on   updating 4.1 to 5.0 stable  it should change the language of the spell   checker to Hungarian; at least if Chrome's UI language is set to Hungarian   and/or on the top of the language preferences list is Hungarian (Hungary).      It leaves the settings on the default US English. </pre>
