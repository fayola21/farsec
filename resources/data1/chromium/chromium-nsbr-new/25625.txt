<title>Issue 25625 -   chromium -    Implement Chrome Keyboard Access for all toolbars.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need a more coherent story for accessing various toolbars. The current   toolbars that exist right now are:    - Toolbar  - Bookmark bar  - Extension bar  - More in the future     Once a toolbar has focus via ALT+SHIFT+T  we can press TAB (TAB+SHIT for   reverse) to traverse between the toolbars. Once we are in the toolbar in   choice  we can press the arrow keys to traverse its children. </pre>
