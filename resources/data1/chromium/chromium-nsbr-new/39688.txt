<title>Issue 39688 -   chromium -    crashes when moving  deleting and renaming bookmark folders - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): Chromium 5.0.342.7 (0)  Is this the most recent version: yes  OS + version: Gentoo/Funtoo  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  Window manager: wmii      1. Open Bookmark Manager  2. Remove  rename or delete folders        The requested action should always be performed.        Often it works but at least one in every five times Chromium crashes (not   responsive anymore).    Even when these actions succeed I get many (can't scroll that far up in my   terminal) errors like this (it's always the same error  repeated many   times).    [23416:23416:19096942439:ERROR:chrome/app/chrome_dll_main.cc(233)] Gtk:   gtk_tree_store_iter_next: assertion `iter-&gt;stamp == GTK_TREE_STORE   (tree_model)-&gt;stamp' failed   </pre>
