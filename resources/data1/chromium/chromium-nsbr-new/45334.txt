<title>Issue 45334 -   chromium -    Policies need to exist in a manifest file - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For MCX  applications can ship with a manifest file  which is a  plist-formatted file that describes the different policies that the  application supports  documenting names  valid values  and a human-readable  description of what the policy means.    At first we can just maintain the xml file manually  but eventually we  should auto-generate it from the same list as the ConfigurationPolicyStore   and perhaps keep it localized in multiple languages. </pre>
