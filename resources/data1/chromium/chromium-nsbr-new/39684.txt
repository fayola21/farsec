<title>Issue 39684 -   chromium -    Serbian latin offered as Croatian - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Serbian latin    5.0.342.7 beta    Ubuntu 9.10 Linux  buy same on any OS    Serbian latin websites are being prompted for translation as if they are   Croatian. This is WERY wrong and annoying because I can not explain to my   customers (I am web developer) why are their sites treated as Croatian   sites. I realize that it is difficult to distinguish between these   languages  but offering wrong suggestion can be even offensive to some   people.    As a developer I would like to have an option to correct this situation. It   could be some information  that I can put in HTML of my sites  that google   can understand  or setting site language via configuration on your   webmaster tools.    Regards   Stamat </pre>
