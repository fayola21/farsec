<title>Issue 24831 -   chromium -    Fix pdf generation in RenderViewTest.OnPrintPages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When running RenderViewTest.OnPrintPages on the Mac we get the   following console spew:    .../src/printing/pdf_metafile_mac.cc(98)] Metafile context has 1 extra   retain(s) on Close  failed to find start of cross-reference table.  .../src/printing/pdf_metafile_mac.cc(134)] Unable to create PDF document   from data    I added a bit of debugging logging  and it turns out that WebKit's printPage   is causing an extra retain on the context--but only in this one test. It   doesn't cause the test to fail  since that test is just for message handling    but it's worrying that there's a case where printPages can hold on to the   context despite the local autorelease pool around it. </pre>
