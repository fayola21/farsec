<title>Issue 31853 -   chromium -    unload event not working in ChromeFrame - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> As reported by someone else in  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-frame/browse_thread/thread/168942703a68dde8?pli=1">http://groups.google.com/group/google-chrome-frame/browse_thread/thread/168942703a68dde8?pli=1</a>  and also observed by my colleagues and I  'unload' events do not fire in  ChromeFame.    ChromeFrame version: 4.0.266.0 build 33992 webkit 532.6 V8: 2.0.3.1    Related URL(s): <a href="https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html">https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html</a>    This URL serves the following HTML:    &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body onunload=&quot;alert('am I fired on unload?');&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt; Navigating away from this page should cause an alert to fire.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;        1. Navigate to cf:<a href="https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html">https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html</a> using ChromeFrame  2. Navigate to another site. No alert is issued.  3. Navigate to <a href="https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html">https://demo01.workbooks.com/unload.html</a> using another browser  4. Navigate to another site. An alert is issued  as expected.      In both cases an alert should be shown.      No alert is shown when ChromeFrame is used.   </pre>
