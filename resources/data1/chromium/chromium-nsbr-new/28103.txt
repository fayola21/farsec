<title>Issue 28103 -   chromium -    mailto:  possibly other external uri's aren't opened correctly with no DE - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run a linux system without a DE (no GNOME KDE XFCE)  2. Set chromium as the default browser and start chromium     ( e.g. BROWSER=chromium-browser chromium-browser )  3. Click on a mailto link in chromium      Opens an new email in some reasonable program (a MUA for mailto: or opens   a configuration window. At least it should allow for some method of   configuration so that a MUA or other reasonable program can be opened.      Nothing visibly. What happens internally is chromium calls xdg-open  which    seeing that there is no DE running  calls $BROWSER $1  trying to open the   mailto uri back in chromium  which instead appears to do nothing.      <b>Please provide
