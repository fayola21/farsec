Launch Developer tools with Ctrl+Shift+I      EITHER:  &quot;Inspect element&quot; in the context menu should be enabled  since the   developer tools including the DOM inspector work fine  OR:  Developer tools should be properly disabled for special pages if there is   some reason to discourage users from using them      The DOM inspector works fine  but the &quot;Inspect element&quot; button is disabled   on the page context menu. </pre>
