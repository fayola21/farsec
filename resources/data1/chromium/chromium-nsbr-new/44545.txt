<title>Issue 44545 -   chromium -    ui_tests can handle individual tests better  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please take a look at  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/5305/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Linux%20Tests%20(valgrind)(3)/builds/5305/steps/valgrind%20test:%20ui/logs/stdio</a>    All the tests were failing in a couple of seconds due to Valgrind suppression  typos but the ui_tests were still waiting quite a lot of time for each test to start.  Can we check if the test has actually failed on start instead of waiting?    Also  it looks like a few browser wrappers can exist at the same time   - do we wait for the tests to shut down before starting the next test?    [cc'ing random people who have modified chrome/test/ui/ui_test.cc recently] </pre>
