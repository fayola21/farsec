Trying to make <a title="Win7 - Second icon spawns on superbar when Chromium is launched from pinned superbar icon" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28104"> issue 28104 </a> work  I uninstalled Chrome  Installed Chromium    copied appdata info around a bit  installed this one again (and gave up on   that one) and now I noticed my bookmarks weren't synced with my office and   laptop.    When I open the &quot;Sync my bookmarks&quot; login screen  the 'Email:' field reads   'undefined'. I change it to my google login... But it never signs in. I   tried with the whole email as well to no avail. </pre>
