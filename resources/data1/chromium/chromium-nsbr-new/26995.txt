<title>Issue 26995 -   chromium -    App icon looks like stuck throbber on Vista - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> on vista  4.0.237.0    I don't know how to reproduce  but currently my system icon for chrome is   stuck on the throbber. By system icon  I mean the icon that shows up when you   hit alt-tab  the icon in the task bar at the bottom  and the icon on the top   left of child windows (e.g. the about window).    It's not moving  it's just stuck there. I was just surfing the web normally   when it happened. </pre>
