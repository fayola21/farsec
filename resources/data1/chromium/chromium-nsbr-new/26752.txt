<title>Issue 26752 -   chromium -    Subfolders doesn't have folder icons on BMB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: Macintosh-0017f2d64524.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L27)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.229.1 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30964">r30964</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.32      1. Launch chrome. Add a new folder on BMB. ( Folder on BMB icon gets a folder icon )  2. Create subfolders to the previously created folder via &quot;Add Page&quot; ( from contextual menu )  3. View the Bookmark folders hierarchy from BMB ( Screen shot-1 attached )    Actual: Show Generic folder icons for all subfolders over the hierarchy on BMB    What is the expected output?    or How Windows and LInux behave ?    Folder icons are shown through out for all the subfolders on BMB    Do we see the folder icons from the chrome system menu bar ?  On Chrome system menu bar folder icons are not shown for both ( parent and sub folders )  ( Screen shot-2 attached for reference ) </pre>
