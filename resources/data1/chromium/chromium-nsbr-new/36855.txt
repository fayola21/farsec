<title>Issue 36855 -   chromium -    Find links in page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Feature request: Be able to launch find in page that only searches anchor   text. All ui is the same  except that plain text on the page isn't searched.    Firefox has this feature  available via ' (apostrophe). It makes keyboard   navigation a lot easier.    I propose ctrl-shift-f as the accelerator. </pre>
