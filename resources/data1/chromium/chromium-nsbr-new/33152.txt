<title>Issue 33152 -   chromium -    Add checksum calculation to the &quot;Downloads&quot; page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Please add a functionality to calculate a checksum of a downloaded file.  Since diffenent hash algorithms are in use (sha1 and md5)  there should be   something like a drop-down list. Also there is no need to calculate sum for   each download.  AFAIK  the are no other browsers providing this functionality and amazing   chromium will be the first of kind. </pre>
