<title>Issue 28792 -   chromium -    Year-2038 problems on Linux and disabled FTP test - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/372044">http://codereview.chromium.org/372044</a>. The FTP test which has this   problem is currently disabled on Linux (just one test case).    I tried to fix this by using upstream NSPR time handling  but I must have done   something wrong because it didn't fix the issue. </pre>
