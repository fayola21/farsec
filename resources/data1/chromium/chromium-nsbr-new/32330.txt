<title>Issue 32330 -   chromium -    Inability to scroll at all when fixed height  overflow:auto and anchor links are used together - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38 (Official Build 34131)  URLs (if applicable) : TBD (Need to upload the repro html first)  Other browsers tested: This only affects Chrome AFAIK              The symptom is that when going to a page with a hash ref (anchor link)  the   page will be unable to scroll at all. This is all methods of scrolling I   know about: PgUp/PgDown  scroll wheel  clicking on the scroll bar  or   trying to drag the scroll slider. In particular  the scroll slider lights   up to indicate that you're dragging it  but it won't actually move. There   are some workaround to unfreeze the window  below. This happens 100% of the   time for me with a particular internal webapp that I cannot link to.   However  I am uploading a minimal webpage that repros the problem  and will   create the proper link in a followup.    The test case is minimal  in that it tries to have the bare necessities to   surface the bug. The required elements are the div with both a fixed height   and &quot;overflow: auto &quot; and following an anchor link to the page. Without all   three of those  the bug does not surface. The fixed size div might seem   abnormally small (or large) depending on your window size  but the bug   still happens even if there is a second scroll bar for the overall page.    This bug only repros for some users. For users that it affects  it happens   100% reliably  for everyone else it never happens. It has been seen in the   wild on both Linux and Windows. It is not recent  but has been happening   for the past year. It has persisted for me across two different machines.    Some things fix the bug (temporarily)  while others don't:  * Clicking on the page does *not* fix it.  * Any drag  no matter how slight  *does* fix it. This includes drag-  selection. This can lead to thinking that the click behavior is   flaky/random  but careful clicking without moving the mouse makes it clear   what's going on.  * Switching to another tab and coming back does *not* fix it.  * But switching to another tab  coming back  and clicking *does* fix it.   (No need to drag)  * Page reload *does* fix it.  * Going to the same URL (CTRL-L then Enter) does *not* fix it. In fact  it   will *re-break* it. (Good for testing!)  * Tabbing to a link *does* fix it.  * Double clicking and triple clicking do *not* fix it. (You have to have a   very steady hand to see this.)  * But  if some text has been selected via a double or triple click    extending the selection with shift+arrows *does* fix it.  * Resizing the page  even to the point where there is an additional   scrollbar  does *not* fix the bug.  * But  if there is a second scrollbar for the overall page  dragging or   clicking on it *does* fix the bug. </pre>
