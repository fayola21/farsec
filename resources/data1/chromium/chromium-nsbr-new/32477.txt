<title>Issue 32477 -   chromium -    Content scripts run multiple times on ebay.com - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884) unstable  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.ebay.com">http://www.ebay.com</a>      1. Install the attached extension  2. Visit yahoo.com  3. Visit ebay.com        You get no alert messages.        At ebay.com  you get 5 alert messages saying &quot;We have run more than once.&quot;          My manifest.json just runs one file  one.js  at document_start:    {    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;AdBlock&quot;  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.2.80&quot;      &quot;permissions&quot;: [ &quot;http://*/* &quot;https://*/* ]     &quot;content_scripts&quot;: [      {        &quot;matches&quot;: [&quot;http://*/* &quot;https://*/*&quot;        &quot;js&quot;: [ &quot;one.js&quot; ]         &quot;run_at&quot;: &quot;document_start&quot;      }    ]  }      one.js just verifies that it has not been run multiple times:    if (typeof nonexistent != &quot;undefined&quot;)    alert(&quot;We have run more than once.&quot;);  nonexistent = &quot;Now I exist  but no one should ever notice.&quot;;      This bug breaks AdBlock's blacklisting UI on ebay.com  because a   dispatching system that registers a certain callback gets blown away by a   subsequent load of the script  so the callback is never run.  I have worked   around the problem in 2 places  but am uneasy about whether other parts of   my code rely on only running once.    I have attached a zip of the extension that reproduces the problem. </pre>
