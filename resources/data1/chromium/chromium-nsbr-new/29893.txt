<title>Issue 29893 -   chromium -    Installer Stuck at Downloading - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I had chrome installed  updated to the dev channel  and now I want to switch   back to stable. I uninstalled chrome leaving my settings in place. Now if I   try to run the normal installer  it gets stuck at Downloading Google Chrome.   I was able to download and install it using the standalone installer  and if   I go to about it shows an update available  but gets stuck at installing.    Windows 7 Pro 64 bit </pre>
