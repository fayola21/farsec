<title>Issue 23282 -   chromium -    Can't import Fx bookmark keywords with %s in non-query-params section - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   i have no problem with keyworded bookmarks when im trying to do a search.    for example       <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=news+%s">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=news+%s</a>  is a perfectly good bookmark for searching google news.  however  attempting to add a keyworded bookmark directly -- or importing bookmarks   from firefox -- that have a %s anywhere in a url that isnt _after_ a '?'   doesnt work      being able to have a keyword that puts your input _anywhere_ into the url   where youve added a '%s'  not just after a '?'      it is somehow an illegal operation; when attempting to import from firefox   it just ignores the offending bookmark  and when attempting to 'add page'   it just gives that red background and the 'ok' button becomes grayed out    <b>Please provide
