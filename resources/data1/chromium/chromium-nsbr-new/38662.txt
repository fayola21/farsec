<title>Issue 38662 -   chromium -    Chrome thumbnails on taskbar in W7 missing icon (and too many items shown) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On trunk  when I open Chrome  it restores my last session  which has only   chrome://extensions open.    In this case I see I have *two* items in the taskbar  when only one tab is   open and the Chrome icon is missing from the taskbar.    See screenshot. </pre>
