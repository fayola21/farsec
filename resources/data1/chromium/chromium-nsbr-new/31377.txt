<title>Issue 31377 -   chromium -    Resizing monitor can leave app unresponsive due to off-screen alert dialog - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Set up Calendar with an event in the near future.  2. Wait until that time  and leave the alert up.  3. Connect to your (Vista) machine by Windows Remote Desktop  using a virtual   monitor that's considerably smaller than your real monitor.  4. See that Chrome is properly resized to fit in the window  but the alert is   now stranded offscreen. The apparent symptom is that Chrome completely stops   responding with no indication why. Even right-clicking on its taskbar button   does nothing.  5. Press return to dismiss the invisible dialog and &quot;unlock&quot; the app. (This   part is expected  and mentioned only as a helpful hint.)    I expect that the same thing happens with any alert  since they're all   equally app-modal. </pre>
