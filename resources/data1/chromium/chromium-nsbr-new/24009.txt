<title>Issue 24009 -   chromium -    [CF Full Mode] &quot;x-clock&quot; should be replaced by &quot;chromeframe&quot; in IE's user-agent in CF's released build - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Prerequisites:    Chrome Frame full-mode has been installed correctly    Chrome Frame Version:    4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)    Steps:    1. In IE  go to <a href="http://whatsmyuseragent.com/">http://whatsmyuseragent.com/</a>    Issue:    In the user-agent string of a released version  &quot;x-clock&quot; should not be  there  but currently both &quot;x-clock&quot; and &quot;chromeframe&quot; are there  joshia on September 22 2009 09:10  (New)  Notes  This is probably an artifact of the old installer  'x-clock' will be there  if the registry value is not removed. Does this happen on a clean machine?  mdu on September 22 2009 11:28  (New)  Notes  This doesn't happen on a clean machine.    But before I install 4.0.211.7  I have uninstalled the older vesion  I  think the 'x-clock' should be removed if we uninstall that older version of  chromeframe </pre>
