<title>Issue 26182 -   chromium -    Hung browser in Mac OS X - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I don't know what the repro steps for this is. I simply tried switching to Chrome and found that it   was hung  so I had to force quit it.    Attached is the hang report that should contain the thread callstacks. Perhaps someone with some   know-how and the symbols could take a look and see if there is anobvious deadlock.    I am using the dev channel. Relaunching after the hang shows my version to be:    4.0.223.11 (Official Build 29902) </pre>
