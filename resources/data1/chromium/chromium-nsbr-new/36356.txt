<title>Issue 36356 -   chromium -    Page shouldn't be redirected when refreshed  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): 5.0.322.2 dev  Is this the most recent version: Yes  OS + version: Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64  Window manager: Gnome/Openbox  URLs (if relevant): <a href="http://concursos.correioweb.com.br/">http://concursos.correioweb.com.br/</a>  Behavior in Linux Firefox: Same problem  Behavior in Windows Chrome (if you have access to it): Not tested  Obs: Opera browser works as expected.      1. Go to: <a href="http://concursos.correioweb.com.br/">http://concursos.correioweb.com.br/</a>  2. Please look the screenshot uploaded here to see where you need to click:   F��__rumCW  3. When you hover the mouse on F��__rumCW you can see on screenshot that the   address on status bar ends with /forum/  4. Click on F��__rumCW you will be redirected to a new page. Obs: The omnibox   show the address without the /forum/       I think the /forum/ should appear on the url address.  Why: If I refresh the page I'll not be redirected to other page.      If I refresh the page I'm redirected to the page where I clicked on F��__rumCW    Obs: On Opera Browser doesn't appear the /forum/ on the url address  but If   I refresh the page I will NOT be redirected to another page. (So Opera   browser it's the only one that works as expected) </pre>
