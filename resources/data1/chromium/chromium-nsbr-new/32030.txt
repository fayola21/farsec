<title>Issue 32030 -   chromium -    Cookie manager should dynamically update its elements when clear browsing data on cookies performed. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.295.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=35884">r35884</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 90.3.1    Flash Player: 10.0.42.34    Precondition: Make sure we have few cookies stored in computer.      1. Go Chrome--&gt;Preferences--&gt;Under the hood-&gt;&quot;Show cookies and website permissions&quot;  2. Chrome --&gt;Clear Browsing data.   3. Make sure we select the &quot;Delete cookies&quot; option and        Clear data for this period--&gt;choose &quot;Everything&quot;  3. Verify the opened Cookie's list.    Actual: Cookies stays in the cookie manager's list even after clearing the cookies. It doesn't update dynamically. Closing and   reopening of the cookie manager updates it.    Expected: Should update dynamically when [Clear browsing data --&gt;Cookies--&gt;Everything] performed.    Note: Cant compare the same scenario in other platforms  Since Cookie manager UI and Clear browsing data UI cant be   viewed at same time. This is Mac-Specific.  </pre>
