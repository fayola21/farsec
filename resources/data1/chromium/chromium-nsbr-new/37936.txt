<title>Issue 37936 -   chromium -    Notifications (at least in Windows) should be dismissed with a right-click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 (Official Build 40685) dev      1. Generate a notification in Chrome (by using the Gentle Reminders lab in   Google Calendar  for instance)  2. Right-click anywhere in the notification.      The notification should close.      Nothing happens.    It is standard Windows functionality to close notifications using the   right-click menu. It becomes such a habit by power users that notifications   which ignore right-clicks become frustrating.   </pre>
