<title>Issue 35117 -   chromium -    Emacs key binding ctrl-b doesn't work in web page when using Arabic keyboard layout. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1.Enable emacs gtk key theme.   2.open www.google.com and input something in the search box.  3.Switch to Arabic keyboard layout  4.Try to press ctrl-f and ctrl-b in the search box to move cursor.      The cursor should be moved forwards or backwards. But instead  ctrl-b opens   the bookmark bar. Other key bindings seem work correctly  except ctrl-b and   ctrl-shift-b.    ctrl-f and ctrl-b work correctly in omnibox.         </pre>
