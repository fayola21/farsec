<title>Issue 40633 -   chromium -    Address bar keyboard navigation using alt differs between punctuation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.7 beta  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Alt + Left/Right moves between periods  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Alt + Left/Right moves between periods        1. Visit a site with a complex url eg. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?</a>  template=Defect%20on%20Mac%20OS  2. Activate the address bar [cmd + l]  3. Use alt + left/right to navigate the address for editing        The caret should move between the full stops (US. periods? - i think that's it  i'm British so it's full   stop) allowing you to move to specific places in the URL. Which is to be expected as the entire   operating system behaves like this in respect to punctuation and keyboard navigation.        The caret will happily move from the end of http:// to the following forward slash. This sounds   like a labour saving feature for people but it actually means that i have to make effort to either:    1) struggle with a mouse - i'm physically impaired and rarely touch the mouse at my desk  2) tap tap tap tap tap with the left and right keys - once again the physical impairment means   that i'm in pain and pissed off    Granted  it's my fault for getting the URL wrong. My worst mistakes are typing .co.uk when it's   .org.uk or .gov.uk that I intended. It's just the inability to do something as simple as alt + shift +   right to select a portion of a url to delete that means that as a keyboard user I'm constantly   dreaming of Safari (which just doesn't offer all the features I'd want in a browser but at least   obeys the very basic of keyboard navigation on a Mac </pre>
