You may see window #3 momentarily raised when #1 is clicked (if so  Alt  Tab will show that #3 is the window alt tab will go to  instead of #2 as  expected/desired)  7. If you don't see the behaviour in 6  try clicking on #3  #2  #1 again.        The &quot;alt-tab&quot; order of google chrome windows should be according to the  reverse order you click on them and other windows.        In some cases a different chrome window is raised first when you click on a  different app's taskbar button after clicking on a chrome window's taskbar  button.    <b>Please provide
