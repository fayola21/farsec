<title>Issue 43423 -   chromium -    Disable UI features for changing the homepage when homepage is managed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When the homepage setting is controlled by policy (this will be available  once the upcoming enterprise configuration management work is done)  the  user is no longer allowed to change the homepage settings.    This affects the following features:  a. Options dialog  b. New tab page: Make this my homepage tip  c. Gtk Toolbar: Drag URL to home button  d. sync  e. profile imports from other browsers    I guess for b  c and e  I think it's best do just disable the feature (i.e.  remove the UI and don't do anything). I'm unsure what to do about sync and  the options dialog. For the options dialog  we could just disable the  widgets relevant to editing the homepage (see attached screenshot how this  would look like). Maybe put a note that states the reason for them not  being allowed to edit the homepage (and possibly other policy-managed  preferences in the future). Ideas? </pre>
