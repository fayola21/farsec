<title>Issue 44497 -   chromium -    Expose gtest's filter-matching API so that external program can utilize it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In some situations (like the out-of-proc testings in chromium) external   programs want to get a list of tests in prior to (or without) running the   actual tests.  Today we can get the list via UnitTest::GetTestCase but it doesn't take the   filtering (can be specified by --gtest_filter) into account  and gtest is   not exposing APIs for external programs to do the same filtering.    If gtest exposes the API (filtering API with the given gtest_filter flag   and/or a complete listing API that excludes filtered tests) to external   programs they can utilize the gtest in a more flexible / extended way.   </pre>
