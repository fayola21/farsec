<title>Issue 26263 -   chromium -    PDF opened in-browser show only the first page  not giving an option to zoom in or scroll. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    OS version               : 10.6.1    Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Click on a link to PDF file:   <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf</a>      Either open the file as attachment in the default application for the file   type  or embed it properly inside the browser.      The first page of the PDF shows up in a fit-to-window mode. There aren't   any standard operation: scroll  zoom  search  etc. The workaround is to   right click the link to the pdf  saving it  and opening the file manually.   </pre>
