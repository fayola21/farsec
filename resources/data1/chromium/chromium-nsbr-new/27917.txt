<title>Issue 27917 -   chromium -    Linux: cannot drag a file into a file input element to get it sent via XHR.send - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To repro  do the following:  1. Add the event listener for change event for a file input element.   2. Drag a file into the file input element.  3. When change event fires  get the file object out of the file input  element and send it via XHR.send().    It does not work on Linux. This should be fixed so that file drag-in could  work on all platforms. </pre>
