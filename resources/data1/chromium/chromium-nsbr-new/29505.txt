<title>Issue 29505 -   chromium -    Undo after deleting or editing text in a note doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Navigate to <a href="http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/">http://webkit.org/demos/sticky-notes/</a>  2. Create a note  3. Type something in the note created  4. Using backspace  delete/edit the content  5. Undo the changes using Ctrl+Z    What is the expected output?   Undo should happen and it should happen backwards    What do you see instead?  Either it doesn't work or the whole content itself will be cleared       </pre>
