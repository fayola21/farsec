<title>Issue 44522 -   chromium -    Implement a git push hook to push the git hash relationship to aebuild - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is the aebuild part.    Declare something like that:    class git(db.Model):    hash = db.StringProperty(required=True)    repo = db.StringProperty(required=True)    parent = db.StringProperty(required=True)    It's be nice if 'hash' was also the entity's key. We can do that in Java   but I don't know how to do that in python.    Then implement the receiver for this data similar to status_listener but   much simpler. </pre>
