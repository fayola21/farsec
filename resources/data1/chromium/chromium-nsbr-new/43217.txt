<title>Issue 43217 -   chromium -    Bookmark button spacing in bookmark bar is suddenly very wide.  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm running 5.0.375.29 (Official Build 46008) beta for Mac OSX.    Until today  all my bookmarks in the bookmarks bar were tightly spaced together.  I had just the   icon for the pages (no text)  and all of them were left-justified with very little space between   them.    Today I opened chrome and there is a lot of space between each button.  They are no longer   tightly spaced  which means that to see all of the bookmark buttons I essentially need to   maximize the window  and half of them get collapsed out of the screen.  If I want to see them I   have to click the double expansion arrow on the right.    I want to go back to the way it was:  All the bookmark buttons in the bookmark bar tightly   spaced so that I can see them without a fully maximized window.     Image attached.    Expected result:  For the buttons to be the way they used to be; i.e. close together.  At a   minimum they should collapse and expand with the window rather than fold into the double   arrows.   </pre>
