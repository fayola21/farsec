<title>Issue 23791 -   chromium -    Double-clicking app window icon should close it - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't support the standard Windows &quot;double-click to close&quot; functionality   on our main window's upper left corner because there's no icon there.  On app   windows  there is an icon  and we should do this.    Note that fixing <a title="Consider using standard system frame for app shortcut windows" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23789"> bug 23789 </a> would give us this for free. </pre>
