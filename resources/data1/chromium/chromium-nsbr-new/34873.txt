<title>Issue 34873 -   chromium -    View source reload problem  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Send some XML via a web form  quite a simple POST form.  2.receive a XML response and do view source  3.from now on  reloading will rarely send the form data to the server    however it will make a request to the server  with no POST information    which means the request of course fails.      The expected result was an XML properly formatted  returned by the server    which the server indicates it does initially  however the browser  seems to   do a reload  with no POST information  and thus generates an application   error from the server.    The same web page does not cause problems in firefox 3.5+        The server returns an error saying that the POST field is not set  and   internal examination of the server logs indicates  that neither GET  nor   POST information was transmitted to the server  thus the request should   fail  from the servers point of view  but the browser has failed to operate   as expected.      <b>Please provide
