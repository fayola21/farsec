<title>Issue 39004 -   chromium -    Notifications' dismiss option not visible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pasting from <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Calendar/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Calendar/thread?</a>  tid=50e946e863f738d7&amp;hl=en:    I am using Chrome on Windows 7 and I have enabled floating desktop   notifications.  Everything appears to be working correctly  except for one   problem.  I have my windows taskbar at the top of my screen and this causes   the desktop notification window to not display the dismiss option.  So  the   only way to get rid of the notification is to close Chrome completely. </pre>
