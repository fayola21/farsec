<title>Issue 42962 -   chromium -    Install from disk image followups - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Parts 2-4 carried over from <a title="Install from disk image followups" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40265"> bug 40265 </a> as post-M5 work. (Parts 1 and 5 were fixed for M5.)    2. Update from disk image. If Chrome is already installed  and the installed version is older than   the running version  offer to update the installed version. Some speculative strings for this were   checked in.    3. (If needed.) Better control of who's running. The relaunched installed process may want to   wait for the parent to exit early on in its main  before attempting to use the profile or anything.    4. (Maybe.) Try to eject the disk image after relaunch?    And a new part 6:    6. The installed copy  when launched  is not in the foreground. It should start in the foreground   if the original copy that did the installation was in the foreground when it completed the   installation. This may dovetail with part 3. </pre>
