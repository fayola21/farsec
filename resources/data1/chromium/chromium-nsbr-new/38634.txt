<title>Issue 38634 -   chromium -    356 unstable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818) dev                  This version of chrome is extremely unstable. First of all - some artifacts   on the + sign (to add a tab)  also a lot of pages just freezes  only   closing the tab and reopening helps. Also new ordering is really bad(each   tab is represented as a separate chrome window). Until this version chrome   worked fine.... </pre>
