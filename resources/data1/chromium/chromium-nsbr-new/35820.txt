<title>Issue 35820 -   chromium -    Duplicate Stored Passwords - Not Overwritten - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Store Password after completing user name and agree to save password  2. Return at a later date  and accidentally change a character in the   password and login  3. This seems to have saved a new password    What is the expected result? It should ask if I want to store the new   password  if I agree  overwrite the old one with the new one    What happens instead? 2 identical usernames  2 different passwords and it   then prevents me from logging in until I remove stored passwords and start   again      <b>Please provide
