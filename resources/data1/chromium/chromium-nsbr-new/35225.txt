<title>Issue 35225 -   chromium -    Display Current Version Download/Install Date In About - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : All  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A      1. Go to the &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; dialog.      I would like to see both the current version and the date/time it was   updated on my computer.  I think this would be helpful to let users know   when their version of Chrome was last updated. For instance:    &quot;4.0.249.78 beta (36714)&quot;  &quot;Last Updated: Feb 9  2010&quot;      I just see the current version. </pre>
