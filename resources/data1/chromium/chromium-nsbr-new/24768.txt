<title>Issue 24768 -   chromium -    test_shell needs support for detecting title changes   - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WebKit patch <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49277">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49277</a> introduced a new  interface in the HistoryDelegate to detect title changes  as well as a new  layout test (http/tests/globalhistory/history-delegate-basic-title.html).    Test shell will need similar support to get this test to pass correctly. </pre>
