<title>Issue 36942 -   chromium -    [Chrome - OS] Not able to install extension in chrome OS because confirm installation dialog is displayed in full screen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Launch chrome os  2. Access official extensions gallery site  3. Try to install an extension      When installing  the Confirm Installation dialog should be displayed with a  proper size  but now it is sometimes displayed in full screen  and also  because a Content Browser UI is always displayed in bottom-right corner  so  the Install and Cancel button of the Confirm Installation dialog is  covered  so unable to install the extension        </pre>
