<title>Issue 38284 -   chromium -    Autofill: Clicking on Profile Label Name should expand/collapse the profile - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3        1. Change Autofill settings        Clicking on Profile &quot;label&quot; name should show the Autofill settings for said   profile  to allow editting/deletion.        Can't click on Profile Label name to edit/delete. Have to click on small   arrow the size of a flea next to it. Not very ergonomic. </pre>
