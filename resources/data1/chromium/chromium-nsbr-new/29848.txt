<title>Issue 29848 -   chromium -    Only spawn plugins when tab has focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.30    OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Only starts plugin when tab gets   focus        Not using the template  but here it goes...    What I like about Safari on the Mac  is that it only starts executing the flash   applets on a page when the tab gets focus. The reason why I like this: I   often visit sites like YouTube  dumpert.nl  break.com  CollegeHumor  etc. I   Cmd-Click on various links to pages with movies  but I don't want to play   dozens of those movies at the same time. Viewing the tabs one by one   starts playback automatically. It also helps if the page in question has Flash   advertisements that make sound.    It would be nice if Google Chrome did the same. Not only on Mac OS  but   any operating system (in my opinion). </pre>
