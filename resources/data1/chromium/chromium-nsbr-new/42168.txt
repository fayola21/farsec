<title>Issue 42168 -   chromium -    tabs should not list New Tab in Tab history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open a new tab and enter a url or goto a bookmark  2. Look at Back/Forward buttons      2. &quot;Go Back&quot; button should be disabled - if I want to  see the New Tab page I will just open a New Tab...      2. Go Back button shows history back to New Tab page  which is misleading/confusing - makes me think there  is earlier browsing history - makes me hesitate to  close the tab without checking the history.    Please provide
