<title>Issue 40726 -   chromium -    [Mac] Provide a command-line switch to quit the browser when there is no open windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We are developing a web IDE and we use Chrome to provide debugging and simulation support.   When the user presses a toolbar button we run Chrome in app mode. Each instance uses   completely separate profile (to avoid messing with user data and avoid any persistent state). This   way the Chrome appears as a new Dock button which is fine. The problem we have is that the   button will not disappear when the application is closed and that may become pretty confusing for   the user.    This could be solved if the Chrome had a command-line switch that would force it to quit when   there is no open windows. </pre>
