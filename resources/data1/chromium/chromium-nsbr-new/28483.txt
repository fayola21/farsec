<title>Issue 28483 -   chromium -    If sound lead disappears  sound does not return but works for other applications  until Chrome restart - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33 (Official Build 31639)  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  but anything with sound                  1. Play a video with sound  2. Unplug the sound lead from the computer that leads to hifi/external speakers (e.g. this emulates a   dirty/warn socket)  3. Wait a short while  4. Windows Vista may complain that a jack has been removed  5. Replace the socket        Sound comes back.          Sound does not come back  even though sound works from other applications.    HOWEVER  it does come back if Chrome is restarted.    (Creating a new Chrome instance does not bring it back either.)      It is as if Chrome detects that a playback device has gone but does not re-detect its reinstatement. </pre>
