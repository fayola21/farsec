<title>Issue 29952 -   chromium -    Undo thumbnail bubble should be dismissed  after restoring the thumbnails. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)    -Remove a thumbnail and Restore all the removed thumbnails using the   action drop-down button.    Issue:  Even though all the thumbnails are restored  the undo thumbnail bubble   still shows up for a fixed time and will dismissed after that time   interval only. If user clicks on the 'undo' link  it does nothing. I   guess  we should dismiss the undo bubble  immediately after restoring all   of the deleted thumbnail. </pre>
