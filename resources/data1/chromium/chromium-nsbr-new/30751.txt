<title>Issue 30751 -   chromium -    Decide if we want to implement support for client side buffers. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> GLES2 allows vertex and index data to be stored on the client. Originally   we decided to not allow that but many GL programs use this feature. For   example Nicholas spent a lot of time trying to figure out why something was   not working not knowing we did not support that.    It is extremely slow to implement.  The GLES2Implementation has to scan the   index buffer to figure out the highest indice that will be accessed. It   then has to copy all the indices and client side buffers across the command   buffer for every draw call on every frame.    If we don't support it then many programs will require more modification   before they start working in Pepper or NaCl.         </pre>
