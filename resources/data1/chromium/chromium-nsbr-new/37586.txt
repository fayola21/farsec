<title>Issue 37586 -   chromium -    XMLHTTPRequests don't work from file: URLs to file: URLs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I am loading a web page locally off my hard drive (something like   file:///Users/whatever/index.html). This file contains a script that makes an XMLHTTPRequest to   another file on my hard drive.    In previous versions of Chrome and Chromium  and in current versions of Safari  WebKit   Nightlies  Opera  Firefox  etc. this works fine.    This makes testing pages very difficult.    As of recently  I get NETWORK_ERR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101 in Chrome AND Chromium.    Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.1 (Official Build 40461) dev AND 5.0.346.0 (Developer Build   40822)           Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK   </pre>
