<title>Issue 33677 -   chromium -    Bookmarks bar folder icon - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;      Folder icons on the bookmark bar should have options to hide them. It is vast   of space  repeating the very same icon over and over. (Please see attach)     The option should be somewhere close to ��_��_��_Always show bookmarks bar��_��_��_ option in   the bookmarks bar popup menu.     Something similar to the Safari and Firefox on OS X     </pre>
