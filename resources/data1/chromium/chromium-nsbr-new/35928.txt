<title>Issue 35928 -   chromium -    JSON.parse and eval cause full screen paint - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.7 beta (os x 10.5.8); 5.0.322.2 dev (xp)      Firefox 3.6: OK      1. Open attached file in chrome with speed tracer installed and running  2. click on the 'CLICK' div  3. observe in speed tracer that each click causes a full repaint of the entire   page      calling eval() or JSON.parse() should not repaint the screen.       if you have a 1024x768 browser window  calling eval will cause a   1024x768 paint event.    Note:  I'm not sure if there's an equivalent to MozAfterPaint in chrome but the   Speed Tracer plugin <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/speedtracer/">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/speedtracer/</a>   shows the same info. In a complicated page  the paint event is very slow    suggesting that this is not an erroneous event.     The same thing happens when calling JSON.parse() instead of eval()   </pre>
