<title>Issue 24588 -   chromium -    never-ending page load for certain pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.25 Beta channel  URLs (if applicable) : (intranet)      Firefox 3.x: OK    Unlike previous versions  this version of Chrome is loading certain pages   in our intranet for very long (or even never ends). Some details are:  1. all pages are HTTPS  2. sometimes it first happens on POST requests  but once I have one tab   that loads forever  even GETs in other tabs also never load  3. I run Chrome with &quot;-process-per-site&quot; switch    Only browser restart resolves the issue  but soon it appears again.    This issue effectively prevents me from using Chrome on our company's   Intranet--and I'm back to FireFox 3.5 for that. </pre>
