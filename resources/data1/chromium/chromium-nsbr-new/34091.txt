<title>Issue 34091 -   chromium -    Make it easy to test a new build step on the try bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should make a new build step run a script from the checkout when there is   a special property set on a build. Then &quot;gcl try&quot; should be able to set this   property when you want to run this new step to test a new script. </pre>
