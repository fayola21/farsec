<title>Issue 38256 -   chromium -    &quot;Home page frequently visited site screenshots&quot; may violate user privacy  bypass passwords - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hello     I'm an internal Googler (LDAP elemay)  want to note that the chrome summary   home page (with images of visited sites) possibly could violate user   privacy:    1) There is a screenshot of my e-mail inbox; you can't make out text but   you can see e.g. how many e-mails are unread  etc.  If multiple people   share the computer but don't have my e-mail password they can see my inbox.    2) I use some spam-sensitive internal tools like &quot;go/WPI&quot;  but if (for   example) my roommate were to borrow my laptop (without VPN'ing  no   connection to internal Google)  she can see an image of &quot;WPI&quot; (with graphs    hard to make out but still a little viewable) with no requirement for   password.     3) I could imagine a screenshot of an inbox of a bank account.  Even if the   text is blurred  you may be able to see  e.g. how many CDs I have  etc.   which bypasses the password  in the case of multiple users using the   computer.    Not sure the best way to handle this.  Is there a way to allow the user to   disable screenshots of certain pages?  Could we have smart logic not take   screenshots of pages behind password protection?    Thanks     Emily     </pre>
