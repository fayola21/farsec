<title>Issue 41730 -   chromium -    Certificates issued by Network Solutions Certificate Authority are reported as revoked on Linux distributions with NSS 3.12.6 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.9  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/">https://www.networksolutions.com/</a>   <a href="https://blackboard.mines.edu">https://blackboard.mines.edu</a>        Firefox 3.x: OK    Opera 10.52: OK   Midori 0.2.4: OK      1. Start Chromium and visit <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com">https://www.networksolutions.com</a>. The page  should load normally.  2. Open a new tab and go to <a href="https://blackboard.mines.edu">https://blackboard.mines.edu</a>. Chromium will  incorrectly state that the serer's security certificate is revoked. Error 1  (see below) is printed to the terminal output.  3. Go back to the Network Solutions tab without closing the second tab and  refresh the page by pressing F5. While the page is reloading and after the  network connection has been established (i.e. the circular loading  indicator has changed directions)  press F5 several more times (anywhere  from 1 to 5 times for me). Chromium will state that the Network Solutions  SSL certificate has been revoked (see attached screenshot). Error 2 (see  below) is printed to the terminal output.  4. Any subsequent refresh or page load in another tab of the same Network  Solutions URL will trigger a revocation error. In addition  visiting  <a href="https://networksolutions.com">https://networksolutions.com</a> triggers a revocation error when it should  trigger a &quot;this is probably not the site you are looking for&quot; error. If  this second URL is visited before step 1  then the proper error is displayed.    Console errors (referenced above):  Error 1:  [26908:27002:2341543989414:ERROR:net/base/x509_certificate_nss.cc(546)]  CERT_PKIXVerifyCert for blackboard.mines.edu failed err=-8180  Error 2:  [26908:27020:2341550724986:ERROR:net/base/x509_certificate_nss.cc(546)]  CERT_PKIXVerifyCert for www.networksolutions.com failed err=-8180    Other information:  * System is 64bit Linux with NSS version 3.12.6  * I also experience this issue in Chromium 5.0.342.7 with NSS version 3.12.6.  * After reverting to NSS version 3.12.5 and recompiling Chromium  I do not  receive any recovation errors.  * The revocation error for the second page (<a href="https://blackboard.mines.edu">https://blackboard.mines.edu</a>)  is triggered even when skipping step 1. However  I found it interesting  that loading a second page affected the first page for subsequent page loads.  * System time is correct (NTP synchronized)  so this appears to be a  different issue from <a title="&quot;The server's security certificate is revoked!&quot; error if the system time is off by hours or days" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22796"> issue 22796 </a>.  * This may be related to <a title="CERT_PKIXVerifyCert for wybredni.pl failed err=-8180"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29178">issue 29178</a>  on which the same error code and  revocation error is encountered  but for different sites. I left a comment  on that issue  but I was told that I should open a new issue. That issue  was apparently fixed with NSS version 3.12.6  but I am still receiving a  similar error even with NSS 3.12.6.    Please let me know if any other debugging information is needed. </pre>
