<title>Issue 36860 -   chromium -    rebaseline tool should warn or error if the zip file is too stale - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now  it's been &gt;24hours since the zip files have updated  due to a bug with the buildbots.   Currently rebaseline.py still just blindly rebaselines using a &gt;24hour old set of zip files. It should   detect anytime that the zip is old (e.g. &gt;1 hour old) and give a big warning. Alternately  it should   error out and require you to pass --force to use it.    Also  maybe instead of time  it should just use revision numbers (e.g. if the zip is &gt; 10 revisions   behind the bots). </pre>
