<title>Issue 42888 -   chromium -    FF is default and opened  Search engines importing thr preferences turns into zombies  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.375.28 (Official Build 45883)    -Set FF as default browser and keep it opened.  Have the preference file some thing like  {  .....  &quot;skip_first_run_ui&quot;: true   &quot;import_search_engine&quot;: true   &quot;do_not_launch_chrome&quot;: false   ......  }  -Install mini_installer with above preference file.    Current Behavior:  Chrome (2 chrome.exe's )runs in the background forever(infact they terned   as zombies). If user launches Chrome  then user is provided with the scary   messages:  - Restore info bar &quot;Chrome did not shutdown correctly...restore &quot;  shows up  -&quot;Your profile could not be opened correctly. Some feature may be   unavailable...blah..blah..&quot; alert. -- Screenshot attached.      Quitting chrome does not help quiting those two zombies  user has to kill   them manually  which is bad.   Glen says  We run importing process as long as Firefox profile is not   available  once avilable (i.e FF is closed)  then we end the importing   process. But the fact is that  even though FF IS CLOSED  they still keep on   running..    As per Glen:  We should end the importing process  if FF is opened. Please talk to him   for more info.     PS:  In the above preference file:  if &quot;do_not_launch_chrome&quot;: true  then if user launches chrome for first   time  then user gets 2 zombies. If launches for 2nd time  then 2 scary   messages  as explained above. </pre>
