<title>Issue 46142 -   chromium -    Test expectations under platform/chromium versus platform/chromium-&lt;platform&gt; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Following extensive discussions at:  <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39721">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39721</a>    We should probably de-duplicate some test expectations that are under platform/chromium-&lt;platform&gt; and have them under platform/chromium.    Reason: there are two fallback / search paths for baselines:  1. chromium-linux =&gt; chromium-win =&gt; chromium  2. chromium-mac =&gt; chromium    Since all tests fallback to chromium  it may make sense to have all files in there.    Results attached for:  fdupes -r chromium* | grep -A1 &quot;chromium-win/&quot; | grep -B1 chromium-mac   </pre>
