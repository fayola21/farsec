<title>Issue 46209 -   chromium -    [Accessibility] all of the content in the Extensions tab is not read by screen read. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Turn on NVDA.  2. Load Chrome.  3. Open the Extensions tab.  4. Tab through the extensions tab.    What is the expected output?  All content on the extensions tab should be read and the user should be able to make changes.    What do you see instead?  all that can be seen is &quot;browse the the gallery&quot; link and three buttons without labels.      When using JAWS 11.0.1430 is used  none of the content is read. </pre>
