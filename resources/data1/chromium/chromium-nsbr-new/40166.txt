<title>Issue 40166 -   chromium -    Can't enter accent characters in text boxes on window (works in omni bar) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1042 (Official Build 42199  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>          Firefox 3.x: FAIL          1. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>  2. Hit Ctrl+' and then type the letter e        ��_��_ is entered in the text box.        an unaccented e is entered instead    Oddly enough  firefox fails in the same way  so I'm not sure if it's a   platform issue or a chrome issue.  At the least  the behavior difference   between the omni box and the text box should be the same.   </pre>
