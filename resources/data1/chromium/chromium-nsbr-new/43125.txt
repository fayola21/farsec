<title>Issue 43125 -   chromium -    Giving a number instead of URL changes the URL into an IP address - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L31a)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.375.29 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=46008">r46008</a>    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2       1. Create a new bookmark  with URL as a number of length &lt;= 10. (eg: 2  1234567890)  2. Open this bookmark in a new page.    Expected:  We should get a Chrome error page and the URL should have the entered http://&lt;number&gt;    Actual;  The number in the URL is changed and instead we have another number which looks like an ip   address (*.*.*.*). And when we try to open this we get &quot;Oops! Google Chrome could not connect   to &lt;ip&gt;&quot;    Eg: 2  will change to be 0.0.0.2  1234567890 will change to be 73.150.2.210.    Note:  Anything starting with &quot;0&quot; is retained as it is.  The max length for a number in URL field is 10.  This is on all platforms.  This doesn't happen on Safari.   </pre>
