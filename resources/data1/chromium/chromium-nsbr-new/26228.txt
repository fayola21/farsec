<title>Issue 26228 -   chromium -    speed up the time it takes to generate the new tab html - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some ideas:  (1) Have ReplaceStringPlaceholders take a StringPiece  (2) Send the result using RefCountedBytes  (3) Make NewTabHTMLSource and DOMUIThemeSource singletons.  They need some   theme information when generated  so they would need to listen for theme   changes to update.  (4) Make all the dom message handlers singletons (ShowSecionsHandler    MostVisitedHandler  RecentlyClosedTabsHandler  MetricsHandler  TipsHandler    etc).  As long as the handler doesn't keep any state  all the new tab pages   should be able to share a single handler. </pre>
