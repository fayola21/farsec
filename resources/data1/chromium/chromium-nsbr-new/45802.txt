<title>Issue 45802 -   chromium -    Remove support for NPDrawingModelCoreAnimation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We've now implemented NPDrawingModelInvalidatingCoreAnimation  which doesn't require us to run   a timer to get updates. Once existing plugins using Core Animation implement NPDrawingModelInvalidatingCoreAnimation we should stop supporting the original version  so that   plugins can't ever trigger the timer-based model.    Mozilla's plan is to implement only NPDrawingModelInvalidatingCoreAnimation as well (I believe they   are planning to do a short-term whitelist for existing plugins for the transition  instead of leaving it   enabled; we could do the same if it looks like there is going to be an issue). </pre>
