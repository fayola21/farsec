<title>Issue 28161 -   chromium -    Mac: error message &quot;[...] __CFServiceControllerBeginPBSLoadForLocalizations received error [...]&quot; on console - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start a nice  fresh Chromium from the command-line; I use:  xcodebuild/Debug/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium  --user-data-dir=/tmp  [this isn't necessary  but may make the problem easier to isolate].  2. Don't import anything. Get window with &lt;<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&gt;.  3. Click on search field on web page  type &quot;foo&quot; (say). Click on blank area.    Then one gets something like:    2009-11-18 12:34:50.416 Chromium Helper[23814:107] __CFServiceControllerBeginPBSLoadForLocalizations received error 1100   from bootstrap_look_up2    (on the console).    Mac OS 10.6.1  <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32337">r32337</a> off the trunk  local debug build. I'll pull a more recent one and see if it's still there.... </pre>
