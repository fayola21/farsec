<title>Issue 41827 -   chromium -    sql.Statement::Run() variant with a changes expectation. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have seen cases where simple changes convert a SQL statement from updating a single row to   updating zero rows.  This does not throw an error  so it's hard to debug - the code all runs right    but the wrong thing happens.    There should be a Run() variant which allows the caller to indicate that exactly N rows should be   modified  or at least N rows  or less than N rows  or something like that.  Failure to match   expectations should certainly be a DCHECK()  but could also perhaps be an error.    This could also be done by exposing a function to return the number of changes from the previous   call  but I think specifying that number up front is a decent design pattern. </pre>
