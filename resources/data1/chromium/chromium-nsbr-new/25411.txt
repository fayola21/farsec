<title>Issue 25411 -   chromium -    IE7 Thinks HTML file with ChromeFrame meta tag is a &quot;ChromeActiveDocument Class&quot; and will not load - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.211.7 (Official Build 26751)          1. Load a page with the meta tag for Chrome Frame in it.    What do you expect to happen?  The page loaded properly.    What do you see instead?  Internet Explorer 7 instead asks if I wish   to &quot;Open&quot;  &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; on the HTML file where the meta tag   resides.  It thinks it is the file type &quot;ChromeActiveDocument Class&quot;.  If   I click open  some HTML pages will load anyway  others will not. </pre>
