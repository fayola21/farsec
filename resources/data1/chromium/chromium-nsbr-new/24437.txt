<title>Issue 24437 -   chromium -    New tabs are empty (about:blank) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On a regular basis  Chrome Mac gets into a state where all new tabs simply  load about:blank instead of the URL they were asked to. I've only seen this  start with URL requests from external applications  but from that point you  must restart to load any new content.    The console features errors like:    09/10/09 10:15:53 AM com.apple.launchd[177] (0x161450.Google Chrome  He[76356]) Policy denied Mach service lookup: com.apple.windowserver.session     And from Chrome:    09/10/09 10:21:26 AM [0x0-0xffdffd].com.google.Chrome[68032]  [68032:523:1556815146876561:ERROR:/b/slave/chrome-official-mac/build/src/chrome/browser/cocoa/browser_window_cocoa.mm(122)]  Not implemented reached in virtual void  BrowserWindowCocoa::ShelfVisibilityChanged()    I'm using Chrome 4.0.221.8  and this happens every couple days without warning. </pre>
