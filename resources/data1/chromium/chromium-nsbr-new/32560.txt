<title>Issue 32560 -   chromium -    Make Mouse Wheel change tab configurable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.295.0 (Official Build 35884)   unstable  WebKit	532.8  V8	2.0.5.5  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8   (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.295.0 Safari/532.8  URLs (if applicable) : N/A      1.  Click a tab  2.  Scroll the mouse wheel (In my case I'm using the right edge of my touch   pad in Ubuntu).        It scrolls the tab  while I could see someone liking this  there has never   been a case for me that I've wanted or used it.  I would much rather be   able to tell chrome to always scroll the page on a mouse wheel.  It's   frustrating enough it deserves a checkbox      I can't configure it  and I constantly change tabs unintentionally.   </pre>
