<title>Issue 41222 -   chromium -    search doesn't work in inspect element - profiles: snapshots  storage  audits - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Issue reproducible on 5.0.375.3 (Official Build 44229)      1. Go to any webpage say yahoo.com  2. Right click on page and select inspect element  3. Click on Profiles tab - Get CPU profile. Also get heap snapshot  4. Search some text in created snapshot 1.     What is the expected output?   Should be able to search    What do you see instead?  Even when text is present in snapshot1  search result displayed - not   found. Same issue with Storage : search any cookie name in cookies (doesn't   work). Also search in audit doesn't work.    Search &quot;works fine for CPU profile&quot; in above build.    Search in &quot;profiles &gt; heap snapshot&quot; worked fine in latest stable build   4.1.249.1045       </pre>
