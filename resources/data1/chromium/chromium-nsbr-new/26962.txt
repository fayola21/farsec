<title>Issue 26962 -   chromium -    JavaScript Compat : for-in ordering of int-like property names - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.32  URLs (if applicable) : n/a           Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK       Opera 10:OK      1. In a JS console  run: for(k in {'abc':0 '123':1}) alert(k);    Expected: alert 'abc' then '123'  Actual: alert '123' then 'abc'    Although 12.6.4 of ECMA-262 leaves the order of enumeration explicitly  undefined  in practice all other browsers appear to preserve the sequence  in which properties were added (see attached testpage) and have done so for  quite a while.     This behaviour is sometimes very useful  and since a guaranteed  implementation (bundling an Object together with an Array of its keys) is  seriously clunky  I suspect a lot of people may be relying on it.    Chrome *almost* follows the convention. The only exceptions are property  names which can be parsed as integers  which are enumerated before anything  else. I'm assuming this is a special-case code path for Array support  but  since the object here wasn't created as an array  I'm not sure why it needs  to be optimized for array-like usage. </pre>
