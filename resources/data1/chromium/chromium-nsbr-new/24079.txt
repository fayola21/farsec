<title>Issue 24079 -   chromium -    Tab hides window decorations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Open many tabs in chromium window till the tab hide the   minimize/maximize/close buttons (on the upper right corner) on the window   (could be another bug).  2. Try to switch to last tab using mouse.  3. The minimize/maximize/close buttons are not visible but are active. i.e.    the last tab is generally on top of the minimize/maximize/close buttons  so   when you click on the last tab  sometimes the minimize button gets clicked   and window minimizes. On other occasions close button gets clicked and   window destroys.      Either the window decorations should not be covered by the tabs  i.e. the   minimize/maximize/close buttons should be visible.  Or if the window decorations are to be covered  then   minimize/maximize/close buttons should be disabled.      The window decorations are covered by tab (and minimize/maximize/close   buttons are not disabled) and it is very difficult to switch to tab using   mouse. Many times close button gets clicked and windows destroys.    <b>Please provide
