<title>Issue 42871 -   chromium -    when chrome is minimized on a mac  finding a url in a tab fails - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Place the following code in an extension:    chrome.tabs.getAllInWindow(undefined  function(tabs) {  	//look through all tabs in the open window to find a url  	for (var t in tabs) {   		var url = tabs[t].url;  			if (url.indexOf(&quot;somewebsite.com&quot;) != -1) {  				//url is found  update it  				var id = tabs[t].id;  				chrome.tabs.update(id  {selected: true  url : q_url});			          				return;			        			}			      		}	  		//if it doesn't exist in the opened window  crea  		chrome.tabs.create({url: &quot;http://somenewurl.com&quot;});	  		return;			    	}  );	    2. Open a tab to the url the script is looking for  3. Minimize window      Script should recognize tab with the url and update that tab with the new  url. Script recognizes the tab when the window is not minimized and updates  it accordingly.      Chrome does not find the url in the open tab and the script proceeds to  create a new tab.    <b>Please provide
