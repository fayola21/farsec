<title>Issue 31909 -   chromium -    Deferred processing for un-associated data types in Syncer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently the SyncerThread runs as soon as a valid connection is detected   with sync servers (kicked off by authentication in general)  and a Syncer has   been created for the Directory (which is kicked off by the syncapi opening   the Directory).  The loop in ThreadMainLoop uses a condition variable to   wait for these conditions.  This all permits the Syncer from getting changes   from the server before ModelAssociation has completed  which could be   bad.  Furthermore  to get multiple data types off the ground we only want   to start the SyncerThread after association has finished for all types (in the   future  we may just need one type to be done in order to let the thread   run).    Proposed solution:  Add a conditional wait in ThreadMainLoop on an   'association complete' flag  and control setting that flag by raising a   notification (as in NotificationService) from ModelAssociators when   association finishes and registering SyncerThread as an observer of this. </pre>
