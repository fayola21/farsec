<title>Issue 33696 -   chromium -    Mac: dragging empty URL lists to web contents will cause exceptions and eventually crash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Start Chromium with a fresh profile and go to the bookmark manager.  2. Drag something (you have a choice of three empty things) to the web   content.  3. Probably  an (NSRangeException) exception will be reported (on the   console  or wherever). On a Debug build  we'll DCHECK(). Do this enough and   it'll eventually crash even on Release.    Crap. This is my fault  I think. But there's a patch for that. </pre>
