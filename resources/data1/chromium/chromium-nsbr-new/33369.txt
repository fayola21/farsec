<title>Issue 33369 -   chromium -    How to set proxy details manually - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;             Safari 4:NA    Firefox 3.x:NA           IE 7:NA           IE 8:NA      I'm using the Chromium OS through Sun VirtualBox. Once after loading the   image  its asking for the username &amp; password. While providing my existing   google userid and password I'm getting an error &quot;Network not connected and   offline login fail&quot;. But I'm able to login as username/password as   chronos/chronos . I believe the issue may be due to proxy setting which I   used to access internet on my host os.I tried to get the proxy details by   typing chrome://net-internals/proxyservice and found the below details:    Current Configuration(chrome://net-internals/proxyservice.config)    Automatic settings:    Auto-detect:No    Custom PAC script:[None]  Manual settings:    Proxy server:[None]    Bypass list:[None]    Bypass local names: No    Even I tried to access terminal window by hitting ctrl+Alt+F2 to manually   configure the proxy. But once I switch to the terminal mode  I'm not able   to type anything in the terminal window.    Please suggest me the resolution for this issue.    Additional Details:-  The image that I'm using for Chrome OS is downloaded from   <a href="http://gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/download/">http://gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/download/</a> site and run through Sun   Virtual Box.    Thanks   Manas   </pre>
