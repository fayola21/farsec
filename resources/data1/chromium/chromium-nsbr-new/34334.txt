<title>Issue 34334 -   chromium -    Java game problem. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I played the game in Firefox and the IE and don't have any problems.  When i change and try to play with Chrome  i see that the game stays soo  much 'heavy'.  2. So i uninstall the browser and nothing change.  3. I do the same in my friend's house and happen the same  and we have  different vga and processors...        Well  i don't know if this is a bug or not  but is only the Chrome browser  shows me that problem of framerate  and this makes very hardly to play  'Runescape'       <b>Please provide
