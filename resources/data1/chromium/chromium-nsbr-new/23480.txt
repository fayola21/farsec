<title>Issue 23480 -   chromium -    Clicking on tab bar makes Chromium go fullscreen ( Linux only )  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.220.0 (Developer Build 27600)      1. Make sure &quot;Use system title bar and borders&quot; is disabled.   2. Click on the blue strip to the right of the new tab (+) button.      Nothing should happen. On double-clicking  however  opening a new tab would   be nice.      Browser goes fullscreen.    This occurs only when chromium has the custom title bars enabled.  Observed on Gnome 2.26.1 ( Ubuntu 9.04). Does not occur on Windows. </pre>
