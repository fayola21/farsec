<title>Issue 29310 -   chromium -    Shortcut idea - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   This is just a simple idea about usability when we are using the tabs.  Yesterday I was reading a text in a tab and writing my exercises in another    so I was switching between tabs a lot. I thought: &quot;Would be wonderful if I   have ALT + TAB like shortcut in Chrome...&quot;.       Some shortcut that switch between the present and the previous tab  like ALT +   TAB.      Nothing. I need to move the cursor through the touchpad  change the visible   tab  read some text  click in the previous tab and keep writing. It's very annoying.    <b>Please provide
