<title>Issue 24488 -   chromium -    Need the Google logo on Chrome window? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.222.2 (Official 28529)  OS + version : Any Linux              In Windows  the Google logo is on top right hand corner of the chrome   window. Are we going to have this in Linux?    For me  it's a way of quickly differentiating which is chrome and which is   chromium if two windows are open. </pre>
