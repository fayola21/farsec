<title>Issue 36845 -   chromium -    DNS prefetching still sent do the DNS server when using a proxy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (38071)      1. Configure a proxy  2. Use your favorite packet capture tool and start listening  3. Browse anywhere on the web        The expected result is no DNS prefetching.  DNS resolution for the proxy is   done at the proxy itself  not the local OS.    Prefetching is *mostly* useless and just makes for a chatty network and   wasted resources.  IFF the same DNS server is used by the proxy  then the   prefetching may still help.    It may be worth leaving as is  or it could be worth creating a separate   flag to make it configurable.  Additional code bloat may not be worth the   savings  we may not know for sure unless it's tested. </pre>
