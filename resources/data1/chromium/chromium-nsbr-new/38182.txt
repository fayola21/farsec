<title>Issue 38182 -   chromium -    enable user style sheet w/o having a flag - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently having a custom user style sheet is behind a flag (--enable-user-  stylesheet).  If it doesn't impact startup perf (it shouldn't  but mac startup perf   is often delicate)  we should remove the command line flag.    I may try some changes on the main waterfall while MTV is sleeping. </pre>
