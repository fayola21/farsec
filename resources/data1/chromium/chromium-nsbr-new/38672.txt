<title>Issue 38672 -   chromium -    Ancient tabs causes constant high CPU usage when revived - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	5.0.356.0 (Official Build 41818)   dev  URLs (if applicable) : ALL      1. Open a bunch of tabs(10-20ish)  2. Leave them for a considerate ammount of time(I often have some tabs open   for days)  3. Click some links in one of these ancient tabs. (scrolling still works)      The clicked link should appear.      Chrome starts using all the available CPU. Spending a long time figuring   out what to do before eventually loading the site.(copying the URL  killing   the tab and reopening a new tab takes considerably less time)      Note that it seems to be a problem related to sites that aren't regularly   updating. As sites that use ajax(or meta refresh) to keep themselves up to   date work as if you just opened them. </pre>
