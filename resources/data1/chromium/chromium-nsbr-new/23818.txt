<title>Issue 23818 -   chromium -    Update extension_toolstrip.css to allow buttons instead of divs for toolstrip-button - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Linux 4.0.213.1  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  Other browsers tested: N/A    In chrome/renderer/resources/extension_toolstrip.css  which is included in   extension toolstrips  there's a note from Aaron:  TODO(aa): It would be nice if we could use actual &lt;button&gt; tags work here    which should work once <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25406">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25406</a> is   fixed.     That bug is marked fixed and resolved. I'm not sure if the Webkit version   that Chrome is integrated with has the fix  but it'd be great to at least   update the CSS to use .toolstrip-button instead of div.toolstrip-button  so   we can use actual button controls (which can be disabled  for example).    Thanks   matias </pre>
