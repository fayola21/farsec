<title>Issue 28357 -   chromium -    Mac: about:memory error message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This is on 10.5.8  on the 4.0.249.0 dev channel:    33393425848549:ERROR:/b/slave/chrome-official-mac/build/src/chrome/browser/proce  ss_info_snapshot_mac.cc(73)] Error parsing output from /usr/bin/top.    Two problems:  1) Why the error message? (Probably I didn't test carefully enough on Leopard.)  2) It shouldn't be '/usr/bin/top'  but '/bin/ps' (how did that get through review?).    There are more serious problems though.    Taking this for myself  but will let go through triage.... </pre>
