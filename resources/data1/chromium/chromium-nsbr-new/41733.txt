<title>Issue 41733 -   chromium -    Crashes All Across This College Library - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome keeps crashing at this library on my campus and I'm not sure why.   I'd love to use it as my main browser  but it always works for a little  while and then crashes.    It's usually different websites  but if it does crash on a website  I  always does every subsequent visit.    I've visited the mentioned sites with firefox  and using chrome at home and  they work fine.    I think the library uses a software like DeepFreeze to image the computers  regularly.    Attaching a crash report hoping for help. </pre>
