<title>Issue 31512 -   chromium -    console.profile does not output to console or indicate it has worked - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome	4.0.266.0 (Official Build 33992)  WebKit	532.6  V8	2.0.3.1  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.6 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.266.0 Safari/532.6      1. Use console.profile and console.profileEnd in a webpage        Developer Tools should pop up (or at least switch tabs if it is open   currently) in the Profiles tab to show that it is starting/stopping   profiling.  And/Or a message should be printed to the console on start/stop   to indicate that profiling is indeed occurring.        Nothing appears to happen.  It is not clear until you view the Profiles tab   and see the generated profiles.  This was confusing to me at first. </pre>
