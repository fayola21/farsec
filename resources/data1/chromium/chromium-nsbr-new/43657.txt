<title>Issue 43657 -   chromium -    Different background image for Chrome themes in incognito mode - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install any theme.  2. Click the 'New Tab' button.  3. The page that you see has a background.  4. If you open the incognito mode you get that same background.      It would be cool if we would have a separate property for that.  Maybe something that would be called: &quot;theme_ntp_background_incognito&quot;. And   maybe this should also be doubled by a separate alignment property as well    something like &quot;ntp_background_incognito_alignment&quot;. Currently we only have   &quot;theme_ntp_background&quot; and &quot;ntp_background_alignment&quot;. </pre>
