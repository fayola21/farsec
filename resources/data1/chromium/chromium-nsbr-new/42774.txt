<title>Issue 42774 -   chromium -    Use recursive copy in GYP for bookmark_manager and shared_resources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now we list out all the files in the shared_resources group and the bookmark_manager in   chrome_browser.gypi due to issues with conflicting GRD file entries  and the fact that it just doesn't   seem to work on windows.  These should be collapsed to a single recursive copy.   </pre>
