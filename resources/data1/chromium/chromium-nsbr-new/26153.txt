<title>Issue 26153 -   chromium -    extension api chrome.windows.get returns incorrent window height when Chrome is maximized - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    I am using the chrome.windows.get api to retrieve the height of Chrome's window   in order to dynamically size my browser action pop up to a percentage of the   containing window.    This api only seems to work correctly for non-maximized windows. If Chrome is   maximized on the Windows platform  then this api returns the height of its most   recent non-maximized state.    I think there are other ways to trigger this quirk  because I also run into this   as I develop with the maximized window. Not sure what is causing it.    However  I discovered that if I restore the window  the api works correctly. And   then when I maximize thereafter  I get the height from the restored state. </pre>
