<title>Issue 38143 -   chromium -    Characters improperly displayed in Developer-&gt;Elements view (&amp;lt; displayed as &lt;) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 5.0.342.3 (Official Build 41132) dev   OS: OS X 10.6.2    On a webpage which includes ampersand encoded characters (i.e. &amp;lt;  &amp;gt;  etc.)  Chrome's   Elements tab in the developer view renders them as the encoded character (i.e. &lt;  &gt;  etc.).     If a page has this as the source:  &lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;example&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;    The elements tab displays this:  &lt;div&gt;&lt;example&gt;&lt;div&gt;    It should display the former.    Directly viewing the source correctly displays these characters.    Source highlighting in the elements tab treats these characters correctly (they're black text  not   highlighted as html elements)     Developers need a clearer way to differentiate these two classes of characters when auditing   rendered page content  particularly when debugging potential XSS vulnerabilities. The two types   of characters are not equivalent even when rendered  and Chrome needs to recognize this. </pre>
