<title>Issue 34632 -   chromium -    regression: IPv6 disabling doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> the --disable-ipv6 flag got broken with <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=37608">r37608</a>    The specific problem lines are:    -    // Create a new job for this request.  -    job = new Job(this  key);  -    job-&gt;AddRequest(req);  -    AddOutstandingJob(job);  -    // TODO(eroman): Bound the total number of concurrent jobs.  -    // <a href="http://crbug.com/9598">http://crbug.com/9598</a>  -    job-&gt;Start();  +    JobPool* pool = GetPoolForRequest(req);  +    if (CanCreateJobForPool(*pool)) {  +      CreateAndStartJob(req);  +    } else {  +      return EnqueueRequest(pool  req);  +    }    Before the Job was created using |key| (which contains the &quot;effective&quot; address family.  Whereas now it is created using req-&gt;info()  which has the requested address family. </pre>
