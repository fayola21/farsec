<title>Issue 45752 -   chromium -    Disable password sync on Mac if the Keychain is configured to prompt the user - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Syncing passwords involves reading all currently stored passwords and comparing them against   what's stored on the sync server. On Mac  Chrome stores its passwords in the Keychain. Since the   Keychain can be configured to prompt the user every time a password a read  we obviously cannot   read all passwords every time sync is initialized. Thus  we should detect how the Keychain is   configured and refuse to sync passwords if it would result in the user being prompted. </pre>
