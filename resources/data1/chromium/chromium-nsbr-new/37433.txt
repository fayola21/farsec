<title>Issue 37433 -   chromium -    Fullscreen overlay disappears when dragging bookmark buttons around - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Go fullscreen.  Make sure focus is not in the omnibox.  Open a folder on the bookmark bar.  Pick a   button inside that folder and start dragging it around until you get the folder to close.  The overlay   should stick around  even after the folder closes.    Patch coming. </pre>
