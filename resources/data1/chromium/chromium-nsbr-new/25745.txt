<title>Issue 25745 -   chromium -    Doesn't check for updated manifest.json on startup [extensions] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    I often edit installed extensions if they aren't working correctly or if I   just want a new feature in it.  It works if I edit html  javascript  css  etc.    But it doesn't work if I want to edit something in the manifest.json (like   removing an unused browser-action-icon)    If I press Reload in the chrome:extensions it updates the manifest.  But when Chrome is restarted the old manifest settings is restored and I   have to press Reload again.    I think Chrome should remember the new manifest.json settings when I press   Reload or check it on startup. </pre>
