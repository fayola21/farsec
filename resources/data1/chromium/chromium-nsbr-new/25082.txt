<title>Issue 25082 -   chromium -    Pasting text into url bar triggers keyword search - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. create a keyword search engine  or verify the keyword of one you have   already.  Assume the keyword is KW  2. Select or copy some text that starts with the keyword  KW  such as &quot;KW   blah blah blah&quot;  3. paste the text into the empty omnibar (either middle click or ctrl-v)    What is the expected output?   The entire string should be entered verbatim  hitting enter should search   for it on the default search engine    What do you see instead?  The keyword search engine is used  so instead you get &quot;search KW for: blah   blah blah&quot;    On windows it behaves as expected  the keyword search is only activated if   you actually type the keyword  not paste it.   </pre>
