<title>Issue 42500 -   chromium -    Put &quot;Get More Extensions&quot; in the Top area - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Custom and control chrome  2.Extensions  3.Scroll to bottom and Get more extensions       In Firefox  I can click &quot;Get Add-ons&quot; easily and can also search by two steps.   As the same  I think I can click &quot;Get more extensions&quot; easily in the top  area(with &quot;update extenions now&quot;) and search extensions directly..       Most time in Extgensions page  I just want to find and install some  extensions I find not to set the extension option(I can set extension  option by right-clicking on the extension).There is no need to put the &quot;Get  more extensions&quot; in the bottom  which makes me have to scroll to the bottom  and click it..     <b>Please provide
