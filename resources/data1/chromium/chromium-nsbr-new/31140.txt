<title>Issue 31140 -   chromium -    Omnibox not focused in newly-opened windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium OS version: 0.5.25.0 (Developer Build 4fcea544** - Mon Dec 21   22:52:51 UTC 2009 - )  Chromium version: 4.0.278.0 (Developer Build 35113)      1. Open a new window with Ctrl-N.      The text cursor should be in the omnibox  but it's not.  If I press Tab   once  it moves there  so I think that Chrome is successfully receiving the   window manager's WM_TAKE_FOCUS message; it's just not assigning GTK's focus   to the omnibox widget correctly.  I'm not sure whether this is a regression   in the Views port or something that's always been there. </pre>
