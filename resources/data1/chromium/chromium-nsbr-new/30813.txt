<title>Issue 30813 -   chromium -    Feature request: Allow extensions to catch right-mouse-down - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33992">r33992</a>   OS + version : Ubuntu 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : KDE/KWin    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Allows this behavior (see e.g.   mouse gesture extensions)  Behavior in Chrome for Windows (optional): Context menu does not appear   until mouse button is released  and extension activity seems to override it   by default.  On Linux and OSX  the context menu appears on mousedown rather than   mouseup  which breaks mouse gesture extensions (a workaround on Linux is to   use the middle button but this is less than ideal because it's not always   easy to gesture with the wheel button and keep it from rotating)    for more description of this see <a title="Right-click context menu shouldn't show before mouseup." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26465"> Issue 26465 </a> </pre>
