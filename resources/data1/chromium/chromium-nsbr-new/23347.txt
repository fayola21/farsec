<title>Issue 23347 -   chromium -    Ctrl - Enter should trump prefilled text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. In the location bar  type the domain of a URL only ('google'  'espn'    'lifehacker')  2. Press 'ctrl - enter'          The location bar will be updated with www.&lt;domain&gt;.com ('www.google.com')   regardless of a site in your history        I visit www.espn.com and www.espn360.com regularly.  Chrome has decided   that espn360.com is my default  so as I start typing 'espn'  it begins   recommending espn360.com  which is fine.  If I were to hit enter  I would   expect that to mean I was accepting the recommendation.    However  if I press 'ctrl-enter'  the browser should not take the   recommendation  and only respect what I have typed.  I should be able to   type e-s-p-n-ctrl-enter and go to www.espn.com every time without having to   watch.    <b>Please provide
