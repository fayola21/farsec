<title>Issue 37231 -   chromium -    The FullTabModeIE_UnloadEventTest fails on the chrome frame builder. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This started since <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40402">revision 40402</a> which basically fetches cookies from the   host browser. Oddly this test always passes on my machine. On the builder it   passes if PatchProtocols is set to 1. Perhaps something to do with timing or   the http equiv patch issuing multiple requests?. I set OptinUrls to * and it   worked.    CC'ing tommi for his input.     </pre>
