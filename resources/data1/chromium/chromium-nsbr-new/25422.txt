<title>Issue 25422 -   chromium -    Subpixel antialiasing disabled when text is above rounded corners - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a title="REGRESSION: Font rendering blurrified" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25365"> issue 25365 </a> for a discussion of why.    agl indicates it'll be pretty hard to bring this back  and it's kinda minor   anyway  so I don't think this is a priority. </pre>
