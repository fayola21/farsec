<title>Issue 43805 -   chromium -    Chrome does not search finance.google.com in the Omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.375.29  OS X 10.6.3    Chrome doesn't search finance.google.com in the omnibar.      1.) Type &quot;finance.google.com&quot; into the omnibar until it auto-completes.  2.) Hit tab key.      The omnibar will enter search mode for finance.google.com and accept stock quote searches.  As an example of how this should work  try it with finance.yahoo.com  and then hitting tab. </pre>
