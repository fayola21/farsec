<title>Issue 31077 -   chromium -    Doesn't start and only prints &quot;Failed to move to new PID namespace: Operation not permitted&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=34537">r34537</a>  OS + version : Linux version 2.6.32-trunk-686 (Debian 2.6.32-2) (gcc version 4.3.4 (Debian 4.3.4-  6) ) #1 SMP Thu Dec 17 00:26:04 UTC 2009  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : Gnome        1. Execute 'google-chrome' from a terminal to see the output.      1. The application should open the GUI window. (it works on my home computer  the only   difference is that 64-bit architecture)      It doesn't open any GUI window  (tested the last two beta revisions for Linux).    I've just installed -unstable version 4.0.266.0-<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=33992">r33992</a> and it has the same behaviour. (WHY does   it try to remove /opt directory?!)
