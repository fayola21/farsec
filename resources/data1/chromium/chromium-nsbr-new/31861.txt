<title>Issue 31861 -   chromium -    request method HTTP DELETE has NOT empty entity-body - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : any             Safari 4: untested    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK        Opera 9: OK       Opera 10: OK        Send any HTTP request with DELETE method        request with DELETE method and empty entity-body (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=fc2616">rfc2616</a>)          request with DELETE method and NOT empty entity-body (which consists string  &quot;undefined&quot;).      Additional information:    <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=FC2616">RFC2616</a> says that &quot;A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the  specification of the request method (section 5.1.1) does not allow sending  an entity-body in requests&quot;. And DELETE method does not allow it.  This mismatch causes an error when using RubyOnRails (in ActionController  module).    </pre>
