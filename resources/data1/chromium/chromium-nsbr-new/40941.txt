<title>Issue 40941 -   chromium -    should return consistent encoding in DOM APIs for URL components - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.1.249.1045  Other browsers tested: IE8  FF36  Safari4  Opera10      1. Load the attached file.  2. Click the &quot;link&quot;.  3. View the results in the text field below the link.        Consistent results across all major browsers.        The browsers convert HTML documents into Unicode. Some of the browsers  then return that Unicode in DOM APIs  while others return the &quot;wire&quot;  format  depending on the URL component. The following results are from  a test case with &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;.    IE8 returns Unicode in all of the major DOM APIs (hostname  pathname  search).    Firefox 3.6 and Opera 10 return Unicode in hostname  but they return  the wire format in pathname and search (%-encoded UTF-8 and %-encoded  original encoding  respectively).    Chrome 4 returns the wire format in hostname  pathname and search. The  wire format for hostname is Punycode.    I asked a co-worker to test Safari 4 on Mac. It returns Unicode in  pathname  but it returns the wire format in hostname and search. </pre>
