<title>Issue 42217 -   chromium -    Apple's last resort font is not used when no font covers a character - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Go to <a href="http://bn.wikipedia.org">http://bn.wikipedia.org</a> (Bengali Wikipedia) without a Bengali font   installed (out of box  Mac OS X doesn't have Bengali font)  2. Do the same in Safari and Firefox    In Safari  the glyph representing Bengali script in Apple's last resort   font is used. In Firefox  the Unicode code points of characters enclosed in   a square (or a rectangle if it's outside BMP) are used.     In Chrome  just a empty square box is used.     This is not a bug per se  but we may consider matching Safari (it's less   useful than that of Firefox for 'debugging'  but for end-users  Safari's   behavior may be considered better).      </pre>
