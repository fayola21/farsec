<title>Issue 32916 -   chromium -    Can't build pyautolib: pyautolib_wrap.cc:870: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors  /chrome/trunk/src/chrome/../xcodebuild/chrome.build/DerivedSources/R  elease/pyautolib_wrap.cc: In function 'void   SWIG_Python_AddErrorMsg(const char*)':  /chrome/trunk/src/chrome/../xcodebuild/chrome.build/DerivedSources/R  elease/pyautolib_wrap.cc:870: warning: format not a string literal and no   format arguments    pyautolib_wrap.cc:870 is        PyErr_Format(PyExc_RuntimeError  mesg);    Apparently  PyErr_Format has declared itself to the compiler as using   printf-style formatting  and the compiler is checking format strings (-  Wformat).  This line should probably be written as        PyErr_Format(PyExc_RuntimeError  &quot;%s&quot;  mesg);    however  pyautolib_wrap.cc is a generated file and I'm not quite sure where   this problem line comes from.    I'm building against the 10.6 SDK in case that makes a difference. </pre>
