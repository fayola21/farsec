<title>Issue 36339 -   chromium -    No title in the active tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071)  URLs (if applicable) : all          Firefox 3.x: OK          Every time I open the Chrome Browser  the active tab's title is empty(no   text at all). The site icon is displayed  but nothing more.       To show the tab's title...      The tab's title is not displayed. However any other non-active tab has a   title. When I change the active tab  the new one has no title  but the now   inactive( previously active :) ) tab has its proper title.   </pre>
