<title>Issue 23829 -   chromium -    Mac: refactor TabController and its target  etc. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Probably a lot of things could be reorganized to be a bit more sensible:    - the current separation between TabWindowController and  BrowserWindowController probably isn't optimal (e.g.  the former has no  access to the TabStripController)  - does the TabView really need access to its controller?  - the TabController's target is a pain to manage  since we have to  explicitly make sure that it doesn't go stale    I want to rethink the way the tabs are handled.... </pre>
