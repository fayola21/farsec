<title>Issue 34390 -   chromium -    timeupdate event stops working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Play a video in html5 video player (YouTube's is one example  seen this   on <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">http://jilion.com/sublime/video</a> as well)      Timeupdate events should fire reliabily.      Sometimes the progress bar will stop moving. Debug output shows this is   because the JavaScript stops receiving timeupdate events  even though the   video still plays. This does not happen 100% of the time  but it does   happen pretty frequently for me in Linux and Windows (Vista &amp; 7).     <b>Please provide
