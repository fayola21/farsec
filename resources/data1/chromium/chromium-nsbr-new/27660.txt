<title>Issue 27660 -   chromium -    Handle HTTP AUTH for shared worker network requests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We need to gracefully handle HTTP auth for shared worker network requests.   We have a couple of options here:    1) Always fail network requests that need HTTP Auth  2) Pop up the HTTP Auth dialog on the parent tab (if there are more than one    just pick one at random).  3) Pop up the HTTP Auth dialog on every tab  but once the user enters creds   on one  close all the rest.    I'm leaning towards #2 or #1 (#2 might actually be the current behavior - I   have to test this). </pre>
