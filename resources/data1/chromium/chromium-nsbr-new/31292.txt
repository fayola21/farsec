<title>Issue 31292 -   chromium -    Drag and drop events are fired in the wrong order - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> According to the latest HTML5 draft at <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-</a>  apps/current-work/#dnd the drop event should fire before the dragend event   but on Chromium Windows this is not the case. This works correctly on Mac and   Linux as well as on Safari Windows. </pre>
