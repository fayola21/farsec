<title>Issue 38555 -   chromium -    Need to decide on smallest icon sizes for extensions - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently define 16x16 (bitty)  32x32 (small)  48x48 (medium)  128x128   (ginormous). :)    During the initial extension infobar implementation we had a discussion on   what the right size is for extension icons within the infobar.    A regular infobar uses 26x26 icon  but extension infobars need the icon to be   a menubutton (which shows a highlight rect on hover)  so 26x26 is too large   because the highlight rect is clipped.    We ended up using a 16x16 icon  but decided we might want have the bitty size   be 19x19  which would look better. However  32x32 doesn't scale well down to   19x19. We then decided to press ahead with 16x16  so this bug is filed to   make sure we don't forget to revisit the decision on minimum size.    Aaron said he wanted to think about this some more  so I'm assigning the bug   to the thinker. :) </pre>
