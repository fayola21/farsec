<title>Issue 42213 -   chromium -    drover should allow multiple reverts in a single commit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I wanted to revert a commit  but it had a followon commit to fix a compile   error  so if I just reverted one of the two  it would break the build.  It   would be nice to do this in one step rather than just relying on the slow   builders or hand-editing.   </pre>
