<title>Issue 32051 -   chromium -    Popup-menu clicking issue - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Use Google Chrome on Windows7 for a period of time.  2. Right click on a link to get a popup menu  then try to quickly click on   the &quot;Open in new tab&quot; option.        A new tab should immediately be opened  and the menu should disappear.      Sometimes the menu does not respond or is slow. The menu remains open and   the click did not trigger any event. This bug does happen quite regularly   while I use the Browser.    <b>Please provide
