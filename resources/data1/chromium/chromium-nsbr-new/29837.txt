<title>Issue 29837 -   chromium -    Modularize ConflictResolver (conflict resolution in general) for other data types - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Most data types don't need to have resolution logic as complicated as what we   have for bookmarks  however they will all need to have a basic way to   reconcile unapplied updates and unsynced items.  Since data types are   independent it seems to make the most sense to separate this part out into   customizable components.      It is not totally clear (to me  at least) if certain types that may not require   granular field-by-field deliberation such as Preferences and autofill could   share a generic resolution scheme  but it doesn't sound crazy to me either.  I   think this bug could warrant a minor investigation to document each type    and their respective requirements from a conflict resolution point of view.  </pre>
