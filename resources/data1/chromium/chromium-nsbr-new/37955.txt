<title>Issue 37955 -   chromium -    Extension options use of localStorage in multiuser/enterprise environments - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1.) Currently all extensions use web localStorage for options settings  which is a K/V pair stored   in a SQLITE 3 db file in a Profile.    2.)  The K/V are arbitrary String values (that can be fairly complex  as Values are typically JSON   serialized Strings in a number of extensions).    3.) You're operating in a multiuser (Linux  Windows  etc) environment where you're the admin   and you want to distribute/use an extension (say x.y.z)  but control options for the extension (say   everyone should have option &quot;bar&quot; of x.y.z set to &quot;foo&quot;). This becomes fairly complex due to the   use of multi-value structures (i.e. the use of JSON  etc) where you end up doing combines (i.e.   merging the 'admin settings' with the 'user settings').    4.) The admin would prefer a pull model (i.e. one place to make changes and not have to push   them out to individual users).    So what's the best way of accomplishing this? </pre>
