<title>Issue 27248 -   chromium -    Notification dialogs should not show up in chrome.extensions.getExtensionTabs() - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It looks like the notification system is using TabContents  which is causing   its windows to be returned by chrome.extensions.getExtensionTabs(). Those   should be filtered out  and maybe we should also add a   chrome.extension.getNotificationWindows() ? </pre>
