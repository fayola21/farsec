<title>Issue 30654 -   chromium -    Add &quot;Check for update...&quot; to extension right-click context menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Summary says it all. Related to <a title="should be able to uninstall extensions by right-clicking on them" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29538"> issue 29538 </a>.    Requires:  -Ability to check if updated version of extension is out there. Couldn't you   just use code that's executed when user clicks &quot;Update extensions now&quot; in   Extensions window?    -UI to indicate the extension has been updated. Could probably reuse the   popup that shows when an extension has been installed  then just change the   wording. </pre>
