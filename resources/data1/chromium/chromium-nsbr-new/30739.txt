<title>Issue 30739 -   chromium -    Delete &quot;most visited&quot; site button on wrong side - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  OS version               : 10.6.2    On Mac OS X &quot;close&quot; buttons generally go on the left - for windows  tabs    etc.  However  in the New Tab page  the delete button for thumbnail is on   the right.      1. Open a new tab  2. Try to delete a site from your &quot;most visited&quot; sites by hovering over the   thumbnail for a second  then clicking on the upper lefthand corner      The site is removed from my &quot;most visited&quot; sites.      The site is pinned to my &quot;most visited&quot; sites - the exact opposite of what I   tried to do. </pre>
