<title>Issue 32404 -   chromium -    catch when tests are stuck in a loop and kill them as if they aren't creating output - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Interactive%20Tests%2">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Interactive%20Tests%2</a>  0(dbg)/builds/19853/steps/interactive_ui_tests/logs/stdio    is currently repeating this line over and over:  C:bslavechromium-dbg-  builderbuildsrcchrometestin_process_browser_test.cc(299): error: Test   timed out. Each test runs for a max of 30000 ms (kInitialTimeoutInMS).    I've seen things like this before on Linux and Mac.  Should the scripts that   catch when a bot hasn't sent any output for a length of time keep track of the   last line of output and if it repeats 100(?) times  consider the test wedged and   kill it?  That way it won't require manual intervention. </pre>
