<title>Issue 29639 -   chromium -    Chrome opens a new tab for links when an existing  unused clear tab is already open - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.27  URLs (if applicable) : N/A  OS version               :  10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): If window has an open tab  but   has no URL open in it (i.e. it's blank)  a link from a third-party application   is opened in that tab  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Firefox behaves as Chrome currently   does  opening a new tab despite there being a blank tab already open.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unable to test.      1. Open Chrome  2. Open a new tab using Cmd + T  3. Go to a third-party application (in my own case  it's a Dashboard widget)   and open a URL from it.  4. Chrome will open another new tab to display the page.       If window has an open tab  but has no URL open in it (i.e. it's blank)  a link   from a third-party application should be opened in that tab (consistent   with Safari).      Chrome opens a new tab to display the page  instead of using an existing   blank tab.    Note: I'm filing this as a Safari user  who's finding this highly frustrating.   Chrome's current behaviour is consistent with how Firefox behaves (not   that this make it 'correct' in my mind). </pre>
