<title>Issue 26405 -   chromium -    Tabs not resizing under certain conditions. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	4.0.222.5 (Official Build 28804)  OS                   : Jolicloud Alpha  URLs (if applicable) : Not Applicable  Other browsers tested: Not Applicable      1.open enough tabs to make them shrink  2.close a middle tab      tabs should resize to fit the screen again      tabs move to the left but don't resize    NOTES: Also makes it so that if the right-most tab is closed then they   resize to wherever IT was. So try opening a LOT of tabs  then closing a   bunch of middle ones  and then the right-most. You'll see what I mean.    Sorry  no screenshot currently available. </pre>
