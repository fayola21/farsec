<title>Issue 39770 -   chromium -    onmouseover event isn't fired until the mouse moves - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.360.0 (Developer Build 0)  Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.6    Consider the case where you have an onmouseover event on some element on a   page. The user loads the page  positions their mouse over the element  and   then hits F5 to refresh. On my instance of Chromium  the onmouseover event   isn't fired until the mouse moves. In Firefox  the onmouseover event is fired   immediately (so there's no need to move the mouse).    It seems like the intention here is that the onmouseover event should fire   immediately  so that's what Chromium should do. </pre>
