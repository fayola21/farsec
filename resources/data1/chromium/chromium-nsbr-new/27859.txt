<title>Issue 27859 -   chromium -    Text box text selection inverts improperly based on mouse location - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. When in a text box  select part of the text  so that a few characters at   the end of a string are selected.  2. While still holding the mouse down during selection  move the mouse to   the right off the text box  or down below the text box.  3. In both cases the text selection reverses itself before revsersing   itself again to select the text you had intended to select.        The text that is selected does not invert based on location of the mouse   pointer. The text that is selected stays selected as long as the mouse is   to the right of the selection start.        The text selection inverts. So if this was the string in the text box:   &quot;This is a string&quot;  and I selected this part &quot;This is [a string]&quot;  by   moving the mouse to the right or down this part of the text becomes   selected: &quot;[This is ]a string&quot;. As the mouse moves past a certain distance   it flips back to &quot;This is [a string]&quot;.     <b>Please provide
