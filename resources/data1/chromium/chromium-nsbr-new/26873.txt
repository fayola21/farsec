<title>Issue 26873 -   chromium -    A couple of places in window assumes that NativeView type is same as NativeWindow. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> A couple of places in window assumes that NativeView type is same as   NativeWindow. This is not true on Linux and it is forcing to use platform  specific piece of code. See FindBarPageControllerTest::AcceleratorResotring   test in find_bar_host_browsertest.cc as an example.    We need to cleanup the API and code to make it platform independent. </pre>
