<title>Issue 42277 -   chromium -    Unable to Sign out when Terminal is open - chromium crash is seen - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome OS	0.7.40.1 (Official Build ab645f5f)  Google Chrome	5.0.382.0 (Official Build 44948)  Type of computer   :  Eee PC      1. Login as chrome OS   2. Open terminal  3. Open some webpages   including a video / audio file (not sure if   video/audio is necessary).  4. Leave system idle to go to see screensaver  5. Unlock system and Sign out.      Expected :  Login screen should appear on Sign out.    Actual :   - Once all browsers were closed but Terminal remained open.  - Another time  Chrome browser crash was seen. Terminal did not close in   second case also. Signout kept crashing the browser and system had to be   rebooted to get to Login screen.     # So far issue could be reproed 2 times. Dumps for second scenario -   </pre>
