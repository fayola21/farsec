<title>Issue 24427 -   chromium -    The IPC sync channel dispatches messages out of sequence if multiple sync channels are used in the same thread - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If multiple IPC sync channels are used within the listener thread and  dispatch nested messages  then the sync message call stack does not unwind in   the expected order  i.e. the outermost call completing first  etc. This can   be easily reproduced if message pumping is turned on for the sync messages   being sent in this context.    The innermost sync calls complete and we incorrectly terminate the outermost   sync calls message loop which leads to crashes.    This crash is observed intermittently if the accessibility code is enabled.    I have added a unit test in ipc_tests which exhibits this problem </pre>
