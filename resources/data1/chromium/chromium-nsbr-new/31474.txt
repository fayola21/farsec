<title>Issue 31474 -   chromium -    random tab crashes on okcupid - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.287.0 (35422)  OS + version : Ubuntu Linux 9.10  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32-bit  window manager : compiz  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profileedit?edit=details">http://www.okcupid.com/profileedit?edit=details</a>    Tried creating an account on okcupid.com  and it seems chromium had silent   problems in doing so. Ended up creating the account in Firefox.    Later on  tried to edit basic info in <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profileedit?">http://www.okcupid.com/profileedit?</a>  edit=details ; about one out of 2 tries  the chromium tab crashes when   hitting the Save button on that page. Haven't quite figured out the logic   behind this bug  just thought I'd report it. </pre>
