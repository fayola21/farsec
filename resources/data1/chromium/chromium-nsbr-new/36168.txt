<title>Issue 36168 -   chromium -    2x increase in safebrowsing gethash requests from chrome 4.0.249.78 to 4.0.249.89 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.89    We noticed that the number of hash server requests from Chrome users  has increased by a factor of two since you launched Chrome 4.0.249.89.    Note that those requests all return a HTTP 200 which means  that the hash prefix matched the blacklist.  Do you have any idea what  change could cause this increase in gethash requests?  Did you change  the way gethash responses are cached?  Are you checking more  resources?     </pre>
