Absolutely love the features offered by google translator. Am able to  translate from French or German to English. makes reading a lot of  documents easier.    Pls enable this service for Tamil at the earliest. With over 80 million  speakers and as the official language in countries such as India  Srilanka   Singapore  Malaysia and Mauritius and with a sizeable number of IT  developers of Tamil roots  I am sure your team is working on it. Can't wait  to have it on board soon.     Cheers </pre>
