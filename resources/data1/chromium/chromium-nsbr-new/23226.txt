<title>Issue 23226 -   chromium -    &quot;ask me where to save downloads&quot; + theme install == download prompt - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have &quot;ask me where to save downloads&quot; checked in options. When I choose to   apply a theme (e.g. on   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_stargazing.html">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_stargazing.html</a>) I get a   download box asking me where to save the theme. This is not at all what I   expect when I click a box labeled &quot;apply&quot;. I assume this is because it's re-  using the download mechanism  but this seems broken. </pre>
