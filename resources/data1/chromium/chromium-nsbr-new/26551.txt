<title>Issue 26551 -   chromium -    Bookmark manager sync UI doesn't show the expired credentials error - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Start chrome and provide a --sync-url to a server which expire the login   cookie after a minute or so.  2. Enable sync by going to &quot;Tools Menu&quot; -&gt; &quot;Sync my bookmarks...&quot;.  3. Restart the browser after a minute and open the bookmark manager.  4. Observe.    What is the expected output?     The bookmark bar as well as the bookmark manager should show a sync error   UI to notify the user that their credentials expired and that they need to   re-login.    What do you see instead?    The bookmark bar correctly displays the &quot;Sync error&quot; UI. The bookmarks   manager  on the other hand  still shows &quot;Synced to foo@gmail.com&quot;.       </pre>
