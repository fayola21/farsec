<title>Issue 37871 -   chromium -    Display Unicode URL Characters as a Different Color to Prompt Users About Potential Domain Spoofs. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm not entirely certain about the feasibility of this  but it seems like   Chrome should be able to display the URL characters in a different color if   they're Unicode and not a subset of the Latin ranges.     This could help users fend against domain spoofs and fishing. And it would   generally disambiguate between Unicode characters which look similar to one   another. In fact  it might prove useful to have each Unicode script type be   a slightly different color (but still readable against a white background).   Latin vs. Cyrillic seems to be the biggest issue in my mind  but there are   undoubtedly numerous other characters which look quite similar.  </pre>
