<title>Issue 39562 -   chromium -    Why use slang English &quot;Nope&quot; when the correct English is a perfectly simple &quot;No&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It is sad to see that Google is using slang English with the word &quot;Nope&quot;    when asking if one wants a translation  rather than the perfectly simple and   correct word &quot;No&quot;.     Why does Google do this and set a bad example for everyone  including those   learning the language? </pre>
