<title>Issue 40343 -   chromium -    REGRESSION - Accessible Information from many areas are appearing as NAMELESS. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some stuff has been broken in the accessibility portion due to <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=43448">r43448</a>  such   as:   - Tab names.  - Extension group.  - Browser Actions names.    Currently screen readers will not see the accessible information for each tab   since its removed. Marking it as P1 for that matter.     </pre>
