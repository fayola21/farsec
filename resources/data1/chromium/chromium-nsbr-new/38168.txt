<title>Issue 38168 -   chromium -    Feature Request: Shortcut to use current site's search engine - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3 (Offici��_��_le build 41124) dev             Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    1. Let's say I'm searching for a couple of movies  and I have &quot;imdb&quot; as   keyword to search imdb.com.  2. I want to search for Movie A so in the addressbar I typ   &quot;imdb&quot;+tab+&quot;Movie A&quot;  3. Then I want to search for Movie B  4. I want to just press ctrl+shift+F (or something) which would focus the   addressbar and have the imdb.com search engine enabled already (as if I   just typed &quot;imdb&quot;+tab)  optionally with the last search selected in it   already    Added image of what I would like  I hope it's clear enough </pre>
