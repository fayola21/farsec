<title>Issue 40504 -   chromium -    History and Cache limits - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK    I think Chrome should have some default limitations for history and cache.   Because after a while it becomes unstable and it can be resolved by clear   browsing data and you know many users can't find that solution  dislike and   leave chrome.    see <a title="Problems accessing some websites"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=38470">issue 38470</a> and <a title="Cache needs clearing quite often"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33608">issue 33608</a> </pre>
