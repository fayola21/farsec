<title>Issue 40243 -   chromium -    FR: Sync &quot;Search Engine&quot; settings to the Cloud - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Using &quot;Edit Search Engine...&quot;  I've create a considerable number of customized Search Engines   (work related  personal  etc.). If my Chrome profile is lost somehow (hardware failure  user error    etc.)  then these will be lost and I'd have to rebuild the list. Also  when I switch computers  my list   is different (or not available until I manually rebuild it)  so that's an inconvenience there too.    I know I could build OpenSearch Description Documents in .xml for each one  and then make   them available on a web page  but I think users everywhere will appreciate that Chrome uses the   Cloud for the Search Engine feature to remember who they  much like BookMark Sync already   does that for them.    Remember: Chrome is AWESOME  so this will increase its AWESOMENESS even more. This is very   important ;)    EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: Please make this feature available for the MAC OS X version first.    Thanks guys and keep on rocking!   </pre>
