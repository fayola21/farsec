<title>Issue 31167 -   chromium -    Feature: Be notified what extension made Chrome page crash. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0  OS + version : Debian Squeeze  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 64-bit  window manager : Gnome/Openbox          Hi  recently Chrome was crashing with (Ah no) when trying to login on Orkut   page. After some time I discovered that an extension called AdBlock+   Element Hiding Helper was causing the problem.  To make the process of discover the problem easier  I think Chrome should   notify users of what extension is causing the crash. (Of course this   notification will be only for crashes caused by extensions)      </pre>
