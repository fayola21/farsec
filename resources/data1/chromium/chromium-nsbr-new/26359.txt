<title>Issue 26359 -   chromium -    ProfileSyncServiceTestHarness needs reliable metric for determining when syncing is &quot;done&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We currently look at some counters that aren't really accurate.    The best way to fix this is might be to compute the maximum item revision in   the syncable::Directory for each client  and when the client that made a   change gets has no unsynced entries remaining  have the other client wait   until the max item revision counts are equal.  This may need to repeat if any   changes rebound; we may also want to look at the changes_remaining value.    Although this is only sanctioned for UI and not for core syncing logic  it   may be a good hint/indicator for our test infrastructure. </pre>
