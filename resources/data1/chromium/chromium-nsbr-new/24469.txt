<title>Issue 24469 -   chromium -    Provide method to reduce as much V8 memory usage as possible - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> V8 has a couple different functions to reduce memory:    Heap::IdleNotification()  Heap::CollectAllGarbage()    In my MemoryPurger class  I want to be able to have V8 dump as much memory   as possible.  Right now I'm calling IdleNotification() in a loop.  Ivan and   James were looking at the implementation and wondering if that would   actually be effective -- maybe it needs to do more mark/sweeps before a   mark/compact  or maybe multiple compacts  or maybe spin some event loop   between compacts  or whatever.    Resolving this bug consists of changing code if needed and then giving me   instructions on what to do as a consumer to direct V8 to reduce to the   minimum possible footprint. </pre>
