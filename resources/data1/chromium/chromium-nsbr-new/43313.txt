<title>Issue 43313 -   chromium -    Chromium steals focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0 (0)      1. Open Chromium  2. Open another application from which you open a link (like a RSS read  a   mail client  etc.)  3. Chromium steals focus and appears in front.      Chromium should stay in the back  like other browsers  or at least this   should be configurable.  It is very annoying when you are working from another app. For instance    when you are on an RSS reader  you are going to open many links for further   reading. Every time  Chrome shows up obliging you to switch back to the RSS   reader.  I know there are some workarounds thanks to the window manager  but they   are not practical and have side effects.    It used to be alright  but the two last version of Chromium have obviously   brought this change.    Please switch back to the old behaviour.   </pre>
