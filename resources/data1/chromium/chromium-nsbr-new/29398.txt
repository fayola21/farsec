<title>Issue 29398 -   chromium -    'Close all firefox windows' doesn't work on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have Firefox running  2. Perform a brand new install (or otherwise trigger an 'install from   Firefox')  3. Message reads 'close all firefox windows' so do that. It still asks you to   close all windows.        On Mac  it should say 'Close all firefox windows  and quit it from the dock'        It doesn't mention the dock  so Firefox is still running.    <b>Please provide
