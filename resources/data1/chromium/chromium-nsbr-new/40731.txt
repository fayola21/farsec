<title>Issue 40731 -   chromium -    Include &quot;install date&quot; in crash report - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have &quot;selection bias&quot; hypothesis that some new users may see more   crashes than average and stop using Chrome. To evaluate the situation  we   want to measure/study the crashes new Chrome users experience. One idea Jim   has is including &quot;install date&quot; in crash reporting.    &quot;I think another action item was to push the &quot;install date&quot; into the data   sent in a crash dump.  There was a lot of discussion of new-user   crashyness  and it would be much better to know *which* crashes were new   users  than to know if new users were more crashy.    We already have the install date in a local pref (I verified its presence)    so it should be &quot;easy&quot;(?) to place it where it will be uploaded in a crash   dump.  Optimally  it would be good if our crash system could parse it out    so that we can filter/select/aggregate/count such data.  We'd then have the   best of both worlds: Stats... and lits of crashes&quot;   </pre>
