<title>Issue 31143 -   chromium -    UI not redrawn after exiting fullscreen mode; eventual crash  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chromium version: 4.0.278.0 (Developer Build 35113)      1. Open a second tab and enter fullscreen mode by hitting F11.  2. Hit Ctrl-W to close the tab.      We should maybe exit fullscreen mode at this point  but we don't.    Sometimes another tab is displayed fullscreen  but other times I end up   with a solid gray screen.  Chrome sometimes segfaults when I mouse over the   exit-fullscreen bubble here.  If it doesn't  and I click the exit-  fullscreen link  the omnibox becomes visible  but nothing else in the UI   is.  I'm able to trigger a crash reliably at this point by hitting F12   twice to enter and leave overview mode (with the effect of refocusing the   Chrome window  I guess)  and then hitting Ctrl-T to create a new tab. </pre>
