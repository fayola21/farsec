<title>Issue 42088 -   chromium -    Space at start of search box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Press Ctrl + F or Page icon &gt; Find.  2. Type a space followed by a letter(s).        Should find everything that matches.      I typed ' m' into the search box  a space and then an m. At first it doesn't   show the 'X of Y' count it normally shows. To get that to show I had to   press Enter  and it then said '5 of 4'. Matches were highlighted but it   wouldn't then cycle through them when I pressed Enter. There was actually a   lot more matches than it said; typing an m and then adding a space before it   found lots of matches.    <b>Please provide
