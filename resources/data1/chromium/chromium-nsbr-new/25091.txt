<title>Issue 25091 -   chromium -    Multiple threads in exception handler - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In dumps we are seeing more than one thread in the crash handler   (UnhandledExceptionFilter)  for example reportid=eaafcf620fd7f7f4    We somehow assumed that the crash hander was serializing them but upon   careful inspection there is nothing to slow down two threads so that causes   problems when in the browser process we are trying to restart the browser  we   can end up spawning to browser processes very close in time with the same   command line. This can cause crashes or weird behavior.   </pre>
