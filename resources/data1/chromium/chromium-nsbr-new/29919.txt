<title>Issue 29919 -   chromium -    Gmail checker extension memory leak -- 400mb in one day - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Found this on Twitter.    <a href="http://twitpic.com/su2ra">http://twitpic.com/su2ra</a>    &quot;Google Chrome Beta for Linux after leaving it open for a night. Guess it's   back to Firefox.&quot;    It seems there must be a leak both browser and extension-side. </pre>
