<title>Issue 31573 -   chromium -    No Chrome in Program list  but Chrome install detects a system installation in place - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I do not have a working version of Chrome installed in my Windows 7   however  when I try to install the latest version of Chrome it advises I  have a system installed version which must be removed first. I have tried  the registry fix and removed all instances in Regedit. The new Chrome  install still detects a system installed version running. I really am at a  loss now on how to remove the 'system' installed version as there is  nothing to remove that I can find. What files or registry entries other  than 'chrome' do I need to delete to remove the instance? </pre>
