Drag bookmark from Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar and drop on Chrome   Bookmarks Bar.    What is the expected output?  ----------------------------  Bookmark title should be retained.  If FF bookmark title was &quot;Google &quot;  it should be the same in Chrome.    What do you see instead?  ------------------------  Title of new bookmark is now base address of old bookmark.  e.g. FF bookmark title was &quot;Google&quot;  Chrome bookmark title is   &quot;www.google.com&quot;.   </pre>
