<title>Issue 38292 -   chromium -    Microsoft Active Accessibility: no way to get the *name* html attribute of web controls - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.3 (Build officiel 41124) dev with  &quot;--enable-renderer-accessibility&quot; option    I am using Microsoft Active Accessibility to enumerate the content of a web  page. I would like to get the *name* html attribute of each object.    accName property contains the *title* html attribute (not the *name* html  attribute). Even if the Microsoft documentation is not very clear about it  (it says &quot;The IAccessible::get_accName method retrieves the *name* of the  specified object)  I suppose Chrome works fine (Firefox and Internet  Explorer also puts the *title* html attribute in accName).    The problem is that html fields do not always have a *title*... A good  example on &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin">https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin</a>&quot; page : login and  password fields do not have a *title* (but they have a *name*)  so there is  no way to recognize them when enumerating objets and getting accName.    Could you provide a way to get the *name* html attribute of web controls?  For example  with Firefox you can get a ISimpleDOMNode pointer that give  you access to a lot of informations on a specific HTML object. </pre>
