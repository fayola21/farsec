<title>Issue 44703 -   chromium -    Layers under &lt;video&gt; are repainted on every video frame  which hurts performance. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Play HTML5 video on YouTube or vimeo.com  maximize the video so that it   is close to full-screen.  2. Run profiler (e.g. oprofile)  3. Check profiler results: about 10% of cpu time is wasted in   sk_memset32_SSE2() which is called from SkARGB32_Blitter::blitRect() (names   of the functions will be different on Mac because Mac doesn't use Skia  but   the problem affects all platforms including Mac). The blitRect is called   for each layer under the video  and twice for the root layer  which boils   to 6 blitRect() calls for the whole video area (up to 150 calls per   second).  Problem is in WebKit: RenderLayer::paintLayer(): it doesn't check that   child layers cover the region being refreshed  and so each layer always   paints itself even when it is not necessary. There doesn't seem to be any   existing mechanism to detect fully opaque areas  so it may need to be added   to fix this issue. O   </pre>
