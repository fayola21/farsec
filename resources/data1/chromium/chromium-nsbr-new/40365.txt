<title>Issue 40365 -   chromium -    (GTK/Linux) Bookmarks bar should function more robustly and intuitively - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This bug tracks work I'm doing on making the bookmarks toolbar more robust   and similar to other browsers' bars.  There are quite a few issues  so I'm   lumping them together here:    - Popup folder contents menus when dragged over to allow dragging bookmarks   into nested bookmark folders   (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30363">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30363</a>)  - Popup folder contents during long mouse-downs  in addition to the current   click-to-open behavior  - Allow dragging bookmarks to a space in the toolbar between two bookmark   folders (currently the bookmark will land in one folder or the other)  - Use custom highlighting on drags over bookmark folders instead of gtk   default highlighting </pre>
