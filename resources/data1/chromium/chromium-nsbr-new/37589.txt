<title>Issue 37589 -   chromium -    &quot;Recently Closed&quot; consistently opens wrong URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 4.0.249.89      1. Open New Tab page.  2. Click on recently closed link X.      Link X opens.      Link Y opens.    This has been going on for weeks  possibly months. I'm guessing it's   something to do with my profile  since otherwise  this bug would have been   spotted by now. </pre>
