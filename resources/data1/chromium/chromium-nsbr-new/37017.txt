<title>Issue 37017 -   chromium -    new popup blocking UI is even less discoverable than previous - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 (Official Build 39691) dev                    1. Click on the link that should generate popup window      Popup window appears. If it was blocked  then at least  there is a visible   notification that it was blocked and could be unblocked.      Before last versions  the notification was in the bottom-right corner. It   was much less visible than in Firefox  but after some time people became   accustomed to it  and looked for it if the window didn't appear.    Today  I spent ~10 minutes trying to figure out what's happening with the   popups on ubs.ch. After that  I found that there is new popup-blocking UI   in the URL bar - next to https lock.     This is absolutely unnoticeable and undiscoverable. Should be much more   visible. At least  reversion to the previous UI would be improvement. </pre>
