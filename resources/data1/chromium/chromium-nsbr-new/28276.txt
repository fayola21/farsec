<title>Issue 28276 -   chromium -    Can't dump symbols from official builds when Chrome is linked with --gc-section - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32330">r32330</a> cut the Chrome binary size down by quite a bit  but now dump_syms  can no longer get the STABS symbols out of it.    If <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32330">r32330</a> is getting merged into 249  then this is a release blocker. </pre>
