<title>Issue 45580 -   chromium -    Implement a cryptographically strong Math.random on Chrome - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From: <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/jscrypto.pdf">http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/jscrypto.pdf</a>    &gt; Javascript exposes a random number generator as  &gt; Math.random. Unfortunately  except in Safari on Windows  &gt; (and Safari on Mac after <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=39510">revision 39510</a>)  this function  &gt; is not cryptographically strong  and determining its strength  &gt; would rely on potentially brittle browser version detection  &gt; code in Javascript. Firefox and Internet Explorer use linear  &gt; congruential generators  and so does Chrome (even though  &gt; Chrome is based on WebKit  it does not use WebKit��_��_��_s  &gt; Javascript implementation).    Even when Safari is the only browser that seems to have a safe random   number generator  Chrome would benefit from it  since it's known that some   applications use random numbers to create security-sensitive secret values   (even if they shouldn't).    In my opinion  we don't need to give any assurances to developers  since   this would be a Chrome/Safari only feature  and we understand that for   performance we may not want to make Math.random crypto-safe  but maybe we   can provide an API that provides a safer random number generator for   applications that decide to do cryptographic operations in the browser.    The following options could be taken:  1. Make Math.random() crypto secure  2. Make Math.secureRandom()  3. Make crypto.random(size)    Greetings </pre>
