<title>Issue 30125 -   chromium -    middle click on omnibox should replace current url - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the user has a URL in the selection clipboard  middle clicking on the   omnibox should load said URL (replace the current URL).    Maybe this should only happen if the omnibox doesn't already have focus  but   I suspect it doesn't matter much either way.   </pre>
