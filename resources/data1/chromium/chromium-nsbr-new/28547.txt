<title>Issue 28547 -   chromium -    Chrome causing -10810 errors? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This isn't a real report yet  but this has been bugging me.    I switched to Chrome as my primary browser on an original black MacBook. Ever since I've done so   I've been forced to reboot my Mac every few days or so as things keep breaking down.    It's a general failure to launch applications. Double-clicking an app yields a -10810 error  which is   in the Launch Services area but undefined. It's not process exhaustion (as a search for &quot;10810&quot; will   tell you)  as this time I had the Terminal up and running. Something killed the authentication   machinery  as popping up a new terminal window gave:    Password:  Login incorrect  login: avi  Password:  Login incorrect  login:     Trying to do a clean reboot:    mac:~ avidriss$ sudo restart now  sudo: unknown uid: 501    mac:~ avidriss$ su  su: who are you?    Ow.    I have zero evidence that this is Chromium  other than the correlation to its installation. I don't want   to blame it  so leave this as Unconfirmed for now and assigned to me. But has anyone heard of this   or experienced it? </pre>
