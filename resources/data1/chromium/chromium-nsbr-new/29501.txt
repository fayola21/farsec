<title>Issue 29501 -   chromium -    Mac: should have &quot;Google/Yahoo!/Bing Search...&quot; item in Edit -&gt; Find menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (with Opt-Cmd-F as keyboard shortcut)  like Safari. This would focus the   Omnibox and insert '?'.    This will help make (a) using the Omnibox to search more discoverable  and   (b) also make the '?' feature of the Omnibox more discoverable.    Mostly though  I want to get Opt-Cmd-F as a keyboard shortcut for free.   Possibly Cmd-K should also do this; see <a title="Apple-K (Command-K) should focus omnibar" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=19783"> issue 19783 </a>.    Any objections to this (the menu item and Opt-Cmd-F -- I'm ambivalent on   the Cmd-K shortcut)? </pre>
