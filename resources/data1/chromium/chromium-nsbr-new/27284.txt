<title>Issue 27284 -   chromium -    When dragging tabs  a browser window that touches the menu bar should accept drops on the menu bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have one chrome window that is maximized vertically (or just touches   the menu bar at the top)  2. Try to drag a tab from another window to the window from step 1  but   miss and hit a few pixels too high        The window should accept the drag anyways  and the life preview should   look accordingly (&quot;mile-high drop target&quot;)        Dropping a tab with the cursor over the menu bar creates a new window.    This is up for UI team discussion first. </pre>
