<title>Issue 38087 -   chromium -    Race condition in location bar loads useless AJAX URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Browse around for a couple months  2. Type a single letter in the location bar  3. Observe that some random garbage is loaded instead of what you   wanted            Expected result is that if I type the letter &quot;a&quot; and the URL bar shows   &quot;arstechnica.com&quot; as the first completion result  I should go to   arstechnica.com upon hitting the return key.        What happens instead is that I go to api.tweetmeme.com  an advertising   site I've never intentionally visited.    <b>Please provide
