Leave some tabs open and have option to restore tabs on startup.  2. Restart the browser      All tabs are opened correctly with no rendering issues.      The tab that has focus on start (and had focus before restart) may appear   in limited area on page  introducing scrollbars  it can be both web-page   and the New Tab Page.    Navigating to other pages using hyperlinks or refreshing the page doesn't   resolve the issue.  Navigating to other pages using bookmarks or address bar returns the tab to   expected behaviour  scrollbars appear where they should  all space is used   for rendering.     </pre>
