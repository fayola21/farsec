<title>Issue 44123 -   chromium -    Drop down lists are misbehaving! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.396.0    When choosing an option from a SELECT list  and using the mouse for it  most   of the times its hard to get chrome to accept our choice... it ignores it and   returns to the previous selected choice.    A classic example is Google Translate. Try to choose other languages from the   drop down boxes and then translate  see what happens...    This is a high priority as this is like this for many version already  with   no fix. It always has driven me crazy  but now I'm about to get hospitalized   for this... </pre>
