<title>Issue 41284 -   chromium -    Disallow extension APIs to apps - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't want to leak proprietary Chrome extension APIs to the web  so we will be explicitly   disallowing all normal extension APIs to &quot;apps&quot;. This should also allow us to have a lighter-  weight install experience for apps  since their permissions are less scary.    This work involves two steps:    1- Disallow certain combinations of manifest declarations during manifest parse  2- Disallow access to extension APIs that are currently always enabled to app pages (eg   chrome.extension.*) </pre>
