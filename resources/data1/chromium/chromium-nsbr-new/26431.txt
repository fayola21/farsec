<title>Issue 26431 -   chromium -    On setting Chrome as default browser  loss of immediate icon history - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    Other browsers tested:N/A         Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: N/A           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A    What steps will reproduce the problem? Remove Chrome as default browse and   then set it as default browser again.      1.On Ubuntu Chrome was not my default browser.  Once I made it my default   browser  it did NOT lose my complete history  but it did lose part that   displays 8 latest entries on the screen.        It should retain the earlier 8 displayed URLs' icons      It had only 2 icons  one for welcome screen and another for Chrome themes.            Please see the attached screen shot.  Besides the 2 icons I mentioned   above  there is a third one of IMDB website that I visited right after I   made Chrome my default browser.  I am using the latest release of 64 bit   Ubuntu 9.10 with 2.6.28-16-generic kernel. </pre>
