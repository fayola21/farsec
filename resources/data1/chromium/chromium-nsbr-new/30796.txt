<title>Issue 30796 -   chromium -    Support binaries need to be added to the .zip files created by Chromium OS bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrom{e|ium} for Chrom{e|ium} OS depends on some support binaries that are   built as a part of the browser build process.  These aren't currently   getting bundled into the zip files that are created by either the official   builders or the continuous/nightly builders.  Can we get them added for both   Chrome and Chromium?  They are called &quot;session&quot; and   &quot;emit_login_prompt_ready&quot; and get dropped next to the browser binary when   the build is done. </pre>
