<title>Issue 30575 -   chromium -    Problems importing bookmarks from Firefox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.38 (PC)                  What steps will reproduce the problem? (NOT Sure you will be able to   reproduce - see comments below)                            I have run across an odd problem  not sure if this is just somehow due to   my particular machine/setup.  I installed Google Chrome recently  and chose   to import bookmarks &amp; saved passwords from Firefox.  Bookmarks imported   fine (though the RSS feeds that I had bookmarked did not import  this is   understandable since Chrome doesn't handle RSS as far as I know).  However    the passwords seem to be processed OK (a dialog box appeared briefly and   disappeared).  When I choose Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Show Saved Passwords  there is   nothing in the list.  However  when I go to a site for which I have a saved   password in Firefox  the password is filled in!  So perhaps the import   worked  but they are not being displayed?     Since I didn't see the passwords when I initially imported  I thought the   problem might be that my Firefox is password protected  so I'd hope that   Chrome cannot import password-protected &quot;saved passwords&quot;.  I am not sure   whether after that first import the passwords were effectively imported or   not.  I then decided to remove password protection from Firefox.  I then   reimported to Chrome.  This new reimport crashes Chrome.  I can repeat this   every time.    So I am seem to be OK  in that the passwords seem to be imported.  However    I know that Chrome crashes when I try to import from Firefox with no   password  and I also cannot see the saved passwords in my list.    Any feedback/thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated.   </pre>
