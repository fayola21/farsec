<title>Issue 44990 -   chromium -    In the change notification column  make sure to display the repo that triggered that change - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/chromiumos/waterfall">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/chromiumos/waterfall</a>  on the Change   column  there is no information from which repository this commit comes from.    In theory it shouldn't matter if DEPS are pinned but that's not the case in   practice.    So urls like <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/chromiumos/changes/47893">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/chromiumos/changes/47893</a>   should contain the corresponding git repository url or base name. </pre>
