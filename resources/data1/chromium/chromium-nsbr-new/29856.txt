<title>Issue 29856 -   chromium -    Wrong translation of &quot;File&quot; menu in Danish Mac version - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   Danish      4.0.249.30      Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.2      &quot;File&quot; is translated wrong as &quot;Fil&quot; in the menu. The correct translation in   Danish OS X is &quot;Arkiv&quot;. Also &quot;Save&quot; is translated as &quot;Gem&quot; where the normal   word in Danish OS X is &quot;Arkiver&quot;. See picture for illustration.      Attached is a screenshot showing the File menu in Chrome vs. Safari (as an   example of any other Danish OS X app). This is a really ugly bug. </pre>
