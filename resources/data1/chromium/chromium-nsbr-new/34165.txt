<title>Issue 34165 -   chromium -    Security Truth In Advertising Google/Chrome/GMail Bug - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Use of the Google/Chrome browser in combination with Google/GMail homepage presents consistent security bugs which can easily be thwarted although   Google/Chrome/Gmail has yet to take steps to do so    (a) Google/Chrome users who don't install WOT have no way of knowing   whether or not clicking on a Google ad on their Gmail page is likely to   lure the user to an unsecure website where waiting malware/spyware etc can   infect the user's PC    alternately     (b)Chrome users who do install WOT can clearly see that clicking on certain   Google Ad links on their GMail page are in fact high security risks  giving   them mixed signals as to the security commitment of Google/Chrome/GMail   itself and/or the enterprose's ability/willingness to use available   security apps providing WOT protection itself to weed out unsecure   advertisers from secure ones before accepting their business...and   Google/Chrome/GMail take no responsibility for such lack of security   resulting in resulting security bug risks such as keystroke logging or ID   theft    (c) No AdBlockers (or combination thereof)offered by Google/Chrome from   developers will completely block these insecure Google GMail ads  whether   by design or built-in security bugs within themselves    (d) Even forearmed with WOT and Adblockers  Chrome browser users can still   accidentally click on ads leading the browser to allow their GMail page to   link them to unsecure locations putting them at security bug risks   mentioned above.    --registered Chrome browser/GMail user      </pre>
