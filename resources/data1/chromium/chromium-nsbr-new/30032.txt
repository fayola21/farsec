<title>Issue 30032 -   chromium -    Extend sync protocol with generic support for additional datatypes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To support additional datatypes  we should allow clients to add new   properties to synced objects without having to edit sync.proto or SyncEntity   directly.  We can use proto2 extensions for this; we'd add an extensible field   to SyncEntity  and have one extension per datatype.    On the server  we can handle unrecognized SyncEntity extensions and store   the extended block as a generic blob.  Thus we could roll out new datatypes   without having to write datatype-specific server code.  The server may   interpret some (but not all) of the extensions  storing them in a more   structured  less generic way. </pre>
