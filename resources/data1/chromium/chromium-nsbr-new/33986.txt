<title>Issue 33986 -   chromium -    MIDDLE MOUSE CLICK is different from RIGHT&amp;LEFT CLICK  when it on scroll BAR - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This *Bug affects &quot;up-to-date&quot; Chromium version from Ubuntu PPA in recent 3   months or more.    I confirmed it on Ubuntu 9.10.    Here  the MIDDLE MOUSE CLICK is different from RIGHT&amp;LEFT CLICK TOGETHER.    Effects: click left&amp;right mouse button on the thumb of the scroller at the   same time  the mouse cursor will take over the control of bar like holding   it... - for details please see it yourself. This is an interesting feature    please keep it and add it to manual!         It was reported by me in <a title="A feature bug lasting for long - Chromium  Ubuntu" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33498"> bug 33498 </a>   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33498">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33498</a>    but sadly no one really care.  I won't record a video for it. </pre>
