<title>Issue 45365 -   chromium -    Chrome needs a bookmarks sidebar  bookmarks unusable without one - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55    Other browsers tested: every single other browser in existence has it         Safari 4: OK    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK    What is a bookmarks sidebar?  In firefox: open firefox  press &quot;ctrl+b&quot;  this is a bookmarks sidebar  this   is how it should be behave.    In IE8: click on favorites  click on &quot;pin favorites&quot;  same perfect sidebar   implementation for bookmarks.      For you to be able to use Chrome with large amount of bookmarks without   having to click at an item in the bookmarks bar and then scroll for 10   minutes.  My largest single directory of bookmarks contains 1751 bookmarks on   firefox  many others contain hundreds. I scroll through them (they are   sorted by name) and can easily click them and open them in the tab I am   looking it  or other tabs or windows using right click menu.      You need to scroll until your wrist breaks  making chrome useless for   browsing bookmarks. (I still use it... firefox I use for bookmarks   browsing  chrome for opening some pages here and there or typing an   address)    Note: this is the single most common complaint I have heard about chrome   since v1. </pre>
