<title>Issue 35351 -   chromium -    Chrome Forgets Login Credentials - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.307.5  URLs: mail.google.com    Chrome forgot my login credentials for all websites. While similar to   #22602  in comment 9  pkasting claims this is a different bug  so I'm going   ahead and opening a new bug to track this.    Before restarting Chrome  my password wasn't remembered for any sites    but my login was. Now I've restarted my browser  and Chrome will only   find my password if I enter my full login.    Example: Visit Facebook  type 'o' in the login field and no autocomplete   dropdown shows. If I type my full login 'og..@gmail.com'  Chrome will find   and populate the password field.   </pre>
