<title>Issue 29844 -   chromium -    User exit message - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33    I just have an suggestion that when I close the browser there is no alert   message or any message saying that &quot;Do you wanna close all tabs?&quot;. Because    accidentally I do close the browser window sometime. Anyway when I open the   browser again  I have an option in the history to see the recently closed   pages. I personally feel to have such message on the browser to support   users...    Thank you!   </pre>
