<title>Issue 30814 -   chromium -    Remove extensions promo from i18n locales - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> For the initial stable release  we're not showing the promo for i18n locales.    Rationale: &quot;We'd still have the i18n'd galleries  which gives developers an incentive to translate their   content  but most users wouldn't be exposed to them. We could add the promo and do a mini   launch in each country as soon as it had enough content.&quot; </pre>
