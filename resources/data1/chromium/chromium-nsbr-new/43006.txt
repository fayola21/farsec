<title>Issue 43006 -   chromium -    Bookmarks in Chrome/Chromium bookmark bar not showing completely - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Install chromium or chrome-dev on ubuntu 10.04      Bookmarks added or synced in bookmark bar should be appearing completely.       I freshly installed chromium on Ubuntu 10.04 and the bookmarks I add in the bookmark bar do not   appear fully. They are cut from top and from bottom  only the middle part of the icon and text   (height-wise) is seen. I was having this problem when I was using lucid beta too but found no fix or   reason. I did a fresh install of lucid now and yet the problems seems to be there. I installed chrome-  dev and chrome-beta and the problem's there too. I don't know whether the problem is in Ubuntu   or chromium.    Please provide
