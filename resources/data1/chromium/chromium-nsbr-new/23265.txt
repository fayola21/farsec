<title>Issue 23265 -   chromium -    TaskManagerTabContentsResource should be updated from the model's refresh  not from view queries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TaskManagerTabContentsResource's WebCore cache fields are updated via an IPC   round-trip to the renderer.  Right now  they are updated whenever the view   calls GetWebCore*CacheSize() with a very simple check that only 1 IPC is   outstanding at any one time.  This is fairly bad MVC design  what I think   really should happen is TaskManagerModel's Refresh() give the Resources a   chance to update themselves. </pre>
