<title>Issue 26729 -   chromium -    Http cache: issue only asynchronous requests to the disk cache. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The http cache uses a mixture of sync and async requests to the disk cache.   Usually  this is not a problem (performance wise)  but if the system's file   IO is overloaded we may start blocking the IO thread while waiting for the   disks to finish.    We should re-write the http cache to issue only async requests. </pre>
