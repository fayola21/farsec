<title>Issue 41547 -   chromium -    Fix URLFetcher to auto-handle IO thread shutdown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should make a couple of changes to URLFetcher:    * The Core object should register itself as an observer of the IO thread   message loop destruction.  When that happens  it should cancel any   outstanding URLRequest.  It shouldn't bother to call back to the UI thread   since such a call won't actually do anything at this point.    * The main object should check to see if the IO thread exists if it's asked   to start a fetch  and immediately fail (probably with   URLRequestStatus::CANCELED) if it doesn't exist.    * We should remove the explicit LeakTracker registration of URLFetchers.    Eric can correct me if I mixed up any terms here. </pre>
