<title>Issue 43594 -   chromium -    ProcessSingleton can pause for 20 seconds - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you crash chrome and relaunch and one of its initial set of processes gets   the same pid as the previous browser process you will block for 20 retries.   Once that's done that process will be killed.    This is unlikely to happen in a normal linux desktop but as chromeos runs the   same processes every time it happens more often. We've put a workaround in to   delete the Singleton* files on startup. </pre>
