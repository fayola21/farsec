Visit the boots.com website and click &quot;Sign In&quot; (or directly visit the URL   above)  2. Fill in your username and password and click the login to boots.com button  3.Nothing happens - it would seem that the form is not submitted.      The form should be submitted and you should be logged into the &quot;My   Account&quot; section of the website.    This works fine in other browsers - but doesn't work in Chromium or Chrome.     </pre>
