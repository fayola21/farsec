<title>Issue 39609 -   chromium -    Inconsistent behaviour for SSL certificates with expiration date reached and weak sig algorithm - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. I navigate to a site  which is using an outdated intermediate certificate of Verisign.  This certificate is valid until 2004  and is using a md2RSA sig algorithm  2. I will get a message from Chrome  that I am visiting a site with reduced security (I assume due   to md2RS sig algroithm ?) I would expect a message that certificate can not be trusted in whole  3. If I even go to the site  I can check the certificate warnings  and I will see  that trust chain is   not valid    So: the behaviour is in general not consistent.  I can not tell you the URL  as this site is available only internally  and not to the public. We will   also replace it with a correct certificate chain.        I would assume that an expired cert will is more relevant than a weak sig agorithm.      <b>Please provide
