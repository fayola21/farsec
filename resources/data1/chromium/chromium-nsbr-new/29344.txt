<title>Issue 29344 -   chromium -    Failure on svg tests: text-text-07-t.svg - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The following two tests are failing as of my upcoming WebKit roll:      LayoutTests/svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/text-text-07-t.svg = IMAGE+TEXT    LayoutTests/svg/text/text-text-07-t.svg = IMAGE+TEXT    They seem to be caused by webkit <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=51627">r51627</a>.    It's possible that they just need rebaselining  but the diffs looked significant   enough that someone more familiar with SVG should take a look at it.   </pre>
