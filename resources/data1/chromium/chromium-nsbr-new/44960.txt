<title>Issue 44960 -   chromium -    SelfDeletePluginInvokeInSynchronousPaint is flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SelfDeletePluginInvokeInSynchronousPaint was disabled for flakiness  but no bug was ever filed. I'm   going to switch it from DISABLED_ to FLAKY_  then we can see what the current status is. </pre>
