<title>Issue 31250 -   chromium -    Extension processes aren't labeled in about:memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install a Chrome extension (e.g.  Google Quick Scroll)  2. Open the Task Manager and notice the extension process.  3. Click &quot;Stats for nerds&quot;        The resulting about:memory page should show the extension process clearly   labeled (e.g.  &quot;Extension: Google Quick Scroll &quot; just like in the Task   Manager).    Instead  it's listed as &quot;Tab&quot;.   </pre>
