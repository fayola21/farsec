<title>Issue 27724 -   chromium -    Chrome is constantly scanning my system for installed plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome is constantly scanning my system for installed plugins    I notice a lot of disk activity when using Chrome on my Vista laptop  so I   downloaded Sysinternals Process Monitor.  To my surprise  it shows that   Chrome is constantly scanning my system for installed plugins!    Observed in:  4.0.247.0 (Developer Build 31985)    Process Monitor shows chrome enumerating the registry and then enumerating   various directories.  It then proceeds to access various DLLs in those   locations. </pre>
