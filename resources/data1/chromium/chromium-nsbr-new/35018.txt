<title>Issue 35018 -   chromium -    Creating a new location with &quot;foo@bar&quot; in the name in proxy settings implicitly creates a &quot;foo&quot; location and &quot;foo@bar&quot; doesn't work - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307.5 (Official Build 37950) dev      1. Go to Network Proxy Preferences  2. Create a new location foo@bar        Chrome should create a location named foo@bar        It creates &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;foo@bar&quot;  additionally mucking around the drop-down   menu will sometimes show it as [ &quot;foo&quot;  &quot;foo@bar&quot; ] and sometimes as [   &quot;foo&quot;  &quot;foo@bar&quot;  &quot;foo&quot; ].    This is probably an issue with unusual characters in location names. </pre>
