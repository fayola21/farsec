<title>Issue 24785 -   chromium -    Seeking in video is laggy for ogg (possible mp4 too) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Plays a video file (e.g. trek2.ogv)  2. Seek to somewhere      You see a frame immediately  you also hear sound immediately  but video   plays after a while.    This is because of the seeking logic we have  after we seek we decode the   keyframe after the target position and some frames onward. Audio plays   right away at the target packet  but video will hold until audio plays past   the position of the keyframe  thus video has a bit of latency for actially   moving.    Video  [..][..][..][TARGET][..][..][..][KEYFRAME][..][..]    Audio  [..][..][..][TARGET][..][..][..][..][..][..]   </pre>
