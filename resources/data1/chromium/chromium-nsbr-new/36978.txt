<title>Issue 36978 -   chromium -    Valgrind failure on Mac media tests - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Recently the media test under valgrind have started to fail.    Interestingly  this only happens on the Mac OS X valgrind bots -- the linux valgrind passes the same tests.    On mac  the valgrind (memcheck + tsan) is failing after reaching:      FFmpegDemuxerTest.Stop    (Looks like it simply exits).    This started occurring after these checkings:    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20Mac%20(tsan)/builds/3035">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/builders/Chromium%20Mac%20(tsan)/builds/3035</a>    Of those  the one which seems the most relevant is hclam's <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=40189">r40189</a>.    Here are the overall URLs to the two failing bots:      <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/waterfall?builder=Chromium%20Mac%20(valgrind)">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/waterfall?builder=Chromium%20Mac%20(valgrind)</a>    <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/waterfall?builder=Chromium%20Mac%20(tsan)">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/memory/waterfall?builder=Chromium%20Mac%20(tsan)</a> </pre>
