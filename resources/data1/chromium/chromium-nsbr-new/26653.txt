<title>Issue 26653 -   chromium -    Improve omnibox/history system handling of HTTP auth URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There are two related fixes that need to be made:    * URLs with HTTP auth info should have usernames/passwords stripped before   entering the URL DB.  Otherwise  simply hitting ctrl-h and copying the link   address reveals the credentials.  It also prevents autocompletion on the   hostname  since we prefix-check against the credentials instead.  When we do   this we should probably &quot;migrate&quot; all the old data by stripping these.    * In either the AutocompleteInput parser or the HistoryURLProvider (I'm not   sure which)  attempted usernames or passwords should be stripped off before   running autocomplete. </pre>
