<title>Issue 27181 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: CF doesn't update to the latest version when it's previous version is in use - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install CF-223.9 from <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">http://www.google.com/chromeframe</a>  2. Launch IE and navigate to cf:about:   3. Now install CF-237  4. Close IE  reopen and navigate to cf:about:    What is the expected output?   CF version should be 237.      What do you see instead?  It still shows 223.9. I see both pv and opv keys lying there in the   registry even after exiting IE.    This is happening on Vista(IE8) </pre>
