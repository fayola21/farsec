<title>Issue 46140 -   chromium -    Security: &quot;Prevent this page from creating additional dialogues&quot; circumvented by changing page anchor. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 6.0.408.1  Platform: Windows XP 32-Bit  Not applicable to other browsers    The mechanism that protects users from endless/large numbers of repeated alert boxes can be circumvented by changing the page anchor.    Take the following script:    &lt;script type=&quot;text/ECMAscript&quot;&gt;    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)    {      document.location = &quot;#&quot; + i;      alert(i);    }  &lt;/script&gt;    When run - the alert boxes will always show  even if the check-box to prevent additional dialogues is repeatedly clicked.    The expected behaviour is that changing the page anchor does not affect whether or not a script is allowed to show additional dialogues. </pre>
