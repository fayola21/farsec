<title>Issue 44567 -   chromium -    MessageLoopTest.RecursiveDenial2 sometimes hangs on Windows with a dialog box - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> There is a timing issue in this test that makes it hangs  since we don't plan   to change MessageLoop functionality and this test is Windows-only  disabling   for now.    Note that it only happens on the try slaves  almost never on the continuous   build. </pre>
