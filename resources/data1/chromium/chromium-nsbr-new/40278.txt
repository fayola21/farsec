<title>Issue 40278 -   chromium -    Test content and geolocation settings for IDN - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'm pretty sure our various content/geolocation settings UIs don't do well   for IDN URLs.  Several places we do things like GURL::host()  which I believe   gets a punycode string.  We need to be fixing this sort of thing up before   displaying it to the user.    We should test things like the browser bubbles and exceptions dialogs. </pre>
