<title>Issue 46153 -   chromium -    common OS X (Cocoa) options on highlighted words are not available - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.422.0 dev    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable):ok    Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable):fail   Behavior in Chrome for Windows:NA      1.Right-Click on an highlighted word that's not part of a hyperlink.           See the following &quot;Cocoa&quot; options in the contextual menu &quot;Search in Spotlight&quot;  &quot;Look Up in Dictionary&quot;.      No such option appear.    I see that these options are available in the text fields that are in the preferences  presumably because these are Cocoa text fields. You're not using the system's webkit  but is it possible to &quot;mimmic&quot; its features regarding some contextual menus  for better integration with OS X? :) </pre>
