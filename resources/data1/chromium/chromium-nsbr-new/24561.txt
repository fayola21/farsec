<title>Issue 24561 -   chromium -    Scroll wheel doesn't work right on this page - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Visit <a href="http://cityfile.com/dailyfile/7508">http://cityfile.com/dailyfile/7508</a>    Try to use your scroll wheel.  I get various effects from &quot;works for a little   while and then quits&quot; to &quot;doesn't work at all&quot;.    Is some plugin stealing the wheel somehow? </pre>
