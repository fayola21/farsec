<title>Issue 44632 -   chromium -    Scrolling thumb in the &quot;mouse down&quot; mode even if it isn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.401.1 (Official Build 47018) dev  URLs (if applicable) : gmail.com  maybe other sites as well        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: OK           IE 8: OK      In GMail  I drag the scrolling thumb and then release the mouse button.   Sometimes  this will correctly return the thumb to a default  unpressed   state  however  sometimes it will got stuck in a &quot;mouse down&quot; state.    In the video below  you can see a correct behavior during the first few   seconds. Then I try to shake the thumb up and down quickly and the thumb   gets stuck - you can see that when I move my mouse out of the thumb and   then hover over another part of the scrollbar later  the thumb jumps   directly to that position as if I had my mouse button still pressed down   (which I don't).    <a href="http://screencast.com/t/OTQ0NTcxNTQ">http://screencast.com/t/OTQ0NTcxNTQ</a> </pre>
