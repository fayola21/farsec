<title>Issue 45100 -   chromium -    cmd-left gets captured by webpage  doesn't go back - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.408.1 dev  URLs (if applicable) :  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?</a>  fuseaction=viewImage&amp;friendID=123399340&amp;albumID=25276&amp;imageID=3434521#a=25276&amp;i=3434521  OS version               :10.6.3            1. Visit a webpage  then go to a myspace image gallery picture like the one in the URL above.  2. Press cmd-back to go back.      You go back to the last page  same as clicking the back button.      The webpage somehow captures the left arrow (ignoring the cmd-modifier) and goes to a previous image in the image gallery.    The listed shortcut in the menu is cmd-[  but cmd-left usually works so the inconsistency is unexpected.    If the page can capture cmd-arrow  can it also catch cmd-t  cmd-w etc? </pre>
