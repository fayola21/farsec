Go to <a href="http://zaz.sirdarckcat.net/zaz/">http://zaz.sirdarckcat.net/zaz/</a> (a script that alerts the location  of the script being included).  2. See the alerts  Actual Results:    the alerts are:  a/b.js  a/b/c.js  a/b/c/d.js  a/b.js  a/b/c.js  a/b/c/d.js    Expected Results:    the alerts should be:  a/b.js  a/c.js  a/d.js  a/b.js  a/c.js  a/d.js    I'm not very good making testcases  and I tried to look for the bug  but I  couldn't find it.. I think this is a well known bug for developers  so I  guess its a dupe  but I couldnt find the bug where this is being discussed.    In any way  I want to propose this being fixed  or are there some details  I'm missing? </pre>
