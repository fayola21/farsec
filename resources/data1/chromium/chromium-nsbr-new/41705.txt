<title>Issue 41705 -   chromium -    sync integration tests dangerously nukes --user-data-dir - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Run sync_integration_tests with --user-data-dir=c:tmpfoo under cygwin on windows. (Or   rather  don't)        It seems like it then nukes c: because c:tmp is interpreted as &quot;c:&lt;tab&gt;mp&quot;. :(    Nick mentioned using ScopedTmpDir instead. </pre>
