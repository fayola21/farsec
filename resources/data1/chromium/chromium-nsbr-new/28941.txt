<title>Issue 28941 -   chromium -    Add the ability to manipulate the clipboard from content scripts or background pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.12 (Official Build 32876)  Mac    Extensions should be able to manipulate data on the clipboard. The use   case my extension is trying to satisfy is the ability to transform and then   copy the current page's URL to the user's clipboard via a keystroke.    This is not possible today because  for security reasons  accessing and   writing to the clipboard in WebKit for normal webpages is restricted.   Manipulating the clipboard is possible via Flash  but that requires making   the user send a keystroke or mouseclick into the Flash embed before   Flash will enable access to the clipboard.    Accessing this capability could require adding an extra permission in the   extension's manifest file. </pre>
