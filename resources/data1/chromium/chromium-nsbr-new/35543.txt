<title>Issue 35543 -   chromium -    Mac: re-organize BrowserWindowController - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> What I said in browser_window_controller.mm:    // TODO(viettrungluu): on-going re-organization  splitting things into multiple  // files -- the plan is as follows:  // - in general  everything stays in browser_window_controller.h  but is split  //   off into categories (see below)  // - core stuff stays in browser_window_controller.mm  // - ... overrides also stay (without going into a category  in particular)  // - private stuff which everyone needs goes into  //   browser_window_controller_private.{h mm}; if no one else needs them  they  //   can go in individual files (see below)  // - area/task-specific stuff go in browser_window_controller_&lt;area&gt;.mm  // - ... in categories called &quot;(&lt;Area&gt;)&quot; or &quot;(&lt;PrivateArea&gt;)&quot;  // Plan of action:  // - first re-organize into categories  // - then split into files    And what I'm saying (in a CL to be landed) in browser_window_controller_private.mm:    // TODO(viettrungluu): work on splitting out stuff from the BWC  and figuring  // out which methods belong here.   </pre>
