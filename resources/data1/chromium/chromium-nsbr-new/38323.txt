<title>Issue 38323 -   chromium -    Exclude rules shouldn't expect a leading slash - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In build/common.gypi we have several exclude rules of the form:                  ['exclude'  '/(gtk|x11)_[^/]*.cc$']     for each platform. However  these require that the filepath have a leading slash relative to the gyp   file. For example  chrome/common/x11_util.cc works  but app/x11_util.cc does not.    Currently  this is worked around in the app project by an explicit sources! list  but we should fix it so   that the slash isn't needed. </pre>
