<title>Issue 35861 -   chromium -    Content blocked icons get lost on tab switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version (from the about:version page): <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38927">r38927</a>      1. set content settings to &quot;block all images&quot;  2. open web page with images  watch &quot;images blocked&quot; icon appear in   omnibox  3. open new tab page  4. switch back to first tab page        icon should disappear after 3 (which it does) and reappear after 4 (which it   doesn't).    Windows (and OS X in my local tree) both recompute icon visibility in   LocationBarView*::Update(). GTK should probably do that too. </pre>
