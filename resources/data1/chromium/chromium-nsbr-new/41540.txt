Select 'Donot show any images' .Save and close dialog  3.Navigate to any site  eg. cnn.com  4. Try to edit the block image settings from omnibox    What is the expected output?  Chrome must allow user to change the Image settings from the omnibox  successfully.User must be able to toggle between both options and incase on  option is chosen (eg. allow images)  other one must be disabled  in other  words user can't select both options at a time    What do you see instead?  The feature is not working correctly. Incase user wants to allow images  if  he clicks on radio button 'allow images'  other option 'block images' is  also selected. It must be disabled.User is able to select 2 contradictory  choices for content settings at a time    This same issue is seen with Javascript settings  Plugins and Popup settings.  Its happening only on Windows  on linux its working fine .  **screenshot below          </pre>
