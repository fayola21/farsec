<title>Issue 37930 -   chromium -    Keystone doesn't look for KSVersion from application Info.plist for Chrome system ticket - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: RohMac-2.local    Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 (Build 9L30)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.40 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 5.0.342.3 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=41132">r41132</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: 7.6.4    QuickTime PlayerX: &lt;unknown&gt;    Flash Player: 10.0.45.2    When Chrome is running as a system ticket  Keystone doesn't look Chrome version (KSVersion)   from application Info.plist  but it depends on the Keystone ticket information.    So if ticket version is higher than Chrome  Keystone will not update Chrome.  For more information look for internal bug 2506062. </pre>
