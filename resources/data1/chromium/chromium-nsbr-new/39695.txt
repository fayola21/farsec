<title>Issue 39695 -   chromium -    Ghost tabs appearing on desktop - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi      While using google chrome developer version (5.0.360.0) on Windows 7 (64   bit)  I see strange looking small  translucent windows on my desktop. These   little windows appear to have the same titles as some of the sites open in   google chrome (some are blank  with no title). If I click on the X to close   one of these windows  it doesn't close  but instead maximizes the chrome   browser.    I have attached a screenshot of these ghostly windows(or tabs).     Additional note  I am using multi-monitors setup (Four 24in monitors  with   Ultramon running to manage multiple desktops). </pre>
