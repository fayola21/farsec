<title>Issue 34310 -   chromium -    Small glitch in drop-down list with thumb. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Build: 5.0.312.0    -Navigate to a page with drop-down list with a thumb to scroll the list.  (for eg: Language drop-down list in google advanced search page)  -Click on the drop-down list and scroll the list from end to the other end   with the thumb.    Issue:  As shown in the screenshot  there is a small glitch/shadow of the thumb in   the list.    It's a regression. Looks good in 1.x version  but repros in 2.x also.    PS: Looks good in Safari.   </pre>
