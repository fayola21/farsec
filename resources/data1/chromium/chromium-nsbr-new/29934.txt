<title>Issue 29934 -   chromium -    ffmpeg deadstrip unused code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> visual inspection of ffmpeg.gyp shows files  especially in chromium  that   dont make sense for just ogg support.  some files are not needed at all. ie resample.c  some files should be moved to chrome or chromeos. ie bitstream_filter.c  some files are needed  but it might be worth investigating why they are   needed.  the assembler files should be done based on branding as well.  and since openmax is only for arm  the arch should be checked as well.   </pre>
