<title>Issue 26524 -   chromium -    Intercept the RDTSC instruction in the seccomp sandbox - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Markus says: &quot;we currently don't intercept the RDTSC instruction  but   instead rely on the SEGV handler to emulate it for us. This is potentially   expensive and can result in kernel log files getting flooded. This is only a   problem for some kernel versions (none of the ones that we use  I think)    but we should probably still try to fix it before turning the code on for   all of our users.&quot; </pre>
