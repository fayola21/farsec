<title>Issue 43270 -   chromium -    Incognito windows share information across incognito windows (gmail stays logged in in two distinct incognito windows) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. open chrome  2. open incognito window  3. login to gmail  4. open new incognito window  5. attempt to login to a gmail again    note that you are already logged in  and you can't open 2 diff  gmail accounts in incognito mode.      I expect incognito to inherit down (incognito tabs opened from an existing incognito-window)   maintain information  but for a new window from the main chrome process to have no state from   the other incognito windows. It's not very 'incognito' if you share my 'secret' info across 'secret   browser instances'  is it?      information is shared across all incognito instances from a single running chrome process.    <b>Please provide
