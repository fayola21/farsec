<title>Issue 30933 -   chromium -    Useless popups during session restore due to Javascript delays - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Create a large session (30-40 windows  several hundred tabs)  kill that   session; either by killing the master chrome process or by rebooting the   system.  2. Restart the chrome session.  3. Watch annoying and useless popup windows appear regarding delayed   execution of session instances using Javascript.      The session should restart seemlessy.      Session throw up a seemingly endless stream of windows that Javascript   sessions are running slowly.  You *AT GOOGLE* do NOT GET IT -- I don't want   to run Javascript -- it is a needless  undesired imposition on my computer   except for selected sites.  Until Chromium provides a NoScript Option or   the ability to disable Javascript -- it will NOT in my mind ever be a   replacement.    <b>Please provide
