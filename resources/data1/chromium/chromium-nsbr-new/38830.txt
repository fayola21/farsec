<title>Issue 38830 -   chromium -    Line in top right of UI - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.356.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  Other browsers tested: n/a    I have no idea if it has just appeared or whether it has been there for   some time  but there is an odd black line in the top right of my UI  to the   left of the minimise button above the most proximal extension button    almost expanding onto it.    The only thing to do is to provide screenshots to show you.    I'm not sure that it should be there though  I thought there was something   dirty on my monitor!    I'm on windows 7 (32bit) professional. </pre>
