<title>Issue 29784 -   chromium -    User Interface Improvement for Client Certificate Usage - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Client certificates allow a user to identify himself to a web site. In all  current browsers I know of it is very difficult for the user to know what  certificate he used to identify himself as on such web sites. Many browsers  choose to send a certificate automatically after the user selects it the  first time. The user cannot then change the certificate used  or log out.     A very simple user interface improvement can help out here  and make the  web a much more secure place simultaneously  as it makes the usage of  client certificates much more widely available  and easy to understand.  This could be a very good comptetitive advantage for Chromium (until the  others copy it of course) :-)    So the solution is simple: In the URL bar browsers usually show the server  certificate information when connected using https. In the same location  the browser could show information about the client certificate used for  the web page (a GUI trick would be needed if more than one cert is required  for a web page to make that visibile to the user).    Firefox in their Weave project are showing the way. I wrote this up in  &quot;Identity in the Browser  Firefox style&quot;   <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/identity_in_the_browser_firefox">http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/identity_in_the_browser_firefox</a>    Now they are trying to solve the whole password problem this way. But as I  argue in that blog a simpler solution to solve  and that would be  compatible with their more detailed solution  would be use the same UI  trick to make https client side certs visible. That would be immediately  useful  and does not require inventing any new standards.   </pre>
