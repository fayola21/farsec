<title>Issue 37421 -   chromium -    Make about:network and about:net-internals into javascript applications - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now these are implemented as C++ in the browser.    Having them as HTML/javascript/css frontends would make it much easier to add new features (could add all sorts   of visualizers for the data  simply by working on the web frontend).    This is important in that it allows for exposing better debugging and performance tools for the network. </pre>
