<title>Issue 26870 -   chromium -    FindInPageControllerTest::AcceleratorResorting is disabled on linux/view build. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Enable FindInPageControllerTest::AcceleratorResotring in  find_bar_host_browsertest.cc for linux/views.    This is currently disabled for Linux build because the focus event  in x11/gtk is asynchronous  and the focus event does not happen  immediately after Hiding the widget. This has to be fixed somehow. </pre>
