<title>Issue 31342 -   chromium -    Port-blocking layout test flaky - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> WIN RELEASE : LayoutTests/security/block-test-no-port.html = TEXT PASS  WIN RELEASE : LayoutTests/security/block-test.html = TEXT PASS    These two have been failing about 5% of the time for more than 500 runs.   Feels more like a test race condition than an app error  but I haven't   investigated much.    Over to abarth for triage. Marking &quot;Security&quot; just in case  although port-  blocking ought to be more a phishing-esque risk than an actual security hole. </pre>
