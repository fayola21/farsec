<title>Issue 41478 -   chromium -    Add back the &quot;http://&quot; prefix in address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.376.0 (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44292">Revision 44292</a>)      1. visit a random site which uses http and not https/ftp. e.g.  <a href="http://www.12345.com">http://www.12345.com</a>      The URL in address bar is expected to be displayed as &quot;<a href="http://www.12345.com/">http://www.12345.com/</a>&quot;.      the URL in address bar is displayed as &quot;www.12345.com/&quot;.    Sometimes I need to cut-and-paste the URL to somewhere else (such as an online forum or a document)  and with the   &quot;http:// removed I'll have to type it manually. And I can't see the reason why it's not displayed. </pre>
