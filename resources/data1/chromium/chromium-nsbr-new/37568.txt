<title>Issue 37568 -   chromium -    AutoFill is operational even when it is disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.2 dev  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry</a>  Also websites that have you fill in a username    I just thought I would check  I don't know if I am the only person with this   problem...  I have autofill disabled and yet it is still storing the   information for me.  I have searched for &quot;offline&quot; and &quot;autofill&quot; and now    simply typing part of it will show up a drop box of those options.  Also  I   have logged into gmail with the same problem...  Is it something with my   computer or is this a widespread problem? </pre>
