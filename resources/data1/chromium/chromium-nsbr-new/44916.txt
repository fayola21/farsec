<title>Issue 44916 -   chromium -    New tabs won't go to homepage  go to new tab page instead? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (Version information at the bottom)    I have checked &quot;Open this page:&quot; in options  under the &quot;Basics&quot; tab. The   home page is the default that was in there  which is   &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>&quot; (I did not edit the URL manually at all). I then   closed the window. I pressed CTRL+T to open a new tab  but it was still   showing the new tab page. It should be showing www.google.com as my   homepage now  right?    I closed  reopened chrome  still no change in behavior.    -----------------------------------  Version information:  -----------------------------------  Google Chrome	6.0.408.1 (Official Build 47574) dev  WebKit	534.0  V8	2.2.10  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)   AppleWebKit/534.0 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.408.1 Safari/534.0  Command Line	  &quot;C:UsersBobAppDataLocalGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; --  disable-geolocation </pre>
