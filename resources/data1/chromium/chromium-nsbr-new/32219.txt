<title>Issue 32219 -   chromium -    Some layout tests fail with text mismatch only on valgrind bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Examples are :      LayoutTests/fast/js/convert-nan-to-bool.html = TEXT    LayoutTests/fast/js/kde/math.html = TEXT    LayoutTests/fast/js/kde/operators.html = TEXT      They don't time out but fail with text mismatch  which implies that there  may be a race.       The above is likely to be a small subset of tests with the issue.     I'm just reporting this in case we want to fix them (eventually).     In the meantime  there's a talk going on about not turning valgrind bots  red when only layout tests fail without memory errors.      </pre>
