<title>Issue 25951 -   chromium -    Reverse UI for Preferences menu on RTL languages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Windows  the entire menu can be read RTL; on Mac  the labels and text  fields don't swap their position in an RTL language  leading to the label  effectively &quot;facing&quot; the left edge of the window  rather than the text  field or menu it should be pointing to.  See screenshot.   </pre>
