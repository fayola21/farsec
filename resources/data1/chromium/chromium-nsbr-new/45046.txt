<title>Issue 45046 -   chromium -    Experiment with Markov model-based tab switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> See <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/solving-the-alt-tab-problem/">http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/solving-the-alt-tab-problem/</a> for   background.    The idea here is to implement the crazy Markov model backend described in   that blog post  and hook it to a UI that resembles Windows' alt-tab   interface: an overlay in the middle of the window whose behaviors for ctrl-  tab in the browser are just like the behaviors in Windows for alt-tab.    The question is  is the backend magic enough to be better than either MRU or   fixed order  and is the frontend visibility enough of an anchor to make the   backend behvaior not feel insane? </pre>
