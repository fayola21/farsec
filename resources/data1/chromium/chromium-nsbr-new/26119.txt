<title>Issue 26119 -   chromium -    &quot;show in folder&quot; doesn't - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. download file  2. click &quot;show in folder&quot; from dropdown  3. nothing happens    This is on XP ... this is consistent for me but I doubt it is broken for   anyone else  and the repro above likely won't.  At least the problem is on   file now in case others see it too.                <b>Please provide
