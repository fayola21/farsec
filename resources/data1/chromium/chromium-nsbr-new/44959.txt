<title>Issue 44959 -   chromium -    Pressing / or ? when typing inside inspector javascript console brings up help - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Try to use the javascript console in an inspector window to  for example    create a variable with a URL in it.     var s = &quot;http://www.google.com&quot;;    Notice that as soon as you type the '/' character  the inspector help overlay   comes up  leaving you unable to type in the URL.    The only workaround is to copy and paste into the console. This bug exists on   trunk and in the dev channel.    </pre>
