<title>Issue 37354 -   chromium -    Pressing Ctrl+Shift+B opens a new bookmark manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This only happens with the new tabbed bookmark manager.    The reason is that when Ctrl+Shift+B is pressed   ShowSingletonTab(GURL(chrome::kChromeUIBookmarksURL)) is called. (the url is   chrome://bookmarks/). However  the extension's chrome_url_overrides changes   the URL to chrome-extension://&lt;extensionid&gt;/main.html and thus the the URLs   do not match in ShowSingletonTab.    My current plan is to use the correct URL of the extension instead. I know it   makes the UI bad but I'll open another bug for that. </pre>
