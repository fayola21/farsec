<title>Issue 31848 -   chromium -    Tabstrip should reflow when dragging a tab out and back in - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 4.0.288.1      1. Drag out a tab when you have lots of tabs on your tabstrip  keep button   depressed  2. Drag it back in    What is the expected result? What happens instead?    After 1.  the tabstrip reflows so that every tab left on the strip gets a big   larger. After 2  that doesn't happen until the tab is dropped; hence there's   not   enough room in the tabstrip for all tabs and the + button gets pushed out.   There should be a tab reflow after 2.   </pre>
