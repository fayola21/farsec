<title>Issue 44643 -   chromium -    compilation fails in ffmpeg_audio_decoder.cc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If the processor doesn't support the SSE2 instruction set the compilation   will fail in &quot;ffmpeg_audio_decoder.cc&quot;. This is because &quot;emmintrin.h&quot; is   included which only supports SSE2. I guess &quot;ffmpeg_audio_decoder.cc&quot; should   include &quot;xmmintrin.h&quot; which only depends on SSE. If I've seen it correctly    then the functions used are included from &quot;xmmintrin.h&quot; via &quot;emmintrin.h&quot;   anyways. At least this fixes the compilation error. </pre>
