<title>Issue 26735 -   chromium -    Undo/Redo should be handled via menu bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  it's handled by the renderer  which means that the menu doesn't   blink when you hit cmd-z/cmd-shift-z. The reason for this is that the   &quot;Should the menu item be active?&quot; state is not plumbed from the renderer to   the browser yet.    I think I've seen a TODO for that in the source  but couldn't find a bug. </pre>
