<title>Issue 31791 -   chromium -    The interwebs sometimes stop working - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.288.1 dev (jrg++ for making that selectable in   the about box)    Both Rohit and me have seen Chrome get into a state where the browser UI   stays responsive and normal  but all web pages stop responding to any   input events like scrolling  navigating to new pages etc. Possibly the events   get through but drawing is broken instead.    It's like the connection to the renderers is somehow broken  at least for the   backing store updates.    I have no idea what to do about this  but I couldn't find an existing bug  so   this one shall be our tracking bug.    When this happened  I didn't see anything suspicious in Console.app. </pre>
