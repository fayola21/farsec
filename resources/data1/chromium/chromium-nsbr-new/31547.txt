<title>Issue 31547 -   chromium -    Implement Shared GLES2.0 contexts - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This requires at least 2 steps    1) Writing the actual service side code to handle shared contexts    2) Deciding on the method for the client to request that a context is shared.    It sounds like for this we want this concept of &quot;context groups&quot;.  So  it   seems like the client would create a group and then from the group create   contexts. </pre>
