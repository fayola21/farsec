<title>Issue 41270 -   chromium -    Transition the NTP into a launcher - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of having the new tab button create an actual new tab  have it create a &quot;proto-tab&quot;. The   proto-tab is an overlay that contains some of the same content as the current NTP  and   disappears when dismissed  like a drop down.    The launcher will also contain shortcuts for installed web apps. </pre>
