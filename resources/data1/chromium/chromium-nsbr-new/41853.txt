<title>Issue 41853 -   chromium -    SELinux is preventing /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox &quot;write&quot; access on oom_adj - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=581256">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=581256</a>    Daniel Walsh 2010-04-12 13:56:09 EDT  Please report this as a bug to chrome.  This is a leaked file descriptor    and  allowing it would allow chrome_sandbox to prevent itself from being oom   killed.     I will not fix this in SELinux in that I consider it a potential problem in  Systems that do not use SELinux.    Google/Chrome developers should set the close on exec flag after opening   this  file.    fcntl(fd  F_SETFD  FD_CLOEXEC)    </pre>
