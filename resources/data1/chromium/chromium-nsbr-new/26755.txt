<title>Issue 26755 -   chromium -    Enter keyup events in Omnibox are sent to renderer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Visit a page with a keyup event handler (e.g.    <a href="http://androsov.net/bugs/chrome-23942.html">http://androsov.net/bugs/chrome-23942.html</a>  which navigates on ENTER keyup   events).  2. Type a URL to a slow responding server (e.g.  run testserver.py and go   to localhost:8888/slow?3) in Omnibox.  3. Hit enter in Omnibox.        The page should navigate to the typed URL.  Instead  because the enter   keyup event in the Omnibox is sent to the renderer  the old page's event   handler tries to navigate at the same time.  It's a race to see which page   wins.    I don't think the keyup event from the Omnibox should be sent to the   renderer.    This is one of the issues causing <a title="Cross-process navigation may prevent input event ACK from the old renderer  causing the browser to shoot the tab in the ..." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23942"> bug 23942 </a>. </pre>
