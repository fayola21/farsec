<title>Issue 36453 -   chromium -    extended 100% cpu use when visiting certain website - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 official-google-rpms-for-linux          Firefox 3.x: OK      1. visit this site <a href="http://git.openbox.org/?p=dana/openbox.git;a=summary">http://git.openbox.org/?p=dana/openbox.git;a=summary</a>  2. try to use it immeditiatly after its loaded go to sublinks and back etc.      Fast loading  and then smooth scrolling and surfing. No stalling. No huge   cpu usage after the page is already loaded.      Chrome uses 100%cpu or at least a lot cpu  it stops after a while. But if   you do something again  like scrolling  going to one of the links  or   reloading  it stalls again at 100% and becomes unusable.   </pre>
