<title>Issue 38812 -   chromium -    AdSense Warning Interstitial - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Go to <a href="https://google.com/adsense">https://google.com/adsense</a> (notice that there is no WWW).    What is the expected output?  AdSense.    What do you see instead?  &quot;This is probably not the site you are looking for!  You attempted to reach google.com  but instead you actually reached a server   identifying itself as www.google.com. This may be caused by a misconfiguration   on the server or by something more serious. An attacker on your network could   be trying to get you to visit a fake (and potentially harmful) version of   google.com. You should not proceed.&quot; </pre>
