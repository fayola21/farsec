<title>Issue 24937 -   chromium -    Using JavaScript to go forward in history breaks pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Have JavaScript attempt to go forward a page with window.history.go(1);       That if the browser cannot go forward a page  it ignores the JavaScript function call.    If the browser can go forward a page  it does.          When the call to window.history.go(1) is in a script that runs on user generated event   (I.E. a button onClick):  The call to window.history.go(1) seems to always be ignored.      When the call to window.history.go(1) is in a script that runs without a user generated   event:  When the browser cannot go forward a page  it seems to ignore the body tag  as nothing   inside the body tag gets displayed on the page  and the body onLoad event does not get   fired.  If the page is inspected using the developer tools  the body tag is absent.      If the browser can go forward a page  then it will experience the same behavior until   the page is reloaded.  When the page is reloaded  the browser will correctly go forward   a page in the history.        <b>Please provide
