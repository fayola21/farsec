Click the circular blue 'play' button to the right of any of the album   covers      Lala-themed music player slides in from the bottom left corner and begins   to play the appropriate song.      Player slides in but its display starts switching rapidly between all of the 10   songs in the list without playing anything.    (I've used embedded Lala music players in other Pitchfork pages before    and they work  but they're not like this one -- the others play a single song   or an entire album  not a specific playlist.) </pre>
