Make sure you have 2 Chromium windows open  in 2 different spaces  2. Enter the URL of an auto-reloading website   (<a href="http://www.ttrworldtour.com/multimedia/live-scoring.html">http://www.ttrworldtour.com/multimedia/live-scoring.html</a>) or a website that loads in   stages (e.g. WAVE)  3. Right after logging in to Google Wave  switch to the other Chromium window in   another Space. If the auto-reloading-website is currently active  it will switch whenever   the page reloads. Wave does only switch in its initiating phase.  4. See how the space gets automatically switched      No automatic Space switching should happen   </pre>
