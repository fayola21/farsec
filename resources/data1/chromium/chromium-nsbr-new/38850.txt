Open Downloads tab either by Ctrl+J or by &quot;Customize and control Google   Chrome&quot; drop down menu.    -What is the expected result?    Google Chrome will function normally  showing the status of currently   downloading file while allowing normal usage of the browser.    -What happens instead?    Google Chrome freezes showing a &quot;(Not Responding)&quot; tag in the title  if   left alone long enough a Task Manager dialog will display itself  otherwise   the browser task or process must be ended manually.    -Please provide any additional information below.

Once the browser has crashed   once  it usually will not crash a second time. </pre>
