<title>Issue 28003 -   chromium -    chrome doesn't load xinha html editor - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.33        Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 8: OK      1. head to <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org">http://appdb.winehq.org</a>  2. open an application page  3. click the button &quot;add test data&quot;      you should get a display of 3 text areas with the xinha html editor on top      in chrome you don't get the editor. in IE and FF you do.    you can browse the appdb code tree in   <a href="http://source.winehq.org/git/appdb.git/?a=tree;">http://source.winehq.org/git/appdb.git/?a=tree;</a>  to help figure out the problem...  i tested with the &quot;always&quot; preference on and got the same result so it's   not a browser identification issue.    attached are screenshots of what it looks like in all 3 tested browsers. </pre>
