<title>Issue 30521 -   chromium -    Bookmark visible in two places at once  during drag (Linux) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Make the bookmarks bar always visible (Ctrl+B)  2. Create a bookmark (a URL) on the bookmarks bar.  3. Doubleclick and drag this bookmark.    While dragging  the bookmark appears in two places at once: its original   location and then again as a dragged item.  This is unusual.  I expect the   visual behavior to be the same as a regular  single-click drag. </pre>
