<title>Issue 31641 -   chromium -    Button tint and star background color - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version : 4.0.291.0 (Developer Build 35549)      1. change the &quot;buttons&quot; (I think) tint in your theme      I expect the bookmark star to still be yellow when active. Or at least I   would expect some way for the theme creator to change the inner part of the   star icon.      Changing the button tint also changes the active star color. In many themes    this makes it hard to guess if the page is bookmarked or not.     </pre>
