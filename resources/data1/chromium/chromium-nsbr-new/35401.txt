<title>Issue 35401 -   chromium -    Chrome ignores html z-index over google earth plugin - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.317.2 dev    Other browsers tested: Firefox 3.6         Safari 4: not applicable    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: not tested           IE 8: not tested successfully (plugin refusing to load)      1. Create a simple webpage with just the basic code for a full-page GE   instance and a DIV element with absolute positioning and a z-index greater   than 1.  2. Load page in Chrome    I have attached a very basic (25 lines) html file that portrays this   behaviour.      DIV displays over the GE instance      DIV is hidden once the instance loads  irrespective of its css position   attribute and the value of z-index (be it 10  101 or 10000)     </pre>
