<title>Issue 26756 -   chromium -    Button order on download pane should be swapped - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Primary action goes on the right.  We use it in dialogs but not in the &quot;this   download is dangerous&quot; prompt.  See attached screenshots of two sets of   buttons seen in the extensions install flow  where the order goes in both   ways.    (I spotted this because I saw Raf hesitate while trying to pick the correct   button in the dialog and was wondering why...) </pre>
