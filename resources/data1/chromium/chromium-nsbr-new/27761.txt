<title>Issue 27761 -   chromium -    Formatting issues on 'Downloads' build-in page. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 3.0.195.32  URLs (if applicable) : Just try to download any big file.           Safari 4: Not related    Firefox 3.x: Not related           IE 7: Not related           IE 8: Not related    When user downloads a file from somewhere  downloader calculates   approximate speed of download.  So  the download speed is not absolutely stable and browser shows speed   like:  1. 242.1 kB/s  2. 242 kB/s  3. 242.5 kB/s  4. 242 kB/s    The problem is a formatting. String that shows download progress is   jumping(less/longer)  because it displays 5 symbols or 3 symbols for speed  I suggest to show integer part and two digits after dot permanently. Then   user will have facility to meditate on download process. ;)  Sounds reasonable?   </pre>
