<title>Issue 26120 -   chromium -    Unify the CSS used for the Extensions page w/downloads &amp; history pages - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you Open the Downloads page  the History page and the Extensions page and   cycle through them (Ctrl+Tab)  you'll notice the Extensions page is a little   different. This wasn't as obvious when the Extensions page had the   folder+gear icon  because it looked like a totally different page  but now   (when I finish with <a title="Standardize on the puzzle piece icon throughout the extensions system" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=25906"> issue 25906 </a>) that the Extensions page has the puzzle   piece icon  which looks like the other icons it starts to hit home that the   Extensions page doesn't look exactly like the others. </pre>
