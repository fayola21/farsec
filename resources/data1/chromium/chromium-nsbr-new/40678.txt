<title>Issue 40678 -   chromium -    In extension  declaring any content_script stylesheet breaks particular site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.342.8 (Official Build 42697) beta  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://dcc.godaddy.com/default.aspx">https://dcc.godaddy.com/default.aspx</a>  Other browsers tested: n/a since it is an extension related issue      1. declare any stylesheet in the mainfest file for a content_script  2. visit GoDaddy's DomainManager site at <a href="https://dcc.godaddy.com/default.aspx">https://dcc.godaddy.com/default.aspx</a>  3. page renders incorrectly after stylesheet is injected  even if stylesheet   is empty.    Attached is a completely boiled down example that demonstrates this ill   behavior. Just unzip it and load it as an unpacked extension in chrome. Click   the extension icon  see the popup window  click the link  and it is   demonstrated.    my related mail thread:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-">http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-</a>  extensions/browse_thread/thread/55a86d0e0e087c91#     </pre>
