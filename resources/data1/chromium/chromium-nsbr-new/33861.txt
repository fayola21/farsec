<title>Issue 33861 -   chromium -    Sync entire browser - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently only bookmarks can be synced.    It would be wonderful if entire browser could be synced. Perhaps there could   be a sync options page with check-boxes for items user wants to sync such as:    bookmarks  passwords  extensions  current tabs/session and history  browser settings   </pre>
