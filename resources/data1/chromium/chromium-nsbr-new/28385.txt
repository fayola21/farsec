<title>Issue 28385 -   chromium -    Use more aggressive memory decommit for TCMalloc on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> TCMalloc's memory decommit rate is optimized for servers with a much more   steady rate of memory use.  We should play around with different values for   tcmalloc's scavenge rate flag to make it more aggressive  or do the same   thing we do in Windows where we implement a completely different decommit   strategy. </pre>
