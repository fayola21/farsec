<title>Issue 27532 -   chromium -    Disable &quot;Open All....&quot; BMB folder contextual menu options when folder is empty - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Platform:    Hostname: testings-macbook-pro-15.local    Mac OS X Version 10.6.1 (Build 10B504)    Processor: 2 Intel 2.33 GHz    RAM: 2048 MB    Chrome:    Chrome version: 4.0.245.0 <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=31763">r31763</a>  &lt;&lt;&lt;Release/Debug&gt;&gt;&gt;    QuickTime Player: &lt;unknown&gt;    QuickTime PlayerX: 51    Flash Player: 10.0.32    Precondition: Make sure we have only one empty folder on BMB .      1. Launch chrome and Right click on empty folder of BMB  2. Verify  &quot;Open All....&quot; options     Actual: Gets enabled.     What is the expected output?   Should get disabled when we don't have any stuff to open.  BMB folder contextual menu must be clever enough to know it doesn't have any bookmarks.    Windows and Linux - &quot;Open All....&quot; options on empty folder gets disabled. </pre>
