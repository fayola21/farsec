<title>Issue 37332 -   chromium -    split SyncBackendHost::OnBackendInitialized callback by data type - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Right now the syncapi reads the value of Directory::initial_sync_ended()   when a SYNC_CYCLE_ENDED event is raised by the Syncer  and requires it to be   true before sending the OnBackendInitialized callback to the   SyncBackendHost.      With dynamic enable/disable  this flag (and callback) need to be   parameterized by data type  so that &quot;initial sync&quot; can end for each of   bookmarks  autofill  etc  separately.  For each data type  the current   implementation performs the initial updates using GROUP_PASSIVE (i.e it   doesn't forward to any chrome thread for processing).  Once   initial_sync_ended for any data type changes to true  the syncer thread   should just pause until told to proceed so that model association can have   exclusive access to the sync db (<a title="Model association needs exclusive access to sync db for a data type" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37154"> issue 37154 </a>). </pre>
