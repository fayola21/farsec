<title>Issue 29599 -   chromium -    session restore should group windows together when exiting via the system menu - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. open two windows in chrome  2. exit using the menu item in the wrench (on linux  this is ctrl+shift+q)  3. restart chrome    I expect there to be a single item in the recently closed section of the   NTP to restore both windows.  Instead  I see two entries  one for each   window.    If the user is restoring lots of windows  this makes it hard to restore   them all.    This might be a regression.  <a title="Better restore UI on startup" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=9022"> Issue 9022 </a> suggested that we used to group   windows into a single entry.    I'm able to repro in windows and linux  so marking as os-all. </pre>
