<title>Issue 40980 -   chromium -    sync_integration_tests are nearly impossible to run - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The sync_integration_tests can't be run against any publicly available   server; they need to be run one at a time with a carefully constructed   command line  and they do not properly clean up after themselves.    I propose fixing this by adding a good-enough-for-test sync server   implementation to testserver.py  and running it as part of each test. </pre>
