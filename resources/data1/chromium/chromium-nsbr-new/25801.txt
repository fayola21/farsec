<title>Issue 25801 -   chromium -    Extensions bottom toolbar disappeared - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;                    1. Extensions toolbar disappeared. Now it's not necessary to use the flag   &quot;--enable-extensions&quot; as I always get the option &quot;extensions&quot; in the menu.  But the toolbar disappeared and I can't manage my extensions. Is this a   transiction in development?        get the bottom toolbar (possibly smaller than the previous one).        really nothing :)     </pre>
