<title>Issue 43836 -   chromium -    MultipleWDSQueriesOnDifferentThreads often hangs unit_tests on the bots - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> PasswordStoreWinTest.MultipleWDSQueriesOnDifferentThreads hangs a lot on the bots:  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Vista%20Tests/builds/18898">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Vista%20Tests/builds/18898</a>  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Vista%20Tests/builds/18896">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/builders/Vista%20Tests/builds/18896</a>    I think I saw it hang yesterday too  but I don't see it on the flakiness dashboard.  Maybe the   flakiness dashboard can't count it if the tests hang?    I'm not sure if I should disable it  but I guess it's also a bug that the flakiness dashboard doesn't   know about hangs. </pre>
