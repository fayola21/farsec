<title>Issue 40617 -   chromium -    PersonalDataManager should be RefCountedThreadSafe - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The AutofillDataTypeController now caches a pointer to the   PersonalDataManager in a Task created on the DB thread and posted to the UI   thread.  Technically speaking  this is dangerous  though probably OK due to   known destruction order of the PersonalDataManager (after the UI message loop   has terminated  so it can't change in normal operation  and a garbage pointer   wouldn't ever get dereferenced)  but the robust solution is to have the task   (and profile) hold references. </pre>
