<title>Issue 28482 -   chromium -    Popup pages still load  despite being hidden by the popup blocker - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1.Go to a site which will open a pop-up window.          In other browsers  pop-up blockers work like that; they prevent pop-up   windows and DON'T LET LOADING pop-uped pages and processing them at the   background.       But in Chrome  pop-up blocker prevents pop-up windows but doesn't stop   loading pop-uped pages. They are still loading at the background. We can't   see any pop-uped windows maybe but they are still processing/working at the   background. So that  sometimes you can hear a music from Chrome and can't   find where it comes from like me at the first time! :) Yes it is come from   a blocked pop-up window. (From an advertisement)    Because of this issue blocked pop-up windows are using CPU  RAM also.    <b>Please provide
