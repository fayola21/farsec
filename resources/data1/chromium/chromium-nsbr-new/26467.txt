<title>Issue 26467 -   chromium -    cl descriptions on tooltips? - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When using the waterfall in console mode (especially merged) it would be   nice if the tooltips on the people where the CL descriptions like they are on   the regular waterfall.  The timestamps are useful on console when not   collapsed  but when collapsed  you lose the ability to see what the CL was. </pre>
