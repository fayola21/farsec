<title>Issue 30551 -   chromium -    No option to disable tabs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> All major borwsers have an option to disable tabs entirely.  When they have enough room in the taskbar  users find that browser tabs are   of no use. What more  usability-wise tabs don't help but make things worse.    If the main task-swither is the task bar  we don't need another  parallel   task switcher.    Please add an option  where users can disable tabbed browsing for good.    The forum is full of posts requesting this feature.    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=0937ca55ddece609&amp;hl=en    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=641c1b03b0a6e719&amp;hl=en    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?</a>  tid=6c0b3850c0e57bb2&amp;hl=en    Thanks! </pre>
