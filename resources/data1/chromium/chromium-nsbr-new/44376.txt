<title>Issue 44376 -   chromium -    Automatic window layout - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I'd like us to mirror (on all platforms) the tab snapping behaviors on windows chrome that lets you   drag a tab or window to the right edge of the screen to fill half the screen with it. Particularly:    * Dragging a window to the side of the screen just adjusts its frame to fill half  not affecting other   windows.    * Dragging a tab out of a window to the right of the screen allocates a new window for it  and   adjusts the origin window to be the other half of the screen (though we may want to do something   different on super large screen  just pushing the window out of the way enough.)    * On mac  dragging a window to the top of the screen should not be a maximize command  because   it is far too easy to do  but I'll be trying to think of ways of accomplishing it   </pre>
