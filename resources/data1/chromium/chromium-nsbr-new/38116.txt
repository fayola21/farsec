<title>Issue 38116 -   chromium -    [GPU] Support creation of OpenGL context that render to an offscreen frame buffer - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> - For compositing WebGL canvases and Pepper 3D plugins.  - Offscreen FBO must be mapped into the namespace of the compositors OpenGL  context.  - Offscreen FBO must be saved whenever SwapBuffers is called so that the  compositor always has a copy available that is not partially rendered.  - Pepper 3D plugins should be able to render concurrently to the compositor.  - Need to defer resizing of the FBO until SwapBuffers is called so that the  newly resized FBO does not receive the tail end of the GL calls for that  context. </pre>
