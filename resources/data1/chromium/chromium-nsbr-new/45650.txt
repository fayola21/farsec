<title>Issue 45650 -   chromium -    Update CFAllocator out-of-memory patch - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To make CFAllocator out-of-memory-safe  we currently need to muck around in  the internals of it. This task is on-going  and for each new significant  revision of Mac OS X we need to either:    - Update our definitions of the internals (and leave this bug open for the  next time)  - See if there's a way to fix it via public API (and then close this bug) </pre>
