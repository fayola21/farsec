<title>Issue 26820 -   chromium -    Use google-glog instead of logging.h - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of having our own base/logging.h  we may be able to use google-  glog from <a href="http://google-glog.googlecode.com/">http://google-glog.googlecode.com/</a> for logging.  The logging   interface should already match what we're using fairly closely. </pre>
