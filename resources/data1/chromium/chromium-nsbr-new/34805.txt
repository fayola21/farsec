<title>Issue 34805 -   chromium -    Internal pages maybe shouldn't be affected by Content Settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193)  Content Settings currently implemented on Windows only.    This issue applies to chrome://newtab/  chrome://extensions/    chrome://history/  chrome://downloads/  etc.    Also  to about:version  about:plugins  about:memory  etc.        1. Options &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Content Settings... &gt; Images:      Select &quot;Do not allow any site to run JavaScript&quot;.  2. Open New Tab page (or other page mentioned above).    What is the expected output?    New Tab page should look normal.    What do you see instead?    New Tab page looks weird:    * No thumbnails.    * No recently closed pages/tabs.    see attached picture.   </pre>
