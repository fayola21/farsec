<title>Issue 37264 -   chromium -    Bookmark Manager drag image needs single-document icon and badge - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the new HTML bookmark manager  when you drag one or more bookmarks it shows a &quot;muliple   document&quot; drag image.   It should show a single document (or something better) when there's only   one bookmark being dragged.    It should also have a badge showing how many bookmarks are being dragged. </pre>
