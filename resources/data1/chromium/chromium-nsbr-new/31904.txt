<title>Issue 31904 -   chromium -    Chrome Crashes When External App Manipulates external_extensions.json - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>     Reproduced problem on Windows XP  and Windows 7.  Didn't try Linux or OS X.    1. Open your &quot;external_extensions.json&quot; file in vi or Notepad.  By default    contents should be an empty &quot;{}&quot; JSON string on a fresh Chrome install.  Mine   was found under   %HOMEPATH%AppDataLocalGoogleChromeApplication4.0.249.43Extensions on   Windows 7.    2. Manually add an entry into this JSON object following the recently added   instructions at   <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/external_extensions.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/external_extensions.html</a> to   trigger Chrome to install an external extension placed somewhere by an   installer ...    {   &quot;aeiegipkdemoddochcfdakkkjjpkdpff&quot;: {     &quot;external_version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;      &quot;external_crx&quot;:&quot;C:crashme.crx&quot;   }  }    3. Save &quot;external_extensions.json&quot;  and close your editor.    4. Open Chrome  the extension should install and &quot;chrome://extensions&quot; shows   the extension is installed. Yea.    5. On &quot;chrome://extensions&quot;  click the Uninstall link to manually uninstall   the external extension.  Extension is uninstalled (no longer in the list on   chrome://extensions).    6. Close Chrome.    7. Open &quot;external_extensions.json&quot; in your text editor  and change the ID   value in the JSON string by one letter (I'm thinking this is how to make   Chrome think it's a new extension with a diff ID so it will re-install again   next time I open Chrome).  My example used   &quot;aeiegipkdemoddochcfdakkkjjpkdpff&quot;  so try &quot;aeiegipkdemoddochcfdakkkjjpkdpfd&quot;   (last letter in the ID string is a 'd' now).    8. Open Chrome.    9. Chrome crashes.          I was expecting Chrome to see a different ID in &quot;external_extensions.json&quot;   and therefore think this extension is a whole new one that should be   installed.  Therefore  Chrome should install it again under the new ID found   in &quot;external_extensions.json&quot;.          Chrome crashes.      <b>Please provide
