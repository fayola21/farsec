<title>Issue 34437 -   chromium -    Printing problem attributed to settings conflict - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. CTRL P to print            A printer dialogue in which it is possible to change print settings such as   print quality  resolution.        The print dialogue opens. It contains all the usual tabs: general  page   setup  job  image quality  colour  advanced.    But the following tabs reveal blank pages when you click on them: image   quality  colour  advanced. The settings that are normally displayed under   these tabs are not there. It is not therefore possible to select those   print settings.    The quality of the print out also has the quality of something that has not   been controlled by any settings whatsoever: the ink is heavy  the quality   crude.    <b>Please provide
