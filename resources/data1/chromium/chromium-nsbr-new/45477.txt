<title>Issue 45477 -   chromium -    Chrome blocks system shutdown  and other 'quit' related problems - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55 (Official Build 47796)      1.a) Try to quit Chrome via the Dock (ctrl+click on Google Chrome  select Quit)    OR    1.b) Select 'Shutdown'  'Restart' or 'Log Out xyz' from the Apple System Menu (or press the power   button and select an option).      Google Chrome quits  or for 1.b)  the requested action is completed by the system.      1.a) Google Chrome doesn't quit  giving no error and continuing to be completely responsive. It   behaves as though 'Quit' was never selected.    1.b) Mac OS X complains that Google Chrome has prevented shutdown/restart/logging out.    Here's the really odd thing: pressing Cmd+Q or choosing Chrome&gt;Quit Google Chrome works   every time without fail. Even after the above methods have failed  Cmd+Q works perfectly. </pre>
