<title>Issue 41668 -   chromium -    Suppress cert selection dialog if an identity preference exists - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.379.0 (44664)  URLs (if applicable) :  N/A  OS version               : 10.6.3 (10D573)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Install a personal certificate  2. Create a wildcard identity preference  say *.mit.edu  3. Goto a website the requires a personal certificate and matches the wildcard  say   <a href="https://web.mit.edu">https://web.mit.edu</a>      Chrome should automatically send the certificate to the server.      Chrome prompts me to select a certificate.  In the example above  it also sets a redundant   identity preference for <a href="https://web.mit.edu">https://web.mit.edu</a>.    Note: 10.6 introduced support for wildcards in identity preferences.  For more details  see:    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sec">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sec</a>  urity.1.html    Wildcard identity preferences on 10.5 machines are ignored.  Ideally  Chrome would support them   on both versions of the OS. </pre>
