<title>Issue 28743 -   chromium -    Open/close tab leaks memory - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. ctrl-T (new tab)  2. www.nytimes.com or www.yahoo.com  3. close tab  4. wash  repeat  rinse        Memory usage (as reported by Windows Task Manager) should be the same after   the tab is closed as it was before the tab was opened        Memory usage increases by about 0.02-0.03 GB for each new-tab  open page    close.    When total memory usage gets to about 2GB (the total RAM on my laptop)    Chrome slows to a crawl. I then need to restart Chrome  which brings my   total RAM usage down to about 1GB.    <b>Please provide
