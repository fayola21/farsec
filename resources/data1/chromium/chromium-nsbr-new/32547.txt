<title>Issue 32547 -   chromium -    Navigating the omnibox with emacs keyboard shortcuts exhibits confusing behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.302.0 (36495)    OS version               : 10.6.2            1. Select the text in the omnibox  2. Begin typing &quot;goo&quot;  3. Press Ctrl+N until &quot;www.google.com/&quot; is selected.  4. Let go of Ctrl  5. Press enter      The user should be taken to google.com  as this is the text now in the   omnibox.      The user is taken to the search results for &quot;goo&quot;.    Some further notes -- part of this behavior is confusing due to the Ctrl key   being used to force the omnibox to consider the input as a url (appending   .com etc).  The emacs text navigation shortcuts are supported throughout   Mac OS X and are vastly more efficient than using the arrow keys... hence it   would be best if the omnibox supported vertically navigating its suggestion   list with Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P  without shifting the entire list when Ctrl is   pressed (this makes finding the desired suggestion harder when using the   emacs shortcuts to navigate).    A solution would be to replace the first suggestion (the google search with   the magnifying glass icon) with the url-forcing-suggestion  instead of   prepending it to the list.  This allows all of the keyboard shortcuts to   continue functioning as is.  Another option would be to move the url-  forcing shortcut to the option key  since the option key currently duplicates   the functionality of command+shift in the omnibox. </pre>
