<title>Issue 37046 -   chromium -    Extension doesn't get loaded in those windows running in app mode. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.335.1 dev    This issue is about Chrome extension and app mode (i.e.  running with --app  parameter).  I had an extension loaded  and then I launched a new window in app mode  with --app=&quot;...&quot;  I found that the extension did not work at all.  My extension is a page action  I know that I should not expect seeing the  page action icon because app mode has no address bar. But I think the  background page should still working even in app mode  right?  I am doing something in background page but I see it doesn't take any  effects in app mode which it work well in native Chrome window.  Is that by design? Or do I have to add some other parameters when launching  the app mode?      The background page should be working even in app mode window.      The background page doesn't work in app mode window.         </pre>
