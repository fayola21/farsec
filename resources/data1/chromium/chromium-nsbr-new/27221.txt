<title>Issue 27221 -   chromium -    Download item text not readable for some themes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.237.0      1. Install a theme where the bookmark text color is the same as the   toolbar button background color. The only theme I know where that is the   case is   <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_at_karimrashid.h">https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/theme_at_karimrashid.h</a>  tml  2. Download something        Primary text on download item should be readable.        It's not.    The reason for this is that we paint download items like buttons  while   windows/linux paint download items with a transparent white rounded   rect.    If triage thinks this is M4 material  I can probably get this in until friday.   Let me know. </pre>
