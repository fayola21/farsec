<title>Issue 35417 -   chromium -    createTreeWalker crashes the renderer in latest Mac beta build (307.7). - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.307..7 beta    OS version           : 10.5.8    This seems to occur only on Mac. We had at least one user report  and I can   reproduce it reliably. It looks like a regression (Quick Scroll worked just   fine in previous versions).      1. Install Quick Scroll extension from   <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibhgpbllg">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibhgpbllg</a>  c  2. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=belgian+waffle&amp;esrch=FT1">http://www.google.com/search?q=belgian+waffle&amp;esrch=FT1</a>  3. Click on the Waffle - Wikipedia result (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle)      The Wikipedia page loads  and Quick Scroll appears on the bottom-right   corner of the page.      Aw  snap! </pre>
