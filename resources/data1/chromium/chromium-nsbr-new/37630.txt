<title>Issue 37630 -   chromium -    Uptime statistics may be corrupted by crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Uptime statistics are gathered by taking the difference between a shutdown   time  and a startup time.    When we reset the startup time  we fail to clear the old shutdown time    making the assumption that the shutdown time will be set when we   shutdown.... but that does not happen when we crash.    At the next startup  we may assume the old startup and shutdown times are   valid  and take their difference  which incorrectly yields a negative   uptime.    We should also be sure to incrementally provide UMA uptime stats  so that a   long uptime is not discarded if there is a crash  and so that uptime   calculations stay relatively in sync with pageloads stats  and other   incrementally gathered UMA stats. </pre>
