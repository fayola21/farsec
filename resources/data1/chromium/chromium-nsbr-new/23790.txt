<title>Issue 23790 -   chromium -    Find-in-textarea does not move cursor/focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Use ctrl-f to search this textarea for a unique string.  Now hit esc.  The   focus/cursor should jump to the found text (i.e. the highlight should turn   into a standard selection).  Instead focus gets messed up; it looks like it's   on some widget in the page but that widget doesn't respond properly to   keyboard shortcuts.    Do we have an old bug on this? </pre>
