<title>Issue 24743 -   chromium -    output from run_webkit_tests should include text/image/image+text instead of fail - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Now that we are trying to reduce the usage of FAIL in test_expectations.txt    the output for unexpected failures should be changed. People copy-paste   this output directly into test_expectations.txt.    Here's an example from a recent run:    Expected to fail  but passed (2):    LayoutTests/platform/mac/fast/loader/non-html-load-event.html    LayoutTests/svg/custom/linking-a-03-b-transform.svg    Regressions: Unexpected failures (1):    LayoutTests/svg/custom/missing-xlink.svg = FAIL </pre>
