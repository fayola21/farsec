<title>Issue 33345 -   chromium -    notifications should default to the top right on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If we can't guess the right corner for notifications (e.g.  the user doesn't run   gnome  kde  or xfce)  we should default to the top right corner.  This appears   to be the default for other notifications.    E.g.  if I run gnome+ion  I always get volume and wifi notifications in the top   right  regardless of where my gnome panel is docked. </pre>
