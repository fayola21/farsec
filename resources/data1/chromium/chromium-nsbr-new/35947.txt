<title>Issue 35947 -   chromium -    [CF] Back navigation doesn't go correctly when doing back for multiple times - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Have CF 5.0.329.0 (Official Build 39038) installed  2. Register *yahoo.com* in CF registry  3. Access yahoo.com(1st page) and click on a link  it goes to a new  page(2nd page)  4. On the 2nd page click on a link  it goes to another page(3rd page)  5. On the 3rd page click on a link  it goes to another page(4th page)  6. Now click the back button of IE or CF' context menu  it goes back to 3rd  page  7.Click the back button again.      Now it should go back the 2nd page  but actually it goes back to 1st page.  it jumps over the 2nd page  which is not a correct behavior.    This issue seems only happen in registry approach  it doesn't happen in  meta tag approach.       </pre>
