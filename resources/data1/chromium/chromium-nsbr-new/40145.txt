<title>Issue 40145 -   chromium -    [Mac] Clicking page actions (or search hints) messes up omnibox focus. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install &quot;lights out&quot; extension.  2. Go to www.google.com.  3. Place cursor at end and type additional url characters.  4. Click &quot;lights out&quot; page-action.        The page dims  the omnibox popup is dismissed  and the entire omnibox contents are selected.    Instead  I expect the page to dim and the omnibox not to be affected at all.    Another case is is if you type &quot;google&quot; and click the &quot;Press [TAB] to search...&quot; text.  It causes a   select-all.  <a title="[Mac] Clicking &quot;Press tab to search&quot; or page actions screws up omnibox selection." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36838"> Issue 36838 </a> was about a bug where you could then not press &quot;TAB&quot; and get what was   promised  but that seems to work at this time.    If the page-action click brings up a popup  on Windows the omnibox popup is dismissed.  This   would make sense for us.  Likewise for the star action  or the location icon.    ---    On <a title="[Mac] Clicking &quot;Press tab to search&quot; or page actions screws up omnibox selection." class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36838"> Issue 36838 </a>  I discovered that overriding -[AutocompleteTextField acceptsFirstResponder] to   return NO if it had a field editor which was already first responder worked to prevent the selection   being messed up.  I will consider landing that once mstone-5 has sailed. </pre>
