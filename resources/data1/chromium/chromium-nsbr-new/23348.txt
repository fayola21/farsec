<title>Issue 23348 -   chromium -    Feature request: profile manager / improved multiple profile handling - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I use my browser in different settings (&quot;work&quot; and &quot;leisure&quot;)  and would like   to be able to switch between profiles easily  or possibly even have multiple   profiles open simultaneously  in different instances of Chrome.    Chrome already supports loading a profile in a different directory with the   --user-data-dir parameter  but right now  the only solution is to keep   several shortcuts to start the program with different command-line   arguments  or to use the command line to launch them every time they're   needed. This is especially a problem in OS X  where the creation of   shortcuts and the passing of command line parameters aren't trivial.    It would be helpful if Chrome went all the way and it allowed for multiple   profiles  with an optional profile manager to pick among them at startup. Firefox implements a good solution  by only displaying the profile manager   at startup if there are several profiles  or if forced with the usage of a   command-line parameter. </pre>
