<title>Issue 33442 -   chromium -    myspace.com: some images are missing because of extension AdBlock - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>     1. Have extensions AdBlock installed  2. Go myspace.com  3. Click on &quot;Video&quot; tab under &quot;Today on MySpace&quot; section        The image thumbnails are displayed quickly and then get lost finally.    If disable extension AdBlock  then it works fine.          </pre>
