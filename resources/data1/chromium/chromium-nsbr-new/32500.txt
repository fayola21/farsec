<title>Issue 32500 -   chromium -    Regression: Autofill dropdown selection changes via mouseover - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have multiple Google accounts that are candidates for autofill in the form   that results when I hit &quot;sign out&quot; in the upper right corner of this bug   tracker.    If I begin typing such that both show up  and then move my mouse vertically   across the autofill dropdown  the selection changes as I hover different   lines.  It should only change when I click or drag.  This problem frequently   causes me to log in with the wrong account.    Much like <a title="Regression: Autofill causes user to have to hit extra keystrokes" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32454"> bug 32454 </a>  I believe this is a somewhat recent regression. </pre>
