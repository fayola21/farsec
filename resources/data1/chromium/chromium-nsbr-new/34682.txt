<title>Issue 34682 -   chromium -    ChromeFrame Tests: Fonts colors - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Changing fonts (and colors) in IE should take effect in Chrome Frame. I don't   think we honor IE colors so just a test for fonts to begin with is OK.    The test is to change different font sizes using IE menu and verify the   effects in chrome frame page. Note that ctrl + '+' will directly go to   chrome/webkit so no magic there :)   </pre>
