<title>Issue 31433 -   chromium -    Problem saving HTTP(s) passwords on sites with invalid SSL certificates. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="https://freya.myvnc.com:10101/">https://freya.myvnc.com:10101/</a>  OS version               : 10.6.2  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Password saving/recovery works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Password saving/recovery works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: Unknown      1. Visit a site with an invalid SSL cert and HTTP authentication  2. Attempt to save the password/username  3. Visit the site a second time (after closing the browser to clear your having &quot;accepted&quot; the invalid cert). The password will not auto fill in.  An interesting note though  the password will fill in if the browser &quot;remembers&quot; that you already allowed the certificate.      The password and username form should be populated automatically.      Nothing. </pre>
