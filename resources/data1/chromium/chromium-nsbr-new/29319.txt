<title>Issue 29319 -   chromium -    revisit bot crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I believe the windows bots all start up a crash reporter to catch things that   crash during the run and log into.  Mac doesn't have anything like this.  The   bots are now setup to not pop a crash dialog  but they will still let the OS   support log the crash.  We should do something to match the recording   windows have to make sure we're trapping the useful info off the bot runs   (and not filling up the crash directories). </pre>
