<title>Issue 36573 -   chromium -    Client side window decorations - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> with the latest patches from cody russel now client side window decoration   is enabled in ubuntu lucid and it would be really awesome that google   chrome now use the real theme of the OS and get integrated with the gnome   desktop environment so that it dont look something 'dont belong here'.   </pre>
