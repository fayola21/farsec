<title>Issue 45718 -   chromium -    The margin for empty titled bookmarks in the bookmarks bar is too large on Mac OS - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.55  OS version           : 10.6.3    Behavior in Chrome for Mac: The margins are too large (see screenshot 1).  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: The margins are displayed correctly (see   screenshot 2).      1. Ensure that the bookmarks bar is visible.  2. Create a new bookmark in the bookmarks bar.  3. Right-click and &quot;Edit...&quot; the bookmark.  3. Delete all the text in the &quot;Name&quot; field  and press OK.  4. Make sure there is at least one bookmark to its right.      There should be a small margin between this bookmark and the icon to its   right. Ideally it should be consistent with the margin that Chrome for   Windows uses (see screenshot 2).      There is a large margin between the bookmark icons (see screenshot 1). </pre>
