<title>Issue 37985 -   chromium -    Remove chrome/common/accelerated_surface_mac dependencies from webkit - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Per thread in email  we need to move chrome/common/io_surface_support_mac.* and   accelerated_surface_mac.* into src/app so they can be used from webkit.    This also entails moving a bunch of x11 support utils.    I'll get to this  but it might not be a couple of days. I've got a few other things backed up in my   queue. </pre>
