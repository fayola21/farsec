Try to submit a form (login form  WordPress settings forms  WordPress template edit forms    etc)  2. Info that I typed in does not need to be passed - the changes don't take effect  login form just   pops up blank again  3. I switch back to Safari and am able to do everything without issue.        I should be logged in  WordPress settings saved  Wordpress template changes made.        Form acts like no data was submitted - login form pops up blank  WordPress forms don't make   any changes.   </pre>
