<title>Issue 31173 -   chromium -    Significant memory leak through page-file-backed section objects/handles - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.266.0 (for Windows)        1. There is no specific way to reproduce the problem  2. Chrome was running continuously about a day or two on   Q6600/2GB/GTX280/Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 32-bit (+all current updates)  3. Many Chrome windows/tabs and sites was opened/closed on the way  but   some was always open. Flash and Silverlight plugins used on some tabs  4. At one moment significant - about 1.5GB - increase of total memory   commit charge was detected  5. Windows Task Manager and Process Explorer v11.33 reported normal memory   sizes for all processes. Only total commit charge increased. Chrome Task   Manager reported normal memory consumption too  6. Closing almost all Chrome tabs doesn't change the picture  7. Handle v3.42 reported ~45000(!) page-file-backed section object handles   owned by one of chrome.exe processes  8. Memory commit charge returned to normal only after closing all Chrome   windows/tabs        No memory commit charge of such monstrous proportions        A significant - about 1.5GB - increase of committed memory    *Issue relevant part of log by Handle v3.42 utility attached   </pre>
