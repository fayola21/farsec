<title>Issue 33905 -   chromium -    A strange problem - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.78 beta (36714)             Safari 4:OK    Firefox 3.x:OK           IE 7:OK           IE 8:OK    It happened every time when I want to type &quot;e&quot;(it'll show 101) and   &quot;c&quot;(it'll show 99).      I want to type smoothly.      The warning window stop me every time when I want to type the certain   letter.    The attachment included  the warning window shot and all the Extensions   I've installed(as I think it's not a problem caused by them).   </pre>
