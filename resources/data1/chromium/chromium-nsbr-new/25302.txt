<title>Issue 25302 -   chromium -    Tab bar is cut off when Aero is temporarily disabled - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Run Chromium with Aero enabled (vista glass theme) while maximized  2. Run a fullscreen game so Aero is temporarily disabled by Vista  3. Alt tab to another app  so the fullscreen game is minimized / in the   background  4. Chromium switches to the XP theme (blue theme)  but the tab bar is cut   off. See screenshot.        The tab bar should not be cut off.        The tab bar is cut off. I believe this is because it thinks it's using the   Aero theme in some part of the code  when it should be using XP theming.    <b>Please provide
