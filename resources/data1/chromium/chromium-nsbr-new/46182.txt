<title>Issue 46182 -   chromium -    After update opened a tab &quot;--restore-last-session&quot; - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.427.0 (Official Build 49010) dev    I clicked wrench menu and I see &quot;About Google Chrome&quot; button becomes &quot;Update Google Chrome&quot;  I clicked it and it says Restart to update chrome. I clicked Restart button and it's updated. But it didn't restore last session.  I had 5 tabs before click restart button. But when it restarted there's 2 tabs. One tab is &quot;--restore-last-session&quot;. See screenshot. And another tab is not one of 5 tabs before it's restarted. It was a page I was opened hours ago and closed. Not a opened tab before restart.    Command line info from about:version    &quot;C:UsersdoganAppDataLocalGoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe&quot; -- &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4664/search?s=xx&amp;q=xx --restore-last-session    &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4664/search?s=xx&amp;q=xx is google desktop search page. I was opened it and closed hours ago. And it's not opened before i restart browser.  Btw I use Windows 7 32bit </pre>
