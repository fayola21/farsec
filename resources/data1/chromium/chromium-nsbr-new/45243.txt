<title>Issue 45243 -   chromium -    Crash service doesn't exist on the Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We have tests that assert that we get crashes  but they don't work on the Mac; instead fail and get   the following log message:    NOTE: Crash service not ported to this platform!    Linux seems to have a breakpad-based implementation  although I haven't investigated the details. </pre>
