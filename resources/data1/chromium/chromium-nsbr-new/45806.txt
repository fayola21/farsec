<title>Issue 45806 -   chromium -    Dragging downloaded item from download shelf into webpage causes the download to happen again - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   System info: Mac OS X 10.6.3  Chrome 6.0.408.1 dev          1. Download a file (e.g.  a PDF file).  2. Drag the file from the Chrome download shelf bar into a webpage that   doesn't not support drag&amp;dropping.  3. Let go of mouse.      What is the expected output?    If the webpage doesn't handle/accept the drag event  nothing should happen.        What do you see instead?    The downloaded file is re-downloaded again. (see &quot;before/during/after drag&quot;   screenshots)    If you do it again with another different file  then you get an infobar   about downloading multiple files (see &quot;multiple&quot; screenshot).      What's strange in this example is that in the screenshot where the PDF file   is being dragged onto the Wikipedia webpage  the icon does not show a (/)   sign indicating that it can't be dropped. When I tested on WinXP I saw the   (/) icon. </pre>
