<title>Issue 40198 -   chromium -    chromium crashes on opening a new tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   5.0.368.0~svn20100402r43430-0ubuntu1~ucd1  [note: I can't get the about:version page  since chromium crashes all the  time when I want to open a new tab to visit about:version &quot;link&quot;]  Is this the most recent version: it is in the Ubuntu PPA I am using  OS + version: Ubuntu 9.10 [lucid] beta  up-to-date  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): 32  Window manager: metacity [+Gnome DE]    If I open a new tab  chromium crashes. It seems to be stable if I only use  the saved sessions  crash occures if I want to open a new tab with CTRL-T  or if I click on a link in pidgin for example (and chromium is configured  as the default browser).    I attach some gdb log to this report.    Thanks! </pre>
