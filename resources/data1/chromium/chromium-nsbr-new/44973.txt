<title>Issue 44973 -   chromium -    not able to pin on the taskbar chrome and crome SxS toghether - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> It happens on win7. If you have chrome pinned and drag chrome SxS to the   taskbar the icon remains the chrome one  but if you lunch from the icon the   SxS will start. If you instead have SxS pinned on the taskbar and drag   chrome  the SxS icon remains in place but if you lunch it the normal chrome   will be launched. It's like the launch icon get overwritten by the other one   without changing the color. The expected behavior is to have 2 icons if you   drag to the taskbar  each one should launch the correct version. </pre>
