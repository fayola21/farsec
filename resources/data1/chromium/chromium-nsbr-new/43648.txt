<title>Issue 43648 -   chromium -    REGRESSION: HTTP protocol scheme is stripped from urls in the omnibar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Google Chrome now removes the http:// part from URLs in the omnibar and re-  adds it in several use cases. This is their design decision.    This issue is not meant for debate or posting opinions  so please refrain   from commenting. Instead  star this issue and point everyone who complains   about HTTP stripping to this issue. This way the clutter will be kept to a   minimum and yet there is a place for people to voice their opinion on this   change.     </pre>
