<title>Issue 24817 -   chromium -    cmd-` doesn't work when web contents has focus - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open two chrome windows  give focus to contents  2. Hit cmd-`        Windows should cycle        Nothing.      This is a regression caused by me sending keyboard events to the renderer   first. When they come back  I only send them to the main menu  and we   don't have a &quot;Cycle windows&quot; menu entry bound to cmd-`. Finder does   e.g. have this. I think the best fix is to just add this menu entry? Are there   other keyboard shortcuts that should Just Work but are not in a menu   item? </pre>
