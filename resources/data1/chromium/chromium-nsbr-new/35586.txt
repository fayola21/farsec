<title>Issue 35586 -   chromium -    unique_client_tags should be hashes of keys and no more than 20 bytes long. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  the unique_client_tag sent by the client is basically a human-  readable string  e.g.: the preferences key.  We should move this so that   it's a hash of a unique value.  What I'd suggest would be hashing a   concatenation of a string and the model type indicator  possibly by zipping   them together as a protobuf like:    message {    optional EntitySpecifics model_type = 1;  // set to default value for   type.    optional string type_unique_string;  }    I think it should be possible to do the hashing on creation  at the syncapi   layer. </pre>
