<title>Issue 28936 -   chromium -    youtube videos not working correctly - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.11  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.youtube.com/</a>           Safari 4: N/A    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7: N/A           IE 8: N/A      1. Run a video      The video loads  buffers  and runs correctly      More than half the time  the video either won't show up  or a black box   shows up where it's supposed to be. When I do manage to load the video    it'd restart after playing for so many seconds  or it'd buffer only to a   certain point then stop buffering.   </pre>
