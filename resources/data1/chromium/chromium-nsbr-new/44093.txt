<title>Issue 44093 -   chromium -    Print workflow needs to be adapted for cloud print. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   The high-level flow (where the PDF data is generated before even bringing   up the dialog) isn't what we want. The desired flow is for the dialog to   first be brought up (and handed in the browser tab for which it's being   brought up instead of assuming the first active browser)  have the dialog   contents communicate the page setup parameters back to us (through the flow   handler)  at which point we would message those parameters to the renderer   responsible for that tab  and that renderer would begin generating the PDF   data file  communicating progress to us  which would be passed on to the   dialog contents.  And  once the PDF generation was done  the PDF data would   then be passed into the dialog contents (instead of when first bringing up   the dialog as is done now).  Updates to the page setup parameters would   cancel any PDF generation in flight and re-start it.  This proposed flow   would also facilitate live preview of the print data.   </pre>
