<title>Issue 37059 -   chromium -    Private browsing plugin test added in WebKit's r55358 fails in Chromium. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> New private browsing plugin test was added in   <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/55358">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/55358</a>.    Regressions: Unexpected text diff mismatch : (1)    plugins/private-browsing-mode-2.html = TEXT    Actual results:  Tests that NPNVprivateModeBool is supported by the WebKit plugin view. This   test is for WebKit platforms that wish to support NPNVprivateModeBool but   do not wish to implement the preference change listener required to support   a cachedPrivateBrowsingEnabled property similar to the one provided by   Safari and tested for in private-browsing-mode.html    On success  you will see a series of &quot;PASS&quot; messages  followed by &quot;TEST   COMPLETE&quot;.      FAIL plugin1.privateBrowsingEnabled should be false (of type boolean). Was   undefined (of type undefined).  FAIL plugin1.privateBrowsingEnabled should be true (of type boolean). Was   undefined (of type undefined).  FAIL plugin2.privateBrowsingEnabled should be true (of type boolean). Was   undefined (of type undefined).  FAIL plugin1.privateBrowsingEnabled should be false (of type boolean). Was   undefined (of type undefined).  FAIL plugin2.privateBrowsingEnabled should be false (of type boolean). Was   undefined (of type undefined).   </pre>
