<title>Issue 42504 -   chromium -    Update Extension Now doesn't check for updates on 3rd party galleries - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> 1. Install an extension with a custom update url (non-gallery extension).  2. Update the extension crx with a new version and update the xml file.  3. Go to Chrome Extensions page  press Update Extensions Now.    I expect Chrome to download the xml file and upgrade the extension. However    it seems to ignore the request and update only after a few hours (either that   or it doesn't work reliably). </pre>
