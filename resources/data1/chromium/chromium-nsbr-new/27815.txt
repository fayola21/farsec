<title>Issue 27815 -   chromium -    The puzzle piece promo should not go away when the text promo is closed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Currently  when the &quot;x&quot; in the yellow textual promo on the NTP is clicked    both the yellow bar and the puzzle piece in the right corner go away.    This doesn't seem right to me. Besides being visually jarring  I like the   look of the puzzle piece  but not the yellow bar. I feel like every version   of Chromium should just have a different little effect there that sticks   around for the whole version.    OTOH  I do remember some people complaining about the theme promo. Is that   why this behavior was added? </pre>
