<title>Issue 28254 -   chromium -    Focus is weird in extension popups with mouse-grabbing widgets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Some extension popup bubbles on Linux have the same focus oddities that   bookmark bubbles did.  The bubble grabs the mouse and keyboard when it's   opened (it needs to  since it's using an override-redirect window).  If a   widget within the bubble (e.g. a combobox) later tries to grab the mouse    GDK automatically transfers the grab to it.  When the widget releases the   grab  GDK doesn't transfer the grab back to the bubble  though.  Other   widgets in the bubble behave strangely after this.    I worked around this in the bookmark bubble by reacquiring the grab when the   widget releases it  but it'll probably be trickier to do something like this   for the arbitrary web content that can appear in an extension popup. </pre>
