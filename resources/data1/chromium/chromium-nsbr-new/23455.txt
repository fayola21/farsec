<title>Issue 23455 -   chromium -    Add a way to identify which VM regions are V8 heaps  for memory profiling purposes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The vmmap(1) tool  which dumps information about every region in a process's address space  is   very useful for high-level analysis of memory usage. It already identifies which regions are created   by malloc  but memory allocated by V8 is just lumped in with all other usages of vm_allocate and   anonymous mmap  as &quot;VM_ALLOCATE ?&quot;. This means you can't use the tool to see how big the V8   heap is.    The very simple fix is to add a tag to the VM region. Apple allows 3rd party code to use the tags   240-255. Tagging is done by adding flags to vm_allocate or mmap using the VM_MAKE_TAG( )   macro. Tags have no effect at runtime  other than to give hints to tools like vmmap that examine   memory regions. </pre>
