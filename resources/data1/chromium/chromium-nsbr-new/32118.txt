<title>Issue 32118 -   chromium -    Chrome doesn't obey Ctl-W GTK key binding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  OS + version : Linux (Fedora 12)  CPU architecture (32-bit / 64-bit): x86_64  window manager : Metacity          1. Add custom key bindings to ~/.gtkrc-2.0.  2. Start Chrome.  3. Enter a custom key combination. Chrome will fail to act on it.    For example:    binding &quot;Chrome&quot; {    bind &quot;&lt;ctrl&gt;w&quot; { &quot;cut-clipboard&quot; () }    bind &quot;&lt;ctrl&gt;w&quot; { &quot;delete-from-cursor&quot; (word-ends  -1) }  }  class &quot;GtkEntry&quot; binding &quot;Chrome&quot;    This code should allow Ctrl-W to delete the previous word in a text entry  box. Unfortunately  it instead closes the current tab. The effect is  compounded if there is only a single tab open  because Ctrl-W will then  also exit the browser.          In a text entry box  the previous word should be deleted. Observance of  ~/.gtkrc-2.0 is expected behaviour for GTK apps.          The current tab is closed. The content of ~/.gtkrc-2.0 is read  but ignored.   </pre>
