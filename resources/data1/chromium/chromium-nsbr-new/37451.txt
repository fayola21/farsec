<title>Issue 37451 -   chromium -    Chinese text fails to wrap  causing horizontal expansion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.89 (Official Build 38071) unknown  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?">http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?</a>  page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=*%E5%A4%84*      Firefox 3.5.8: OK    This is a Chinese dictionary site  which I have asked to display all entries   containing a certain character. Some of the entries towards the bottom are   long idioms or phrases. None of these are wrapping across multiple lines  so   the entire table is being horizontally expanded to the point that you can no   longer see all columns without scrolling.    This compels me to use Firefox to access this site. </pre>
