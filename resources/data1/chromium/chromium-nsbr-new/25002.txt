<title>Issue 25002 -   chromium -    Opening tabs causes titlebar gradient to shrink - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 29240  URLs (if applicable) : n/a  OS version               : 10.6.1  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): n/a  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: n/a      1. Launch Chrome.  2. Press the new tab button four times.      Titlebar gradient should stay consistent.      Notice that the titlebar gradient shrinks from filling the whole dark gray   area to roughly the height of a toolbar-less titlebar. Also  closing the last   tab will typically make it draw correctly again. There are other ways to   reproduce this--minimizing and restoring the window seems to make it   particularly likely to happen--but this is the simplest I've found.    Issue appeared within the last couple days. </pre>
