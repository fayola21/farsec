<title>Issue 43615 -   chromium -    Documentation defect - Channel Switching - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The website describing how to switch to a more stable channel   (<a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Going-back-to-a-">http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Going-back-to-a-</a>  more-stable-channel ) does not describe how to actually switch to a more   stable channel.     The current wording suggests that switching to an earlier channel is possible   without reinstalling (though one has to wait until the more stable channel   has a version number greater than the current one)  however  there are no   instructions on how to do so.     Either switching channels is not possible without reinstalling  in which case   the misleading first two sentences of that section should be removed  or it   is possible and further instructions should be added. </pre>
