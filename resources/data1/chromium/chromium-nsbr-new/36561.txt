<title>Issue 36561 -   chromium -    NPS files leaked in temp dir - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On windows only  there are a lot of NPSXXX.tmp files created in the temp dir    and they are never deleted  which causes the temp dir to run out of temporary   files.    test_shell_tests or layout tests are creating them.    This change seem to be related  but this is really old. So maybe the &quot;files   are deleted when the plugin goes away&quot; assertion is not true anymore.  <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/glue/plugins/plugin_st">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/webkit/glue/plugins/plugin_st</a>  ream_win.cc?<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=1">r1</a>=5197&amp;<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=2">r2</a>=6245 </pre>
