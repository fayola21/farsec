<title>Issue 44889 -   chromium -    Enhancement: Customise 'Show in Folder' action - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I rarely use Windows Explorer.    I prefer Total Commander. TC has a command line command for opening a folder   in a new tab.    I'd like to customise the Chrome 'Show in Folder' command so that it passes   the folder name to a specific command  which in my case would be Total   Commander.    For example  I already do this with Locate32. </pre>
