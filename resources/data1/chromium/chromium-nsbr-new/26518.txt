<title>Issue 26518 -   chromium -    Implement extensions sync - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.11    It would be nice if extensions  like bookmarks  could follow you wherever you   go. It's annoying to have to manually install your extensions every time you   use a new computer. I realize this is probably much more complex than syncing   bookmarks  but it would be a really nice feature. </pre>
