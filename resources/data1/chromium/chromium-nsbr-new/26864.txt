<title>Issue 26864 -   chromium -    unable to install themes/extensions when using non-utf8 file encoding - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. LANG=en_US.iso885915 xterm    2. chrome --user-data-dir=��_��_ber  3. try to install a theme        The theme won't install properly.  There are a couple issues:  a) browser_theme_provider.cc has some WStringHacks floating around.  b) extension_prefs.cc tries to put a filepath in a DictionaryValue.    DicitonaryValue only knows about utf8  but the filepath might not be utf8.    I fixed (a)  then ran into (b).  I think maybe Value* should know about   FilePath  or at least provide some wrappers for it.   </pre>
