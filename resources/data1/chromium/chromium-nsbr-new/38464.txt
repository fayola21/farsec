<title>Issue 38464 -   chromium -    A library is not recreated after a .cc file is removed from its list of sources - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/1047003">http://codereview.chromium.org/1047003</a>  I moved cert_test_util.cc  from the net_base library to the net_test_support library  and  ssl_test_util.cc from the net library to the net_test_support library.    As the attached build log shows  the two .cc files were recompiled  and  the net_test_support library was recreated.  But the net_base and net  libraries were not recreated  so they still contained the object files  cert_test_util.obj and ssl_test_util.obj.  So the executable  chrome_frame_net_tests  which is now missing the dependency on the  net_test_support library  could still be linked successfully.    This missing dependency was discovered later when a buildbot that does  clobber builds got unresolved symbols when linking chrome_frame_net_tests.    Is it possible for GYP-generated build files to recreate a library if  a .cc file is removed from its list of sources?    Please mark this bug WontFix if this is hard to implement.  Thanks. </pre>
