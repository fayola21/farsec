<title>Issue 32857 -   chromium -    When tooltip text is elided a blank line is shown - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On chromiumos we recently switched to a new gtk theme. The problem started   happening then. Create a title for a page that's long. If it gets and you   hover over the tab title the tooltip will show the text but in a tip that's 2   lines tall. </pre>
