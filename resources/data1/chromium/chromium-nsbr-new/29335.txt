<title>Issue 29335 -   chromium -    be clever about fetching blacklist when no extensions are installed - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We don't really want clients with no extensions fetching the blacklist all   the time  because many of them may never install an extension  so it's a big   waste of server resources. However  we'd like to protect people from having   their first install of an extension be installing something that is on the   blacklist.    One of the best ideas I've seen so far for how to handle this is  on first   extension install  if the extension doesn't come from the gallery  to kick   off a request for the blacklist and block the install (with some reasonable   timeout) until it the blacklist comes back. If we can start the blacklist   fetch soon enough  hopefully we can hide some of the user-perceived latency. </pre>
