<title>Issue 39718 -   chromium -    Install plugin prompts should be bypassed when a plugin is disabled using about:plugins - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Use internal flash plugin using --enable-internal-flash      1. Go to about:plugins and disable flash  2. Navigate to www.hulu.com    What is the expected output?   A better info bar saying that the plugin is disabled should be shown. If   possible  give an option to enable plugin using that infobar.    What do you see instead?  Info bar which prompts to install plugin is seen.    Google Chrome	5.0.360.4 (Official Build 42897) </pre>
