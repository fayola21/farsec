Open the URL above  and change to English if necessary;  2. Click &quot;To Download Page&quot;;  3. Wait for some seconds and click &quot;Raysource&quot; or just have the mouse   hovered on the button        If the download tool called &quot;Raysource&quot; on the website is installed  the   file will be downloaded normally.        Since the link is encoded by base64  the case is critical  which toggled by   chrome and messed up.   </pre>
