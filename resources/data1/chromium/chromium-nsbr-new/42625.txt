<title>Issue 42625 -   chromium -    Verify available disk space before starting a download - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Download  say 300 MB file having 100 MB free on disk  2. Wait for free disk space to end      1. Chrome somehow should mark download as broken  2. Ability to continue/restart downloading      1. Say  if I was downloading my presentation.mov  Chrome saves only 100 MB   of it and it looks like a normal file and shows no errors. So  if I don't   know which file(s) I need to re-download  I'll get a surprise later  when   I'll open it. I'll screw up during my presentation!    2. I go to downloads and see no feature to resume my download. I cannot   even restart it! Damn. I need to copy URL to address bar to do that.      <b>Please provide
