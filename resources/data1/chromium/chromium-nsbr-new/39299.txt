<title>Issue 39299 -   chromium -    Waiting for cache - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Navigate to any page with http auth   2. Navigate to page from 1 in another tab.      Each tab which opening page requiring http auth should ask for a   credentials.      Instead of that the second tab is &quot;Waiting for cache&quot;(??what does it mean   in this context??) until i submit http auth window in first tab. It could   be nice if the tabs loading same site try to load it again with auth from   tab with submited credentials from first tab or if there could be setting   item in options of chromium for that;). I tried that again and it seems it   happens only if the pages are opened at starting of chromium(restoring   previous session)     <b>Please provide
