<title>Issue 35495 -   chromium -    Manual update checks should always get the latest version (and not get error 12) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On the Mac  there's no difference in the update check from the About.. box   vs. a periodic automatic check.    On Windows  a manual request has an extra 'installsource' field that can be   either ondemandupdatecheck or ondemandinstall for on demand manual checks.    On the server side  we can use the extra data to make sure that people who   click &quot;install the update&quot; always get the bits.     This allows us to throttle automatic updates  while still servicing people   who know the update is available and explicitly ask for it.    cc'ing ddorwin@google  who I think is familiar with how things work in   Omaha on Windows. </pre>
