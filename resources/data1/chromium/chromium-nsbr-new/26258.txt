<title>Issue 26258 -   chromium -    Borders around location bar and find bar wrong color in gtk. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Instead of drawing the correct background image  we fake the borders on the   location bar and the find box with multiple event boxes colored static   colors. This used to work  but now that there are themes  it can look really   bad. Replace those layers of event boxes with blitting the proper background   images.    It's only subtly wrong in some themes (Hedgehog in the Fog)  but can be   fairly discernible on dark themes (Tiesto) or bright themes (Good Smile). </pre>
