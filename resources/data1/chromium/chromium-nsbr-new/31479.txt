<title>Issue 31479 -   chromium -    When the location specified under Downloads is in a volume that is not currently mounted  Chrome creates a folder with that name under /Volumes instead of downloading to another location. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :     Google Chrome	4.0.249.43 (Official Build 34537)  WebKit	532.5  V8	1.3.18.16  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US)   AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.249.43 Safari/532.5      1. Mount an external drive  either directly to the computer or by opening a   shared drive on another machine on the network.  2. Choose a folder on that drive as the Downloads location.  3. Unmount that drive.  4. Download something in Chrome.        Chrome should prompt you about that location no longer existing and/or   download it to another  already existing location that is not in /Volumes.        Chrome creates a folder hierarchy under /Volumes. e.g.   /Volumes/The_Name_of_My_External_Drive/downloads. The problem with   this is that the next time that drive is mounted  that volume will be named   with a &quot;-1&quot; suffix because Chrome has already created a folder with that   name. e.g /Volumes/The_Name_of_My_External_Drive-1/. This can cause   problems for other scripts and programs the user may have that rely on   the external volume having the original name.   </pre>
