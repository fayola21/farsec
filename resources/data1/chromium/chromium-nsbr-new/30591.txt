<title>Issue 30591 -   chromium -    [Linux] Extensions Icons on menu get messed with other elements when window shrinks - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Install few extensions on chrome  2. Shrink(resize to low) the window     Actual: Extension icons on menu gets overlapped with the other elements of window.  ( Screenshots added for reference - On both Linux and Mac )    Expected: Icons should not overlap with other chrome elements.  It would be good  if we  add chevron ( &gt;&gt;) for extensions stack on window resize.     </pre>
