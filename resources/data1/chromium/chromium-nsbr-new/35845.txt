<title>Issue 35845 -   chromium -    java applets not working  including simple &quot;what version is java&quot; applets - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       :  Chromium	5.0.307.7 (Developer Build 38400) Ubuntu  WebKit	532.9  V8	2.0.6.6    URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://www.javatester.org/version.html">http://www.javatester.org/version.html</a>          Firefox 3.x: OK          1. open <a href="http://www.javatester.org/version.html">http://www.javatester.org/version.html</a>  2. look at &quot;Method 1:  Ask Java&quot; on that page  3. notice the lack of pink box (inside the blue box) with the java version       Per the instructions in the bottom half of the blue box you should see a   pink box with a java version string in it  such as &quot;Java Version 1.6.0_16   from Sun Microsystems Inc.&quot;      No pink box.    Attach a screenshot if possible.    I can if it's really not clear  but I think the results make it very clear   without the need for a screenshot. </pre>
