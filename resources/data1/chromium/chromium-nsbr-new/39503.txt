<title>Issue 39503 -   chromium -    MAJOR ERROR in distinguishing Serbian from Croatian language - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Language: Serbian Latin / Croatian  Version number: Google Chrome 5.0.342.7 beta  OS: Ubuntu Karmic    Description: Google Translator interprets web sites in Serbian written in   Latin script as sites &quot;in Croatian language&quot;.    Explanation: Serbian language uses both Cyrillic and Latin script  Latin   being more popular on the Internet. Serbian pages written in Cyrillic are   by no mistake recognized as Serbian  while 100% of Serbian pages written in   Latin script are by mistake recognized as Croatian. The script you use to   distinguish them is wrong - the use of Latin script in Serbian language   doesn't make it Croatian.    Linguistic explanation: Serbian and Croatian are mutually intelligible   languages and are almost identical. They represent Serbian and Croatian   standard of what used to be Serbo-Croatian language in ex-Yugoslavia.   Serbo-Croatian used both Cyrillic and Latin script  as does contemporary   Serbian standard  while Croatian is Latin only.    Cultural curiosities: The standards are so similar that it is sometimes   impossible even for native speakers to determine whether the text is   written in Croatian or Serbian standard. Due to nationalism in the area    these two standards insist that they are two separate languages  while the   differences are even less than British and American English.     Suggestions: First  solve the issue of treating Serbian pages as Croatian    this is of utmost importance. Second  if it is impossible for you to make a   distinction  make a category &quot;Serbian or Croatian&quot; or &quot;Serbian/Croatian&quot; or   &quot;either Serbian or Croatian&quot; for the pages you are unsure of. For instance    Serbian pages in Latin script  which outnumber Serbian pages in Cyrillic   script.    Examples:  - Wikipedia in Serbian  - Site of RTS  Serbian national TV  - Site of NIN  a prestigious Serbian weekly newspaper  - Site of Serbian Government  - Krajina Force - The voice of Serbs in exile  the national site of Serbs   from Croatia                      </pre>
