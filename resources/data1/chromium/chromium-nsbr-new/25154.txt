<title>Issue 25154 -   chromium -    task manager error messages on Linux - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.3 (Developer Build Ubuntu build 29376)    The task manager continuously puts out error messages about non-existent   processes  like:    [29486:29486:170116968370:ERROR:/build/buildd/chromium-browser-  4.0.223.3~svn20091017r29376/build-tree/src/base/process_util_linux.cc(370)]   opendir(/proc/27/task/): No such file or directory    It's also not clear if its really showing any info on tabs. I only see non-  zero statistics on browser and the shockwave flash plugin.      This is on ubuntu 9.04.     </pre>
