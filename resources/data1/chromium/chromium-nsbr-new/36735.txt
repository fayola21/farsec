<title>Issue 36735 -   chromium -    sync spurious update for TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Our server appears to be sending updates to TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER items after   initial sync  which should not happen.  We have worked around some NOTREACHED   statements that ToT client code would otherwise trigger due to this problem    until we can fix the situation on the server. </pre>
