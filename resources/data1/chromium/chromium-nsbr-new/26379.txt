<title>Issue 26379 -   chromium -    JavaScript can pop an alert panel while you're dragging a tab. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [See also <a title="Jank with JavaScript alert versus modal loops."  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26378">Issue 26378</a>: Jank with JavaScript alert versus modal loops.]      1. Bring up two tabs.  2. Browse one to the attached alert.html.  3. Drag the alert.html tab off the window and don't release.        The alert pops up and hangs around while you drag the tab around.  It doesn't seem to BREAK   anything  but it's pretty weird. </pre>
