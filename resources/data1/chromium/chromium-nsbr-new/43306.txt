<title>Issue 43306 -   chromium -    If I move or remove a directory in the file system  and the directory was the most-recently-saved-in-directory  Chrome recreates it the next time I try to save something and the save dialogue box defaults to this recreated directory. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.375.29    OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): If I delete the directory or move it to the Trash  Safari   shows me its parent.  If I move it (but not into the Trash)  Safari shows me my Documents folder.  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): If I delete the directory  Firefox defaults to the user-  specified download directory.  If I move the directory --- even into the Trash --- Firefox finds it   and defaults there.  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: did not test      1. Save a web page.  2. Delete or move the directory it was saved into.  3. Bring up the save dialogue box again.      Chrome defaults to the user-specified downloads directory  or the deepest still-extant parent of   the missing directory  or my home directory  or my Documents folder.      Chrome recreates the missing directory. </pre>
