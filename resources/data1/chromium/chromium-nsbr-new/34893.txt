<title>Issue 34893 -   chromium -    Pinned Tabs vanished - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version: 5.0.317.2 dev      The  what I am calling  application tabs  where you can drag a tab to the far   left of the tab bar and have it auto shrink to just the favicon  that were   introduced in 4.0.302.2 have been removed in 5.0.317.2 dev.    I consider this a regression even if the feature was never announced as I   like the feature and made heavy use of it  please bring them back. </pre>
