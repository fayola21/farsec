<title>Issue 33148 -   chromium -    Crash recovery of tabs hangs Chrome for minutes on end - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.276.0 (0)      1. open a whole bunch of tabs from many many websites with lots of memory  2. force-kill chromium    Problem:  Chromium asks &quot;Chromium didn't shut down correctly  reopen tabs?&quot; and   effectively freezes and thrashes the disk for a good few minutes. One   cannot access any URLs or do anything at all. I think it's trying to   recover something  but it should not do *anything* at all until the user   requests a Recovery operation.    Since I often have over 20 tabs open and often force-kill Chrome  this   effectively means I have to wait about 5 minutes every time I open the   browser for the first time in a day. </pre>
