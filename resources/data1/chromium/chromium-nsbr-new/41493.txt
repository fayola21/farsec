<title>Issue 41493 -   chromium -    Change heuristic on when to include scheme in pasted text from address bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We already have bugs that the rich-text item copied from the address bar   doesn't include the scheme when the plaintext one does -- see <a title="Copy url to X copy buffer does not include protocol string" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41173"> bug 41173 </a>  <a title="REGRESSION: Copy URL from Omnibox and pasting into rich text does not include protocol string" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=41489"> bug   41489 </a>  etc.    However  there's a different issue that is also problematic for me.    If I select all of a URL except the query params  and paste  I don't get the   scheme.  his is because our heuristic is &quot;copy as a URL if the whole URL was   selected&quot;.  I think this should change to &quot;copy as a URL if the selection   starts at the beginning of the text and includes at least the entire   hostname&quot;. </pre>
