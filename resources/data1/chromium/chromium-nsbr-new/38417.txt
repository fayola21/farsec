<title>Issue 38417 -   chromium -    text field repeating IME input content in test_shell  - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I use  <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/41832/">http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/41832/</a>   build for this test.  when runing test_shell  I replace the   webkitdatatest_shellindex.html with a html page that contains a text input   field.  Then use chinese IME to input characters into it.  When I type in   &quot;XY&quot;  the final text that inputed into the field will be XYXY.    However  if I use chrome-win32.zip to do the test  everything is normal.    I raise this is because the chromiumembedded project have the same issue as   the test_shell and don't know how to fix it.  </pre>
