<title>Issue 43834 -   chromium -    Autofill configuration triggers too easily - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I signed into a checkout page: <a href="https://checkout.google.com/view/receipt?">https://checkout.google.com/view/receipt?</a>  t=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX to complete a transaction and I got the &quot;Configure   autofill&quot; infobar. We shouldn't show this unless I've actually filled out   more than 2 (?) non-username/password fields. In this case  it seemed to suck   in only a phone number.     </pre>
