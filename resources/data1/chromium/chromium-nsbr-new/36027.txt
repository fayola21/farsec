<title>Issue 36027 -   chromium -    Website used to look fine  but after refresh is completely messed up. Another refresh doesn't help - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.322.2 unknown    <a href="http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/de/ph/14/ep/einfuehrung/efeld/ar">http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/de/ph/14/ep/einfuehrung/efeld/ar</a>  beit.vlu/Page/vsc/de/ph/14/ep/einfuehrung/efeld/kapitel3/arbeit06.vscml.htm  l  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x : not tested  Behavior in Firefox 3.6: working perfectly      1. Visiting the website. I can't really reproduce it because the website is   messed up now and stays so forever. Only on the first visit it was working.    Problem:  On the first visit  the formulas were graphics and they could be displayed   nicely. After a refresh  the formulas were characters and really messed up.   Refreshing all the time didn't help at all. Luckily I still had a tab with   the old version of the website  so I could create the sceenshot attached.   Left side is first  working version  right side is broken one after   refresh.     </pre>
