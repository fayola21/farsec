<title>Issue 28393 -   chromium -    Chromium Linux should not start if the suid sandbox is not owned by root - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=30948">r30948</a>  anyone on Linux using the suid sandbox need to have it owned   by root. This is normally the case  but we should add a sanity check and   refuse to start if this assumption does not hold true.    I've already committed <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=32314">r32314</a>  this bug is just to help keep track of the   mstone:4 merge. </pre>
