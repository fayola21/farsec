<title>Issue 34564 -   chromium -    bookmark bar unresponsive on NTP - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Open a new tab  2. Click on a bookmark on the bookmark bar    Nothing happens.    If I press control-B and &quot;dock&quot; the bar  it works. With the bar &quot;undocked&quot;   it fails.    <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=38084">r38084</a>    Will try to narrow it down more later. </pre>
