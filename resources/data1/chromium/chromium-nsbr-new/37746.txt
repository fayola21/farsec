<title>Issue 37746 -   chromium -    The MultipartResponseUITest.SingleVisit test started failing on the XP and Vista dbg builders since CL 41003 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This CL just ensures that we read the user-data-dir as it is passed in and   don't try and convert it to ASCII.    Marking this test as DISABLED for now as this needs some debugging. </pre>
