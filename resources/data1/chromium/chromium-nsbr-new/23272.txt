<title>Issue 23272 -   chromium -    Support pinned tabs on Mac - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Pinned tabs have been added to both Linux and Windows now. The plan is to   have it work on all platforms  so we need a Mac implementation. Nicholas said   he would do the implementation  but I don't know what his schedule is like.    Support for windows was added in <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=25963">r25963</a>. You might also want to look at   <a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=20181">r20181</a> which added support to TabStripModel for pinned tabs. </pre>
