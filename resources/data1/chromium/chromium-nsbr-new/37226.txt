Chrome with bookmark bar with  sub folders inside a folder.  2. Go full screen.  3. On the floating tool bar menu in the full screen mode  click on the book mark folder and open   all its sub folders. ( screen shot attached)  4. With the floating menu hiding click above the book mark folder.       What is the expected output?   Floating tool bar menu should be in sync with the bookmark bar subfolder sub menus.    What do you see instead?  Crash.  When the bookmark bar subfolder sub menus are open  the floating tool bar menu disappears   and click above the folder menu crashes the browser.    Note : The Crash report is empty .     filing separate bugs for the themes issue and empty crash report.     </pre>
