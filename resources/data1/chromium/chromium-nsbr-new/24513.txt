<title>Issue 24513 -   chromium -    most visited boxes flash on screen when opening new tab page that has been configured to not show most visited boxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> most visited boxes flash on screen when opening new tab page that has been   configured to not show most visited boxes    flickery UI == not good    observed in:  4.0.222.2 (Developer Build 28527)    this seems to happen more commonly when themes are enabled  presumably   because of the expense related to painting the NTP background.  i noticed   this while running with the &quot;infected mushroom&quot; theme. </pre>
