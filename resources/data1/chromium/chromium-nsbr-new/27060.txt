<title>Issue 27060 -   chromium -    Start Page Screenshots Should Not Save Text - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.223.16  URLs (if applicable) : NA  Other browsers tested: NA                1. Go to a web page that is on your start page and that has a login on that   page that you have saved your user/pass for.  2. Chrome may save a screenshot of that page with the user/pass textboxes   filled in since they are auto-filled by Chrome.        I would expect Chrome to take smarter screenshots.  For instance  clearing   all form fields before taking a screenshot.      Chrome randomly takes a screenshot without regard for the content on the   page.     </pre>
