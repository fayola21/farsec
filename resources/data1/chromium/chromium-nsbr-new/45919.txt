<title>Issue 45919 -   chromium -    Google Chrome on MacOSX 10.6.3 locks up all keyboard/mouse input - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version    : 5.0.375.55  Mac OS X 10.6.3    (I'm a googler who works on Google Code Project Hosting  but reporting this in the public issue   tracker.)    I received a brand new Macbook Pro last week and installed the latest Chrome.  I've been using   Chrome exclusively on this machine  and approximately once per day this bug happens:      * Chrome suddenly stops accepting all keyboard input and mouse clicks;      * All other running applications stop accepting all keyboard input and mouse clicks as well;      * Each keyboard press produces a 'boop' sound   as if a modal dialog box were complaining   about my typing/clicking elsewhere when I shouldn't.  But I can't find any dialog box at all  even   when revealing all windows in Expose.      * Of course  the Quartz window manager continues to work -- I can move app window frames   around  but still can't click or type *within* any application window. Nor can I actually switch to a   different app -- the Chrome menu bar stays locked at the top of the screen.      * If I 'force quit' Chrome from the dock  the dock thinks Chrome is no longer running  and   Activity Monitor shows no such process either.  However  the Chrome menu bar stays stuck at   the top of the screen!      * At this point  I'm unable to even access the Apple menu for a clean restart;  I'm forced to cut   power and do a cold reboot.    At first I thought that maybe this was a result of some buggy Chrome extension  but the only   extension I'm running is 'Chromed Bird'.  When I uninstalled this extension  the problem still   recurred the next day.    Is there some sort of secret  invisible  modal dialog box I can't see?  Is this a known issue?  I was   using Chrome 5.0 daily with no problems on Mac OS X 10.5 for months until I got this new 10.6   machine last week. </pre>
