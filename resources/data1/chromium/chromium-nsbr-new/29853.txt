<title>Issue 29853 -   chromium -    ��_��_��_ JavaScript 2.6.2 Incompatibility - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ChromeFrame version: 4.0.255.0 (Official Build 32762)    Related URL(s): NVIDIA inhouse webapp    ��_��_��_ JavaScript 2.6.2 Incompatibility  The JavaScript 2.6.2 specification allows arbitrary field names in objects  ��_��_��_ even with any special characters. Thus an ��_��_��_Address��_��_��_ class of course can  have the property ��_��_��_name��_��_��_ in it. In JavaScript an object per default has no  ��_��_��_name��_��_��_ field  same for properties which we use for our webapp config  methodology. ��_��_��_Sometimes��_��_��_ if we use and access the name field of function  objects it simply disappeared��_��__ Imagine how nice it was to figure that out ;-)    Isolating the issue was almost the solution: I changed all the ��_��_��_name��_��_��_  fields to ��_��_��_funcName��_��_��_ or similar wherever it was necessary and all of a  sudden everything worked again. </pre>
