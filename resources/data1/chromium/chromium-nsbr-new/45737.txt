<title>Issue 45737 -   chromium -    TabStrip animation parity with Windows - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I would like to synchronize tab animations between all platforms. This means   once we've tuned the Windows tab animations to our satisfaction  we should   make sure the tabstrips on Mac and Linux should use the same animations.    Note to Mac: This means they should run at the same speeds too  not the    animation speeds we're using now  which are too slow. </pre>
