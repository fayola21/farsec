<title>Issue 33012 -   chromium -    google-chrome-beta-4.0.249.43-34537.i386 requires qt3! - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 4.0.249.43    rpm = google-chrome-beta-4.0.249.43-34537.i386    google-chrome-beta requires qt3 - see below    If google is really serious about gaining browser market share with thier   google-chrome browser on linux then they need to move with the times (i.e.   kde3 is out  kde4 is in). This means that they must build google-chrome   browser with qt4    790FX:/space1 # zypper remove qt3-3.3.8b-93.1.i586  Retrieving repository 'openSUSE KDE4 Factory Desktop' metadata [done]  Building repository 'openSUSE KDE4 Factory Desktop' cache [done]  Loading repository data...

In fact   that was the design goal of Qt4: lower resource usage. That said  a  system running both Qt3 and Qt4. along with GTK libraries  and  whatever Open Office uses  is a dog! As I do not have any remaining  Qt3 apps  running KDE 4.4  Open Office and FIrefox is rather quick and  certainly no heavier than using the same apps in KDE 3 were.    # other details  uname -a  Linux 790FX 2.6.31.8-0.1-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT 2009-12-15 23:55:40 +0100   i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux </pre>
