<title>Issue 45679 -   chromium -    Sync visited links - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The &quot;visited links&quot; data is kept separately from history.  It would be a boon   to sync this so that I could go home and still have the 20 techmeme articles   I read at work be marked as visited when I go to the site.  Hopefully it'd be   simple to do too.    Tim tells me this can't make M6.    CCing Brett who authored the visited links system  as he can consult on any   technical questions around how to make this work. </pre>
