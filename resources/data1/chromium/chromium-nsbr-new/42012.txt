<title>Issue 42012 -   chromium -    --enable-http-in-address-bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.381.0 (44876)    So maybe Googlers can be persuaded to at least add an option to restore the   original functionality  if they don't want to discuss the actual bug itself. Users will never notice or know about it and complainers have no reason to   complain anymore.   </pre>
