<title>Issue 33876 -   chromium -    Security: LocalStorage Cross Domain Denial of Service Attack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Operating System : Windows XP SP2  Chrome Version : 4.0.249.78    Steps to reproduce :  1. Visit an evil domain which executes a DOS exploit filling up the  localStorage (and probably occupying localstorage ipc channel?) (in an  iframe) - <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/localstorage/exploit.html">http://securethoughts.com/security/localstorage/exploit.html</a>  2. Wait for some time like 10 sec.  3. Open a new tab and visit a trusted site -  <a href="http://infernohacks.com/localstorage/set.html">http://infernohacks.com/localstorage/set.html</a> which wants to set a single  name/value pair.  4. Trusted Site won't open. it looks to fail accessing the localStorage.  5. Sites that don't use localStorage open normally. e.g. i tried google.com  and it opened fine.  6. If you close the browser and restart it again  then everything works fine.    (step 3 must be done after step 1  otherwise step 4 might work as expected  since it might get cached.)    i also found this to show the same result for Mac OS Snow Leopard + Chrome  4.0.302.2 dev   </pre>
