<title>Issue 32915 -   chromium -    [MD audit] [Window Sandbox] CrossCallParamsEx::CreateFromBuffer() integer overflow - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In srcsandboxsrccrosscall_server.cc there is an integer overflow issue   with call_params-&gt;GetParamsCount()    If the param_count value in the untrusted buffer is above max_uint / 4 or if   param_count is 0.    The net effect is that we allocate memory from the heap     backing_mem = new char[actual_size];    In which actual_size is smaller than required by 0x60 bytes. The following   placement new allocation:     new(backing_mem)CrossCallParamsEx();    Causes bytes outside the allocated chunk of the heap to be overwritten. I   does not appear that the values or location are controlled by the attacker    in fact they are just zeros form the above ctor.    Unfortunately now the loop that calls     address = copied_params-&gt;GetRawParameter()     is now operating in memory that has not been fully initialized. This codepath   then performs 7 tests on the |address| value which random memory is unlikely   to pass but one can never be sure.    The severity rating reflects the fact that the bug is in a security sensitive  code-path but I is believed that it would be very hard to exploit this bug   beyond DoS via heap corruption.   </pre>
