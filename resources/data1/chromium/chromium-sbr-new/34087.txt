<title>Issue 34087 -   chromium -    Vulnerability on access bank site - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> By accessing HTTPS pages the browser behaves inappropriately. An example of  this is that when access to a database page (In my case the bank Santander)  and enter the bank information and press OK to access to the browser simply  does not enter  and generates a cookie that process. To have to get into  pressuring the back button again and press the OK!    This process creates a vulnerability and can be used to capture information.   </pre>
