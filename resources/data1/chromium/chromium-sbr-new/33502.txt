<title>Issue 33502 -   chromium -    Information leak in STYLE href property - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a>&quot;&gt;  Hola  &lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;  setTimeout(&quot;alert(document.styleSheets[0].href)&quot;  10000);  //setTimeout is used just to wait for page loading  &lt;/script&gt;      The code above should display the same href value as in the LINK tag but   it displays the final URL if there is a redirection  here in my country   when you browse to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a> you get redirected to   <a href="http://ar.yahoo.com/?p=us">http://ar.yahoo.com/?p=us</a> so the above code displays this last URL.    There are some websites that put user session ids on the URL querystrings   the same for tokens used for CSRF protection  if an attacker can get a   user browsing his website then he can use the above code to reference a   URL of a website the user is logged on that will be redirected to another   URL that could have a session id or token in the querystring and then use   this information for more dangerous attacks. Some websites could also have   in the querystring some other useful information that could be used for   further attacks. Websites putting session ids  tokens  etc. in querystings   are already not secure but this issue helps in exploiting them. </pre>
