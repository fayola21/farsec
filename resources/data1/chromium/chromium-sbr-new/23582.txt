<title>Issue 23582 -   chromium -    We need to look at all the different process type and see about sandboxes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We did the renderer sandbox early on  but haven't looked since.  I believe   windows sandboxes the helper extensions use for reencoding images  etc.    We should go through all the process types and make sure we have the right   sandboxing in place  might not hurt to get all the sandboxing into a common   flow so it can log/assert if it gets a new process type without us thinking   about a sandbox while it first gets created. </pre>
