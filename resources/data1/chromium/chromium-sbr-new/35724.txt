<title>Issue 35724 -   chromium -    Integer overflow in webGL - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The bug allows to read and write arbitrary data to process memory using   WebGLArray object.  It's in the &quot;WebGLArray::create(buffer  byteOffset  length)&quot; method. If   byteOffset+length &gt;= 0x80000000  it passes all checks. Then the array   pointer changes to buffer_size+byteOffset and you can access the data using   get() and set() methods.  Browser:  Chromium	5.0.326.0 (Developer Build 38881)  WebKit	533.1  V8	2.1.0.1  It's important that it doesn't require to enable webGL(&quot;--enable-webgl&quot; in   command line) because it doesn't use &quot;getContext('webkit-3d')&quot; method. It   probably doesn't work on Chrome 	4.0.249.89 (you can crash it by &quot;o   = new WebGLByteArray(-1)&quot;  but there is no get()/set() methods).  The testcase reads some data from the memory and displays it on the screen   (try to reload the page to see more).  It also possible to read the data just using negative numbers in the get()   method. </pre>
