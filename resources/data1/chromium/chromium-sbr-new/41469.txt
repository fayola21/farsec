<title>Issue 41469 -   chromium -    Drag and drop bad reference counting leads to re-use of freed memory: WebCore..String..length ReadAV@Arbitrary (394bb1a56acd66a43221b2a08fa5b25a) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Dragging and dropping an image while a page is being refreshed can trigger memory corruption. Found while   trying to reproduce issue 41447.    Repro:  1) Create a window with an IFRAME that refreshes constantly (drag&amp;drop.htm)  2) In the IFRAME  load a page that has an image. (drag&amp;drop2.html  drag&amp;drop.jpg)  3) Drag and drop the image.  4) KaB00m.    This repro may not show clear signs of memory corruption. However  using the repro for issue 41447 to do   this does clearly show the same crash  but with a non-NULL pointer.       </pre>
