<title>Issue 28645 -   chromium -    MatchPattern in string_util.cc can smash the stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The MatchPattern function in string_util takes a pattern and does an 2^n   recursion on question marks.  For example  a user script with a url pattern   with lots of question marks will never complete  can could smash the stack.    We're saved by the sandbox since patterns appear to be matched in the   renderer.  It seems like we should give up after a certain recursion depth   just to be safe. </pre>
