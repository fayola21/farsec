<title>Issue 39740 -   chromium -    Plugins are not always blocked by content settings - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Plugins are not always blocked by content settings    Observed in 5.0.365.0 (Developer Build 42941)    Repro steps:  1- Modify content settings to block all plugins  2- Load test case  3- Click button  4- Notice that the plugin loads and can be played    The bug is likely related to the fact that we only send down the blocked   content settings in response to a top-level navigation.  In this example    there is no top-level navigation since the newly opened window is to   about:blank. </pre>
