<title>Issue 40575 -   chromium -    An HTTP page loaded quickly after NTP can gain DOMUI bindings privilege - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> ------------  Problem  ------------    If you start a new load on the same tab before the &quot;new tab&quot; process commits the load  you can   get the site to load in the same process as the NTP  and it will have the dom_ui_enabled bit set.    This race has been hit by users  and is the underlying cause for <a href="http://crbug.com/12718">http://crbug.com/12718</a> (it   causes form submission to appear as flaky  since when the page gets loaded into NTP process    forms will submit as a GET instead of a POST  until the page is reloaded into a new tab)    ------------  Reproduction steps  ------------      chrome  --renderer-startup-dialog --no-sandbox    (1) Open a new tab page [the renderer will be frozen due to an alert box]  (2) Type the URL <a href="http://sadsteve.com/chrome_bug.php">http://sadsteve.com/chrome_bug.php</a>  (3) Dismiss the renderer start dialog  to resume the renderer    Or alternately on mac/linux  you can use GDB in place of the startup dialog to fake the latency:    chrome --renderer-cmd-prefix='gdb --args'    Now  if you attach to the renderer process hosting the webpage  you will find that   &quot;dom_ui_enabled&quot; is set for its RenderView. Moreover  if you follow the instructions on the   chrome_bug.php page  you will find that the form submission does not work -- the reason is it   gets short-circuited in RenderView::decidePolicyForNavigation() because of the value of   dom_ui_enabled. </pre>
