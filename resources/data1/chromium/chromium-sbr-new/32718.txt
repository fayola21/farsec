<title>Issue 32718 -   chromium -    Security: Cross-domain bug in password manager - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I have not had a lot of time to test various scenarios with this issue.  If  you have trouble reproducing  just let me know and I can try to get a more  precise test case.    In messing around with HTTP digest authentication  I discovered a behavior  where the password manager pre-populates the login form for one domain with  the credentials for *another domain*.  It doesn't submit them  automatically  but does leave the user one click away from sending  credentials to the wrong place.    Here are the steps I followed on Chrome 3.0.195.38 under Windows 7 (release  candidate):    0. Set up an HTML page with the following contents:     &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;       &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://evil.example.com/image.png">http://evil.example.com/image.png</a>&quot; /&gt;     &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;       This page should be hosted at (not protected by any auth):       <a href="http://victim.example.org/test-img.html">http://victim.example.org/test-img.html</a>      1. Next  set up an HTTP digest protected area under the following URL:     <a href="http://victim.example.org/private/">http://victim.example.org/private/</a>      2. Now set up the attacker's server to be digest protected  so      that the following URL should prompt for digest auth:     <a href="http://evil.example.com/image.png">http://evil.example.com/image.png</a>      3. Log in to a digest-protected area such as:      <a href="http://victim.example.org/private">http://victim.example.org/private</a>       Save the password in the password manager.      4. Now  access the unauthenticated HTML page on the victim's server:     <a href="http://victim.example.org/test-img.html">http://victim.example.org/test-img.html</a>            Since the embedded image requires authentication  you should get a     password prompt.      The vulnerability I encountered is that the password manager actually  prepopulates victim.example.org's credentials in this dialog.  In message  board websites  or anywhere that an attacker can post links to images on  third party sites  this could be a serious phishing issue.  No other  browser I tested does this.    With digest authentication  this isn't the end of the world since passwords  aren't that easy to get at  but I would be surprised if basic  authentication prompts don't have the same behavior.    I was doing some general security testing on many browsers when I came  across this issue.  I have some additional observations about security  weaknesses in this area which affect many browsers that I'll be publishing  in a week or so.  I will drop a link somewhere here when I get it out and I  hope some of your devs will have a chance to review it.    thanks!   </pre>
