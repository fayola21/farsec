<title>Issue 29112 -   chromium -    Block chrome-extension:// pages from importing script over non-HTTPS connections - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Importing insecure scripts in background pages are a bad practice that I  have seen recommended on extension developer mailing lists in combination  with Google Analytics. There is simply no way for an extension with  &quot;https:// or &quot;tab&quot; privileges to do this securely without compromising the  user's security. We should treat it like particularly virulent mixed  content and block it.      1. Create an extension with some privileges  e.g. tags or &quot;https://*  2. Put &lt;script src=&quot;<a href="http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;">http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</a> in the  extension's background page.    What is the expected output?    A console error such as &quot;Refused to execute external JavaScript script  <a href="http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js">http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js</a>. Extensions can only load external  scripts over HTTPS.&quot;    What do you see instead?    Script executes  allowing network attackers to hijack the extension's  privileges. </pre>
