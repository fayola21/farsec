<title>Issue 33324 -   chromium -    New windows opened within ChromeFrame in full tab mode don't use the host network stack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If a page rendered within ChromeFrame issues a window.open call which results   in a new window being opened  you can see that this window opens as a regular   chrome window and not a window within the host browser.    Importantly network requests issued by this window will go through the Chrome   network stack  which means sessions opened by the main page will not be   reused. </pre>
