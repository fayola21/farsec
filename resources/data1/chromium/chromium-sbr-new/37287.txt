<title>Issue 37287 -   chromium -    Infinite recursion in WebCore::SVGUseElement::expandUseElementsInShadowTree leads to stack exhaustion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Opening the attached SVG file or a page containing it in Chromium on 32-bit  Ubuntu 9.10 causes a renderer segmentation fault in  WebCore::SVGUseElement::expandUseElementsInShadowTree. All tested builds  between 35446 and 40259  being the latest I have here  were affected.    In 64-bit Fedora 12 having the current Google Chrome 5.0.307.11 (Official  Build 39572) beta  the issue manifests as either the tab getting stuck in  loading  a sad tab or a browser crash (double free or memory corruption).  The browser crash occurred only once in 20 loads  so it's pretty rare.    I have no proof that this is exploitable. Reported as security issue to be  on the safe side. </pre>
