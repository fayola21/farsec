<title>Issue 36774 -   chromium -    The 1 second timeout on safebrowsing get hash might be exploitable - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Perhaps there has already been a discussion on this  but I didn't see it.    I noticed that currently we have a 1 second timeout on the safe browsing   checks (kMaxGetHashMs).    This means that if the SafeBrowsing URL check takes longer than 1 second    it is aborted and the URL is considered to be safe.    If one constructs a portal page that slows down the safe browsing's hash   fetches to the point where they take longer than 1 second  this could be   used to load any blacklisted site and reliably bypass the interstitial.    (You could construct such a page by slowing down the network layer. One way   for example  is to exploit the fixed connections-per-host limit and eat up   all the sockets to the safebrowsing service's host).    Anyhow  maybe this isn't considered a big deal since such pages could be   discovered by the safebrowsing service and added to the blacklist too. But   still  I figured I would bring it up since 1 second seems pretty low. </pre>
