<title>Issue 29920 -   chromium -    Referer: header is sent when redirect from https to http - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> (I have a proof of concept  though it's Google-internal visible only  those   urls are provided below)    The basic sequence is:  * Start at an https url (https://www/~japhet/  * Click a link that navigates to an https url (redirect.php)  * The link triggers a redirect to an http url (<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>)    When <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> is reached  document.referrer will not show   a referrer due to <a href="http://crbug.com/7357">http://crbug.com/7357</a>  but the http Referer: header will   have been sent to google.com  even though the referrer is a secure scheme   and the destination isn't.    I've got a fix for this just about ready  so assigning to myself.  I'm marking   this P1 because it seems relatively minor to me  but correct me if I'm   wrong. </pre>
