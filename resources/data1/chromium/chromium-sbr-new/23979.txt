<title>Issue 23979 -   chromium -    Security: add other common HTML extensions to the dangerous extensions list - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We consider some file extensions to be malicious (exe  bat  com  etc)  and  prompt when saving them. As a workaround against file:///-based SOP  violations  we also added HTML to this list at some point.    A security researcher contacted security@google.com today rightfully  pointing out that this mitigation can be bypassed with other extensions   such as mht or mhtml. I also suspect that in addition to htm and html  the  same holds true for hta  htt  xml  and maybe xslt.    We should add these to the list accordingly.     Since this is an external report  and the researcher might still want to  follow up publicly  it would be good to have this patched in a reasonable  timeframe.    [ In the long run  we really need to lock down file:/// SOP for files  downloaded with Chrome and other browsers  too. ] </pre>
