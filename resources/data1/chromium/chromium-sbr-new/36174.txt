<title>Issue 36174 -   chromium -    Referer headers getting sent between HTTPS sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> On Thu  Feb 18  2010 at 8:26 PM  Greg Grothaus &lt;greggrothaus@google.com&gt; wrote:  &gt; This one is more of a minor security issue in fact.  &gt; Johannes had the smart idea of making all of webspam's tools accessible only  &gt; via SSL  aka https URLs.  This change was relatively easy too because the  &gt; GFE can do the SSL connection and talk plaintext to the backend server on  &gt; borg.  The idea was that a link from an HTTPS URL to a HTTP URL would not  &gt; pass referrers.  See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-15.1.3">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-15.1.3</a>  2nd  &gt; paragraph.  Chrome does this correctly to the letter of the RFC.  &gt; However  it seems that in the same spirit  if a request is made from a HTTPS  &gt; URL on domain A to another HTTPS URL on domain B  the referrer should also  &gt; not be sent.  The path of the request to domain A was encrypted  and now you  &gt; are sending that sensitive path to the third party domain B  still  &gt; encrypted  but readable by domain B.  Firefox on Linux strips referrers in  &gt; this case.  Chrome on Linux does not.  I haven't tested with any other  &gt; browsers.  &gt; -Greg </pre>
