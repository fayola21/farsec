<title>Issue 44608 -   chromium -    Local .html pages with frames violate domain-origin policy - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 6.0.411.0 (47717)  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v2.3.5/rdoc.zip">http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v2.3.5/rdoc.zip</a>  OS version               : 10.6.3  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): Works  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: No windows to test on.      1. Download <a href="http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v2.3.5/rdoc.zip">http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v2.3.5/rdoc.zip</a>  unzip.   2. Open rdoc/index.html  3. In the left frame  type &quot;validates_presence_of&quot; in the search bar  4. Click the function result that comes up.      The documentation for that function should load in the right frame.      The documentation does not load  as Chromium claims it violates same-domain origin policy.    From the JS Console:  &quot;Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL   file://localhost/Users/dbalatero/Documents/rdoc/files/README.html from frame with URL   file://localhost/Users/dbalatero/Documents/rdoc/panel/index.html. Domains  protocols and   ports must match.&quot;    It seems like local files should be part of the same domain policy. In this case  domain ==   &quot;localhost&quot;  protocol == &quot;file&quot;  and port == undefined. </pre>
