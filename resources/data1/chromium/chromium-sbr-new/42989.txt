<title>Issue 42989 -   chromium -    Difference in Windows/Mac renderer sandbox behavior - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> In the renderer  set a breakpoint at 'WebCore::DragController::dragOperation'. Step into   containsURL()-&gt;asURL()-&gt;hasValidURL()  and change the return value to false. Step until   file_util::PathExists is called.    On Windows:  GetFileAttributes() fails with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.    On OS X:  stat64() returns 0.    I would expect it to fail uniformly in the sandbox or succeed uniformly. </pre>
