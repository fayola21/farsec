<title>Issue 36772 -   chromium -    Security: HTTP AUTH dialog spoofing using long subdomains (Windows Only) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome: 4.0.249.89  5.0.335.0  Platform: Windows XP  Windows 7 (Exploit does not work on Mac snow leopard  Ubuntu Karmic   for latest versions of Chrome)    Testcase:  Assumptions:  Trusted Site: securethoughts.com  Evil Site: infernohacks.com  Visit <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/redir.php?">http://securethoughts.com/security/redir.php?</a>  loc=takeanyservice.securethoughts.com.certifiedbyverisigncorporation.infernohacks.com/diges  t.php    Description:  In this testcase  i assume the trusted site has a open redirect  lets say in redir.php loc   paramater (there are other ways to do this as well :). I point it to my evil site infernohacks.com    digest.php page which brings up an http digest auth dialog. A normal user who visits this url   will see it beginning with his trusted host name. Then when http digest auth dialog comes up    the real site infernohacks.com name get truncated due to longer subdomains. This normal user   won't suspect anything and will put his/her site credentials which will get sent to my evil site.    Expected:  Like all other browsers  it should show the complete hostname and not truncate any part of it   (should wrap around in next line :)). </pre>
