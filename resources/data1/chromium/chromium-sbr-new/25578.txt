<title>Issue 25578 -   chromium -    No more symbolic links in the .app (en.lproj -&gt; en_US.lproj) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I thought we had filed a bug about this  but I can't find it.    We need to kill the en.lproj -&gt; en_US.lproj symbolic link in our package.    Ideally we'd do something special and output en.lproj instead of   en_US.lproj.    Symbolic links aren't included in the code signature.  Having en.lproj be a   symbolic link makes it possible to replace all theme.pak resources for   English users that haven't selected a more specific locale without altering   the application's fingerprint.  Doing so is as simple as retargeting the   symbolic link to point elsewhere.  This is a security problem to some   extent.    I've removed all other symbolic links from our .app package.  en.lproj is   the only one that remains (although it's present in three places). </pre>
