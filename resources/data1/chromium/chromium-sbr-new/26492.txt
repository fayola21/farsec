<title>Issue 26492 -   chromium -    Add regex escaping code - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The OS X Sandbox configuration files only allow paths to be specified in terms   of regex's.  This means that if we want to programmatically allow access to a   directory we need to escape that directory before inserting it into the sandbox   configuration file.    This is needed amongst other things to enable sandboxing of the utility   process on OS X.    At the time of this writing  the utility process is disabled on OS X - see <a title="sandbox UtilityProcess on Linux"  href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23837">Issue   23837</a>. </pre>
