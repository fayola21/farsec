<title>Issue 30660 -   chromium -    window.open() Method Javascript Same-Origin Policy Violation - Project Hosting on Google Code</title>   1. Invite the victim to the malicious content(please see below PoC) hosted  on the attacker's domain.  2. An iframe named &quot;SOMENAME&quot; in the malicious content loads data from a  third party domain.  3. The malicious content executes the JavaScript code in the window.open  method which targets &quot;SOMENAME&quot;.  4. That JavaScript code in the window.open method is executed in the  context of the third party domain and can grab the victim's cookie and  other data from the third party domain and send these data to the  attacker's domain.   Before sending these data  Chrome sends &quot;OPTIONS&quot; method to confirm that  the attacker's site allows the cross domain request from the third party  site. If the attacker's site sends back the response which includes valid  &quot;Access-Control-Allow-XXX&quot; headers  Chrome makes a request which contains  the third party's content and cookie to the attacker's site.      Permission should be denied by same-origin policy.        The attacker can bypass the same-origin policy to steal the victim's cookie  and other data from a third party domain via Chrome.      <b>Please provide
