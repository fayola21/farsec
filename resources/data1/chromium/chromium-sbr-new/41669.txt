<title>Issue 41669 -   chromium -    Chrome sets a wildcard identity preference which could cause Safari to send certificate to untrusted sites. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 5.0.379.0 (44664)  URLs (if applicable) :  N/A  OS version               : 10.6.3 (10D573)  Behavior in Safari 3.x/4.x (if applicable): OK  Behavior in Firefox 3.x (if applicable): N/A  Behavior in Chrome for Windows: N/A      1. Install a personal certificate  2. Create a wildcard  say <a href="https://web.mit.edu">https://web.mit.edu</a>  3. Goto a website the requires a personal certificate and matches the wildcard  say   <a href="https://web.mit.edu">https://web.mit.edu</a>      Chrome should not set any identity preferences.      Chrome creates wildcard identity preferences  in this example for both *.mit.edu and *.edu.  The   problem with this is Safari will then use those identity preferences  possibly sending the user's   certificate to an untrusted site.  Worse  by having a wildcard identity preference for a top level   domain  Safari will send the identity preference to many external domains  without user   interaction.  This could possible expose personal information such as name and e-mail. </pre>
