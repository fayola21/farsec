<title>Issue 31935 -   chromium -    appcache: https servers shouldn't be able to store no-store pages from other servers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33456">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33456</a>    Description From Alexey Proskuryakov 2010-01-10 18:32:03 PST (-) [reply]  Plug a security hole with appcache: don't allow hostile https: servers to cache  no-store files on other https: servers.
