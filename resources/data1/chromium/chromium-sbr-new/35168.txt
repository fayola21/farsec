<title>Issue 35168 -   chromium -    Crash when clicking long URL with unknown scheme - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> This was initially reported by x41@freeshell.org at   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=1516">http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=1516</a> .  I've attached   the file attached to that bug.    Chrome OS builds of Chrome appear to die after the user clicks a very long   (~90 KB in the case of the report) link with an unknown scheme.  I think   that the problem might be in Views' external protocol dialog -- I'm not   sure if it's running out of memory building a dialog that's long enough to   hold the string  or opening a very-wide window and tripping over a limit in   the X server (the latter problem showed up in tooltips in the GTK version    I think).    The GTK port appears to be fine here; the link gets truncated in the dialog   that's shown.  I haven't tested this on Windows.  Long URLs should probably   be truncated when building the dialog. </pre>
