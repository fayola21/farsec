<title>Issue 26672 -   chromium -    Security Broken in Gmail and Blogger Comment Windows. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi with version 4.0.223.11 and 4.0.223.16  secure pages are broken.  The   secure icon changes from the padlock to the triangle with the exclamation   mark saying &quot;This page contains some insecure content.&quot;.  So far I have   found that this problem happens when I am in the comment window of   &quot;<a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/</a>&quot; and also in gmail.  For gmail I   found that the source of the problem has something to do with the &quot;Google   Talk Plugin&quot; because when I sign into Gmail and and GTalk finally loads    the security of the page breaks.  When I use &quot;disable-plugins&quot; in the   short-cut  Gmail remains secure after Gtalk is fully loaded.  But even when   the plugins are disabled  this comment window's security is still broken.    Why?  Anyway  there should be a feature that would allow the user to choose   what plugins they want to disable  instead of having one choice to either   have all of them enable or none at all.  Anyway  it would be nice if this   security problem would get fixed.   </pre>
