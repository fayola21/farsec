<title>Issue 42356 -   chromium -    User scripts can access chrome:// URLs - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> My change to URLPattern (<a href="/p/chromium/source/detail?r=44167">r44167</a>) introduced a security hole with user   scripts. A user script can inject scripts into chrome:// pages and thus have   access to everything we expose to those pages  including most visited    history  downloads data etc. </pre>
