<title>Issue 38550 -   chromium -    Mac: Don't send client cert before verifying received server cert - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The current Mac SSL code will sometimes send the client cert before verifying the server cert. This is   considered incorrect behavior.    The user still has to choose and confirm a client cert before it's sent  and client certs don't usually   contain sensitive information (i.e. no private key!)  but this can be considered a privacy issue in that   it allows the server to get some information about the viewer's identity under false pretenses.    According to wtc  this also affects Windows. We have no workaround on that platform due to API   limitations  but the Mac SecureTransport API allows us to do things the right way; we just aren't  yet. </pre>
