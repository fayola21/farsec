<title>Issue 33304 -   chromium -    Security: XSS when dragging and dropping a javascript: link onto a tab - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Publicly found at:  <a href="http://nomoreroot.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-chrome-drag-and-drop-fun.html">http://nomoreroot.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-chrome-drag-and-drop-fun.html</a>  (Added the reporter to cc)    When a javascript: link is dragged onto a tab  the javascript gets executed   in the context of the page open in that tab. This could lead to XSS  though   I think it is very unlikely it can be reliably exploited as it requires   unusual user interaction.    While it is a useful feature that javascript: bookmarks execute in the   context of the current tab  I doubt this draging and dropping of   javascript: urls from webpages onto tabs has any use in real life. It may   be wise to remove the feature  but feel free to explain why we should keep   it if you disagree. </pre>
