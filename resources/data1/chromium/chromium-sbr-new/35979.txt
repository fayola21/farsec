<title>Issue 35979 -   chromium -    Security: Opening a malformed XML file causes a segmentation fault in xmlParseGetLasts. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Opening a malformed XML file causes a Chromium renderer process   segmentation fault in xmlParseGetLasts on Ubuntu 9.10 (32-bit)  and tab   getting stuck in loading (closing it will leave Google Chrome running) or   a  browser death by a segmentation fault in Fedora 12 (64-bit).    Tested with the following versions:  32-bit Ubuntu 9.10 with:    Chromium	5.0.330.0 (Developer Build 39077) Ubuntu  64-bit Fedora 12 with:    Google Chrome	5.0.307.7 (Official Build 38400) beta    I will try to find a free time slot to minimize the triggering file.    The attached gdb backtrace is from the Ubuntu 32-bit 5.0.330.0 error.   </pre>
