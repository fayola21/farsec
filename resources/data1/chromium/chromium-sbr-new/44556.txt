<title>Issue 44556 -   chromium -    Security: WebKit: WebCore::RenderInline::destroy ExecAV@Arbitrary (b1c9c3c46df454874e36c9f86b2418fa) - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Repro:  &lt;HTML&gt;    &lt;BODY onload=&quot;setTimeout('document.write();'  1)&quot;&gt;      &lt;a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/BODY&gt;  &lt;/HTML&gt;    It appears the A  I and CENTER tags are required as well as the timeout   before writing to the document. I assume that memory corruption happens   when writing into a document with this specific content because of some   object is freed after rendering the document but still accessed when   writing to it. This is speculation.    Repro's on 4.1 and 6.0  I've attached a repro and details gathered from a   crash.   </pre>
