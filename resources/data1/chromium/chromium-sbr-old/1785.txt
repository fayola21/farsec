<title>Issue 1785 -   chromium -    Show Password - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi. I know that this isn't a bug but i believe that  if you guys wants to   keep the &quot;show password&quot; stuff (i dislike this option but i'm sure you have   a reason for that) perhaps you should consider setting a master password or   something.     Keep up the good job!    </pre>
