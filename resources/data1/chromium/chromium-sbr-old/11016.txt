<title>Issue 11016 -   chromium -    Can't tell what URL was downloaded - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I download a file (like an EXE)  I have no idea where it came from.    For example  visit:    <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-">https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-</a>  3.0.9&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US    Did you just download Firefox over HTTPS?  It's anyone's guess. </pre>
