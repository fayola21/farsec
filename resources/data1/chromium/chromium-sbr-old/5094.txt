<title>Issue 5094 -   chromium -    Memory corruption in Adobe Acrobat EMBED object - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Fast loading/unloading of Adobe Acrobat object through EMBED tags can cause   memory corruption in FireFox. It seems all browsers run into problems at   some point  though I've not seen crashes in other browsers.    <a href="http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/COM/Object">http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/COM/Object</a>   instantiation/EMBED%20type%20manual.html?application/pdf    I'd like to find out how this affects Chrome before I inform other venders. </pre>
