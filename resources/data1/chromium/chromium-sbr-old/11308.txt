<title>Issue 11308 -   chromium -    ReadAV [ARBITRARY]@chrome!NPAPI::PluginInstance::NPP_DestroyStream+0x111 - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've found what seems to be a memory corruption vulnerability in Chrome.   Unfortunately  I cannot repro the issue on my machine. I've attached all   the information my FuzzFramework as able to collect. It seems to have been   able to reproduce the <a title="This is a test" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3"> issue 3 </a>/10 times it tried. I think this may be a race   condition in creating/deleting NPAPI plugins or something. Maybe the object   is destroyed before it is fully initialized  or whatever.    You can try to repro this using repro_server.py  which is a small HTTP   server that can serve &quot;repro&quot; files created by my framework. In this case   the &quot;repro&quot; file for the problem id &quot;Problem #1 Repro.http-  bodies.log_entries.gozer3.pickle&quot;. My FuzzFramework runs with &quot;page heap&quot;   enabled so that may be a requirement to detect the issue. It was found on   XPSP3 with a Chromium v2 built about a week old.    The file &quot;Problem #1 Details.cdb output.gozer3.txt&quot; contains all relevant   output from cdb.exe that FuzzFramework extracted from one of the crashes -   it may be useful in tracking down the cause of the issue.    I'm sorry I cannot provide more info  I hope we can track down the root   cause as this seems to be exploitable.       </pre>
