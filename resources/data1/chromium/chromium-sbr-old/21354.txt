<title>Issue 21354 -   chromium -    ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-Ext are not supported leading to a potential XSS attack - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Spun off issue 15701.     ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-Ext can have a similar issue to that presented  by the lack of conversion support in Chrome.     Unlike ISO-2022-KR  we have to add multiple tables to support them  which  can increase the Chrome download size. However  it's at most 1MB  (uncompressed) and we may want to bite a bullet and add them although those  encodings are not used in the web at all.             </pre>
