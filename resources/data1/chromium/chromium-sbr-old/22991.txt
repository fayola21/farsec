<title>Issue 22991 -   chromium -    Chrome Frame bypasses IE mixed content setting - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>   1. Disable mixed content in IE using Tools &gt; Internet options &gt; Security &gt;   Custom level &gt; Display mixed content  2. Go to a Chrome Frame site with mixed content  e.g.   <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/test/chromeframe/mixed.html">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/test/chromeframe/mixed.html</a>    What is the expected output?    Script does not run. No alert appears.    What do you see instead?    Script runs  showing an alert &quot;mixed content ran&quot;. There is a warning in   developer console explaining that the script was insecurely loaded. </pre>
