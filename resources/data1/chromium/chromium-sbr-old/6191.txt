<title>Issue 6191 -   chromium -    Security: Download .EXE UI messed up. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : 1.0.154.36    I downloaded an exe and the UI got messed up. I have attached a screen grab   that shows the screen area reserved for the download information is too   small  causing the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; buttons to be partially invisible. I can   see part of the &quot;Yes&quot; button. If an attacker could force this behavior  a   user is unable to press &quot;No&quot; and inexperienced users are much more likely   to press the part of the &quot;Yes&quot; button that is visible  without knowing what   it does.    I do not know what caused this - maybe because I was opening other tabs or   applications during the animation? I only noticed after I came back to the   page after a half a minute  when i wanted to open my download.       </pre>
