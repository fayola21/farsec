<title>Issue 4150 -   chromium -    Security: SwissSign Root marked for EV - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> SwissSign is in the process of adding EV Certificate in his offering. Right  now we are in the Root Stores of Microsoft  Mozilla and Opera.     We would like to have the &quot;SwissSign Gold CA - G2&quot; added as EV Root  Certificate. This Root Certificate can be identified with:      Subject    /CN=SwissSign Gold CA - G2/O=SwissSign AG/C=CH      SHA1 Hash    d8 c5 38 8a b7 30 1b 1b 6e d4 7a e6 45 25 3a 6f 9f 1a 27 61      Key Size    4096      Validity (Effective) Date    Wednesday  25. Oktober 2006 10:30:35      Expiration Date    Saturday  25. Oktober 2036 10:30:35    We will create a new intermediate Issuing CA for the sole purpose of  issuing EV certificates  but I believe we do not need to add this Issuing  CA to the root store. All our EV certificates will be issued with the  following &quot;constant&quot; OID in the Certificate Policy extension:    Policy Identifier: 2.16.756.1.89.1.2.3    Attached also:  - the report of the EV Audit  - the new CP/CPS in normal and diff mode with the actual one    Regards  Freddy Kaiser  CTO SwissSign having already an gmail account  Direct mail: freddy.kaiser@swisssign.com </pre>
