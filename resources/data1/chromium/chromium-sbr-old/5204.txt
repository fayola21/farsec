<title>Issue 5204 -   chromium -    Save file as misses mark of the web - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> From a comment on our blog:     devaka said...  2Ian Fette: Now in Google Chrome  when you save html page by clicking right   mouse button and &quot;save file as..&quot;  it saves html without &quot;mark of the web&quot;    I've just checked it out with links on this page. But it works well when   you save it from main menu or &quot;ctrl+s&quot;.     </pre>
