<title>Issue 15799 -   chromium -    SSL errors on Google chrome  suspect file system access expires - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> If you leave your computer for some time &gt; 1 day  and come back to it   sessions to some SSL sites (only seen on <a href="https://mail.google.com/*">https://mail.google.com/*</a> so far)  will not refresh  but gives the big red SSL Error screen.  Unfortunately I  cant work out how to view the certificate store to see whats going on.    I'm going to make a bold guess and say that if you use access to a file  system that expires after a certain time  this bug is triggered.  Perhaps  an SSL store is stored on disk  and after a Kerberos ticket expires  but  for sites that continually refresh  such as Gmail  they don't like having  the ssl cache taken away from them.
