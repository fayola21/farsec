<title>Issue 2632 -   chromium -    Advisory: Google Chrome Carriage Return Null Object Memory Exhaustion Remote Dos - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Explanation:  ============  The Google chrome browser is vulnerable to memory exhaustion based denial  of service which can be triggered remotely. The vulnerability triggers when  Carriage Return(rnrn) is passed as an argument to window.open()  function. It makes the Google Chrome to generate number of windows at the  same time thereby leading to memory exhaustion. The behavior can be easily  checked by looking at the task manager as with no time the memory usage  rises high.    It has been noticed that understated script do the trick making Google  chrome to consider the required argument as object. Once it is triggered  the pop ups are started generating. The Google Chrome browser generate  object windows continuously there by affecting memory of the resultant system.    User interaction is required to visit the malicious page.    The Proof of Concept script is:    window.open(&quot;rnrn&quot;);  window.refresh();  window.open(&quot;rnrn&quot;);    Version affected:  ==================  Two under stated versions have been released by Google. Both are affected:    Official Build 1798  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)  AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML  like Gecko)  Chrome/0.2.149.29 Safari/525.13    Official Build 2200  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)  AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML  like Gecko)  Chrome/0.2.149.30 Safari/525.13    Proof of Concept:  =================  Please find the proof of concept here:    <a href="http://www.secniche.org/gds">http://www.secniche.org/gds</a> </pre>
