<title>Issue 20450 -   chromium -    Chromium shouldn't allow XHR to local directories - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Not entirely sure this is a bug  but is a difference from other browsers  and causes a LayoutTest to fail.  Looking for input so I   can resolve the LayoutTest properly.    Navigating to a file url for a directory (like file:///C:/foo)  gives the following results:  IE: Opens a native windows file browsing window for that directory  FF: Nicely formatted directory listing page  Safari: Page with a &quot;You don't have permission to open this page&quot; message.  Chrome: Nicely formatted directory listing page     Doing an xhr to the same url (xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;  &quot;foo&quot;  true)) from a local file url gives the following results:  IE: Throws exception: Exception: Access is denied.  FF: Throws exception: Exception: Access to restricted URI denied  Safari: Fires onError  responseText &quot;&quot;  Chrome: Success  with responseText the same as the lovely page served when accessed directly.    So  I guess I'm asking  is the Chrome behavior by design?  If so  I'll just rebaseline.  If not  I can file more appropriate bug. </pre>
