<title>Issue 2618 -   chromium -    Web Inspector should not rely on the untrusted page to implement escapeHTML - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The Web Inspector relies on the untrusted page to implement escapeHTML.    This is problematic because the untrusted page might not actually sanitize   HTML.    Proof of concept:    <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~abarth/research/chromium/inspectored/">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~abarth/research/chromium/inspectored/</a>    This vulnerability seems harder to exploit in TOT WebKit with SquirrelFish   Extreme due to some odd semantics around __defineGetter__.    This will get fixed in the Great Inspector Rearchitecting  so it's not   clear whether we should try to fix this issue as a one-off. </pre>
