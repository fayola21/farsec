<title>Issue 1210 -   chromium -    Don't trigger buttons on second click of a double-click - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Buttons should not trigger on the second click of a double-click  if the   first click was not on them.  This helps avoid problems where the first   click on something changes the UI and places a different button under the   mouse for the second click. </pre>
