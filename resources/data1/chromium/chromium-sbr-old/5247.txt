<title>Issue 5247 -   chromium -    Cross-frame-access-*-explicit-domain layout tests failing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Two tests in LayoutTests/http/tests/security/  as well as their pending   versions (in pending/http/tests/security)  are failing with the error    Fail: Cross frame access to frame explicitly setting document.domain was   allowed.    cross-frame-access-child-explicit-domain.html  cross-frame-access-parent-explicit-domain.html    These used to pass (in their pending/ versions  forked to take care of a   race condition that has since been fixed in the main line too)  although   it's been a while. </pre>
