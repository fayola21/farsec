<title>Issue 21467 -   chromium -    Cross site scripting through non-http servers - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Importing from: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19664">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19664</a>    Description From Sandro Gauci 2008-06-18 18:24:41 PDT (-) [reply]  When web browsers render content from non-HTTP servers which display user  supplied data  they can create the flaw described in the referenced document.     My suggested solution is to make sure that the response is coming from an HTTP  server. This can be done by validating the HTTP response msg / headers.    Blocking ports helps mitigate but is not enough to prevent this behavior across  all scenarios.    <a href="http://resources.enablesecurity.com/resources/the%20extended%20html%20form%20attack%20revisited.pdf">http://resources.enablesecurity.com/resources/the%20extended%20html%20form%20attack%20revisited.pdf</a> </pre>
