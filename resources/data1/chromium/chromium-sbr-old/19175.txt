<title>Issue 19175 -   chromium -    Security: maybe restrict XHTML payloads with certain +xml MIME types - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [Moved from internal bug 1004726]    We now permit content types such as application/rss+xml   application/atom+xml  or image/svg+xml  to in fact contain *any* top-level  xmlns=  and any collection of nested xmlns= values.    This increases the risk of cross-site scripting  as web application  developers are not necessarily aware that in absence of proper escaping   XHTML and JavaScript could be executed via xmlns=&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</a>.    (Other browsers prevent XHTML in rss+xml and atom+xml by the virtue of  having a dedicated feed viewer)    We should perhaps consider enforcing top-level xmlns  and restricting  lower-level xmlns  on common */*+xml MIME types. We can still permit  arbitrary mixing on text/xml  application/xhtml+xml to prevent breaking  something useful.    /mz </pre>
