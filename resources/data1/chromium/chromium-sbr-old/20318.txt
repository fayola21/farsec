<title>Issue 20318 -   chromium -    Security: do not auto-complete URLs with cloaked credentials - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Noticed this behavior while working on an unrelated audit:    1) Follow a valid auth-bearing URL such as  ftp://anonymous:some_string@ftp.icm.edu.pl/    2) See the credentials cloaked in the URL bar  and the URL loaded as  <a href="ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/">ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/</a>    3) Close the browser.    4) Type 'ftp'  wait for Chrome to auto-complete the URL  (<a href="ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/">ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/</a>)  click return.    5) Watch 'some_string' credentials being sent over the wire.    This is a bit counterintuitive  and could possibly be used to 'tag' users  by polluting auto-completion history this way  and then having all attempts  to navigate to a particular site silently tagged with a cached value.    A suggested fix would be to not auto-complete inline-auth-bearing URLs; a  more convoluted one would be to rank them lower  and annotate them on the  auto-complete list somehow.    /mz </pre>
