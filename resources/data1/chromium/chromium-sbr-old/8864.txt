<title>Issue 8864 -   chromium -    Security: CANVAS implmentation crashes - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> [See internal bug 1157004 for some context]    Although some fixes were made earlier  Chrome 2 still seems to be crashing  with my &lt;CANVAS&gt; fuzzer  <a href="http://lcamtuf.cordump.cx/canvas/">http://lcamtuf.cordump.cx/canvas/</a>.     I did not investigate in more detail  but we should probably make sure it  passes the tests smoothly before releasing.   </pre>
