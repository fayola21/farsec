<title>Issue 18803 -   chromium -    Avast can't scan all files of chrome's cache: password protected - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre>       The attached file is one of the cache files of chrome that cannot be   scanned by avast antivirus. It reports that the file is protected with a   password.     I think that chrome should NOT keep files that are protected by a password   in it's cache.    I don't know anything about the file attached  because I don't know how to   open it. I only know it was in the cache folder of chrome.     EDIT: I wasn't able to attach the file  I continuesly got the 400 bad   request error! </pre>
