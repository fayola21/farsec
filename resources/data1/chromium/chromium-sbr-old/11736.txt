<title>Issue 11736 -   chromium -    Remove use of insecure string functions from tcmalloc - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> The insecure sprintf and strcat functions are used in tcmalloc code. Even   though their use does not seem to cause any risk of exploitable bugs  this   change is needed as a mitigation because no dev should think that it is ok   to use these functions under any circumstances; there is no reason to run   the risk they bring when there are perfectly acceptable alternatives.    Affected code:  /third_party/tcmalloc/tcmalloc/src/malloc_extension.cc   =&gt; MallocExtension::GetHeapSample uses sprintf  /third_party/tcmalloc/tcmalloc/src/base/logging.h   =&gt; LogPrintf uses strcat     </pre>
