<title>Issue 21338 -   chromium -    Same Origin Policy Bypass via getSVGDocument() method. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome Version       : Google Chrome	2.0.172.43 (Official Build )  WebKit	530.5  V8	1.1.10.15  User Agent	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)   AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML  like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.43 Safari/530.5  URLs (if applicable) : <a href="http://sh0dan.org/svg-test/svg-sopb.html">http://sh0dan.org/svg-test/svg-sopb.html</a>  Other browsers tested:    Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:       Safari 4:    Firefox 3.x: OK           IE 7:           IE 8:    What steps will reproduce the problem?  1. Load an SVG image in an object tag from a third party site. Set data as   the uri of the svg file  type as &quot;image/svg+xml&quot;  2. Get a reference to the object and call the getSVGDocument() method.  3. This creates a reference to the objects contentDocument.   4. From here it is possible to read/set properties of the contentDocument   of the third party  including cookies.    What is the expected result?  Permission should be denied by same origin policy.    What happens instead?  Ability to read/write cookie data  and view other data from a third party   sites contentDocument.     Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if  possible.
