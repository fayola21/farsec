<title>Issue 18725 -   chromium -    Security: Treat certificate signatures using weak signature algorithms as invalid - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Before we get the Windows update that changes CryptoAPI to disallow  the use of MD2 and MD4 in certificate signatures  we can add code to  treat those certificate signatures as invalid.    Sites with an MD2 or MD4 signature (specifically  md2WithRSAEncryption  or md4WithRSAEncryption) in the end-entity certificate or an intermediate  CA certificate in the certificate chain will get the &quot;invalid certificate&quot;  SSL interstitial page  which has only the &quot;Back&quot; button.    Note: the signatures in root CA certificates are irrelevant.  md2WithRSAEncryption and md4WithRSAEncryption are the only MD2/MD4  signature algorithms listed in CryptoAPI's header file &lt;wincrypt.h&gt;. </pre>
