<title>Issue 21337 -   chromium -    History (back button) hijacking. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Applicable URL: <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/why/upgrade-advantage.jsp">http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/why/upgrade-advantage.jsp</a>   (Click &quot;Upgrade your plan!&quot; link.)  The next page will not allow you to back out of it by just clicking the back   button  you instead have to right-click the back button and go a few entries   before.    This can be really annoying  especially when a site spams your back history   so the previous URL is out of the menu.    I can't tell exactly what method AT&amp;T is using here. But I suggest there be   an option to disallow meta redirects and location.href settings that would   redirect the browser on a page that is loaded via the user pressing the back   button. </pre>
