<title>Issue 5787 -   chromium -    Chrome allows to drag javascript: URLs into bookmarks bar - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Chrome allows to drag &quot;javascript:&quot; URLs into the bookmarks bar  just like   normal &quot;http:&quot; URLs. This way users can get tricked into executing   arbitrary JavaScript on whatever domain is currently loaded in the active   tab when clicking on the bookmarked link.    A simple example on how to leverage that fact is to sniff the content of   &quot;chrome-resource://new-tab&quot; ��_��_��_ which usually would show the personal   homepage. Given the history function of that page you could scan frequently   used pages of that user (and potentially sniff URL parameters like sessions   or password).    Example (drag to bookmarks bar  click on homepage):  &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:alert(document.body.innerHTML)&quot;&gt;drag&lt;/a&gt;    A more complex example would be a script that really forwards to a   destination  dragging a linked logo of news site or such into the bookmarks   bar will be a frequently used feature for dragging bookmarks.    &lt;a   href=&quot;javascript:if(false){}else{document.location='http://news.google.com'  }&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;    The if statement could for example sniff for a certain domain and than   interact with the website (e.g. to steal session or modify data). The   example below interacts with the DOM of blogger.com when you are on your   homepage ��_��_��_ in all other cases it forwards to new.google.com:    &lt;a   href=&quot;javascript:if(document.location=='<a href="http://www.blogger.com/home'){alert">http://www.blogger.com/home'){alert</a>  (document.body.innerHTML)}else{document.location='http://news.google.com'  &gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;    A user might never realize that every click on the bookmark carries the   risk of running malicious code on the open website.    Mitigating factors:    1. The risk of getting such a bookmark(let) installed is relatively low    although social engineering tricks might work well on such a simple task   like dragging a link.    2. The tooltip of the bookmark shows that it is a JavaScript URL. Not that   anybody who would fall for this trick would really understand what that   means.    Internet Explorer 7 does not allows dragging of JavaScript URLs  it even   generates a warning message when you try to add a javascrip: URL via a   context menu.     Both seem to be a reasonable counter measure to avoid people hijack   bookmarks.      </pre>
