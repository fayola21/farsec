<title>Issue 6274 -   chromium -    Security feature request: consider incorporating DOM checker into regression suite or other release testing - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> We should investigate integrating DOM Checker with other release testing to  make sure we do not ship a build that fails these checks:    <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/dom_checker/">http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/dom_checker/</a>    Background: the tool helped to identify some same-origin policy issues in  pre-release versions of Chrome  and I just noticed that recent 1.0 releases  started to fail some tests that it would pass before (<a title="Security bug: something very wrong with same-origin checks" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6264"> issue 6264 </a>). We  should avoid shipping any builds that fail any new DOM Checker tests.    One caveat: to verify the outcome of certain operations  the tool uses an  &lt;iframe&gt; URL hash based  cross-domain communication channel that worked  perfectly with earlier versions  and works in Firefox and MSIE - but fails  after several hundred tests in current 1.0 releases. This seems like a  glitch on Chrome end  however  so is probably worth investigating  rather  than working around.    [You probably want to keep this request marked as private until <a title="Security bug: something very wrong with same-origin checks" class=closed_ref href="/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6264"> issue 6264 </a>  is resolved.] </pre>
