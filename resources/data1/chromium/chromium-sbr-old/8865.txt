<title>Issue 8865 -   chromium -    Old chrome.dll left behind after upgrade  recognized by Secunia PSI as a potential security threat - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> After upgrading to 1.0.154.48  chrome.dll for version 1.0.154.46 is still   left behind in user-specific data directory.  In my case on Win XP it's:    C:Documents and SettingsGaren.I530Q6600Local SettingsApplication   DataGoogleChromeApplication1.0.154.46    I'm guessing this is by design  however  Secunia PSI recognizes chrome.dll   from that version as a security threat (screenshot attached) and recommends   upgrading to the latest version. Of course  I am running the latest   version  it just doesn't know that.    Found references to other users running into this:  <a href="http://secunia.com/community/forum/thread/show/1328/after_autopatch_to_chro">http://secunia.com/community/forum/thread/show/1328/after_autopatch_to_chro</a>  me_1_0_154_48_chrome_still_insecure    Suggest cleaning up old data after a successful upgrade  or providing some   easy way to remove old stale data. </pre>
