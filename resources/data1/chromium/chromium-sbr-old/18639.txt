<title>Issue 18639 -   chromium -    Crash [@ 0xffffffff] - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Open bang.html in Windows XP SP3 Google Chrome 3.0.195.4  which then  crashes (See screenshot). Chromium Mac build 3.0.198.0 crashes too.    On the Mac v8 js shell it crashes both opt and debug at 0xffffffff. Wanted  to file this in the v8 bug reports but it has no option to file as a  security bug  so filing here instead  just-in-case this is exploitable.    (Please attribute and acknowledge discovery of testcase to reporter)   </pre>
