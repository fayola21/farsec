<title>Issue 8903 -   chromium -    Sharing Login details in different TAB - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> Hi     Say if I logged in to one tab for any google account   then if I open  a   new tab  then it inherits the login details from the previous TAB. But as   per the early annoucement  the TABs doesnt share any details and they ran   in their own process.       </pre>
