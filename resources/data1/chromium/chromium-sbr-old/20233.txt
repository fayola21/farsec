<title>Issue 20233 -   chromium -    Crash potentially due to resource exhaustion - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> MustLive sent a report on security@google.com which is included later.     A simplified PoC by Michal is:  perl -e '{print  &quot;&lt;script&gt;location.hash='''&quot; &quot;A&quot;x20000000 &quot;''';&lt;/script&gt;&quot;}' &gt;testme.html  ...and it does not seem to be doing much  other than bogging down the  UI by the virtue of dumping 20 megs into the URL bar.    However  it did crash my Dev channel Chrome when using this PoC and   accessing other tabs during the load.  <a href="http://www.corp.google.com/~sumitg/no_crawl/chrome/mustlive-">http://www.corp.google.com/~sumitg/no_crawl/chrome/mustlive-</a>  locationdos.html      MustLive report:    &quot;I want to warn you about Denial of Service vulnerability in Google Chrome.     At the end of December DoS vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 was found   by Jeremy Brown (<a href="http://websecurity.com.ua/2755/">http://websecurity.com.ua/2755/</a>). After I checked at   23.12.2008 this vulnerability in different browsers  I found that this   Denial of Service vulnerability also exists in Chrome 1.0.154.48.     DoS:     Original exploit (<a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554">http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554</a>).     Use Google's cache because milw0rm.com is not working now   (http://209.85.129.132/search?  q=cache:aE09aeFDddMJ:www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554+<a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/e">http://www.milw0rm.com/e</a>  xploits/7554&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=clnk).     With html file generated by this exploit in all affected browsers there is   consuming of CPU resources (and some consuming of RAM resources  besides in   those browsers  where there is no freeze  after closing of tab with exploit   the memory is not released  so large amount of memory stays in use until   closing of the browser). In Chrome 1.0.154.48 and previous versions the   exploit leads to CPU Overload. But if to open empty tab and to close tab   with the exploit  then on empty tab the browser can take 100% of CPU and   freezes.     Vulnerable version is Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and previous versions (and   potentially next versions).     Attend to security of all of yours web sites  web software  browsers and to   security-audit.     I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site   (<a href="http://websecurity.com.ua/3424/).">http://websecurity.com.ua/3424/).</a>&quot; </pre>
