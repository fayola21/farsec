<title>Issue 5468 -   chromium -    File Security - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When I enter a site where is a pdf file on the main page  it just opens and   doesnt ask for me whether to open it? I tried it on Firefox and IE and they   both asked me if I want to open it... Just think about this  that pdf file   could be a virus...???    There are also lots of other security bugs. I'm waiting for Chrome 1.1 :) </pre>
