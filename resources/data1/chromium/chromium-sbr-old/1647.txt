<title>Issue 1647 -   chromium -    Suggestions attempted for SSL sites - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> When accessing a https site if the URL in the address bar is edited  slightly then the URL is sent to the suggestion service on clients1.google.com.    I don't think suggestions should be attempted for SSL sites as this could  potentially send semi-sensitive URL data from a HTTPS site over plain HTTP. </pre>
