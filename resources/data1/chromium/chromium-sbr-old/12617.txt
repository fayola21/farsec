<title>Issue 12617 -   chromium -    Starting a hiden download can allow attacker to determine how long the browser stays open. - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> I've found a minor information leak that allows an attacker to determine   how long a user leaves Chrome running after visiting a malicious page:  1) A user visits a malicious site.  2) The page opens a URL in a popup  which is hidden by our popup blocker.  3) The URL opened in the popup starts a download in the popup. The download   animation is shown in the hidden popup.  4) The page closes the popup.  The user is now downloading a file without him/her knowing about this. The   only way a user can make sure this didn't happen is by checking the   &quot;Downloads&quot; page every now and then.)    The attacker could slow the download to a crawl to make sure it doesn't   fill the disk or terminate while the user continues to browse the internet.   The attacker now knows that the user is still using Chrome even if s/he   leaves the malicious site.    When Chrome closes  the connection is terminated and the attacker knows the   user has closed Chrome.    I think the leaked information is not that valuable so I'm filing this as   low priority.    Suggested fix: we need a better way to indicate that the user is   downloading a file: something that cannot be spoofed or hidden. </pre>
