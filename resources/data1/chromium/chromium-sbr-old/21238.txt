<title>Issue 21238 -   chromium -    security: Content-Type: application/rss+xml being rendered as active content - Project Hosting on Google Code</title> <pre> security@ received the following report that seems to be a duplicate of  b/1004726. It was also tested in 4.0.206.1 and 2.x:    Hi Google Security Team     Version Tested: Google Chrome v3.0.195.10    Vulnerability: Google Chrome's inbuilt RSS/ATOM Reader renders untrusted  javascript content in an RSS/ATOM feed.    Exploit Scenarios:    1.       Attacker can social engineer a user to visit a rss/atom feed  link.  Malicious javascript gets executed in the user's browser. It is not  expected  of feeds to execute untrusted content.    2.       Attacker can upload a .rss/.atom/file with .rss(or .atom) in  name(with arbitrary extension) on a trusted site. The trusted site might  allow the upload thinking that it is not one of the executable file  formats  (like .html .php .asp) and hence won't get rendered in the browser[Chrome  does not execute untrusted file types  e.g. try clicking  <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/anyfile.tx">http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/anyfile.tx</a>]. On the  contrary   if a user clicks on this link while being authenticated to this trusted  site  the malicious javascript does get executed in the context of trusted  site and user's credentials can get stolen.    Proof of Concept:    <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.atom">http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.atom</a>    <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.rss">http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.rss</a>    <a href="http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.atom.tx">http://securethoughts.com/security/rssatomxss/googlechromexss.atom.tx</a> [Any  arbitary file extension]    Suggested Fix: Don't render any javascript content of an RSS feed.    Opera 10 is vulnerable to the same issue. Microsoft IE7  IE8  Firefox 3.5  and Safari 4 are not vulnerable to this exploit.    I am planning to disclose this vulnerability on my blog in another 15 days  (September 23) and hope you can fix it by then.  I believe in responsible  disclosure and want to protect your users from potentially getting  exploited. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
