Externalize the manager service name and point the Help link to a valid URL    The master role assignment page (Step 5 of install) and the cluster topology summary page are referencing the manager service name as 'HMC Server'. This needs to be changed to 'Ambari' server.The post-install success message on a single-node install has the same issue.Currently  the Help link in the top nav launches a new tab and loads the page that the user is on. Instead  load the Help page on Ambari project website (for now  we'll point it to the Install Guide as a placeholder).
