Task timeout should be a configurable knob at the ambari-server    Task timeout is a configurable knob at the ambari-agent.timeout_seconds = 600This opens up the possibility of different timeout value at different agent instances as well as different value between the server and the agent. This can lead to state where server may have timed out the tasks but agent may not have. The other way is benign.This config can be moved to the server and server can hand it off to the agent when agent registers. This also makes it easier to manage the timeout value.
