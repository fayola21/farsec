WebHCat and Oozie services does not start on RHEL5 with enabled security because of 'CRITICAL: Error doing kinit for nagios'    FE only has support to provide single path for kinit. As Ambari supports mixed OS deployment it cannot be guaranteed that kinit exists at the same path on all nodes. FE should allow providing a set of look-up paths for kinit as well as the BE should support a set of default lookup paths.
