LiveStatus of the component is not updated when username is changed    Steps to reproduce: On installer wizard  make install phase fail by killing any install task of master component. Go back and change hdfs username to hdfs1. Proceed ahead and installer wizard completes successfully. HDFS service is red. Nagios shows no alerts  but API returns INSTALLED status for all hdfs host components. UI impact: On starting HDFS  all tasks completes successfully with 100% green progress bar but service status always remains red. Restarting agent resolves the issue.Looks like AmbariConfig.servicesToPidNames is not getting updated when username is changed.
