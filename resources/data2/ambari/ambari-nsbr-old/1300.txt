Service status / host component status can get stuck in the green blinking state if stop fails - no further operation can be performed    This happens when a service/host component is running  but stop fails. This leaves the desired_state in the INSTALLED (i.e.  STOPPED) state  while the live state is STARTED.Currently  UI assumes when desired_state==INSTALLED and state==STARTED  it is STARTING. This was a trick to get around the problem of backend live state update lagging and to make UI more responsive.
