HBase Read/Write request metrics seem to have changed for 2.x stack    See the screenshot for HBase Cumulative Requests graph.The graph does not seem like it's displaying cumulative read/write requests  but rather showing the rate... so the label no longer makes sense.This is on the 2.0.5 stack. On the 1.x  I believe this graph would show cumulative read/write requests (which were less useful).So for 2.x stack  we should probably change the label for this graph to say Reads/Writes per Second (or whatever we are showing - need to confirm).
