Optimize query call for retrieving host information    Every 15 seconds  Ambari Web makes a call to retrieve information about all hosts in the cluster. With 400+ nodes  this call retrieves about 10MB of info  since the API returns last_agent_env  which is host check results used during bootstrap and makes the payload huge.By optimizing the query string for this API call  we can cut down on the payload by more than 90%.
