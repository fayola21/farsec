Oozie start fails - likely due to 'failed install'    Oozie start failed with following in the log: hadoop dfs -chmod -R 755 /user/oozie/share' returned 1 instead of one of 0On the node: chmod: '/user/oozie/share': No such file or directoryoozie@c6402 ~$ hadoop dfs -ls /user/ DEPRECATED: Use of this script to execute hdfs command is deprecated.Instead use the hdfs command for it.Found 3 itemsdrwxrwx--- - ambari-qa hdfs 0 2013-08-02 02:40 /user/ambari-qadrwx------ - hive hdfs 0 2013-08-02 02:41 /user/hivedrwxrwxr-x - hdfs hdfs 0 2013-08-02 02:42 /user/oozieoozie@c6402 ~$ hadoop dfs -ls /user/oozieDEPRECATED: Use of this script to execute hdfs command is deprecated.Instead use the hdfs command for it.oozie@c6402 ~$The reason  the oozie smoke is failing to run an oozie job with more than one node in the cluster  due to bad settings in /etc/hadoop/core-site.xml:&lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hadoop.proxyuser.oozie.hosts&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;host1&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;host1  in my case is host on which oozie is not installed. After changing this to host2 (where oozie server is installed)  oozie smoke succeeded.
