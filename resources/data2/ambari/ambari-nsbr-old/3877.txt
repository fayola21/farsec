Duplicate config-group action not duplicate configs    Override like 3 configs in a config group and save. Now go to the Manage Config Groups dialog and select this group and click on Duplicate action. A popup with name and description pops up and hitting OK creates the duplicated config group.Though this duplicated config group has the correct name/description  it does not have the duplicated configs (3 that we overrode). When doing the POST call  we should populate the desired_configs to be the exact same as the source config-group.
