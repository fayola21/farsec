HBase 0.95.2 - Logger doesn't work    Installing 0.95.2 from internal repo 2.0.5. hbase-daemon.sh defines a default logger of INFO RFA{{  when log4j.properties uses {{INFO DRFA. They should match  as startup generates an error and does not continue.We should stop over writing the log4j properties for hbase. This will allow for hbase log4j properties to be in sync with those that come with the rpms.
