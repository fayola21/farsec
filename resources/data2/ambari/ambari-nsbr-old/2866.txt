API JMX mapping needs to be updated due to property name changes    In Ambari UI  we show properties like NameNode RPC Time.We used to get this metric by querying the NameNode component for 'RpcQueueTime_avg_time'.However  in Hadoop 2  it looks like this property name changed to 'RpcQueueTimeAvgTime'  so the Ambari API no longer contains these metrics. Other properties related to NameNode RPC may have changed. We need to update the mapping accordingly.
