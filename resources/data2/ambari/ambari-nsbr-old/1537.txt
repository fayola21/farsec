Constrain the width of all wizard popups    Currently  the popup for any wizard resizes to fill up the width of the browser width with some horizontal margin. Vertically  it resizes to fit the height of the content; in some cases  it looks really silly on a wide screen.We should specify the max width of the wizard popup. Ambari Web supports two width configurations (wide and narrow)  so the wizard popup should look good in these two configurations.
