Do not store disks_info in DB. Store it as dynamic info in memory that can be used to show on the UI.    Currently  we store disks info in DB and this information is never updated after registration. As disks details can change (space availability changes  disks get mounted/unmounted  etc.) the persisted information is not useful.We should instead hold the details in memory and refresh it at certain intervals (e.g. once every 10 minutes) and then alert if space availability hits some lower limit.
