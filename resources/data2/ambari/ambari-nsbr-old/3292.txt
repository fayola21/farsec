Security wizard: On NameNode HA mode  General category should have spnego principal and keytab field    Earlier dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.keytab field was being used for NameNode and SNameNode component. So we planned to pull this key to NameNode category when HA is enabled as it's the only component then using the key.After HDFS-5091 fix  journalNode also uses this key.So instead of pulling this config key in NameNode section  it should be kept in General category and the description of this principal and keytab location field should be changed accordingly.
