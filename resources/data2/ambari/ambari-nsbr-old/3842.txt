Host configs page should properly order services    When App.supports.hostOverridesHost is enabled  and you visit the configs page for a host  the services are in some random order. They should be in the same order as the services page.Also  there is a small empty entry in the menu  which gives like a 5px extra space between some services. You can even hover on this empty entry and it will highlight.
