Ensure version values are used appropriately throughout Ambari    The current version of Ambari build is being used in several scenarios: Ensure Ambari Server installs the correct version of Ambari Agent Ensure that Ambari Server only accepts registration from correct version of Ambari Agent Ensure that DB version is compatible with Ambari Server  The DB version itself will be used to control DB upgrades  Towards this end the following open issues remain: Get the build version be automatically embedded in the version file Use the above for deploying agent as well as allowing agents to register Regarding DB version there are two possible paths:  Separate out DB version and have it be modified manually as needed Have the build version be used as DB version - this may make writing upgrade scripts little complicated as build version may change due to some proj mgmt decision
