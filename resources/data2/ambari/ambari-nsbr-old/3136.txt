Reduce the size of ExecutionCommand entity    Currently  each ExecutionCommandEntity stores the whole config blob. This is a severe duplication of data as tagged configuration information is already available as immutable entry.We need to reduce the footprint of ExecutionCommandEntity by storing only configuration tags. The tags can be replaced with actual configuration value when the command is handed off to the agent.We need to ensure that when Ambari is upgraded and there is a mix of ExecutionCommandEntity instances with and without embedded config - it works.
