It seems upgrades available at the FE is hard-coded to 1.3.0    In order to test upgrade  I modified the available stack definitions to allow upgrade from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2 and removed upgrade to 1.3.0. However  the FE still says '(Upgrade available: HDP-1.3.0)'. However  http://server:8080/api/v1/stacks2/HDP/versions/1.3.0/ has min_upgrade_version as null.{ 'href' : 'http://server:8080/api/v1/stacks2/HDP/versions/1.3.0/'  'Versions' : { 'stack_version' : '1.3.0'  'stack_name' : 'HDP'  'min_upgrade_version' : null } ...
