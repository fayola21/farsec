Cannot delete a stopped host_component in INSTALLED state    I have a host with 4 stopped host_components. When I issue a DELETE on say http://c6401:8080/api/v1/clusters/vmc/hosts/c6404.ambari.apache.org/host_components/DATANODEThe response is:{ 'status' : 500  'message' : 'org.apache.ambari.server.controller.spi.SystemException: An internal system exception occurred: To remove master or slave components they must be in MAINTENANCE/INIT/INSTALL_FAILED/UNKNOWN state. Current=INSTALLED.'}
