ambari-server start script (ambari-server.py) will never use SERVER_START_CMD_DEBUG    The ambari-server.py start script has a command defined for starting the ambari-server in debug mode (SERVER_START_CMD_DEBUG  which turns on remote debugging)  but there is currently no option supported that will force the script to use the debug start commaand. I propose adding a --debug option so that you can run 'ambari-server start --debug' to activate remote debugging.
