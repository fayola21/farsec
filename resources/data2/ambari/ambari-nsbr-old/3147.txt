Modify ganglia config to match the data resolution of the older version    New ganglia version retains almost 50 times more data for higher resolution metrics collection. Ambari needs to modify the configuration to match the older resolution as the new default config has a very high disk space requirement.Looks like the default config for ganglia changed fromRRAs 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:244' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:24:244' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:168:244' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:672:244' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5760:374'toRRAs 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:5856' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:4:20160' 'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:40:52704'Its an increase from 1350 data points to 78720. After reverting to older configuration the file size for a single metrics and its summary info are-rw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nobody 12224 Sep 7 18:29 ./HDPNameNode/c6402.ambari.apache.org/disk_free.rrd-rw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nobody 23656 Sep 7 18:29 ./HDPNameNode/__SummaryInfo__/disk_free.rrdIn contrast it was-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 630768 Sep 7 17:48 /tmp/rrds/HDPNameNode/c6402.ambari.apache.org/disk_free.rrd-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1261000 Sep 7 17:47 /tmp/rrds/HDPNameNode/__SummaryInfo__/disk_free.rrdThe recommendation is to revert back to the old config (i.e. do not use the new default config). Confirming that with an older installation of Ambari.
