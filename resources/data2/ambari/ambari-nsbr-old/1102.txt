Error handling when errors are encountered during preparation for deploy    Currently  if any errors are encountered during preparation for deploy  the user is taken to the deploy page and the hosts will be shown as 'Waiting' but nothing happens. This is bad UX.At a minimum  we should prevent the user from proceeding and display an appropriate error message if any error is encountered after 'Deploy' is clicked  but before we transition to Step 9.We should also think about how a user can recover from this situation.At this point  the deploy has not initiated  but certain API calls may have succeeded  so we may have incomplete info in the database. Currently there's no convenient way to 'rollback'.We can either ask the user to clean the slate by reinitializing the database and try again (should succeed if the original problem was temporary).We can also build more logic in the UI to retry  check if records already exist  etc...
