ambari-agent RPM claims ownership of /usr/sbin    *This also affects trunk*The ambari-agent.spec (generated from rpm-maven-plugin) claims ownership of /usr/sbin $ grep sbin target/rpm/ambari-agent/SPECS/ambari-agent.spec | grep attr%attr(755 root root) /usr/sbinThis is a problem because the filesystem RPM owns /usr/sbin.According to rpm-maven-plugin documentation&#91;0&#93;  this is because the only file under /usr/sbin is ambari-agent and'directoryIncludedIf the value is true then the attribute string will be written for the directory if the sources identify all of the files in the directory (that is  no other mapping contributed files to the directory). This is the default behavior.'The 'no other mapping contributed files to the directory' bit is important.The solution is to add directoryInclude=false to the mapping.&#91;0&#93; http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/map-params.html
