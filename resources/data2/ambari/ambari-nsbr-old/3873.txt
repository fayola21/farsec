Unittests for User resource an all it's attributes    Test resource User of resource management . Test all actions and all the attributes. Please make sure we mock to check both cases when user already exists and when it's not.Note here we should not call directly provider methods like action_create  but make resource management library do that for us  by calling env.run(). In other case test won't cover resources definitions  and other import logic
