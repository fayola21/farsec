shell.killprocessgrp is not working in a reliable way    We have noticed an issue where shell.killprocessgrp is not working correctly. We have seen a scenario where namenode start takes a long time when on a secure cluster the jce policy is unavailable. After 10 minutes when the agent tries to kill the puppet process it invariably fails.We need to run some experiment (perhaps using long running puppet processes) to ensure that shell.killprocessgrp works as expected.Also  we need to verify that the behavior is as expected on both RHEL and Suse.
