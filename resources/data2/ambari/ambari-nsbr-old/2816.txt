Customize Services: directories are shown in comma-delimited format when revisiting    In the Install Wizard  Customize Services page shows multiple directories delimited by newlines.However  when revisiting the page (go back to Customize Services from the Review page  for example)  the directories are shown in comma-delimited format. We should always show the directories in newline-delimited format. Note that when we actually store the value  the directories are comma-delimited (which is correct).
