Enhance Install/Start/Test progress display    When we are showing progress for cluster install  it takes a while for any of the host-level or overall progress to show any progress completion percentage (they can get stuck at 0% for several minutes). This is because host-level completion is not displayed until the first install task for the task is complete. Instead  we should advance percentage complete when the tasks changes the status (from PENDING-&gt;QUEUED-&gt;IN_PROGRESS) to better reflect the install progress to the end user.
