Hosts table UI cleanup    1) has too much padding (See attached.)2) the sorting carets should have more padding-left so there is a bit more space between the column label3) the checkboxes should have more left padding. They are not balanced.4) The checkboxes and status icons are not vert centered with the hostname text.5) The input field for searching the hostname column should take up more horizontal space. with all that blank  makes it look like there is a missing column.
