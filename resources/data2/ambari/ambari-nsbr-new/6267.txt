Add Services fails with a server error under some conditions    Upon clicking on 'Deploy' from Review page in Add Services Wizard  sometimes the UI shows a server error saying 'Resource Already Exists'.It looks like the UI is trying to add client components on hosts that already have them.I've seen it for HDFS_CLIENT  MAPREDUCE2_CLIENT  etc.  when trying to add Oozie (for sure)  Storm (I think)  and possibly others.
