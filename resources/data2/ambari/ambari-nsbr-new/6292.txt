Python client caches curl flags between requests causing problems    Currently if you use the python client  if you issue a DELETE request followed by a GET request  that GET request becomes a DELETE request. You can imagine why that's undesirable.The problem is that we set the CUSTOMREQUEST field on the DELETE  but we don't unset it on the next GET. pycurl sees it still set and assumes we're still doing a DELETE.
