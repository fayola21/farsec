Ambari DDL for MySQL should not create ambarirca database    Ambari-DDL-MySQL-CREATE.sql includes 'create ambarirca' database.CREATE DATABASE ambarirca;USE ambarirca;1) At minimum  this DDL should not be creating an ambarirca database and instead mix in the RCA tables with core Ambari tables (that's how Oracle DDL does it &#8211; I think). Not ideal but better than creating an ambarirca database in this script (a user would be surprised to see this).2) Alternatively  we need to split out RCA DDL from the core Ambari. We can doc that if you plan to use HDP 1.3.x stack that you need to to setup an RCA database (since RCA is only applicable to those with HDP 1.3.x stack). If we go this route  for consistency  we would need to do the same for the oracle DDL.Note: Right now  looks like the oracle DDL just puts the RCA tables in the same database as ambari core tables (basically #1 above).
