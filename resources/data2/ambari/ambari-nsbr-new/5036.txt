Enabled security.After steps above on all 3 hosts tasks jammed and don't want to perform or fail for a very long time.VMs are alive  ambari-server and all ambari-agents are running.Finally got a reproduce using 2 commandscurl 'http://vm-0.vm:8080/api/v1/clusters/cc/services?params/run_smoke_test=false' -X PUT -H 'X-Requested-By: X-Requested-By' -u admin:admin --data '{'RequestInfo': {'context': 'Start All Services'}  'Body': {'ServiceInfo': {'state': 'STARTED'}}}' ; sleep 3; curl 'http://vm-0.vm:8080/api/v1/clusters/cc/hosts/vm-0.vm/host_components/APP_TIMELINE_SERVER' -X DELETE -H 'X-Requested-By: X-Requested-By' -u admin:adminThe way to reproduce is a bit different compared to an original description (I issue a DELETE request in 3 seconds after START_ALL_SERVICES request has been issued)  but the symptoms are the same: ServiceComponentHostNotFoundException exception is posted to log and operation is stuck on stage that contains 'App Timeline Server Start' command.
