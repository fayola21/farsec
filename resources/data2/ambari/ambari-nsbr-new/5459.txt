Usability: Improve Stack Definition support for repositories    1) Remove HDP-UTILS from Ambari .repo  and move into the HDP Stack Definition (Ambari does not depend on HDP-UTILS so this causes confusion  makes it harder to doc local repo setup  and is unclear on failures if not setup correctly).2) Requires support for multiple repositories in a Stack Definition  and ability to specify multiple repositories from UI.
