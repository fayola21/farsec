OS type check for centos 6.5 can fail if the /etc/issue has CentOS Linux release 6.5    I tried default centos 6.5 it works fine. But if I change /etc/issues and /etc/redhat-release to say:CentOS Linux release 6.5 (Final)then the registration fails with:INFO 2014-04-09 14:39:22 501 security.py:51 - SSL connection established.
