Ambari Server reset show wrong commands for DB manipulation    When performing ambari-server reset with external DB  ambari-server does nothing but outputs commands for resetting it manually.But:1. Commands are wrong  at least on Suse:su -postgres --command=psql -f /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/Ambari-DDL-Postgres-DROP.sql -v username=''ambari'' -v password=''bigdata''su: invalid option -- 'o'Try 'su --help' for more information.2. This commands should take in account that external DB can be located on the another host.3. Maybe the best option would be to give user ability to reset automatically  for example via command line switch like ambari-server reset -a
