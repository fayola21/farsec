Maintenance Mode: maintenance icon changes on Host Details page    For host components whose service is in maintenance mode  the maintenance mode icon should be displayed to the right of the service name and we should display the host component health (green / red  etc) on the far left.When the host itself is in maintenance mode  we should not show any maintenance mode icon on the host component (unless the service is in maintenance mode). This allows the UI to distinguish which host components are in service-derived maintenance mode vs host-derived. Also  on this page  host-level operations apply to all but the host components in service-derived maintenance mode (regardless of the host maintenance mode)  so this display is more natural and easier to understand for the end user.
