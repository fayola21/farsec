supervisor.enable should be removed from Ambari's Storm Config section    Ambari exposes the supervisor.enable property and in some early builds defaults it to true which causes the supervisor's to not launch workers assigned to them. The supervisor's will start up  the assignments are there  but the supervisor's just ignore them. We need to remove the supervisor.enable from Ambari as it seems like a very dangerous switch that doesn't have broad applicability.
