Hosts page: there is no indication that filtering/sorting/paging is happening or not (confusing)    In 1.6.1  filtering/sorting/paging on the Hosts page has been converted from client-side to server-side in order to address scalability issues.As a result of that  the responsiveness of UI is dependent upon how quickly the server can respond to filtering/sorting/paging calls (and also depends on the network). While UI is waiting for the new table content to come from the server  there should be some indication that work is in progress. For example  we can put an overlay on the table with a spinner (gray out the table with a spinner on top - kind of like when switching filters on JIRA's Agile Board).
