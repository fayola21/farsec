Deploy stuck during generating tasks on Review page (not always reproduced)    After the user clicks 'Deploy' in the Installer Wizard  sometimes an error is shown showing 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not access base url'. This happens while the wizard tries to save the user-specified repo base URLs.Installer should not be performing validation during deploy  because it had already been done during Select Stacks.
