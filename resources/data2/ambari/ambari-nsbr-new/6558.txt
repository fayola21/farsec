FE allows add host on host that is in UNKNOWN state (agent was stopped)    added a host to a cluster (manually installed and started an agent)http://c6403.ambari.apache.org:8080/api/v1/hosts/c6401.ambari.apache.org{ 'href' : 'http://c6403.ambari.apache.org:8080/api/v1/hosts/c6401.ambari.apache.org'  'Hosts' : { 'host_health_report' : ''  'host_name' : 'c6401.ambari.apache.org'  'host_state' : 'HEALTHY'  'host_status' : 'HEALTHY' }}After the agent is stopped for the host{ 'href' : 'http://c6403.ambari.apache.org:8080/api/v1/hosts/c6401.ambari.apache.org'  'Hosts' : { 'host_health_report' : ''  'host_name' : 'c6401.ambari.apache.org'  'host_state' : 'HEARTBEAT_LOST'  'host_status' : 'UNKNOWN' }}At this point I can perform AddHost and start the wizard. But AddHost will eventually fail - although now I see it just waiting.We need some form of error indication when host is not lost.
