Bootstrap API call says bootstrap is running even though all agents have installed and registered    UI keeps showing that the agents are being installed  because the bootstrap API GET call keeps returning that hostsStatus/status is RUNNINGI suspected time.sleep(1) instruction. If restart takes too long time  situation  when ambari-agent.log has not been created yet is possible. So  tail command returned not 0 retcode and exit from procedure. But in logs I cant see any non-zero retcodes. Thus  too short logs could be explaned by this issue.
