Unit test failures on jenkins for Ambari 1.7.0 related to alerts.    Tests run locally and pass 100% consistently.These test results are fishy; they randomly fail on different OS deployments. Even the simple logic ones fail. There are only 5 alert targets ever created  yet there are 9 returned sometimes. I'm wondering if this is because we tried to load some data in the @BeforeClass instead of @Before - maybe there's a weird Guice/JUnit race condition going on.I can't say I can fix this with confidence since I can't reproduce it. I'm going to move some things to @Before and hope it helps.java.lang.AssertionError: expected:&lt;5&gt; but was:&lt;9&gt; at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:93) at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:647) at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:128) at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:472) at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:456) at org.apache.ambari.server.orm.dao.AlertDispatchDAOTest.testFindAllTargets(AlertDispatchDAOTest.java:117)
