Behavior change: host filtering no longer handles startsWith matches    If I have a host that has IP 10.0.2.15  in Ambari 1.6.0 if I start to filter by IP (by typing 10.0....)  the hosts that match 'startsWith' stay displayed.In Ambari 1.6.1  now it only does exact match  so once I start typing  all hosts disappear until I finally type the whole thing in for exact match.Hosts/ip.matches(10)
