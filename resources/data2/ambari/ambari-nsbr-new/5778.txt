In some upgrade scenarios  Ambari Web's persist key-value store state causes the UI to act unpredictably    During Ambari upgrade  automatically clear the persist state to prevent potential issues with Ambari Web not working properly (this was observed a number of times on upgraded clusters). Currently  we make the following call to get out of the inconsistent state so that Ambari Web works properly:curl -i -u admin:admin -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari' -X POST -d '{ 'CLUSTER_CURRENT_STATUS': '{/'clusterState/':/'CLUSTER_STARTED_5/'}' }' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/persistWe need to do something equivalent during upgrade.
