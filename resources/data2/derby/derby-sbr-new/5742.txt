Native user authentication: improve wording of error message    This error message no longer has a correct string: XCY05(quote from English locale):Invalid setting of the derby.authentication.provider property. This property cannot be set to NATIVE::LOCAL unless credentials for the database owner have been stored in the database using the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CREATE_USER procedure.This property should no longer ever need to be set to NATIVE::LOCAL: it is done automatically when the first user is created via SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CREATE_USER.The wording should be adjusted. Note: Now  the property should never be set manually for native authentication via SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY  this is only meaningful for LOCAL credentials db  but this is done automatically since version 7 of the spec.
