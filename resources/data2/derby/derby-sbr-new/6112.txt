SSL Test (and network server )  can hang if serverSocket.accept() fails for something other than an IOException    In starting a server with SSL as in SSLTest if serverSocket.accept() fails for some reason other than an IOException it may just print the error to console and hang. In this case it was:java.security.AccessControlException: Access denied (java.util.PropertyPermissionI saw this when debugging a java issue in serverSocket.accept() but I think it could be simulated by adding an unwrapped System.getProperty() of some sort before serverSocket.accept() to force a permission error. e.g.  System.getProperty('derby.system.home'); return serverSocket.accept(); } catch (IOException acceptE) {I have not verified that would work.
