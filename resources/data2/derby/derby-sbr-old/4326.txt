hang on winvista with IBM 1.6 SR5 in NSSecurityMechanismTest    This is stopping my platform testing on winvista with ibm 1.6 SR5.During the initial run of suites.All  I got:-------------------------------- testNetworkServerSecurityMechanism java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer: setsockopt at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketSetOption(Native Method) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.setOption(PlainSocketImpl.java:283) at java.net.Socket.setKeepAlive(Socket.java:1171) at org.apache.derby.impl.drda.ClientThread.run(Unknown Source)--------------------------------Rerunning suites.All gave the same error.There is only 1 java process active &amp; hanging.Running just the test itself also results in a hang but there was (so far - it's been sitting unchanged for 4 hours) java.net.SocketException.
