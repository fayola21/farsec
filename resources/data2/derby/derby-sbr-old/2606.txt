Derby should print the parameters to failed statements to the derby.log when it logs the error    It would be good if when derby dumped an error to derby.log it printed the parameters for the failed statement. Currently the default behaviour is that only the statement text will print. Users have to set derby.language.logStatementText=true if they want to see the parameters. It would be useful if any errors included the parameters as well as the statement text.To reproduce put derby.stream.error.logSeverityLevel=0 in your derby.properties and run this script: connect 'jdbc:derby:wombat;create=true';create table t (i int);prepare p as 'insert into t values'; execute p using 'values(1)';execute p using 'values(10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)';
