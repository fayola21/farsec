remote server testing with 10.2 snapshot showed 8 failures    I ran derbynetclientmats between two IPV6 machines with the 10.2 snapshot and finally got to look at the results...There were 8 failures  4 of those because of other tests leaving stuff behind.2 tests complained about junit classes not being found (? one of those was checkDataSource!).2 tests seemed to have trouble connecting - those might be the more interesting ones.Will do further analysis  &amp; create test cleanup patches.The failing tests and some comments:suite derbynetclientmats with ibm142 &amp; IPV6 machines using -DhostName= (i.e. remote server test) and build: 10.2.0.4 alpha - (419130)derbynetclientmats/derbynetclientmats.fail:jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java ?? fails because of an error accessing junit. Not sure why  junit is in client classpath...and it's not even a junit test. Stack trace not helpful.
