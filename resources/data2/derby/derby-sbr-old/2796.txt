Obscure error messages when using SSL in various combinations    I ran clients with various ssl configurations on their urls and startup options against servers with various ssl configurations. I will attach an html file recording my results. I feel that many of the error conditions raised diagnostics which were too obscure to be helpful. I think this will be burdensome to tech support.
