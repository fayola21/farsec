SecurityException or LinkageException thrown during loading a class from a database jar incorrectly shuts the engine down.    In addiing test cases to lang/dcl.test for signed jar files stored in the database I found that if a jar is installed with a tampered class the resulting SecurityException shuts Derby down. Most likely the same would be true for an invalid class hacked into the jar.
