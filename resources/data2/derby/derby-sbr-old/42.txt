When using encryption  do not store the length information about the external key in service.properties    When using derby database encryption there is a provision to provide the key to be used for encryption as an external key. In this case the key is not stored in the database for added security. There should not be any useful information about the external key that was used for encrypting the database in the service.properties.Right now  key length is stored in service.properties. This should not be stored in service.properties.
