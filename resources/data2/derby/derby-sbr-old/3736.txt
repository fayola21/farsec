Revoking a column level privilege from a user  a prepared statement relying on that privilege can still be executed    When a table level SELECT privilege is revoked  a dependent prepared statement is invalidated and can no longer be executed  but in the case of a column level privilegeSELECT privilege  the dependent prepared statement can still be executed.This works as expected in 10.2  but does not work in all 10.3 and 10.4 releases.
