A  'revoke execute ... restrict' should fail if there are dependent objects on the execute privilege    As per the functional spec attached to DERBY-1330  a 'revoke execute ... restrict' should fail if there are dependent objects on the execute privilegeIn order to implement this  when revoke execute is executed  a special invalidation action should be sent and dependent objects will need to catch that invalidation and throw an exception. If there are no dependents  then no exception will be thrown and revoke execute will succeed.I am just creating a new jira entry here so it is easier to track sub items of DERBY-1330. Will link this Jira entry to DERBY-1330. See the functional spec attached to DERBY-1330
