SYSCS_GET_USER_ACCESS incorrectly treats the passed in user name as a SQL identifier and thus can reports the wrong user information    VALUES SYSCS_GET_USER_ACCESS(CURRENT_USER) will report the wrong user information if the user name needs to be a delimited identifier when used in a SQL statement such as GRANT. E.g. user fred@derby.com  123 etc.Passing the user name as a VARCHAR also returns the wrong user for such user names.
