Allow SQL query text to be null in StatementKey    Because the SQL isn't checked before the cache is queried  StatementKey should allow the SQL query text to be null.This simplifies handling this exceptional situations  hopefully without complications.What will happen is  the cache is queried  null is returned (no match) and then prepare will fail in the driver. Because the statement is never prepared  it will never be inserted into the cached  nor (incorrectly) fetched from the cache in the first step.Of course  one could also explicitly check for null in either the Logical(Prepared|Callable)Statement&#91;40&#93;  StatementKeyFactory or StatementCacheInteractor.However  the proposed change is small  isolated to one class and makes the exceptional case be handled by the normal code path.
