Bad Eclipse plugin version specification    In the plugin.xml of the Derby Eclipse plugin  the version specification reads '10.1.0.0 (124830)'  which Eclipse complains about as being illegal. In consequence  the plugin is not loaded.The Eclipse docs have the following to say about the version specification: 'Plug-in version format is major.minor.service.qualifier'.Stripping the '(1234830)'  whatever that is anyway  solves the problem.
