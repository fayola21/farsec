In soft upgrade mode  the metadata queries do not get compiled in SYS schema. This will cause problems in future releases of Derby.    EmbedDatabaseMetaData implements metadata queries. The implementation of metadata queries in EmbedDatabaseMetaData checks if we are in soft upgrade mode (getPreparedQuery() has following code)if (notInSoftUpgradeMode()) s = getPreparedQueryUsingSystemTables(queryName  net);else { try { //Can't use stored prepared statements because we are in soft upgrade //mode and hence need to get metadata sql from metadata.properties file //or metadata_net.properties String queryText = getQueryFromDescription(queryName  net); s = getEmbedConnection().prepareMetaDataStatement(queryText); } catch (Throwable t) { throw handleException(t); } }So  when running in soft upgrade mode  we do not go through SYSSTATEMENT but this will cause the metadata query to run in whatever the current schema may be rather than in SYS schema. This is not a problem in Derby 10.3 release because during soft upgarde  the collation will always be UCS_BASIC and hence collation mismatch can't happen.But in Derby 10.3  a user can create a database with territory based collation. When such a database will be in soft upgrade mode for say Derby 10.4  the metadata queries will run into problem if they are run in a user schema. This is because in soft upgrade mode  we do not go through SYSSTATEMENTS and instead compile the metadata queries in current schema. If the current schema is user schema  then character string literals in metadata queries will get the collation type of territory based and when compared with character string colunms from SYS tables with collation type of UCS_BASIC  we will end up getting compilation error for the metadata queries. So  before the next release  we will have to fix this problem. One solution may be to somehow make the current compilation schema as SYS when running the metadata queries in soft upgrade mode.
