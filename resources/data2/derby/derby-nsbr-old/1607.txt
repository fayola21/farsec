new j9 canons required/canons need to be removed to catch up to changes to 7/27/06.    There are some newer failures with wctme5.7 &amp; wsdd5.6 that are just due to canon maintenance. lang/aggregate.sql - needs a new j9_13 and j9_22 canon lang/ejbql.sql - j9_13 canon can be removed (there is no j9_22 canon) lang/distinct.sql - needs new j9_22 canon nist/dml099.sql - j9_13 canon can be removed lang/procedureInTrigger.sql - needs a j9_22 canon note  this last test also suffers from DERBY-1605.
