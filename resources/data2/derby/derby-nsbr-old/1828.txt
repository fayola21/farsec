Access rule violations should use a SQL state starting with '42' according to the SQL standard.    The SQL standard says that SQL State '42' is for 'syntax error or accessrule violation' (section 23.1).There is a question of what JDBC 4.0 exception should be thrown for a access rule violation JDBC 4.0 maps '42' to SQLSyntaxErrorException which seems wrong for an access rule.Message thread:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200609.mbox/%3c45004A04.5080002@apache.org%3e
