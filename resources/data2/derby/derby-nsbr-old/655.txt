getImportedKeys returns duplicate rows in some cases    I have a database with a large number of tables. I get duplicate rows when I call DatabaseMetaData.getImportedKeys for a particular table. However  if I create the same table with same number of foreign keys in another database (which has fewer number of tables)  then getImportedKeys returns me the correct number of rows. This error seems to happen only when the database has a large number of tables. I will attach a repro for this shortly.
