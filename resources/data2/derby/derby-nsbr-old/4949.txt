Backward  confusing error message when you use the wrong ResultSet.getXXX() method in the client driver    If you try to get a Time value out of an INTEGER column  the client driver gives this error. I believe that similar nonsense comes back when you try other mismatched getters on other datatypes: 'An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'java.sql.Types 4' from a data value of type 'java.sql.Time'.'The exception is a java.sql.SQLDataException with SQLState 22005. The embedded driver returns a better message: 'An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'java.sql.Time' from a data value of type INTEGER'.'I recommend two improvements to the utility method which generates these exceptions:1) Flip the order of the type names.2) Use the ResultSetMetaData to look up the source data type name.
