sysinfo with -cp client option should not print error saying DB2 jar file and driver class are missing    If you run java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp client SimpleApp.classyou getFOUND IN CLASS PATH: Derby Client libraries (derbyclient.jar) user-specified class (SimpleApp)NOT FOUND IN CLASS PATH: Derby Client libraries (db2jcc.jar) (com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver not found.)The 'NOT FOUND IN CLASSPATH' output is confusing and invalid because we're testing the network client  not the DB2 JCC client.
