Convert compatibility/testScript.xml to JUnit    I have started converting compatibility/testScript.xml to JUnit to1) be able to more dynamically specify which combinations to test  2) get standard JUnit reports from the test  and3) more easily include the compatibility test in the regression test runs.I plan to use a property file (patterened after the current ant.property file for the compatibility test)  to specify jvm and derby library locations.With the growing number of jvm and derby versions I also think that it should be possible to specify a number of different kinds of compatibility test combinations for example:a) the current way  which is all combinations of derby and jvm on both  server and client. &#91;(derbys*jvms)*(derbys*jvms)&#93;b) Current trunk client and jvms vs. all server derbys and jvms. &#91;(1*jvms)*(derbys*jvms)&#93;c) All clients and jvms vs. current trunk server and jvms. &#91;(derbys*jvms)*(1*jvms)&#93;d) Exact specification of the combinations to be tested. &#91;(N*M)*(X*Y)&#93;Which kind of test to run should be specified in the property file.
