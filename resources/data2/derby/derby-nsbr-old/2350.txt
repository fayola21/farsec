Use of XML values in the action statement of a trigger throw exceptions.    A trigger like  where V  V1 and V2 are columns of type XML will thrown an exception when fired.CREATE TRIGGER AIS AFTER INSERT ON T_MAIN  REFERENCING NEW_TABLE AS N FOR EACH STATEMENT  INSERT INTO T_ACTION_STATEMENT(A  V1  ID  V2)  SELECT 'I'  V  ID  V FROM NERROR 38000: The exception 'java.sql.SQLException: An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'java.lang.Object' from a data value of type 'XML'.' was thrown while evaluating an expression.Most likely because triggers are implementing using VTIs and hence JDBC ResultSets and XML is not supported through JDBC yet.TriggerTest shows this issue  see the comment with the bug number to reproduce.
