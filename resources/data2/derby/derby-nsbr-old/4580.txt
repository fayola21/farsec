Cannot use dblook on soft-upgraded database: Table/View 'SYS.SYSSEQUENCES' does not exist.    I tried to use dblook on trunk to dump the schema of a database created with Derby 10.5. dblook printed the following message:&#8211; Timestamp: 2010-03-12 15:45:50.836&#8211; Source database is: db&#8211; Connection URL is: jdbc:derby:db&#8211; appendLogs: false&#8211; Note: At least one unexpected error/warning message was&#8211; encountered during DDL generation. See dblook.log&#8211; to review the message(s).In dblook.log  I saw an exception with this message:java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table/View 'SYS.SYSSEQUENCES' does not exist.
