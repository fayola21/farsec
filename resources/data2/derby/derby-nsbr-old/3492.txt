When the replication log buffer becomes full  the chunk of log that should be appended is to the buffer is discarded    In MasterController#appendLog  log is force-sent to the slave if the replication log buffer becomes full. However  the log chunk that should have been appended is discarded:try { logBuffer.appendLog(greatestInstant  log  logOffset  logLength);} catch (LogBufferFullException lbfe) { try { logShipper.forceFlush(); } catch (IOException ioe) {...}The log chunk must be added after freeing a log buffer by calling forceFlush
