Don't allow references to generated columns in the NEW transition variables of triggered actions of BEFORE triggers    Thanks to Dag for finding this restriction in the SQL Standard  part 2  section 11.39  SR 12 c) I see this provision: 12) If BEFORE is specified  then: : c) The &lt;triggered action&gt; shall not contain a &lt;field reference&gt; that references a field in the new transition variable corresponding to a generated column of T.
