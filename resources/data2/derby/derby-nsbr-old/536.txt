The current build.properties for the Derby Help Plug-in for Eclipse does not work for creating a deployable plug-in    While updating the information for the web site about the Derby plug-ins I revised the instructions on how to create zip files for the plug-ins. The current build.properties file for the help plug-in did not work to create a deployable plug-in  without manual intervention. The attached patch for the build.properties file for the help plug-in should replace the existing one  which allows users to select Export &gt;&gt; Deployable plug-ins and fragments and then create a zip file which is suitable for deployment.svn stat output:M plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.plugin.doc/build.propertiesTests:I built a new doc zip file using the new build.properties file  unzipped it to another eclipse install in the ECLIPSE_HOME directory and made sure all of the files for the help were in the correct location and accessible.I'd appreciate it if someone could commit this.Thanks Susan
