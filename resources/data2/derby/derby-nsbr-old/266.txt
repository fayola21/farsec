test tools/dblook_test.java fails if run in a directory having '*derby/*' in its path    SYMPTOM: The test 'tools/dblook_test' will fail. The diff looks similar to this:     Start: dblook_test jdk1.4.2_02 derbyall:derbytools 2005-05-06 22:37:37 ***4861d4860&lt; java.io.FileNotFoundException: &lt;filePath&gt;Test Failed. End: dblook_test jdk1.4.2_02 derbyall:derbytools 2005-05-06 22:37:53 ***    cf mail thread:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200505.mbox/%3c20050507140048.GB690@ac30.fr34.2y.net%3eANALYSIS: The problem lies with the sedfunctionality in the test harness  which delete certain lines beforecomparing with the master file.Sed.java in the harness removes lines containing derby/ in the path viz: deleteLines.addElement('^.derby/.//&lt;.//&gt;//(.).*$');  deleteLines.addElement('^.derby/.//(.).$'); so if your tests are running in a directory containing this pattern  aline too much is deleted from dblook_test.tmp  thereby giving acomparison failure like you describe.I don't know the reason for this deletion yet  so I can't say how tofix it  but the work-around is obvious: Run test in a directory whosename does not contain this pattern
