DriverManager.getConnection leaks memory when connecting to a non-existent database    Repeated calls to java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection('jdbc:derby:C:DOES_NOT_EXIST') leak memory and eventually lead to an OutOfMemoryError.This bug is similar to DERBY-1947 in that ContextManager objects are not getting removed from the HashSet. The attached test program demonstrates the issue. When run with VM options -Xms8m -Xmx8m  it throws an OutOfMemoryError after 19022 calls to DriverManager.getConnection.
