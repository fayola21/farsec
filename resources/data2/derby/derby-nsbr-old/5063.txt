Embedded driver allows updateBytes() on BOOLEAN column    The following code inserts the value TRUE into the table T on the embedded driver: Statement s = c.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY  ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); s.execute('create table t(b boolean)'); ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery('select b from t'); rs.moveToInsertRow(); rs.updateBytes(1  'this is a test'.getBytes()); rs.insertRow();The client driver fails:java.sql.SQLException: An attempt was made to put a data value of type 'byte[]' into a data value of type 'BOOLEAN'.I believe the client driver is correct  and embedded should be changed to match it.
