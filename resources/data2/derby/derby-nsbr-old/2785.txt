ij 'describe' built in command cannot describe a table named 'run'    steps to duplicate:(attach ij to any database)ij&gt; create table run (i int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; desc run;ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered 'desc' at line 1  column 1.ij&gt; I think this is a parser problem within ij where the 'run' is taken as a token and that token is not included in the definition of a tablename expression in the grammer (should be an easy fix).
