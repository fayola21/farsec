Create a utility class for skipping data in an InputStream    The contract of InputStream.skip is somewhat difficult  some would even say broken.See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#skip(long))A utility class should be created to ensure that we use the same skip procedure throughout the Derby code base.Suggested functionality: long skipFully(InputStream) : skips until EOF  returns number of bytes skipped void skipFully(InputStream long) : skips requested number of bytes  throws EOFException if there is too few bytes in the streamI know of two different approaches  both skipping in a loop: a) Verify EOF with a read call when skip returns zero. b) Throw EOFException if skip returns zero before requested number of bytes have been skipped.There's related code in iapi.util.UTF8Util. Maybe this class  say StreamUtil  could be put in the same package?
