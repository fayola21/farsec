Add Order Entry application/system/performance test/toolkit    Order Entry (OE) is an OLTP application/toolkit which is based upon the TPC-C specification but is not claiming to be a valid implementation. The TPC-C specification is used mainly forthe database schema &amp; population rules and the logic of the business transactions.http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/OE is set up so that the driving &amp; display of the business transactions is separated from the actual implementation which then allows different implementations to compare performance of Derby features. In all cases the implementationswould perform the logical functionality required by the TPC-C  but need not be strict implementations. As an examplethe new order number is obtained in a defined way in TPC-C  but Derby could use generated keys to perform thesame logical function. Testing the two ways would lead to see if there were performance problems with generated keys.Examples of the possible implementations of the business transactions are: direct - client executes SQL statements directly holding onto PreparedStatements for the lifetime of the client) procedure - client executes a procedure per business transaction EOD - implementation using JDBC 4^H5? EOD updateable ResultSets positioned updates etc.Other options include use of triggers use of generated keys etc.Possible values for the display (results of the transaction) nothing text HTML for servlets/JSPs etc.Also the loading of the data could support different options: load with/without contraints in place load using INSERT statements load using import load using import with a ResultSet class.OE allows the amount of data loaded initially to be varied very easily  just by setting the warehousescale factor  so a warehouse=1 creates a database of size N  and warehouse=100 a database of size 100N (roughly).This allows databases in the range 10-100Gb to be easily created.The general setup would that OE could be used as a function test  performance test  or stress test so it's seen as a toolkit.I hope also that the OE could be expanded beyond the TPC-C spec  for example: adding images (BLOBs) and descriptions (CLOBs) to the product ITEM table. adding triggers to send-email on various actions.These additions would be intended to test Derby functionality in a 'real-world' OLTP application.The top-level package under java/testing would be org.apache.derbyTesting.systemTests.oe
