Client ResultSet.getHoldabilty will return incorrect value when the ResultSet is obtained from a procedure call    Fixing DERBY-3305 (aka DERBY-1111) exposes that the holdability for a result set sent over DRDA is being obtained from the Statement that created the JDBC ResultSet  not its actual holdability. The two can be different when the result set is dynamic result set from a procedure.jdbc4.ResultSetTest.getHoldability fails in client mode.
