calling getByteLength on org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.StoreStreamClob makes BinaryStream  fetched before this call  unusable    StoreStreamClob.getByteLength first resets the internal stream and then reads the entire stream. Due to this any read on Stream obtained by StoreStreamClob.getRawByteStream returns -1.StoreStreamClob is a read only InternalClob  so probably keeping the length in a variable will be good idea.
