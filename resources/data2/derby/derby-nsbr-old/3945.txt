Generation clauses which mention user-coded functions may produce different resuls depending on who performs the triggering INSERT/UPDATE    This is similar to DERBY-3944. The compiler uses the current schema in order to resolve unqualifed function names when preparing INSERT/UPDATE statement. This means that a generation clause may evaluate differently depending on who invokes the triggering INSERT/UPDATE statement. This violates the requirement that generation clause should be deterministic (see part 2 of the ANSI/ISO standard  section 4.16.Hopefully  the same patch will fix both DERBY-3944 and this issue.
