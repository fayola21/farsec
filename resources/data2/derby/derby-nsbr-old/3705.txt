In Net Client mode  negative values for stream length are accepted without an exception for PreparedStatement.setAsciiStream()    This is related to Cloudscape bug 4250.Pass negative length as the stream length for various setXXXStream methods should throw an exception. But in Net Client mode  passing a negative value as stream length to PreparedStatement.setAsciiStream() doesn't throw an exception.e.g. //from store/StreamingColumnPreparedStatement ps = prepareStatement('insert into ' + 'testLongVarCharInvalidStreamLength11 values(?  ?  ?)'); ps.setInt(1  100); try { println('===&gt; testing using setAsciiStream with -2 as length'); ps.setAsciiStream(2  fileIn  -2); // should throw exception here but doesn't. }This issue has been fixed for embedded mode  but not for client mode.
