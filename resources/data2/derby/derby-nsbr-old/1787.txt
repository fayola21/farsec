The database owner is incorrectly referred to as dba in the code comments that were checked in Derby 10.2 for grant revoke work. We should clean this up at some point.    Grant revoke functionality was added in Derby 10.2 The comments that went into the grant revoke code  in some places refer to database owner as 'dba'. They are not the same thing. In the grant revoke world  dba is a role. We haven't added roles into Derby yet but current use of dba in comments might make it confusing when we do start working on roles including dba.
