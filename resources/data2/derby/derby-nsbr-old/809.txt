Incorrect documentation for 'NetworkServerControl.logConnections(boolean)'    The documentation for 'NetworkServerControl.logConnections(boolean)' states that Derby logs both connections and disconnections. As of 10.1.2.1 and (all) earlier releases  this is not true. The documentation should be corrected to avoid confusing users.The thought of adding logging of disconnections has also been posted on derby-dev.Byran Pendleton identified the following documentation with the incorrect description:http://db.apache.org/derby/javadoc/publishedapi/org/apache/derby/drda/NetworkServerControl.htmlhttp://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/adminguide/radminconfigdb2jdrdalogconnections.htmlhttp://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.0/manuals/admin/hubprnt23.htmlhttp://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/adminguide/tadminlogfile.htmlShould we fix this in 10.0? If yes  please update fix versions for this issue.
