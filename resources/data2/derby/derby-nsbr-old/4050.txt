Multithreaded clob update causes growth in table that does not get reclaimed    Doing a multithreaded update of a Clob table causes table growth that does not get reclaimed except by compressing the table. The reproduction has a table with two threads. One thread updates row 1 repeatedly with 33 000 character clob. The other thread updates row 2 with a small clob  'hello'. The problem occurs back to 10.2 but seems much worse on trunk than 10.2. The trunk database grew to 273MB on trunk after 10000 updates of each row. The 10.2 database grew only to 25MB. If the update is synchronized there is no growth.I will attach the repro.
