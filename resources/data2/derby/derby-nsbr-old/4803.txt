Sequences do not work in INSERT/SELECT    Using sequence in SELECT works fine whereas the same SELECT query used in INSERT/SELECT results in 'The statement references the following sequence more than once' error. This happens even though the SELECT in question returns exactly 1 row of data.The Reference Manual states 1. ' NEXT VALUE FOR expression may occur in the following places: SELECT statement: As part of the expression defining a returned column in a SELECT list' and 2. ' NEXT VALUE expression may not appear in any of these situations: CASE expression  WHERE clause  ORDER BY clause  Aggregate expression  ROW_NUMBER function  DISTINCT select list'.Nowhere a restriction on INSERT/SELECT is mentioned. Additionally  other databases (i.e. Oracle) support use of sequences in INSERT/SELECT.Therefore  I consider it a bug.
