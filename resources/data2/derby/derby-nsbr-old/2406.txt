XAResource.end does not set the XA transaction state correctly when the XAException is thrown    As the comments in DERBY-2360 show when calling the XAResource.end the XAException may be thrown even when the transaction was successfully disassociated from the connection but the transaction was marked as rollback only. The code at the end of XAResource.end function does not handle this correctly. It either throws an XAException or sets the connection state to XA_T0_NOT_ASSOCIATED. The corresponding code from NetXAResource.end method is if (rc != XAResource.XA_OK) { throwXAException(rc  false); }else { conn_.setXAState(Connection.XA_T0_NOT_ASSOCIATED); }
