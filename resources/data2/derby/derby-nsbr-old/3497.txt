OOME at slave during replication    After deleting and inserting more than 1 million records during replication  I got java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space.The heap dump shows that almost the entire heap is byte arrays  and it seems most of them are referred to by ReplicationMessage objects. An inspection of the heap dump in VisualVM it seems that it is references rooted in SocketConnection#objInputStream that keeps them from being garbage collected.
