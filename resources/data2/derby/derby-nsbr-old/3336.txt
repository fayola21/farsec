jdbcapi/derbyStress.java no longer runs with low memory heap so does not provide testing for leak scenarios    This was raised as an issue in DERBY-3316  but it seems to make most sense to raise it as a separate issue. When derbyStress ran in derbyall it ran with 64MB heap so that it could test fixes for various memory leaks. When moved to JDBCHarnessJavaTest it started running with the full 512MB heap used for suites.All so no longer tests for those leaks. There are two options presented so far1) Move it back to derbyall 2) add it to the junit-all target For the adding it to the junit-all target option I think a few things have to happen for it to be run as part of the nightlies. 1) Convert derbyStress.java to junit. 2) create a junit-lomem target and make it part of junit-all. 3) Fix junit-all so that it can run with the nightlies. DERBY-2045 + distribute ant to the testing machines make nightly script changes etc.Myrna expressed some misgivings to relying on junit-all because ant is not available on all the platforms where she tests. I think the best course of action is to at least temporarily move the test back to derbyall and then open separate task(s) for the junit conversion effort.
