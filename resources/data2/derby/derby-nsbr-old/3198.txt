Using setQueryTimeout will leak sections    The implementation of setQueryTimeout relies on NetStatementReply.writeSetSpecialRegister() which will allocate a dynamic section when called. No reference to this Section object is kept  and so Section.free() never gets called on it. Executing the same statment repeatedly with a query timeout set results in the client driver throwing an exception because the number of Sections exceeding 32000.
