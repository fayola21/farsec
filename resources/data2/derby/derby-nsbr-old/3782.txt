Client Configuration.java imports engine class  org.apache.derby.iapi.services.info.JVMInfo    The client code (org.apache.derby.client.am.Configuration) imports the engine class org.apache.derby.iapi.services.info.JVMInfo.This will make two copies of the class in derby.jar and derbyclient.jar which can cause problems if mixed version jars are used and I think may cause jar sealing issues as well.Until we have a good framework for sharing code between engine and client  the client shouldn't import engine classes.
