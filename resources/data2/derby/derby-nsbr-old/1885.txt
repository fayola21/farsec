The source distribution for 10.2.1.4 rc1 includes derby.log files    The db-derby-10.2.1.4-src release candidate built on 9/22/06 includes derby.log files. db-derby-10.2.1.4-src/derby.log db-derby-10.2.1.4-src/java/demo/toursdb/derby.logFile sizes: $ ls -l derby.log rw-rw-r- 1 jta jta 767545 Sep 22 16:12 derby.log $ ls -l java/demo/toursdb/derby.log rw-rr- 1 jta jta 542 Sep 22 14:28 java/demo/toursdb/derby.logIf the release candidates need to be rebuilt  it would be good to remove those derby.log files  but it doesn't harm anything to have them in there (just consumes a little space).The db-derby-10.2.1.4-lib and db-derby-10.2.1.4-bin distributions don't have these files.
