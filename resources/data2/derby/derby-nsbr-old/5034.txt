[patch] bad field masking makes non functional rowsInput evaluation    RealDistinctScalarAggregateStatistics derives from RealScalarAggregateStatisticsRealDistinctScalarAggregateStatistics takes a constructor parm of rowsInput and forwards it to the super class's constructor  where it is stored for use by the class.However  the subclass mistakenly added a masked rowsInput field that is never set  and thus interferes with the proper use of the super class's rowsInput field.patch removed the erroneous subclass's field.
