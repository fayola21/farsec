LOBStreamControl shouldn't throw SQLException    LOBStreamControl throws three types of exceptions: IOException  SQLException and StandardException.All the SQLException are generated/thrown from the code in LOBStreamControl.At this level of the code  SQLException should not be thrown  as it is more tedious to handle both SQLException and StandardException at higher levels.I propose to replace SQLException with StandardException in LOBStreamControl. The purpose of this change is consistency  and also results it slightly less code at higher levels.
