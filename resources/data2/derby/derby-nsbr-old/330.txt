Many files do not have correct svn-properties    There are two problems with svn properties in Derby:1) A number of non-binary files do not have the svn:eol-style=native property set. Some of these currently has CRLF (Windows-style) line terminators  Example:dt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ file ./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/popup/actions/RemoveDerbyNature.java./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/popup/actions/RemoveDerbyNature.java: ASCII C program text  with CRLF line terminatorsdt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ svn proplist -v ./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/popup/actions/RemoveDerbyNature.javawhereas others have LF(Unix-style). Example:dt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ file ./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/actions/SysInfoAction.java./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/actions/SysInfoAction.java: ASCII C program textdt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ svn proplist -v ./plugins/eclipse/org.apache.derby.ui/src/org/apache/derby/ui/actions/SysInfoAction.javaSome of the files that don't have this property do instead have a property called 'snv:eol-style'. I'm guessing this is a typo.Example:dt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ svn proplist -v java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/crypto/T_CipherOFB.javaProperties on 'java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/crypto/T_CipherOFB.java': snv:eol-style : native2) A seemingly arbitrary collection of files have the svn:executable property set. To my knowledge  the only files in the Derby respository that should have this property are the *.ksh and perhaps the *.bat scripts  (I don't know if Windows cares about this property when the file has the .bat suffix). Currently none of the *.ksh scripts have this property  but a number of java source files (not all) have it. (If there is some reason to have this property on other files  it should at least be done consistently throughout the repository).Example:dt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ svn proplist -v java/drda/org/apache/derby/drda/NetworkServerControl.javaProperties on 'java/drda/org/apache/derby/drda/NetworkServerControl.java': svn:executable : svn:eol-style : nativedt136804@atum10~/local/DERBY/d_rby-138$ svn proplist -v java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/crypto/T_CipherOFB.javaProperties on 'java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/crypto/T_CipherOFB.java': snv:eol-style : nativeIf I understand correctly it is not possible to create a patchfile that contains property changes  so I guess a committer will have to do this. I'm willing to create a script file containing all the svn commands that must be run  as a 'pseudo patch'.
