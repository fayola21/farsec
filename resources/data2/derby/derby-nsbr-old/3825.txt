StoreStreamClob.getReader(charPos) performs poorly    StoreStreamClob.getReader(charPos) performs poorly because it resets the underlying stream and skips data until it reached the requested character position. Not only does the data has to be skipped  it also has to be decoded (UTF-8).The problem is exposed through EmbedClob.getSubString  which causes extremely bad performance for the client driver because the locator based Clob implementation uses this method.For the record  there is another read buffer size issue that exaggerates the problem (it will probably be handled under DERBY-3769  and also DERBY-3818).
