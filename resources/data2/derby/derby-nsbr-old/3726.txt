Don't call RAFContainer.padFile() from instances of RAFContainer4    In this thread on derby-dev  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200806.mbox/%3c48530848.3020501@sbcglobal.net%3e it was mentioned that RAFContainer4 calls padFile() when creating a container. Since padFile() uses old I/O calls and the rest of RAFContainer4 uses NIO  it could possibly cause similar issues as those seen in DERBY-3347. Although we haven't verified that this is a problem  we should try to avoid mixing old I/O and NIO to be on the safe side.
