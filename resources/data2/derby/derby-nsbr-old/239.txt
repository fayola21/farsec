Need a online backup feature  that does not block update operations   when online backup is in progress.    Currently Derby allows users to perfoms online backups using SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE() procedure  but while the backup is in progress  update operations are temporarily blocked  but read operations can still proceed.Blocking update operations can be real issue specifically in client server environments  because user requests will be blocked for a long time if a backup is in the progress on the server.
