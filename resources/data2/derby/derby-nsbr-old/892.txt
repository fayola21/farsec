add mechanism for specifying policy file for individual function tests    It would be nice to be able to specify a test-specific policy file.This should get handled similar to existing properties  i.e. get specified in a test_app.properties file (or  for a suite  in the suite.properties file). The file should then be copied into the correct place.Note  that the 'old' functionTests harness (as opposed to junit tests) includes a check for a property called 'serverPolicyFile' (in harness/jvm.java). The name is a left over from when the policy file was only used for/by network server  and should be renamed - derbyTestPolicyFile  for instance. It is not used anywhere at present  and not specific to network server. It would be nice if this could be expanded  or  if not used  removed.The default policy file used is the derby_tests.policy file under functionTests/util.Also  currently  the property can only be used with RunTest - for further traction  it should probably get passed on through RunSuite/RunList.Once confirmed to be working  the property should get documented in &lt;trunk&gt;/java/testing/README.htm.
