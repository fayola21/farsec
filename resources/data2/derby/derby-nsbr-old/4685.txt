Dead/unreachable code in OpenConglomerate.lockPositionForWrite()    OpenConglomerate.lockPositionForWrite() contains this code twice: if (!waitForLock) { // throw lock timeout error. throw StandardException.newException(SQLState.LOCK_TIMEOUT); }The second occurrence of this code can never end up throwing an exception  since waitForLock is guaranteed to be true there because of the identical check a couple of lines above. (Judging by the similar method lockPositionForRead()  it is probably the first check that should be removed  so that the latch on the page is released before the exception is thrown.)Also  the method is always called with forInsert==false  so the forInsert parameter can be removed. (I also suspect that the method doesn't work correctly if ever used in an insert operation  since it calls latchPage(RowPosition) which will unlatch the page if the row isn't found on the page  and I assume that a row that is about to be inserted does not exist yet.)
