Memory leak when attempting to boot non-existing database with the in-memory back end    When attempting to boot a non-existing database with the in-memory back end  a DataStore is created and referenced by a map. Since the database doesn't exist  Derby won't use the DataStore again and it will hang around indefinitely in VFMemoryStorageFactory (or until the same database is actually created  in which case the data store will be used).FYI  storage factory instances are instantiated liberally  including for the same service (i.e. six instances of VFMemoryStorageFactory may be created to boot 'jdbc:derby:memory:myDB').
