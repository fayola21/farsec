Test harness does not pass jvm flags properly if there are more than 1 property in jvm flags    To run Derby tests with EMMA for Code coverage  there is a need to set up emma flag -Djvmflags=-Demma.verbosity.level=silent. This is basically to enable EMMA not to print out any messages to avoid having any diffs. This all works fine when running Derby tests with EMMA for jdk142  jdk15  jdk131 etc because there is no other jvm flag that is passed while calling RunSuite Command. Now  while running tests with j2me/cdc/foundation  another value needs to be passed as jvmflag which is-Djvmflags='Dij.dataSource=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedSimpleDataSource'.I tried to combine values for both jvm flags as following  but it did not work properly:1. -Djvmflags='-Demma.verbosity.level=silent -Dij.dataSource=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedSimpleDataSource'During this run  the value that was further passed while running one test was Djvmflags=''-Demma.verbosity.level=silent'.As you can notice it took jvm flag as '-Demma.verbosity.level=silent 2. -Djvmflags='-Demma.verbosity.level=silent -Dij.dataSource=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedSimpleDataSource'During this run  the value that was further passed while running one test was Djvmflags=''-Demma.verbosity.level=silent'.As you can notice it took jvm flag as '-Demma.verbosity.level=silent From the above it looks like test harness needs to be changed so that it can parse multiple values for jvm flags properly.
