Link 'Getting Started....' and 'Apache Derby Server ....' in demo.html needs to be linked to actual documents instead of manuals page    The links 'Getting Started with Apache Derby' and 'Apache Derby Server and Administration Guide' in file https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk/java/demo/demo.html needs to be linked to actual documents as following:Getting Started with Apache Derby to 'http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/getstart/getstartderby.pdf'Apache Derby Server and Administration Guide to 'http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/adminguide/derbyadmin.pdf' Right now the links are linked to 'http://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/index.html'Also  once the dev release is committed (for example committed to 10.2)  the links needs to be changed so that 'dev' is replaced with actual release number.
