Truncation Error with Concat    Consider the tableCREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_TABLE ( ID VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL  NAMEZ VARCHAR(255)   COUNTRY VARCHAR(255) )Sql:PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepateStatement ('SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_TABLE WHERE NAMEZ = VARCHAR ( CAST (? AS VARCHAR(32672) ) || CAST (? AS VARCHAR(32672) ) )' );ps.setString(1  'Alan E. ');ps.setString(2  'Frechette');ps.executeQuery()Error:'A truncation error was encountered trying to shrink VARCHAR 'Alan E. Frechette' to length 15.'getErrorCode()-1getSQLState()22001 Please note that-The query executes ok against DB2 database-The query executes ok if the total length of both the parameters bound is less than 15. That is as follows //Total length of parameters bound = len('Alan E. Fre') = 11 ps.setString(1  'Alan E. '); ps.setString(2  'Fre');-The error occurs both with embedded and network mode of derby-Omitting the casts as follows also gives the same error query: SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_TABLE WHERE NAMEZ = VARCHAR( 'Frechette' || ? ) error: SQLState: 22001 'A truncation error was encountered trying to shrink VARCHAR 'FrechetteAlan E. ' to length 15'-Using parameter markers for both the variables without cast like as follows results in error query: SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_TABLE WHERE NAMEZ = ? || ? error: SQLState: 42X35 'It is not allowed for both operands of '||' to be ? parameters.'-Using parameter markers for only one variables without cast like as follows results in error query: SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_TABLE WHERE NAMEZ = 'Frechette' || ? error:SQLState: 42818 'Comparisons between 'VARCHAR' and 'LONG VARCHAR' are not supported.' -It works to cast to VARCHAR(2000)  but not VARCHAR(2001) or larger. Regardless of length  if it fails  the magic number is always 15.
