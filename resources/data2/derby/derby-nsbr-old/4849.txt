Re-compilation may cause duplicate entries in the XPLAIN table    If happening at the right moment  a re-compilation request may cause duplicate entries in the XPLAIN statement tables.I have only confirmed this for the SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS table  and I do not know if the other XPLAIN tables are affected.The error is highly intermittent  and so far I have only been able to trigger it when testing the automatic index statistics update prototype.See the attached stack-trace for some more details.
