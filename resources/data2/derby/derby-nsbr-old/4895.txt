Thread local TableDescriptor#referencedColumnMap is not removed from app threads when Derby is shut down    &gt; This has been seen to cause error messages in TomCat  cf. this quote from a mail on derby-user:&gt; &gt; http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-user/201011.mbox/%3C7800E37B639BC345BC2AB40980B7C529180FB525@MERCMBX03R.na.SAS.com%3E&gt; &gt; SEVERE: The web application &#91;/MyApp&#93; created a ThreadLocal with key of type [org.apache.derby.iapi.sq/&gt; l.dictionary.TableDescriptor$1] (value &#91;org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.dictionary.TableDescriptor$1@d133a3&#93;)/&gt; and a value of type &#91;java.util.WeakHashMap&#93; (value [{={1  2  3  4}  =null  =null}]) but failed to remo/&gt; ve it when the web application was stopped. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
