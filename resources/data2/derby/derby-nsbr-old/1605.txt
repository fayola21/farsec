test harness evaluates j9 2.2 jvm (a.k.a wctme5.7) as isJDBC4; does enthousiastic sed-ing    The wctme5.7 run shows failures like so:     Start: iepnegativetests jdk1.3.1 subset - 2.2 derbyall:derbytools 2006-07-24 11:41:43 ***16 del&lt; ERROR 38000: The exception 'java.sql.SQLException: Table/View 'IEP.NOTABLE' does not exist.' was thrown while evaluating an expression.16a16&gt; ERROR 38000: The exception 'SQL Exception: Table/View 'IEP.NOTABLE' does not exist.' was thrown while evaluating an expression....    It seems to me this is because it evaluates the major/minor version (2.2) as isJDBC4 in functionTests/harness/RunTest.java : JavaVersionHolder jvh = getProperties(sp); boolean isJDBC4 = jvh.atLeast( 1  6 );and is gets passed on to Sed.java.The following tests fail with this jvm because of this:lang/compressTable.sqllang/nestedCommit.sqllang/releaseCompileLocks.sqltools/iepnegativetests.sqltools/importExportThruIJ.sqltools/ieptests.sqljdbcapi/statementJdbc20.javai18n/iepnegativetests_ES.sqlstore/streamingColumn.javastore/TransactionTable.sqllang/procedureInTrigger.sqlIt seems to me we need an if (!jvmName.startsWith('j9')) or some such around the isJDBC4 assignment.
