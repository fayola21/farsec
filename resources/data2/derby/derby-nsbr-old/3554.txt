Change Collation test to run DatabaseMetaDataTest  BatchUpdateTest GroupByExpressionTest  and UpdateableResultSetTest for only one locale    Currently CollationTest runs DatabaseMetaDataTest  BatchUpdateTest GroupByExpressionTest  and UpdateableResultSetTest for multiple locales and territory based collation. It would be sufficient for these to run with a single locale and would save some time running tests.
