SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE should create statistics if they do not exist    There must be an entry in the SYSSTATISTICS table in order for the cardinality statistics in SYSSTATISTICS to be created with SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE should create statistics if they don't exist. The only way to create them if the index was created on an empty table  seems to be to drop and recreate the index after the table has been loaded.The documentation will also need updating if this change is made.http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/tuning/ctunstats57373.html
