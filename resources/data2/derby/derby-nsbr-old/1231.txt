LIKE does not match empty strings when used with a prepared statement    LIKE should give true for two 0-length strings. See SQL 2003 Ch. 8.5General Rules 3)c)i)The query SELECT * FROM t WHERE v like ''appears to give me all rows where v is an emptystring  as expected.But a prepared statementSELECT * FROM t WHERE v like ?  with setString(1  '')always returns an empty result set. See attached repro for the full example.
