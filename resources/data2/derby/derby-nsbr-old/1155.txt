Separate XAResource from EmbedXAConnection    jdbc4.0 introduces two new methods in javax.sql.PooledConnection. Due to this a new implementation of PooledConnection and XAConnection for jdbc4.0 is required. According to current hierarchy XAConnection extends from PooledConnection. Going by similar hierarchy for new classes PooledConnection40 will extend from PooledConnection and XAConnection40 will be extending from PooledConnection40. This structure forces to replicate all the methods of XAConnection to be present in XAConnection40 too. In the current implementation EmbedXAConnection itself is XAResource. This will cause to replicate all the XAResource methods to be present in XAConnection40. Separating these two implementation will save replication of lots of methods.See the comments on jira issue 1137 for some more discussion about this issue.
