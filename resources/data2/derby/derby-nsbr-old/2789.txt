DatabaseMetaData .locatorsUpdateCopy() should return true    Since updates made to a BLOB or CLOB value in Derby is made on a copy  DatabaseMetaData .locatorsUpdateCopy() call should return true. For the embedded driver the functionality to update a LOB value is new in 10.3. For the client driver  updates have been possible in prior releases  and locatorsUpdateCopy() has returned false. That behavior was wrong since the client updated a main-memory copy  not the values in the database. For 10.3  the client will use a locator based implementation which will rely on the behavior of the embedded driver. Hence  locatorsUpdateCopy() should return true in both cases.
