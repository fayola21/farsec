DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() fails on iSeries JDK 1.4 with verfier error on generated class.    Analysis shows that ----------------------------------------------------------------------The problem is occurring starting at offset 2007 in method e23. There is an invokeinterface to method setWidth(int  int  boolean) of class VariableSizeDataValue. This invoke returns a value of class DataValueDescriptor. That value is in turn stored in field e142 at offset 2015 in method e23. The problem is that field e142 is a NumberDataValue  and DataValueDescriptor is not a valid subclass of NumberDataValue. Thus the store is not allowed.----------------------------------------------------------------------Looking at the generated setWidth() calls I see one in BinaryOperatorNode where the return (DataValueDescriptor) is not cast to the type of the field it is stored in.
