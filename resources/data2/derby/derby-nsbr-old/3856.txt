difference between Embedded vs DerbyNetClient in format of return from timestamp(cast(? as varchar(32)))    There is a slight difference in how Embedded vs. DerbyNetClient return a specific cast.This showed up during conversion of the test lang/datetime.sql which before was only run with Embedded...The following sql: prepare dateTimePS as 'values( date(cast(? as integer)) timestamp(cast(? as varchar(32))))';execute dateTimePS using 'values(cast(1 as integer)  ''2003-03-05-17.05.43.111111'')';gives: 1 |2  -------------------------------------Embedded: 1970-01-01|2003-03-05-17.05.43.111111DerbyNetClient: 1970-01-01|2003-03-05 17:05:43.111111(in Embedded there's a '-' between date and time part  with DerbyNetClient a space; with Embedded the separator between time elements is .  with DerbyNetClient :. Embedded reflects the data as passed in  with DerbyNetClient it seems to be the default timestamp format).I am not sure which is correct at this point  but I confirmed the behavior is like this in latest builds of trunk and 10.3 and 10.4 branches.
