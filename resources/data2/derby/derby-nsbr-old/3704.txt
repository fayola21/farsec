If an IOException is encountered during establishment of the connection  Network Server should print the root exception to the console instead of a generic message    In working on DERBY-3701  I noticed that when the FileNotFound exception caused the connection to fail it just printed out a generic exception  not the IOException that caused the error.That is because of this code in ClientThread. catch (IOException ioe) { // IOException causes this thread to stop. No // console error message if this was caused by a // shutdown synchronized (parent.getShutdownSync()) { if (!parent.getShutdown()) { parent.consolePropertyMessage('DRDA_UnableToAccept.S'); } }In the event of an unexpected IOException the actual exception should print and the client socket should be closed if it has been established.
