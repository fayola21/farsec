Test harness should support J2ME 1.1    I would like to enable the 'old' test harness to support the new version of IBM's j2ME implementation  which is based on j2ME jdk spec version 1.1. This is available with a product named Websphere Everyplace Micro Edition 6.1. from IBM.We already support j9_foundation  which matches to j2ME jdk spec 1.0. I'd like to add j9_foundation11  which then matches to j2ME jdk spec 1.1.I'm proposing to switch my automated tests over to the newer version going forward  and to minimize complexity of the change  I'd like to make the canons reflect behavior of the new version. The differences are minimal. However  I want to be able to still run with the old (except where the results differ  failures would occur with the old version).One of the reasons for moving to the new version is that there is a bug with the older version in regards to security manager  preventing a smooth run of the junit tests  and I'd like to run all short-running tests (suites.All and derbyall) with at least one of the versions. Another reason is that the j2ME spec 1.0 is really old.
