Make getNegation() abstract in BinaryComparisonOperatorNode and UnaryComparisonOperatorNode    Both BinaryComparisonOperatorNode and UnaryComparisonOperatorNode have a method called getNegation() with the following code: /* Keep the compiler happy - this method should never be called. We should always be calling the method in a sub-class. */ if (SanityManager.DEBUG) SanityManager.ASSERT(false  'expected to call getNegation() for subclass ' + getClass().toString()); return this;Instead of relying on asserts to detect missing method overrides at run-time  we should make the methods abstract so that such errors are detected by the compiler.
