DataSourceTest uses ConnectionEventListener but never verifies that events are getting fired    Derby has a junit test called DataSourceTest in jdbcapi package. This test registers ConnectionEventListener for various Connection objects but never verifies that events from those Connection objects are getting delivered to the listeners. Prior to this test's conversion to junit  there were System.out.println in the test but since this test is not cannon based anymore  those printlns have been commented out. I will soon submit a patch where this test will have asserts to make sure that Connection events are getting fired.
