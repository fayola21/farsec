Aliased Columns not recognized after 'group by... order by' combination    I've been doing work to try and integrate Derby with the Mondrian ROLAP engine  which has uncovered a bug in Derby when a query involves column aliasing  a group by clause  and an order by clause.For example: Mondrian will generate the following query:select STORE.STORE_COUNTRY as c0  STORE.STORE_STATE as c1  STORE.STORE_CITY as c2  STORE.STORE_NAME as c3  STORE.STORE_TYPE as c4  STORE.STORE_MANAGER as c5  STORE.STORE_SQFT as c6  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT as c7  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT as c8  STORE.MEAT_SQFT as c9  STORE.COFFEE_BAR as c10  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS as c11 from STORE as STORE group by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAME  STORE.STORE_TYPE  STORE.STORE_MANAGER  STORE.STORE_SQFT  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT  STORE.MEAT_SQFT  STORE.COFFEE_BAR  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS order by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAMEwhich should be valid SQL. I have tested this query outside of the Mondrian environment and still receive the same error which is:'Column 'STORE.STORE_COUNTRY' is not in any table in the FROM list or it appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or it appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list.SQL State: 42x04Error Code: 30000However  if I remove any one of the three elements (aliasing  group by  order by) or if the order by uses the aliased names  the query works. It is only the combination of all 3 elements that is causing a problem.&#91;ie. all of the following queries work correctly&#93;select STORE.STORE_COUNTRY   STORE.STORE_STATE   STORE.STORE_CITY   STORE.STORE_NAME   STORE.STORE_TYPE   STORE.STORE_MANAGER   STORE.STORE_SQFT   STORE.GROCERY_SQFT   STORE.FROZEN_SQFT   STORE.MEAT_SQFT   STORE.COFFEE_BAR   STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS from STORE as STORE group by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAME  STORE.STORE_TYPE  STORE.STORE_MANAGER  STORE.STORE_SQFT  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT  STORE.MEAT_SQFT  STORE.COFFEE_BAR  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS order by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAMEselect STORE.STORE_COUNTRY as c0  STORE.STORE_STATE as c1  STORE.STORE_CITY as c2  STORE.STORE_NAME as c3  STORE.STORE_TYPE as c4  STORE.STORE_MANAGER as c5  STORE.STORE_SQFT as c6  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT as c7  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT as c8  STORE.MEAT_SQFT as c9  STORE.COFFEE_BAR as c10  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS as c11 from STORE as STORE group by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAME  STORE.STORE_TYPE  STORE.STORE_MANAGER  STORE.STORE_SQFT  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT  STORE.MEAT_SQFT  STORE.COFFEE_BAR  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESSselect STORE.STORE_COUNTRY as c0  STORE.STORE_STATE as c1  STORE.STORE_CITY as c2  STORE.STORE_NAME as c3  STORE.STORE_TYPE as c4  STORE.STORE_MANAGER as c5  STORE.STORE_SQFT as c6  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT as c7  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT as c8  STORE.MEAT_SQFT as c9  STORE.COFFEE_BAR as c10  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS as c11 from STORE as STORE order by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAMEselect STORE.STORE_COUNTRY as c0  STORE.STORE_STATE as c1  STORE.STORE_CITY as c2  STORE.STORE_NAME as c3  STORE.STORE_TYPE as c4  STORE.STORE_MANAGER as c5  STORE.STORE_SQFT as c6  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT as c7  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT as c8  STORE.MEAT_SQFT as c9  STORE.COFFEE_BAR as c10  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS as c11 from STORE as STORE group by STORE.STORE_COUNTRY  STORE.STORE_STATE  STORE.STORE_CITY  STORE.STORE_NAME  STORE.STORE_TYPE  STORE.STORE_MANAGER  STORE.STORE_SQFT  STORE.GROCERY_SQFT  STORE.FROZEN_SQFT  STORE.MEAT_SQFT  STORE.COFFEE_BAR  STORE.STORE_STREET_ADDRESS order by c0 c1 c2 c3
