setting tracedirectory from the command line does not work    I triedjava org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl tracedirectory /tmpand got:Trace directory changed to /tmp.java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl trace onTrace turned on for all sessions.Trace turned on for all sessions.And the trace output was not redirected to the /tmp directory. The tracedirectory command seemed to be ignored.Setting tracedirectory with the system property derby.drda.traceDirectory or with the NetworkServerControl api seems to work ok.
