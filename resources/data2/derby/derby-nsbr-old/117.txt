[PATCH] Improvements on the NetServlet    Hi all I did some minor enhancements on the Net Servlet: changed Cloudscape to Derby in the i18n bundles added pt_BT to know languages (the bundle was already there  but the language was not set at the .java)  improved use of tracingDirectory: init-parameter is now used (it was documented but not used before) current value is shown when the user try to change it improved function that handles the request locale (for instance  mozilla uses a - instead of _ to separate the country from language) shows on the screen which port the server is running on added a new SRV_POrtNumber message key for such infoSo  I'm sending a trunk patch with such changes.&#8211; Felipe
