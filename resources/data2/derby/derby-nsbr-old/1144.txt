With client PooledConnection.getConnection() does not reset holdability and isolation state properly    I found this issue when working on DERBY-1044 which was filed for the isolation not getting reset for XAConnections.I found that this was a generic issue for PooledConnections and also that holdability was also wrong.The fix proposed for DERBY-1044 should also fix this issue. That bug has the repro for the isolation state issueFor holdability  this code passes for embedded but fails for client: // Test holdability  ConnectionPoolDataSource ds = TestUtil.getConnectionPoolDataSource(p); pc1 = ds.getPooledConnection(); testPooledConnHoldability('PooledConnection'  pc1); pc1.close(); ** @param string @param pc1 */ private static void testPooledConnHoldability(String string  PooledConnection pc1)  throws SQLException Unknown macro: { System.out.println(&quot;n**Test holdability state**&quot;); Connection conn = pc1.getConnection(); conn.setHoldability(ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT); // reset the connection and see if the holdability gets reset conn = pc1.getConnection(); int holdability = conn.getHoldability(); if (holdability != ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT) { System.out.println('FAIL: Holdability not reset on get Connection'); } else { System.out.println('PASS: Holdability reset on getConnection'); } conn.close(); }
