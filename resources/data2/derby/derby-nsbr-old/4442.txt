Evaluation of default value and identity in an INSERT result set evaluated too early.    In contrast to generated column  which are evaluated when the next row from the result set to be inserted  currently default values and identity columns are generated 'early'  that is as part of avaluating the subquery (SELECT or VALUES as the case may be). This does not currently cause a user visible bug in Derby  but it lies behind DERBY-3 and the effect Bryan observed in DERBY-4.Additionally  'early' computation has given rise to much special handling and ensuing bugs  cf. DERBY-1644  DERBY-4413  DERBY-4419  DERBY-4425 and others.DERBY-4397 requires this fix for correct behaviour with INSERT.See alsohttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4413?focusedCommentId=12769532&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12769532
