Provide collation sensitive subclasses for SQLChar  SQLVarchar  SQLLongvarchar and SQLClob which will use the passed Collator to do the collation rather than the default collation of UCS_BASIC    This jira entry is one of the tasks involved in implementing DERBY-2336.The existing SQLChar datatype has the Derby's default collation which is UCS_BASIC defined on them. With Derby 10.3  we want to support an additional collation for char datatypes which will be based on the territory. This jira issue is the placeholder for creating subclass of SQLChar which will use the passed Collator to do the collation. The current use of this class in Derby 10.3 will be for territory based collation but this class can be used in future for other kinds of collations like case-insensitive etc.
