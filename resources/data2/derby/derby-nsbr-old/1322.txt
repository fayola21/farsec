Missing resets of isOnInsertRow state in net client when navigating away via other than ResultSet#next    Please see the enclosed repro program.When attempting the deleteRow  it will fail with SQL state 24000 'nocurrent row'  since the first() call doesn't properly reset theIsOnInsertRow_ state. By inspection of ../am/ResultSet.java I foundthe other positioning calls beside next and moveToCurrentRow to sufferthe same problem.
