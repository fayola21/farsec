Incorrect ORDER BY caused by index    I think I found a bug in Derby that is triggered by an index on a large column: VARCHAR(1024). I know it is generally not a good idea to have an index on such a large column.I have a table (table2) with a column 'value'  my query orders on this column but the result is not sorted. It is sorted if I remove the index on that column.The output of the attached script is as follows (results should be ordered on the middle column):ID |VALUE |VALUE----------------------------------------------2147483653 |000002 |218572147483654 |000003 |218574294967297 |000001 |21857While I would expect:ID |VALUE |VALUE----------------------------------------------4294967297 |000001 |218572147483653 |000002 |218572147483654 |000003 |21857This is the definition:CREATE TABLE table1 (id BIGINT NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY(id));CREATE INDEX key1 ON table1(id);CREATE TABLE table2 (id BIGINT NOT NULL  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL  value VARCHAR(1024)  PRIMARY KEY(id  name));CREATE UNIQUE INDEX key2 ON table2(id  name);CREATE INDEX key3 ON table2(value);This is the query:SELECT table1.id  m0.value  m1.valueFROM table1  table2 m0  table2 m1WHERE table1.id=m0.idAND m0.name='PageSequenceId'AND table1.id=m1.idAND m1.name='PostComponentId'AND m1.value='21857'ORDER BY m0.value;The bug can be reproduced by just executing the attached script with the ij-tool.Note that the result of the query becomes correct when enough data is changed. This prevented me from creating a smaller example.See the attached file 'derby-reproduce.zip' for sysinfo  derby.log and script.sql.Michael Segel pointed out:'It looks like its hitting the index ordering on id name from table 2 and is ignoring the order by clause.'
