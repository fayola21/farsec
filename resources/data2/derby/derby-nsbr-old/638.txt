Network driver setTransactionIsolation() causes a commit  but does not complete it locally    When autocommit is set to false  a call to setTransactionIsolation using client driver does not end the transaction when the method exits. When a close() is called on the conection  it throws an exception.Running the code below: conn.setAutoCommit(false); conn.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED); try{ conn.close(); }catch(SQLException se){ System.out.println('Got exception when closing the connection'); se.printStackTrace(); }with client driver gives:Got exception when closing the connectionorg.apache.derby.client.am.SqlException: java.sql.Connection.close() requested while a transaction is in progress on the connection.The transaction remains active  and the connection cannot be closed.with embedded driver  it works okay and does not throw any exception.
