java/testing/README.htm needs to be updated with information on JUnit tests    Currently  the testing readme at java/testing/README.htm does not contain any information on running or developing Derby junit tests. This document should at least be updated with information on how to run Derby's junit tests. A description of the top-level suites and running the Ant junitreport target would be a good start.
