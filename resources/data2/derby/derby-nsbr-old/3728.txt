Fix error handling in PrivilegedFileOpsForTests    The exception handling in this utility class is unclear and can in some cases cause ClassCastException to be thrown.Note that SecurityException is a runtime exception.Potential issues to be fixed: 1) Avoid possibility of ClassCastException in 'getFileInputStream' 2) Don't include SecurityException in the signature (throws clause) 3) Document SecurityException in JavaDoc.Points 2 and 3 leads to the option of not catching SecurityException  which allows the code to be written more concisely and we can use PrivilegedAction instead of PrivilegedExceptionAction in some cases.There is also a missing character in the class name in the header  and an invalid JavaDoc tag in the class JavaDoc.
