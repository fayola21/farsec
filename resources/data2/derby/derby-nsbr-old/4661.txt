Reduce size of encoding buffer for short character values    When inserting character values Derby converts from Java char to an on-disk encoding of UTF-8. To to this  the user stream is read and the resulting bytes after conversion are placed in a 'translation buffer'. The default size of the buffer is 32 KB. When inserting a lot of short values  the pressure on the Java garbage collector is unnecessary high and the allocation/GC also causes a somewhat higher CPU usage.This effect of this issue can easily be reduced by sizing the buffer in the appropriate cases.
