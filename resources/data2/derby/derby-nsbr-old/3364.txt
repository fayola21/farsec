Replication failover implementation must be modified to fail at the master after slave has been stopped    Jorgen says...I tried to run the failover command on the master  which seems to work fine as long as the master and slave are still connected. If the slave has been stopped for some reason  however  failover hangs on MasterController#startFailover here: ack = transmitter.readMessage();
