Trigger action statement is not recompile when there is a change that would affect it.    A trigger action statement  such as an INSERT statement is not recompiled when there is some DDL change on the underlying table  such as a CREATE INDEX.In the example below a unique index is added to the table (t2) inserted into by the trigger's action statement. When the tirgger fires it does not raise any error (should raise a unique constraint violated error) and does not insert the value into the index. A select from t2 does not show the additional rows in t2 as it is performing an index scan  once the index is dropped the rows appear to the select.ij version 10.2ij&gt; connect 'jdbc:derby:cs;create=true';ij&gt; create table t (i int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; create table t2 (i int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; create trigger tt after insert on t for each statement mode db2sqlinsert into t2 values 1;0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; insert into t values 1;1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; select * from t2;I-----------11 row selectedij&gt; create unique index tu on t2;0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; insert into t values 1;1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; select * from t2;I-----------11 row selectedij&gt; insert into t values 1;1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; select * from t2;I-----------11 row selectedij&gt; drop index tu;0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; select * from t2;I-----------1113 rows selected
