One each deleted or updated from a heap row a new RowPosition object is created.    See the new RowPosition in GenericConglomerateController.delete and replace. The fetch methods also have new RowPosition calls but in general these calls are not made for scans.Can a single RowPosition object be re-used across the life of the query?In general Derby should try to avoid creating objects per row in any statement as the gc overhead when operating on a large number of rows can be high.
