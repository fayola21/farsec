Use a lower wait timeout in BlobClob4BlobTest    These test cases wait 60 seconds for a timeout: testLockingClob testLockingWithLongRowClob testLockingBlob testLockingWithLongRowBlobSince they run both in embedded and network client mode  BlobClob4BlobTest spends about eight minutes waiting for a timeout. Therefore  it would be good if its setUp() method lowered the timeout (and tearDown() reset it). TestJDBC40Exception shows how this could be achieved.
