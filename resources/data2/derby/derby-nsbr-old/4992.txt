Release notes should specify which Java version is needed to run Derby    Since 10.3  it appears we no longer include information about what Java version is needed to run Derby  at least not on the release notes published on the web site  cf.http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.7.1.1.html and others.In the 10.2 release notes  we see:JDK/JDBC support: JDK 1.3  1.4  1.5  and J2ME J2ME/CDC/Foundation Profile JSR-169  JDBC 2.1  and JDBC 3.0 supportI think this type of information should still be readily available from the release notes  does anybody know why we stopped doing that?
