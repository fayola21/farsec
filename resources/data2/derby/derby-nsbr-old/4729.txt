add more information to the XACT_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION returned from store.    Improve the following message:ERROR 40XT0: An internal error was identified by RawStore module.At least add the state variables. Originally it wasn't expected that this error would ever fire  but it often does. It usuallyis caused by some previous bug and then something going wrong with the cleanup after the bug in an XA transaction.
