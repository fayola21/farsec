Loading databases from jars in the classpath is broken  databases cannot be found.    In converting an old Cloudscape test to ensure changes made for DERBY-538 would not break loading from classes stored in the database when the database itself is in a jar  I discovered that a database cannot be found that is in a jar on the classpath.Discovered the reason is the StoreFactory implementation for classpath always prepends a leading foward slash to the database name  but this is incorrect (e.g. db7 to /db7). This causes the database not to be found when the classloader is URLClassLoader as the correct path for the service.properties file is db7/services.properties  not /db7/services.properties.Will add converted test (lang/dbjar.sql)
