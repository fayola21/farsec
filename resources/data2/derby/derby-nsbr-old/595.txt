Using derby.language.logStatementText=true can mask certain exceptions and lead to incorrect behavior in some cases    Using derby.language.logStatementText=true can mask certain exceptions and lead to incorrect behavior.I observed this with tests using streams  where if valid (expected) exceptions are raised when DVD.getString() is called  the exception gets eaten up when this property is set. See 1)in GenericParameter.toString()try{return value.getString();}catch (StandardException se){return 'unexpected exception from getString() - ' + se;}}2)in GenericPreparedStatement.execute()  where pvs.toString() is called for the parameters.________Reproduction: Run the test jdbcapi/resultsetStream.java   with derby.language.logStatementText=true and expected error exceptions wont be thrown for the error cases. I looked at the tests that use streams   only the store/streamingColumn.java uses derby.language.logStatementText=true. I'll file another bug to resolve this test.
