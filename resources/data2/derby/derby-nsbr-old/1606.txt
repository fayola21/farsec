derbyrunjartest hangs with wctme5.7 & always uses j9_13; hangs with _foundation    derbyrunjartest hangs with wctme5.7.I am not sure what the hook up is but if I do this:j9 -jcl:max -Xbootclasspath/p:c:/wctme5.7/ive/lib/jclMax/classes.zip;c:/wctme5.7/ive/lib/charconv.zip;c:/wctme5.7/ive/lib/database_enabler.jar -jar c:/derbyt/svn2/trunk/jars/sane/derbyrun.jar ij --helpI get successfully:Usage: java org.apache.derby.tools.ij &#91;-p propertyfile&#93; [-ca connectionAttributePropertyFile] &#91;inputfile&#93;Also  when looking at the code of this test  it forces the jvm class to be used to be j9_13 whenever the jvm as set in RunTest starts with J9. However  wctme5.7 is j9_22 and this also prevents running with foundation (assuming that's supported).
