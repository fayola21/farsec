jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java and jdbcapi/checkDataSource30.java hang intermittently with client    The tests checkDataSource.java and checkDataSource30.java hang intermittently especially with jdk 1.5.Attached is the test run output and traces when the server is started separately.1) Enable checkDataSource30.java by taking it out of functionTests/suites/DerbyNetClient.exclude.2) Run the test with client.java -Dij.exceptionTrace=true -Dkeepfiles=true -Dframework=DerbyNetClient org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest jdbcapi/checkDataSource30.javaAttachements: testfiles_after_hang.zip - Test directory. traces_on_hang.txt - Server side traces obtained by starting the server separately before running the test.I wish I had time to work on this right now as I would really like to see this valuable test in the suite  but hopefully someone else will pick it up.
