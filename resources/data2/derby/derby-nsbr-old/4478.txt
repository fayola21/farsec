Use AtomicLong for XactFactory.tranId    Dyre Tjeldvoll posted some results on DERBY-3092 that indicated that some types of load might cause contention on XactFactory.tranId (a shared long)  and suggested that it was replaced with a java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong on the platforms that support java.util.concurrent.*.I'm splitting this issue out from DERBY-3092 so that the two possible improvements reported there can be addressed independently.
