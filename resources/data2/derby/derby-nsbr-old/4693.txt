column rename looses 'identity' attribute.    renaming an identity column causes the column to loose its 'identity' attribute.you can reproduce the problem as follows:CREATE TABLE njr_version ( id INTEGER generated always as identity  databaseVersion INTEGER);insert into njr_version (databaseVersion) values (10);&#8211; column inserted successfully.rename column njr_version.id to idVersion;insert into njr_version (databaseVersion) values (10);Error: Column 'IDVERSION' cannot accept a NULL value.To compound this problem there is no way to restore the renamed column's identity attribute as the alter command doesn't let you set an identity attribute. The only work around is to create a new table and copy the data across.
