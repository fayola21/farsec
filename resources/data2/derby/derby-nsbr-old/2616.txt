intermittent network startup related errors in running junit nightly test suite    I intermitently get network startup related errors in running the nightly full test suite on my laptop  running XP  with a firewall and a VPN - I am not sure what if any of those environmental factors is causing it. I have been mostly ignoring the errors as it seemed like it usually was only one test. I my latest run it was more like 7 or 8. I'll append exact tests as a comment on this issue.To debug the problem I picked one - org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.derbynet.NSSecurityMechanismTest and ran it in a loop. When I did this it failed everytime after the first one (and the first one intermittently failed). When I bumped the WAIT_TIME up to 300000 and the SLEEP_TIME to 500 injava/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/NetworkServerTestSetup.java then the test passed everytime . In 30 runs theentire test took varying times from 2 minutes to 6 minutes  mostly in the 4 minute range.
