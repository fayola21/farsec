Derby does not resolve functions bound to methods with varargs.    Varargs were added in Java 5. It would be nice if Derby let you invoke a function bound to a method with a variable length argument list. The Reference Guide states a small number of restrictions for methods which can be invoked as Derby functions: They must be public  static  and not have arguments which are long datatypes. I see no reason that Derby shouldn't be able to resolve and invoke functions which are bound to methods which don't suffer these limitations but which have variable argument lists.
