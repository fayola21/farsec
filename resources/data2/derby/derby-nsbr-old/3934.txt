Improve performance of reading modified Clobs    The performance of reading modified Clobs is poor  which is demonstrated by running a test program selecting a 10 MB Clob and then getting the contents using getSubString: unmodified Clob (StoreStreamClob) : ~1 300 ms modified Clob (TemporaryClob): ~156 000 msIn this case  the Clob was modified by changing the first character.A number of subtasks will be created to handle the various issues  which will be related to both performance and code cleanup.For a brief overview  see http://www.nabble.com/Suggestion-for-improving-ClobUpdatableReader-and-related-code-to20308303.html
