big decimal error diff in derbyall lang/procedure test run in the DerbyNetClient - jdk1.3 specific    derby all regression test failure in the following test. Most recently it failed in the 1/27 derby build. It also failed on 1/20. It ran fine on 1/13. Havenot had time to narrow down further. Did note that there is a separate master for this test   but no jdk131 specific masters that I could see.
