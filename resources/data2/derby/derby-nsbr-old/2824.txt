Improve error reporting  fix whitespace/formatting issues and replace tabs in UTF8Reader    I plan to do the following changes to UTF8Reader: Improve the error reporting when hitting a UTF8 decoding error (currently an UTFDataFormatException with no message). This might also lead to deleting one helper method for generating an exception (the one with no message). Improve error reporting for trying to use the reader after it has been closed (currently an IOException with no message). Remove trailing spaces  and add a few newlines here and there. Replace tabs in the file with spaces.Now  the last point can be discussed  but here are my arguments for doing it: The file now has a mix of tabs and spaces (but still more tabs). Spaces are the preferred/required method of indentation. I want to get it fixed before the branch is cut  which makes it easier to port fixes from trunk/10.3-NEXT to 10.3. If I don't make it for 10.3  I won't do it. I don't see it as very likely that we will back-port major fixes to this class on the 10.2 branch. If we have to  I will volunteer  Since so much else of the Clob 'infrastructure' has changed recently  this seems like a good time to do the clean-up.Please raise your concern as soon as possible if you want to veto these changes. I do plan to commit them tomorrow.
