EmbeddedDriver does not implement PreparedStatement.setNull(int  int  String)    The embedded driver throws Util.notImplemented() when PreparedStatement.setNull(int  int  String) is called. The javadoc says that '&#91;if&#93; the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type  the given typeName is ignored.' The client driver correctly ignores typeName and forwards the call to setNull(int  int). Embedded should be changed to match the client.
