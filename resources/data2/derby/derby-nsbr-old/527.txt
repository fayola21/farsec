Incorrect insane build on windows platform    I've found that Derby will not build sane properly for me. I have isolated it to here: &lt;target name='evaluate.sane'&gt; &lt;condition property='generate.sane'&gt; &lt;equals arg1='${sane}' arg2='true'/&gt; &lt;/condition&gt; &lt;/target&gt;The scope of the generate.sane property is limited to this target (only tested in a Windows XP environment)  ergo it will always be an insane build. Patch to follow shortly.
