Simple column names specified as part of 'AS' clause in a table expression are ignored if the table expression is a view.    Simple repro as follows:create table t1 (i int  j int);insert into t1 values (1  1)  (1  -1)  (2  2)  (3  -3)  (4  4);create view v1 as select j  i from t1;create view v2 (x y z) as select j  i  i+j from t1;&#8211; OK: Returns column names specified in AS clause.select * from t1 as x(a b);&#8211; OK: Returns column names for the viewsselect * from v1;select * from v2;&#8211; WRONG: Ignores column names specified in AS clause for the views.select * from v1 x(a b);select * from v2 as x(a b c);I observed this as far back as 10.0.2.1  so this is not a regression.
