Make Locale available in DataValueFactory(DVF). This Locale object will be used to construct Collator object if the user has requested territory based collation.    Add a new api on DVF which will make Locale object available to DVF. This new api on DVF will get called by the boot method of BasicDatabase after BasicDatabase has finished booting DVF. This Locale will be either the Locale obtained from the territory attribute supplied by the user on the JDBC url at database create time or if user didn't provide the territory attribute at database create time  then it will be set to the default JVM locale. This Locale object will be used by DVF to construct the Collator object if user has requested territory based collation.The new api will look like following void setLocale(Locale localeOfTheDatabase);
