Allow Derby to rename tables referenced by foreign keys    Hi  I'm on the Apache Roller team and we use database migration scripts to update databases between Roller releases. (We have a common template (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/roller/trunk/app/src/main/resources/sql/500-to-510-migration.vm?view=co) that is run through Velocity to create specific scripts for the several databases that we support.) One handicap with Derby that we're not seeing with other databases is its inability to rename tables that have FK's on them. Renaming one of our tables returns this error from Derby:rename table website to weblog;Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WP_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 30000Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WE_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WC_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'FO_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'MF_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'NF_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'AP_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999This results in the migration scripts needing to be messy  first dropping all constraints before recreating them  for the one RDBMS that requires it. It would be great if a future release of Derby could be coded to support table renames regardless of the constraints defined on it. Thanks!
