Make Optimizer trace logic pluggable.    Right now the trace logic in the optimizer is hard-coded to produce a stream of diagnostics. It would be good to be able to plug alternative trace logic into the optimizer. This would make the following possible:1) Plug in trace logic which produces formats which are easier to study and which can be analyzed mechanically. E.g.  xml formatted output.2) Plug in trace logic which can be used during unit testing to verify that the optimizer has picked the right plan. Over time this might make it easier to migrate canon-based tests to assertion-based tests.
