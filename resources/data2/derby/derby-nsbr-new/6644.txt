Support standard syntax for altering column nullability    Derby supports altering the nullability of a column via an ALTER TABLE statement  but the supported syntax is different from what the SQL:2011 standard defines. We should add support for the standard syntax as well.The standard syntax is ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c SET NOT NULL ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c DROP NOT NULL
