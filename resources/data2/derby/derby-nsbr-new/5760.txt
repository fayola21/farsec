Missing argument in some XJ022 errors    EmbedBlob and EmbedClob some times wrap IOExceptions in an SQLException with SQLState XJ022 (SQLState.SET_STREAM_FAILURE)  but they don't always specify the message argument  so the error message ends up like this:java.sql.SQLException: Unable to set stream: '{0}'.(The detailed error message does appear in a chained exception  so it's not a very big problem  but it looks a bit odd.)I don't know of a way to expose these exceptions in a test. I just noticed it when I added some manual asserts to force a failure when investigating another issue.The fix should be simple: Use the helper method Util.setStreamFailure() that sets the message argument automatically.
