Use the JVM's cache of Number instances in ReuseFactory    ReuseFactory has a cache of Byte  Short  Integer and Long instances to avoid excessive allocation of such instances.As of Java 5  the JVM has a cache of its own  available through static valueOf() methods in these classes.The JVM's cache is guaranteed to have at least all values in the range &#91;-128  127&#93;. ReuseFactory currently caches Integer instances in the range &#91;-1  18&#93; plus a few special values  and Byte  Short and Long instances in the range &#91;0  10&#93;.If we change ReuseFactory so that it uses the JVM's cache  the number of cache misses will be lower  and the code will become shorter.
