SecureServerTest  Driver40UnbootedTest and replication tests not prepared for space in java.home    SecureServerTest  Driver40UnbootedTest and the replication tests fork JVMs by calling Runtime.exec() methods that take the command as a String parameter  not a String[]. This causes problems like the ones seen in DERBY-5490 when there's a space in ${java.home}.The tests should be rewritten to use the helper method BaseTestCase.execJavaCmd()  which handles this case correctly.
