Make DoubleProperties.propertyNames() thread-safe    As discussed in DERBY-4269  DoubleProperties.propertyNames() may throw a NullPointerException if properties are removed by another thread while the method is executing. Since DoubleProperties is a sub-class of  and used as a drop-in replacement for  java.util.Properties  it should be thread-safe just like the propertyNames() method in the parent class.
