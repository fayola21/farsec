Rolling back a transaction leads to an inconsistent state    Rolling back a transaction can leave a table in an inconsistent state if the table has been previously altered through the addition of new columns. It appears that if newly added columns have not been changed from their default value  then when a transaction which sets new values for these columns is rolled back the new columns are not restored to their previous values.Attached is an ij script with fairly minimal steps to reproduce the problem on Derby 10.6.2.0 and 10.8.2.2 (Win7 x64  Sun 32-bit JRE 1.6.0.26). Expected and observed output also attached.Would appreciate any suggestions as to a workaround for this issue. Running SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE on the table after adding the columns seems to avoid the problem but may be just masking the issue.
