NOT elimination for CASE expressions is broken    NOT elimination for CASE expressions seems to be broken. Take this example:ij&gt; select * from sysibm.sysdummy1 where not ( case when ibmreqd = 'Y' then true else true end );IBM&amp;----Y 1 row selectedBoth branches of the CASE expression evaluate to TRUE  so one would expect the predicate 'not ( case ... )' to evaluate to FALSE  and the query should return an empty result.
