Replication tests keep references to connections after completion    The base class for the replication tests  ReplicationRun  keeps references to connections used during the test also after the test has completed. The connections are referenced from these fields: masterConn slaveConn startSlaveException (which references a connection indirectly via client.am.SqlException -&gt; client.am.Sqlca)
