Table functions should only accept arguments which are constant in their query block.    Derby lets you invoke a table function in the FROM list of a query  passing in arguments built out of columns in other tables in the FROM list. This syntax is illegal and the resulting queries have no meaning under the SQL Standard. See the discussion on DERBY-5554. We should forbid this syntax. Similar syntax involving correlated subqueries in the FROM list is already forbidden. Fixing this will create a backward incompatibility which requires a release note.
