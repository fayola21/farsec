Remove unnecessary field rwsOK in DirStorageFactory4    DirStorageFactory4 has a field called rwsOK defined like this: private static final boolean rwsOK = JVMInfo.JDK_ID &gt;= JVMInfo.J2SE_142;The only supported platform whose JVMInfo.JDK_ID is less than JVMInfo.J2SE_142  is FP/CDC. But DirStorageFactory4 is not used on FP/CDC because it depends on NIO. This means that the field will always have the value true  and it can be eliminated.
