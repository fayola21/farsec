OOME when running ConstraintCharacteristicsTest with smaller heap    When I ran suites.All on a device with little memory  so that I needed to reduce the heap (-Xmx160M)  it stopped and failed with an OOME when it came to ConstraintCharacteristicsTest.That test uses a memory database in order to speed it up. One of the test cases (testManySimilarDuplicates) has such a big data set that the database doesn't fit in the heap. It would be good if we could reduce the memory requirements of the test so that it passes on smaller devices to. Alternatively  we could add a switch that makes it easy to disable test cases that are known to have high memory requirements.
