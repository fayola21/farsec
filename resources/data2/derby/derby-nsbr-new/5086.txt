Disable istat logging by default    The automatic index statistics daemon will by default log what it's doing. That means messages like these ones will be written to derby.log during normal operation:Wed Mar 02 13:36:22 CET 2011 Thread&#91;main 5 main&#93; {istat} 'APP'.'T': update scheduled - 23ce809c-012e-7691-6c29-000003480128 reason=&#91;no stats  row-estimate=36167&#93; (queueSize=1)Wed Mar 02 13:36:22 CET 2011 Thread&#91;index-stat-thread 5 main&#93; {istat} 'APP'.'T': generating index statisticsWed Mar 02 13:36:23 CET 2011 Thread&#91;index-stat-thread 5 main&#93; {istat} 'APP'.'T': generation complete (509 ms)Wed Mar 02 13:36:23 CET 2011 Thread&#91;main 5 main&#93; {istat} stopping daemon  active=false  work/age=510/14736 &#91;q/p/s=0/1/1 err:k/u/c=0/0/0 rej:f/d/o=0/0/0&#93;Although these messages may be helpful in diagnosing bugs  they may also be a source of confusion since users probably only expect errors/problems to be logged by default. Also  for some workloads  large quantities of log may be produced and take up disk space. Therefore  I think we should disable the logging before the 10.8 release  and instead instruct users who experience problems to enable logging manually with the derby.storage.indexStats.log property.
