XATransactionTest: Table/View 'DERBY1016' already exists    Cf the test report on trunk.http://dbtg.foundry.sun.com/derby/test/Daily/jvm1.7/testing/Limited/testSummary-1211980.htmlIt looks like the ordering between testForgetExceptionDerby1016PROTO and testForgetExceptionDerby1016NOTA is inversed in this run on Windows  and the test currently requires testForgetExceptionDerby1016PROTO to be run ahead of testForgetExceptionDerby1016NOTA. JDK 7 can/will reorder the fixtures.
