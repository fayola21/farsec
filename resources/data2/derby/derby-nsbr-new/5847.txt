Clean up IDE warnings in DRDAConnThread    When I open DRDAConnThread in NetBeans  I see 49 warnings. Most of them are harmless (like static fields accessed via an instance  suggestions about using StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer  or using System.arraycopy() instead of for loops). Others indicate real problems  like the use of != to compare SQL states in writeSQLDIAGGRP().We should clean up the warnings so that it's easier to notice new warnings about potential problems.
