Revamp the vti demo to look and behave more like the other demos.    The VTI demo began as a set of classes which could not be compiled by the normal build because they used Java 5 features. We hooked these classes into the ordinary build later on (see DERBY-3684). But the VTI demo still sticks out like a sore thumb. We ought to be able to make the VTI demo behave like the other demos now.
