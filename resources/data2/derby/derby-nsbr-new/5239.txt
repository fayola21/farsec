Remove usages of DriverManager to obtain an Embedded Connection in Derby Server    The Derby Network Server appears to look up the Derby Embedded Driver from the java.sql.DriverManager in a couple of places in order to get the connection to the actual database.This means the network server cannot operate in environments where for whatever reason it is not OK to access the embedded driver from the DriverManager. Just in general this behavior is unexpected as it should be possible to directly load the embedded driver.I've observed this issue in 10.6.1.0 and checked that the relevant usages are unchanged in trunk.
