in list multi-probe by primary key not chosen on tables with >256 rows    I have a table with a long integer primary key field and 11 million rows. I seem to be unable to load large chunks of rows via id in a reasonably efficient manner. 1. If I do individual lookups via the primary key  then a fast indexed lookup occurs. However  if I do large numbers of such queries  then the time is overwhelmed by round-trip overhead which makes everything incredibly slow. 2. If I use a single query with a disjunction of the primary keys of interest  then a table scan is performed (even if the clause only contains 1-3 items)  which walks over 11 million rows...incredibly inefficient. 3. If I use an IN clause  then a table scan is performed (even if the clause only contains 1-3 items)  which walks over 11 million rows...incredibly inefficient.I'm guessing that this might have something to do with the fact that I'm using large integers and really big numbers that don't start anywhere at or about 1 for my keys. Could this possibly be confusing the optimizer?Here are the unlimited query plans for the 3 cases that I enumerated:*********************************************************************************************&#91;EL Fine&#93;: 2013-01-17 11:09:53.384-ServerSession(582235416)Connection(1430986883)Thread(Thread&#91;&quot;Initial Lisp Listener&quot; 5 SubL Thread Group&#93;)-SELECT TERM_ID  ARG0  ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  FORMULA_HASH  FORMULA_LENGTH  FORMULA_TYPE  KB_STATUS FROM KB.FORMULA_TERM WHERE (TERM_ID = ?) bind =&gt; &#91;2251799814033500&#93;Thu Jan 17 11:09:53 CST 2013 Thread&#91;&quot;Initial Lisp Listener&quot; 5 SubL Thread Group&#93; (XID = 4711079)  (SESSIONID = 3)  SELECT TERM_ID  ARG0  ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  FORMULA_HASH  FORMULA_LENGTH  FORMULA_TYPE  KB_STATUS FROM KB.FORMULA_TERM WHERE (TERM_ID = ?) ******* Project-Restrict ResultSet (3):Number of opens = 1Rows seen = 1Rows filtered = 0restriction = falseprojection = true constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 restriction time (milliseconds) = 0 projection time (milliseconds) = 0 optimizer estimated row count: 1.00 optimizer estimated cost: 6.59Source result set: Index Row to Base Row ResultSet for FORMULA_TERM: Number of opens = 1 Rows seen = 1 Columns accessed from heap = {1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8} constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 optimizer estimated row count: 1.00 optimizer estimated cost: 6.59 Index Scan ResultSet for FORMULA_TERM using constraint KB_FORMULA_TERM_TERM_ID_PK at read committed isolation level using share row locking chosen by the optimizer Number of opens = 1 Rows seen = 1 Rows filtered = 0 Fetch Size = 1 constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 next time in milliseconds/row = 0 scan information: Bit set of columns fetched=All Number of columns fetched=2 Number of deleted rows visited=0 Number of pages visited=3 Number of rows qualified=1 Number of rows visited=1 Scan type=btree Tree height=-1 start position: &gt;= on first 1 column(s).
