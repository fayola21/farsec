Failures in upgradeTests.Changes10_9 related to index cardinality statistics    The upgrade test fails when run with 10.8.3. The reason is that a fix has been backported to 10.8.3  and older branches back to 10.3  and this fix invalidates assumptions made in some of the tests in Changes10_9.Example of failures:https://builds.apache.org/job/Derby-10.9-suites.All/60/testReport/As a side note  I'm wondering if we don't have good enough routines to make sure we run the upgrade tests with maintenance releases on older branches before releasing them. I don't know if we can avoid this situation in general  that would at least require very careful consideration on how to write the upgrade test.
