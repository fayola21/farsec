    "# Filtering and Ranking Security Bug Reports\n",
    "This application is used to build prediction models for predicting security bug reports. Included here are bug reports from five different projects, code, experiments, and results. This document provides guidance on how to use the application on the command line. We start with some information about the bug reports and then we procede as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the generation of data matrices for experiments;\n",
    "- calculation of tfidf as a measure of the popularity of security related keywords;\n",
    "- prediction bug reports as security or non security reports and;\n",
    "- ranking bug reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can can download the *farsec.jar* and run the examples in order, using the commands in **bold**. The user must also create an output directory in the same location as *farsec.jar*. All data and results will be sent to the output directory.\n",

    "### Bug Reports\n",
    "For each project, data is partitioned into train and test sets. These are further partitioned into sbrs and nsbrs. Each bug report is converted into a file and stored in the approporiate directory (e.g -sbr-new, -nsbr-new, -sbr-old and -nsbr-old). \n",

    "## Data Matrices\n",
    "### Generate Data Matrices for Experiments\n",
    "Given bug reports for each project we find security related keywords. We use the keywords to generate train and test sets with the bug reports. We generate these matrices for two types of prediction experiments. The first is within predition (WPP) the second is transfer prediction (TPP).\n",
